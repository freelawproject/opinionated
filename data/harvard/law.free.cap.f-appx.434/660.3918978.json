At trial, \u201cthe prosecution relied heavily on scientific evidence indicating that a liquid was used to ignite the fire. After the fire, this liquid left residues of medium petroleum distillates (\u2018MPDs\u2019) at the scene. A prosecution witness testified that Souliotes\u2019s shoes also contained MPDs.\u201d <em>Souliotes v. Evans, </em>622 F.3d 1173, 1176 (9th Cir.2010). Approximately eight years after Souliotes\u2019s conviction, a chemist and arson investigator, John Lentini, using scientific techniques unavailable at the time of Souliotes\u2019s trial, was able to distinguish between the MPDs found on Souliotes\u2019s shoes and the MPDs from the crime scene. Souliotes presented this MPD evidence in a petition for writ of habeas corpus. The habeas petition was eventually dismissed by the district court as untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">In September 2010, we held that the district court applied an incorrect diligence standard under 28 U'.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D), one of the provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) that triggers the one-year limitations period for filing a habeas petition. <em>Souliotes, </em>622 F.3d at 1178-79. The Court further concluded that an evidentiary hearing is necessary to determine when the scientific techniques at issue were developed and would have been available to an inmate like Souliotes. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the Court rejected Souliotes\u2019s claims under the doctrine of equitable tolling and under the \u201cactual innocence\u201d or \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d gateway. <em>Id. </em>at 1181; <em>see also Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995). With respect to the latter issue, the Court relied on <em>Lee v. Lampert, </em>610 F.3d 1125 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">A majority of nonrecused active judges of this Court recently voted to rehear the <em>Lee </em>case en banc. Although the outcome in <em>Lee </em>upon rehearing en banc may affect the scope of Souliotes\u2019s habeas claims on remand, the result in <em>Lee </em>will not alter the need for an evidentiary hearing concerning when Souliotes could have discovered the new evidence at issue. The Court is mindful of the amount of time that has elapsed since Souliotes filed his habeas petition. The Court is also aware that Souliotes is no longer a young man and that, for him to have a meaningful right to habeas review, the timing of proceedings is significant. Thus, while awaiting an en banc opinion in <em>Lee, </em>we remand this case to the district court for the <em>limited </em>purpose of conducting an expedited evidentiary hearing to determine when an inmate in Souliotes\u2019s position could have discovered, through the exercise of due diligence, the new MPD evidence. <em>See Nash v. Ryan, </em>581 F.3d 1048, 1058 (9th Cir.2009) (ordering a limited remand to allow the district court to make a factual determination); <em>Friery v. L.A. Unified Sch. Dist., </em>448 F.3d 1146, 1150 (9th Cir.2006) (same). The parties shall advise the Court when the evidentia-ry hearing has concluded and the district court has entered findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>We therefore grant a limited remand for the district court to conduct further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b683-8\"> The Honorable Thomas S. Zilly, Senior United States District Judge for the Western District of Washington, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
