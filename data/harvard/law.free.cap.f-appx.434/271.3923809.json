The district court sentenced Crawford to six months\u2019 probation and imposed a $100 special assessment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-22\">On appeal, Crawford\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he states that he could find no meritorious issues for appeal. Crawford was informed of her right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but she has not done so. Counsel calls our attention to Crawford\u2019s allegations of duress and coercion set forth in her notice of appeal filed in the district court. We find no merit in these conclusory allegations, especially in light of Crawford\u2019s sworn testimony to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-23\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Crawford\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Crawford, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Crawford requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Crawford.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
