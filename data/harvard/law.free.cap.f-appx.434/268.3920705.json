Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In calculating Kulla\u2019s offense level, the district court applied U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2Hl.l(a)(l) (2009), which instructed it to apply \u201cthe offense level from the offense guideline applicable to any underlying offense.\u201d The court identified the underlying offense as blackmail, and Kulla was therefore assigned a base offense level of nine pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2B3.3(a). The base offense level was increased by six levels because Kulla was a public official at the time of the offense and the offense was committed under color of law, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 2Hl.l(b)(l), and decreased by two levels for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1 (a), for a total offense level of thirteen. Kulla was placed in Criminal History Category I, which yielded a Guidelines range of twelve to eighteen months. Because Kulla was subject to a statutory maximum of one year, the Guidelines range became twelve months pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Kulla challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that blackmail was an appropriate underlying offense for purposes of USSG \u00a7 2Hl.l(a)(l). He argues that he merely sought access to the victim to pursue a romantic relationship with her, and that his communication with the victim did not satisfy the elements of blackmail because he did not demand a \u201cthing of value\u201d from her. In assessing a sentencing court\u2019s application of the Guidelines, this court reviews its legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Mehta, </em>594 F.3d 277, 281 (4th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 279, 178 L.Ed.2d 184 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">\u201c \u2018Blackmail\u2019 ... is defined as a threat to disclose a violation of United States law unless money or some other item of value is given.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B3.3, comment. (n.l); <em>accord </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 873 (2006). The words \u201cthing of value\u201d \u201care found in so many criminal statutes throughout the United States that they have in a sense become words of art. The word \u2018thing\u2019 notwithstanding, the phrase is generally construed to cover intangibles as well as tangibles.\u201d <em>United States v. Girard, </em>601 F.2d 69, 71 (2d Cir.1979). Within the context of various criminal statutes, federal appellate courts have found diverse intangible items to be \u201cthings of value.\u201d <em>See United States v. Townsend, </em>630 F.3d 1003, 1011 (11th Cir.) (freedom from jail and greater freedom while on pretrial release), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2472, 179 L.Ed.2d 1233 (2011); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>525 F.3d 1033, 1047-48 (11th Cir. 2008) (sexual intercourse); <em>United States v. Marmolejo, </em>89 F.3d 1185, 1191 (5th Cir.1996) (conjugal visits); <em>Girard, </em>601 F.2d at 71 (amusement, sexual intercourse or the promise of sexual intercourse, a promise to reinstate an employee, an agreement not to run in a primary election, or the testimony of a witness).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">Based on our review of the record, we agree with the district court that the time and attention of Ms. Blanco, a woman much younger than Kulla, was a \u201cthing of value.\u201d Kulla persisted in trying to secure Blanco\u2019s attention, from giving her flowers to threatening her with deportation. As noted by the Government, Kulla\u2019s actions show \u201cthat he effectively bargained for [Ms. Blanco\u2019s time and attention], which is an indication of its value to him.\u201d (Appel-lee\u2019s Br. at 10). Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that blackmail was an appropriate underlying offense for purposes of USSG \u00a7 2Hl.l(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">Kulla next argues that the district court erred in referring to both his and Ms. Blanco\u2019s physical appearance before imposing his sentence. He contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>attractiveness of the parties is not a permissible sentencing consideration and that sentencing in federal court cannot turn on the attractiveness of the people involved. Of course, Kulla is right that a sentencing judge may not rely on physical attractiveness in reaching a sentencing decision. The record reveals, however, that the district court merely commented on the relative attractiveness of Kulla and his victim while conducting its \u201cthing of value\u201d analysis. We find nothing in the record to support Kulla\u2019s contention that the district court took either Kulla\u2019s or Ms. Blanco\u2019s physical appearance into account in imposing the sentence in this case. Kulla\u2019s arguments in this regard are simply unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Kulla\u2019s sentence. We deny as moot the motion to expedite the decision. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
