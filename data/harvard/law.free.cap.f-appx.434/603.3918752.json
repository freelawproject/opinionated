We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we do not recount additional facts except as necessary to explain the decision. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">Panella first claims that he was denied due process on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct. At trial, two government witnesses who had charges pending on other matters at the time they gave their testimony denied being motivated to testify by an expectation of leniency. Pan-ella claims that the prosecution failed to meet two constitutional obligations with respect to this testimony: (1) the duty under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), to disclose the existence of a secret deal for leniency between the prosecution and the witnesses; and (2) the duty under <em>Napue v. Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959), to correct the false testimony that the witnesses were not motivated by the expectation of leniency. The district court did not certify Panella\u2019s <em>Napue </em>claim for our review, but, because the parties both briefed the claim, we now expand the certificate of appealability. 9th Cir. R. 22-l(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-17\">The district court correctly concluded that Panella has not shown that the state court\u2019s denial of Panella\u2019s habeas petition based on prosecutorial misconduct was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of\u2019 Supreme Court law or that it \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The state court concluded that Panella\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim failed because Panella had not produced any evidence that the prosecution promised or suggested leniency in exchange for the witnesses\u2019 testimony. Likewise, the state court determined that Panella\u2019s <em>Napue </em>claim failed because he had not produced any evidence that the prosecution knew at the time of trial that the witnesses lied when they testified that they did not expect leniency. <em>See United States v. Zuno-Arce, </em>339 F.3d 886, 889 (9th Cir.2003) (stating that <em>Napue </em>claim includes the following elements: \u201c(1) the testimony (or evidence) was actually false, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>(2) the prosecution knew or should have known that the testimony was actually false, and (3) that the false testimony was material.\u201d). As the district court found, Panella has not offered any evidence or Supreme Court law demonstrating that the state court\u2019s \u201cruling ... was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>-U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786-787, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Nor can we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying Panella an evidentiary hearing on his prosecutorial misconduct claim. The state court held, and the district court agreed, that Panella\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claims would not, if proven, have been material to the outcome of his trial given the quantity of independent evidence demonstrating Panella\u2019s guilt. <em>See United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 678, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985) <em>(Brady </em>materiality); <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 103, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976) (Napue materiality). Since a habeas petitioner is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing unless he has \u201c \u2018alleged facts that, if proven, would entitle him to habeas relief,\u2019 \u201d <em>Earp v. Ornoski, </em>431 F.3d 1158, 1167 (9th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Williams v. Woodford, </em>384 F.3d 567, 586 -(9th Cir. 2004)), the district court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that Panella\u2019s inability to demonstrate materiality rendered an evidentiary hearing unnecessary. <em>See Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1401, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011) (\u201cAlthough state prisoners may sometimes submit new evidence in federal court, AEDPA\u2019s statutory scheme is designed to strongly discourage them from doing so.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">Second, Panella claims juror misconduct, committed when the foreperson coerced another juror into changing her verdict, warrants reversal of his conviction. The state court found as a factual matter that the foreperson did not physically coerce the juror to change her verdict. Without the element of physical coercion, the state court determined that the allegations in the affidavit described no more than permissible \u201cheated discussions that naturally occur at times during jury deliberations.\u201d The record supports the state court\u2019s factual finding, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2), and Panella has not pointed to any clearly established Supreme Court law holding that a jury verdict influenced by harassment but not coercion violates due process, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). We therefore agree with the district court that Panella\u2019s claim for habeas relief must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to hold an evidentiary hearing on Panella\u2019s juror misconduct claim because the state court assumed the truth of Panella\u2019s factual allegations before correctly ruling that no constitutional error had occurred. <em>See Earp, </em>431 F.3d at 1167 (holding that petitioner must establish \u201ccolorable claim for relief\u2019 before being entitled to evidentiary hearing). <em>Cf Pinholster, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1412 (Breyer, J., concurring in part) (noting that where the state court assumed a habeas petitioner\u2019s facts but unreasonably found those facts did not violate federal law, a hearing in federal court might be required).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b626-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
