The district court denied the motion, and thereafter Ohang-bon pleaded guilty to Counts One and Three pursuant to a plea agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was sentenced to forty-two months\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">On appeal Ohangbon contends that the district court erred in denying his suppression motion because police lacked probable cause or reasonable suspicion to stop his vehicle. Ohangbon also asserts that the district court procedurally erred in sentencing when it enhanced his offense level by four levels. We affirm his convictions but vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">We review factual findings underlying the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress for clear error and legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Blake, </em>571 F.3d 331, 338 (4th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1104, 175 L.Ed.2d 919 (2010). A factual finding is clearly erroneous if this court \u201con the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>532 F.3d 326, 337 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, \u201cif the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,\u201d we will not reverse the district court\u2019s finding even if we would have \u201cdecided the fact differently.\u201d <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>396 F.3d 538, 542 (4th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). In other words, when two views of the evidence are permissible, \u201cthe district court\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-14\">We also defer to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations, \u201cfor it is the role of the district court to observe witnesses and weigh their credibility during a pre-trial motion to suppress.\u201d <em>United States v. Abu Ali, </em>528 F.3d 210, 232 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). We construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government as the party prevailing below. <em>United States v. Griffin, </em>589 F.3d 148, 150 (4th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1599, 179 L.Ed.2d 503 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-17\">A traffic stop of a vehicle constitutes a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and is permissible if the officer has either probable cause to believe a traffic violation has occurred, <em>Whren v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 809-10, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996), or a reasonable suspicion of unlawful conduct, <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 20-22, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), regardless of the officer\u2019s subjective motivations, <em>Whren, </em>517 U.S. at 810, 813-19, 116 S.Ct. 1769. <em>See United States v. Branch, </em>537 F.3d 328, 335 (4th Cir.2008) (\u201cObserving a traffic violation provides sufficient justification for a police officer to detain the offending vehicle for as long as it takes to perform the traditional incidents of a routine traffic stop.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Ohangbon identifies inconsistencies in the testimony of Detective Saintsing, the officer who conducted the traffic stop, concerning the alleged violations that led to the stop. He argues that Saintsing lacked a legitimate basis to initiate a stop and that the purported traffic violations relied upon by Saintsing were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The district court acknowledged the inconsistencies in Saintsing\u2019s testimony but found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">any discrepancies in Saintsing\u2019s testimony do not undermine his credibility to the point of causing the court to reject it all. Based on the totality of the circumstances, the court finds Saintsing credible regarding the critical fact that he observed the Mercedes change lanes erratically, run off the road, and swerve within a lane during its travel down the highway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Deferring to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we conclude that Saintsing had reasonable suspicion to initiate a traffic stop notwithstanding the discrepancies Ohang-bon identifies.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Ohangbon contends that, in any event, his movements did not violate North Carolina law because there was no testimony that he drove his vehicle so unsafely as to endanger another. We disagree. North Carolina law provides that drivers ensure their movements can be made in safety. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 20-146(d)(l), 20-154(a) (2009). The law does not distinguish between the driver\u2019s own safety and the safety of other motorists. The district court thus did not err in concluding Detective Saintsing had reasonable suspicion that Ohangbon was violating North Carolina traffic laws. Ohangbon\u2019s erratic movements supplied a reasonable suspicion that he was not able or willing to determine whether his movements could be made in safety. Any subjective motivations Saintsing may have had in stopping Ohangbon cannot alter this conclusion. <em>Whren, </em>517 U.S. at 810, 813-19, 116 S.Ct. 1769.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">Ohangbon further argues that the illegible registration sticker on his license plate did not violate N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-111(1), (2) (2009), because he did not act willfully. Because Ohangbon\u2019s erratic driving alone supplied Saintsing with reasonable suspicion to initiate the traffic stop, we need not reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">Next, Ohangbon argues that the district court committed procedural error at sentencing when it misapplied the advisory Sentencing Guidelines. Specifically, he argues that the district court erred when it applied a four-level enhancement to his offense level based on its finding that he possessed a firearm in connection with another felony offense. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) (2009).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>The Guidelines allow for a four-level increase of a defendant\u2019s offense level where \u201cthe defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). A firearm is possessed in connection with another offense if the firearm \u201cfacilitated, or had the potential of facilitating,\u201d the other offense. USSG \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 14(A). \u201cThis requirement is satisfied if the firearm had some purpose or effect with respect to the other offense, including if the firearm was present for protection or to embolden the actor.\u201d <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>566 F.3d 160, 162 (4th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted). Here, the district court, relying on <em>United States v. Manigan, </em>592 F.3d 621 (4th Cir. 2010), among other cases, concluded that the Government had established the applicability of the four-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The district court erred, however, in reaching its finding, by substituting the standards applicable to an enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) to one applicable under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Those provisions are not interchangeable. <em>Manigan, </em>for example, concerned the application of USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), which applies to an individual convicted of a narcotics offense while in possession of a weapon; in contrast, \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) applies to an individual convicted of a firearms offense who used or possessed a firearm \u201cin connection with another felony offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6). Section \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) provides for a four-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The different penalties in \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) and \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) are reflected in their elements and shifting burdens. A two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) is proper where the Government proves \u201c[a] weapon was present;\u201d it then falls to the defendant to prove that \u201cit is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 3. In contrast, a \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement will apply only if the Government proves that \u201cthe firearm or ammunition facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense or another offense, respectively.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2K2.1 emit, n. 14(a). <em>See United States v. Nale, </em>101 F.3d 1000, 1004 (4th Cir.1996) (disapproving of analogizing \u201cin connection with\u201d language in \u00a7 2K2.1(c) to \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) and placement of burden an defendant to show no \u201cconnection\u201d). Here, although it purported to apply \u00a7 2K2.1(c), the district court adverted to the \u201cshifting burden\u201d standard applicable to the two-level enhancement provided in \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), stating, \u201cthe Court finds that the Defendant has not carried the burden of demonstrating that it was clearly improbable that the handguns were not used in connection with the drug activity.\u201d J.A. 122-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm Ohangbon\u2019s convictions. However, because it appears that the district court erroneously applied the \u201cshifting burden\u201d approach of \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) to impose a four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), we vacate Ohangbon\u2019s sentence as procedurally unreasonable. We remand for resentencing consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\n<em>CONVICTION AFFIRMED, SENTENCE VACATED, AND CASE REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-18\">.

Although Ohangbon failed to present this precise argument, we exercise our discretion to reach it because the broader issue of the appropriateness of the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement cannot be addressed without setting forth the appropriate standard. <em>See U.S. Nat'l Bank of Oregon v. Indep. Ins. Agents of Am., Inc., </em>508 U.S. 439, 448, 113 S.Ct. 2173, 124 L.Ed.2d 402 (1993); <em>United States v.
