He was sentenced to sixty months of imprisonment. On appeal, he raises two issues: (1) whether sufficient evidence supported his conviction; and (2) whether the court\u2019s willful blindness instruction was proper. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-20\">Because Dizzley moved for a directed verdict of acquittal, we review the denial of a motion for acquittal de novo. <em>United States v. Alerre, </em>430 F.3d 681, 693 (4th Cir.2005). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government as required, <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942), we find that Dizzley\u2019s conviction is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Alerre, </em>430 F.3d at 693; <em>see United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996). We note that the jury simply disbelieved Dizzley\u2019s testimony that he did not know he was laundering drug proceeds by engaging in a series of cash automobile sales that were structured to avoid detection. We do not review credibility determinations on appeal. <em>Burgos, </em>94 F.3d at 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-21\">Next, Dizzley contests the court\u2019s willful blindness instruction. In his opening brief, however, Dizzley admits that the court\u2019s instruction was proper. (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 11). We find no merit to this issue on appeal. Again, the jury made a credibility determination that Dizzley, an educated man who had known one of co-conspirators (Avery Terrell Haigler) for approximately twenty years, knew that he was helping Haigler and at least one other person launder drug proceeds via cash vehicle sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-22\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
