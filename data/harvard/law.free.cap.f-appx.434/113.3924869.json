For the reasons that follow, we will modify the District Court\u2019s order and affirm that order as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Because we write for the parties, who are familiar with the background of this case, we discuss the events leading to this appeal only briefly. Davis is a black female who served as a police officer with the Newark Police Department (\u201cNPD\u201d) in Newark, New Jersey, for several years prior to the termination of her employment in or around July 2007. In March 2009, she commenced this action by filing a pro se complaint in the District Court. She subsequently filed a pro se amended complaint in October 2009. The amended complaint, brought against the City of Newark, several NPD officers, the Institute for Forensic Psychology, and numerous unidentified individuals and entities, alleged claims of retaliation under the First Amendment and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq., as well as claims of race and gender discrimination under Title VII. The amended complaint also raised several state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">In December 2009, the City of Newark and the NPD officers moved to dismiss the amended complaint pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). On September 10, 2010, the District Court granted the motion and dismissed the entire amended complaint with prejudice. The court concluded that Davis\u2019s First Amendment claims failed because the alleged triggers of the Defendants\u2019 retaliation \u2014 a police report that Davis had prepared while an officer with the NPD, as well as various internal grievances she had submitted to her NPD superiors \u2014 were not protected speech under the First Amendment. As for her Title VII claims, the District Court concluded that her amended complaint \u201cis so devoid of factual substance that [she] cannot possibly state a claim under Title VII.\u201d (Dist. Ct. Op. at 8.) Finally, because the court rejected all of Davis\u2019s federal claims, it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her state law claims. Davis now seeks review of the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise de novo review over the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Davis\u2019s amended complaint, <em>see Phillips v. County of Allegheny, </em>515 F.3d 224, 230 (3d Cir.2008), and may affirm that judgment on any basis supported by the record. <em>See Tourscher v. McCullough, </em>184 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1999). In conducting our review, \u201cwe accept as true all well-pled factual allegations in the [amended] complaint and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from them, and we affirm the order of dismissal only if the pleading does not plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>See Fellner v. Tri-Union Seafoods, L.L.C., </em>539 F.3d 237, 242 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">Having reviewed the record in this case, and for substantially the reasons provided by the District Court, we agree with the court\u2019s decision to dismiss Davis\u2019s Title VII claims. We also agree with the District Court that her retaliation claims fail under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment, for the police report and internal grievances that allegedly triggered the retaliatory activity were not made in her role as a private citizen speaking on a matter of public concern. <em>See Garcetti v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number><em>Ceballos, </em>547 U.S. 410, 418, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006). Although the District Court did not address whether her allegations of retaliation stated a claim under the First Amendment\u2019s Petition Clause, we conclude that they do not, for the Petition Clause, like the Free Speech Clause, is triggered only by matters of public concern. <em>See Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2488, 180 L.Ed.2d 408 (2011); <em>see also id. </em>at -, 126 S.Ct. 1951 (stating that a public employee\u2019s right under the Petition Clause \u201cis not a right to transform everyday employment disputes into matters for constitutional litigation in the federal courts\u201d). Finally, to the extent Davis\u2019 amended complaint alluded to alleged due process violations, we conclude that she failed to present a viable due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Because the District Court properly dismissed all of Davis\u2019s constitutional and federal claims, it did not err in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her state law claims. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3) (providing that a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims when it \u201chas dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction\u201d); <em>Borough of W. Mifflin v. Lancaster, </em>45 F.3d 780, 788 (3d Cir. 1995) (\u201c[Wjhere the claim over which the district court has original jurisdiction is dismissed before trial, the district court must decline to decide the pendent state claims unless considerations of judicial economy, convenience, and fairness to the parties provide an affirmative justification for doing so.\u201d). We note, however, that these state law claims should have been dismissed <em>without </em>prejudice. <em>See Figueroa v. Buccaneer Hotel Inc., </em>188 F.3d 172, 182 (3d Cir.1999). Accordingly, we will modify the District Court\u2019s September 10, 2010 order to reflect this point, and, in light of the above, affirm that order as modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
