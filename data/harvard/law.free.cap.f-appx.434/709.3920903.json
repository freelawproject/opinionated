The district court held that National Union did not breach its contractual duty to pay because Silgan did not suffer a covered loss under the umbrella insurance policy issued by National Union. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we do not recount additional facts except as necessary to explain the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The parties agree that California law applies and that it is Silgan\u2019s burden to establish that its claims fall within the scope of the insurance policy. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Lindahl v. Air France, </em>930 F.2d 1434, 1436 (9th Cir.1991). Jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Under the terms of the umbrella policy, National Union is obligated to pay sums that Silgan is liable for due to \u2018Property Damage\u2019. The policy defines two types of \u2018Property Damage\u2019: (1) \u201cphysical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property,\u201d and (2) \u201closs of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.\u201d We conclude that neither type of \u2018Property Damage\u2019 occurred here. Thus, National Union did not breach its duty to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">1. \u201cPhysical injury to tangible property\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">The prevailing view under California law is that where property damage is defined as a \u201cphysical injury to tangible property,\u201d the \u201cmere incorporation of a defective but functioning [product] that might fail in the future [does] not constitute \u2018property damage.\u2019 \u201d <em>F &amp; H Const, v. ITT Hartford Ins. Co. of Midwest, </em>118 Cal.App.4th 364, 12 Cal.Rptr.3d 896, 905 (2004). We conclude that coverage is not triggered by this first definition of \u2018Property Damage\u2019 because it is undisputed that Silgan\u2019s defective lids did not physically harm the fruit inside the cups. There was no alteration in the appearance, shape, or color of the fruit and the fruit remained edible. Silgan\u2019s defective lids, moreover, were not so inherently dangerous that they can be considered to have inflicted a physical injury on the fruit by the mere fact of incorporation. <em>Cf. Armstrong World Indus. Inc. v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>45 Cal.App.4th 1, 52 Cal.Rptr.2d 690, 733-34 (1996) (holding that the installation of asbestos-containing materials caused immediate physical injury to the building because asbestos is ultrahazardous).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">2. \u201cLoss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-13\">A \u201cclassic \u2018loss of use\u2019\u201d claim occurs where \u201cthe insured\u2019s defective property rendered the property of a third party unusable.\u201d <em>Sony Computer Entm\u2019t Am. Inc. v. Am. Home Assur. Co., </em>532 F.3d 1007, 1019 (9th Cir.2008) (applying California law). We conclude that coverage is not triggered by this second definition of \u2018Property Damage\u2019 because Silgan has not demonstrated that the fruit inside the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>fective cups was completely \u201cunusable.\u201d Although Del Monte may have made a business decision not to sell the fruit cups, Silgan has not shown that the edible fruit was unsuitable for other purposes, such as sale on a secondary market.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In sum, because Silgan has not established that its defective lids caused \u201ca physical injury to tangible property\u201d or the \u201closs of use of tangible property that is not physically injured,\u201d National Union did not breach its duty to pay under the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b732-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
