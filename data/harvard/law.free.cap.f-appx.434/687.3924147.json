AHL contends Loza misrepresented whether he was undergoing a diagnostic test for cancer at the time he applied for coverage and that his claim is based on an uncovered preexisting condition. Loza filed suit alleging claims for (1) breach of contract, (2) bad-faith denial of coverage, (3) negligent infliction of emotional distress, and (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-19\">The district court granted AHL\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to all claims, finding that AHL was entitled to rescission as a matter of law and dismissing Loza\u2019s separate request for punitive damages. The district court also denied Loza\u2019s cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>motion for partial summary judgment as to his breach of contract claim, finding that AHL had not waived its right to rescission. Loza now appeals the district court\u2019s ruling as to both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment. <em>City of L.A. v. San Pedro Boat Works, </em>685 F.3d 440, 446 (9th Cir.2011). For the reasons that follow, we reverse the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings. Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history of the ease, we do not recite them here except as necessary to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">1. Breach of Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">To support a claim to rescission of an insurance contract under Arizona law, AHL must establish that Loza made a fraudulent misrepresentation in his insurance application. Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 20-1109; <em>see also James River Ins. Co. v. Hebert Schenk, P.C., </em>523 F.3d 915, 920-21 .(9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Question six of AHL\u2019s cancer insurance application asked in pertinent part: \u201cIs any person to be insured currently undergoing any diagnostic test for, now being treated for, or ever been treated for, cancer or any malignancy....\u201d AHL argues that \u201cdiagnostic test for cancer\u201d should be defined as any test that is part of a diagnostic process used to identify cancer. Thus AHL alleges that Loza\u2019s answer of \u201cno\u201d was a misrepresentation because he had recently undergone a prostate-specific antigen test (\u201cPSA test\u201d), which AHL contends is part of the diagnostic process for identifying prostate cancer and should have been disclosed in response to question six.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Loza counters that \u201cdiagnostic test for cancer\u201d should be defined as a test that could itself identify or rule out the presence of cancer. Accordingly, he argues that his response to question six was not a misrepresentation because a PSA test cannot identify or rule out cancer. To assess whether Loza\u2019s answer was false, therefore, the court must determine the scope of \u201cdiagnostic test for cancer\u201d as used within the application, which does not itself define the term. <em>See Sparks v. Republic Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>132 Ariz. 529, 647 P.2d 1127, 1132 (1982) (\u201cThe interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law to be determined by the Court independent of the findings of the trial court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">We hold that AHL was not entitled to rescission because the term \u201cdiagnostic test for cancer\u201d is ambiguous under the facts here. To evaluate ambiguity in an insurance contract, Arizona law applies \u201ca rule of common sense,\u201d requiring a court to consider whether \u201cconflicting reasonable interpretations\u201d are presented and whether \u201clegislative goals, social policy, and examination of the transaction as a whole\u201d support a finding of ambiguity. <em>Employers Mut. Cas. Co. v. DGG &amp; CAR, Inc., </em>218 Ariz. 262, 183 P.3d 513, 515 (2008) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cMoreover, the \u2018ambiguity\u2019 rule applies only after the court is unable to determine how the language of the policy applies to the specific facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). The undisputed medical evidence presented here is that a PSA test is used as a screening test in conjunction with other examination results to evaluate whether a cancer biopsy of the prostate is warranted, but could indicate a range of other medical issues. It is undisputed that a PSA test cannot itself diagnose or rule out prostate cancer. Thus, the medical evidence would reasonably support both AHL\u2019s broad reading of \u201cdiagnostic test for cancer\u201d and Loza\u2019s narrow reading of the same term, as these definitions apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>to a PSA test.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further, neither interpretation conflicts with standard definitions of this term.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The facts surrounding Loza\u2019s PSA test also fail to clarify whether he should have considered it to be a diagnostic test for cancer when answering question six. While AHL\u2019s underwriters testified it is \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d that a PSA test is used to detect prostate cancer, Loza testified that he did not know what a PSA test was, and there is no further evidence about public understanding of a PSA test. <em>See Sparks, </em>647 P.2d at 1132 (\u201cIn determining whether an ambiguity exists in a policy, the language should be examined from the viewpoint of one not trained in law or in the insurance business.\u201d). While Loza\u2019s physical symptoms and medical history indicated a heightened potential for prostate cancer, his primary care physician did not tell him he was being tested for cancer either before or after the PSA test. Indeed, a PSA test is recommended for all men of Loza\u2019s age, regardless of their symptoms. Finally, the transaction here was initiated by AHL, and the application\u2019s language was prepared by AHL. We see no social policy or legislative goal that would conflict with our finding question six to be ambiguous under the circumstances here.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Under Arizona law, an ambiguous term in an insurance document is construed against the insurer. <em>First Am. Title Ins. Co. v. Action Acquisitions, LLC, </em>218 Ariz. 394, 187 P.3d 1107, 1110 (2008) (\u201cIf an ambiguity remains after considering [all relevant] factors, we construe it against the insurer.\u201d); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Wilson, </em>162 Ariz. 251, 782 P.2d 727, 733 (1989) (\u201cOnce a court finds the requisite ambiguity, it is then compelled to construe the provision against the insurer.\u201d); <em>Sparks, </em>647 P.2d at 1132 (\u201cWhere the language employed is unclear and can be reasonably construed in more than one sense, an ambiguity is said to exist and such ambiguity will be construed against the insurer.\u201d). Because there is no dispute that a PSA test cannot itself identify the presence of cancer, Loza\u2019s response to question six was not false under his narrow definition of \u201cdiagnostic test for cancer.\u201d Accordingly, AHL is not entitled to rescission pursuant to \u00a7 20-1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">We therefore reverse summary judgment as to Loza\u2019s breach of contract claim. Loza may now himself be entitled to summary judgment on this claim, but the district court did not address AHL\u2019s second argument that his insurance claim was based on an uncovered preexisting condition. We decline to address on appeal an argument not decided in the district court. Accordingly, we remand this issue to the district court for a determination of whether this issue precludes entry of summary judgment as to Loza\u2019s breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">2. Bad Faith</p>\n<p id=\"b712-12\">The district court found that AHL was entitled to summary judgment on Loza\u2019s claim to bad-faith denial of coverage because his misrepresentation in the application was a reasonable basis upon which to rescind the policy. Because we hold that Loza made no misrepresentation, we reverse summary judgment and remand this claim for further proceedings. <em>See Zilisch v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>196 Ariz. 234, 995 P.2d 276, 279 (2000) (\u201cWhile an insurer may challenge claims which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>fairly debatable, its belief in fair debatability \u2018is a question of fact to be determined by the jury\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Sparks, </em>647 P.2d at 1137) (internal citation omitted). Loza may also be entitled to punitive damages on the basis of this claim. <em>See Filasky v. Preferred Risk Mut. Ins. Co., </em>152 Ariz. 591, 734 P.2d 76, 82-83 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">3. Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The district court granted AHL summary judgment on Loza\u2019s claim to negligent infliction of emotional distress because \u201c[i]t is undisputed that Loza received no physical injury from the actions of [AHL].\u201d In Arizona, the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress requires that emotional distress result in illness or bodily harm. <em>Keck v. Jackson, </em>122 Ariz. 114, 593 P.2d 668, 669 (1979). Under Arizona law, however, \u201cbodily harm\u201d can include \u201csubstantial, long-term emotional disturbances unaccompanied by any physical injury.\u201d <em>Harris v. Maricopa Cnty. Superior Court, </em>631 F.3d 963, 978 (9th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, we reverse summary judgment and remand for further proceedings to determine if Loza has sufficient evidence of long-term emotional disturbance to support a triable issue of fact on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">4. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Because Loza conceded that his claim to intentional infliction of emotional distress could not succeed if AHL validly rescinded the policy, the district court entered summary judgment without addressing whether there was evidence to support all the necessary elements of this claim. <em>See Citizen Publ\u2019g Co. v. Miller, </em>210 Ariz. 513, 115 P.3d 107, 110 (2005) (identifying necessary elements of this claim under Arizona law). Accordingly, we reverse summary judgment and remand for further proceedings to determine whether Loza has sufficient evidence to support a triable issue of fact on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">Reversed and Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b710-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-6\">. AHL\u2019s reliance on <em>Eley v. Boeing Co., </em>945 F.2d 276, 279 (9th Cir.1991), to support its interpretation is unavailing because our decision in that case centered on the broad discretion afforded to administrators under ERISA to interpret provisions of employee health plans.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
