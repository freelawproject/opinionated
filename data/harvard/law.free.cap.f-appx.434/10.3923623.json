Rakoff of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b33-21\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b33-22\">Emmerling appeals the dismissal of his four claims: (1) substantive due process violation, (2) stigma-plus procedural due process violation, (3) selective enforcement equal protection violation, and (4) conspiracy to violate his constitutional rights. He also appeals the denial of his motion for leave to amend his complaint. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-23\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint under Federal Rule of Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., </em>621 F.3d 111, 124 (2d Cir.2010). We review for abuse of discretion a district denial of a plaintiffs request for leave to amend a complaint. <em>Green v. Mattingly, </em>585 F.3d 97, 104 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-24\">\u201cTo establish a violation of substantive due process rights, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the state action was so egregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>said to shock the contemporary conscience.\u201d <em>Okin v. Vill. of Cornwall-On-Hudson Police Def't, </em>577 F.3d <em>415, 431 (2d </em>Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Emmerling failed to allege any behavior by Appellees that could reasonably be considered egregious, outrageous, or conscience-shocking. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of his substantive due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">To state a valid \u201cstigma-plus\u201d claim, a plaintiff must plausibly allege: (1) a defamatory statement; (2) \u201csome tangible and material state-imposed burden in addition to the stigmatizing statement\u201d; and (3) a lack of process adequate to justify the state\u2019s action. <em>Velez v. Levy, 401 </em>F.3d 75, 87-88 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted). To allege a defamatory statement, a plaintiff must allege a public statement injurious to the plaintiff that is capable of being proven false and that was false. <em>Id., </em>at 87. We agree with the district court that Emmer-ling failed to plausibly allege a defamatory statement or a lack of adequate process. We therefore affirm the dismissal of his stigma-plus claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">To state a valid selective enforcement claim under the Equal Protection Clause, a plaintiff must plausibly allege: (1) He was treated differently than others similarly situated; and (2) The selective treatment was \u201cbased on impermissible considerations such as race, religion, intent to inhibit or punish the exercise of constitutional rights, or malicious or bad faith intent to injure a person.\u201d <em>Freedom Holdings, Inc. v. Spitzer, </em>357 F.3d 205, 234 (2d Cir.2004). This Circuit has not yet decided whether selective enforcement claims are still viable in the public employment context after <em>Engquist v. Or. Dep't of Agric., </em>553 U.S. 591, 128 S.Ct. 2146, 170 L.Ed.2d 975 (2008). We need not answer this question here, however, because we agree with the district court that Emmer-ling failed to plausibly allege that he was similarly situated to any of the individuals he points to as having received more favorable treatment. On this basis, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of his selective enforcement claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">To state a valid conspiracy claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3), a plaintiff must, among other things, plausibly allege the existence of a conspiracy to deprive him of his constitutional rights. A complaint containing \u201conly conclusory, vague, or general allegations of conspiracy to deprive a person of constitutional rights cannot withstand a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Gyadu v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>197 F.3d 590, 591 (2d Cir.1999) (per curiam). We agree with the district court that Emmerling provided only vague and conclusory allegations of conspiracy and thereby failed to allege a plausible \u00a7 1985(3) claim. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Em-merling\u2019s conspiracy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">A district court may deny a plaintiffs request for leave to amend his complaint when it believes that such leave would be futile. <em>Acito v. IMCERA Grp., Inc., </em>47 F.3d 47, 55 (2d Cir.1995). Here, Emmerling\u2019s proposed amendments are merely stylistic and fail to amend his complaint in a manner that would survive dismissal. <em>See Hayden v. Cnty. of Nassau, </em>180 F.3d 42, 53 (2d Cir.1999). We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Emmerling leave to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">We hereby AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment denying Appellant\u2019s motion to amend his complaint and granting Appel-lees\u2019 motions to dismiss Appellant\u2019s complaint with prejudice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
