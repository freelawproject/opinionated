Garcia was injured when she was struck by a vehicle driven by co-defendant Gregory Georges (\u201cGeorges\u201d), who had rented the automobile from Alamo. Garcia filed a complaint against Alamo seeking damages for, among other things, vicarious liability under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 324.021(9)(b)(2). The district court, pursuant to Alamo\u2019s motion to dismiss, held that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 324.021(9)(b)(2) was preempted by federal law, and dismissed Appellant\u2019s vicarious liability claim and one of her negligence claims. The district court subsequently entered summary judgment disposing of the remaining claim against Alamo.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">On appeal, Appellant argues that the district court erred in granting Alamo\u2019s motion to dismiss because: (1) Congress did not intend for the Graves Amendment to preempt capped or limited vicarious liability schemes like that in Fla. Stat. \u00a7 324.021(9) (b) (2); and (2) Fla. Stat. \u00a7 324.021(9)(b)(2) is exempted from preemption under the Graves Amendment\u2019s savings clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">We review a district court\u2019s order granting a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standard used by the district court. <em>Stephens v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>901 F.2d 1571, 1573 (11th Cir.1990). We take the facts in the complaint and all reasonable inferences therefrom as true. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-13\">On August 10, 2005, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (\u201cSAFE-TEA-LU\u201d) was codified at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106. This legislation is now referred to as the Graves Amendment, after Representative Graves who was a principal proponent of the bill. The Graves Amendment insulates lessors of motor vehicles from vicarious liability. There are two operative provisions: a preemption clause and a savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-14\">The preemption clause states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-15\">(a) In general. \u2014 An owner of a motor vehicle that rents or leases the vehicle to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>a person (or an affiliate of the owner) shall not be liable under the law of any State or political subdivision thereof, by reason of being the owner of the vehicle (or an affiliate of the owner), for harm to persons or property that results or arises out of the use, operation, or possession of the vehicle during the period of the rental or lease, if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-5\">(1) the owner (or an affiliate of the owner) is engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">(2) there is no negligence or criminal wrongdoing on the part of the owner (or an affiliate of the owner).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-7\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106(a). The savings clause states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-8\">(b) Financial responsibility laws. \u2014 Nothing in this section supersedes the law of any State or political subdivision thereof\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-9\">(1) imposing financial responsibility or insurance standards on the owner of a motor vehicle for the privilege of registering and operating a motor vehicle; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-10\">(2) imposing liability on business entities engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles for failure to meet the financial responsibility or liability insurance requirements under State law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-11\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 30106(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">In <em>Garcia v. Vanguard Car Rental USA, Inc., </em>540 F.3d 1242, 1245-49 (11th Cir.2008), we held that the Graves Amendment preempts Fla. Stat. \u00a7 324.021(9)(b)(2), the very statutory provision at issue in this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We found that \u00a7 324.021 fell within the Graves Amendment\u2019s preemption clause, and that Congress intended to draw a distinction \u201cbetween liability based on the companies\u2019 own negligence and that of their lessees, not between limited and unlimited vicarious liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1248. In addition, we rejected the argument that Florida\u2019s vicarious liability scheme is part of its financial responsibility law, so as to be exempted under the savings clause. We held that financial responsibility laws, for the purposes of the Graves Amendment, are \u201clegal requirements, not mere financial inducements imposed by law,\u201d like \u00a7 324.021(9)(b)(2). <em>Id. </em>Thus, we held, because reading \u00a7 324.021(9)(b)(2) into the savings clause exception would \u201crender the preemption clause a nullity,\u201d the Florida statute did not satisfy the savings clause. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-16\"><em>Garcia </em>controls this case. <em>Garcia </em>directly rejects Appellant\u2019s arguments that the preemption clause was only intended to preempt unlimited vicarious liability schemes and that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 324.021(9)(b)(2) fell within the savings clause. As noted in the district court\u2019s order to dismiss, Appellant neither makes an attempt to distinguish <em>Garcia </em>nor ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>gues that <em>Garcia </em>does not apply. Under the prior precedent rule, we are bound to follow our prior precedent unless and until it is overruled by this Court <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court. <em>United States v. Vegar-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Further, not only have we rejected Appellant\u2019s arguments in <em>Garcia, </em>but the Florida Supreme Court has recently issued an opinion holding that the federal Graves Amendment preempted Fla. Stat. \u00a7 324.021(9)(b)(2), and that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 324.021(9)(b)(2) was not a financial responsibility law as contemplated by savings clause of the Graves Amendment. <em>See Vargas v. Enterprise Leasing Co., </em>60 So.3d 1037 (Fla.2011). Thus, because this precise preemption issue has already been settled by this Court, as well as by the Florida Supreme Court (which would not bind us in any event because the issue involves the interpretation of a federal statute), there is no reason to stay the proceedings. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing Appellant\u2019s vicarious liability claim, and deny Appellant\u2019s request for a stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-9\">. In this appeal, Garcia has raised arguments only addressing the district court\u2019s dismissal of her vicarious liability claim, and therefore has abandoned any other arguments. <em>Denney v. City of Albany, </em>247 F.3d 1172, 1182 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that issues not briefed on appeal are considered abandoned). In addition, while Garcia's complaint was filed against Alamo <em>and </em>Georges, we have held that \"where an action is dismissed as to all defendants who have been served and only un-served defendants remain, the district court\u2019s judgment may be considered a final appeal-able order.\" <em>Insinga v. LaBella, </em>817 F.2d 1469, 1470 (11th Cir.1987); <em>see also Loman Dev't Co. v. Daytona Hotel &amp; Motel Suppliers, Inc., </em>817 F.2d 1533, 1536 (11th Cir.1987). Despite numerous attempts by Garcia, including repeated attempts at the same international addresses, Georges has not been served to date, and we have \"no reason to assume that there will be any further adjudication of the action.\" <em>Insinga, </em>817 F.2d at 1470. Accordingly, Garcia's case is final and we have jurisdiction over this appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b815-13\">. Fla.
