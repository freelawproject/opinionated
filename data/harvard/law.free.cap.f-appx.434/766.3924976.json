O\u2019BRIEN, United States Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b788-26\">Ismael Gonzalez-Barreras pled guilty to illegal re-entry after deportation subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction and was sentenced to 80 months imprisonment. He appeals, claiming his sentence is substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Gonzalez-Barreras, a citizen of Mexico, came to the United States in 1981. Since that time, he has been deported four times; his last deportation occurred in January 2005. Like the others, that deportation did not stick. In December 2008, he reentered the United States, where he remained at large until December 2009, when he was arrested by the Denver Police Department for possession of a forged instrument. After he completed his 90-day jail sentence for that offense, he was indicted in federal court with illegal re-entry after deportation subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2). He pled guilty to the indictment pursuant to a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">A presentence investigation report (PSR) determined the base offense level was 8. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because he had previously been convicted of \u201ca felony ... drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months,\u201d the base offense level was increased by 16. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). After receiving a 3-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, the total offense level was 21. The PSR determined his Criminal History Category was VI. With that criminal history and a total offense level of 21, the advisory guideline range was 77 to 96 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Gonzalez-Barreras asked for a 4-level downward variance to a sentence of 51 months, claiming it was reasonable considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He pointed out that his advisory guideline range was largely the result of the 16-level enhancement provision of USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Relevant here, he argued that provision was not entitled to deference because it (1) was not based on empirical evidence and therefore the United States Sentencing Commission was not operating within its characteristic institutional role when drafting it and (2) results in his previous drug conviction being \u201cdouble counted\u201d \u2014 once to increase his criminal history score and again to increase his base offense level. (R. Vol. I at 75.)</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">The district court denied his motion for a downward variance. Instead, it determined a sentence near the bottom of the guideline range (but not at the bottom) was appropriate and sentenced him to 80 months imprisonment. The court was concerned with the \u201cseverity of his criminal record\u201d which was \u201cnon-stop\u201d from 1993 to 2009. (R. Vol. II at 26, 30.) It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah9v\">He\u2019s in Criminal History Category VI. He\u2019s been deported four times, and he comes back to this country and commits crimes, including felonies. So this situation ... is distinguishable from people who come back and either get no convictions, or maybe they get convicted for illegal reentry. But he comes back and commits independent crimes, so one could argue that he is a threat to public safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">(R. Vol. II at 26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">Gonzalez-Barreras now repeats the argument made in the district court \u2014 his 80-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>month sentence is substantively unreasonable because the 16-level enhancement provision of USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) is, itself, inherently unreasonable as it \u201cis not based on empirical data and national experience\u201d and therefore \u201cdoes not exemplify the Sentencing Commission\u2019s exercise of its characteristic institutional role.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 11 (quotations omitted).) He also argues the enhancement \u201ccreates unwarranted sentencing disparities because it treats every defendant who was convicted of <em>any </em>drug trafficking offense and who was sentenced to more than 13 months [imprisonment] the same, notwithstanding potentially significant differences between them.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 7-8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">\u201cWe [normally] review sentences for substantive reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Middagh, </em>594 F.3d 1291, 1294 (10th Cir.2010). However, as Gonzalez-Barreras acknowledges, his arguments are foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Alvarez-Bernabe, </em>626 F.3d 1161 (10th Cir.2010), which we are bound to follow \u201cabsent en banc reconsideration or a superseding contrary decision by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>In re Smith, </em>10 F.3d 723, 724 (10th Cir.1993). He raises the issues only to preserve them for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b788-7\"> The parties have waived oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed.
