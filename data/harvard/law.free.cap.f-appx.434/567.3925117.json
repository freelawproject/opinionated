Long argued that the document was not really a PSR, and that it contained inaccurate and scandalous information which was being used against him in federal prison. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied the motion, and he appeals. After careful review, and for the reasons explained by the district court, we agree with the court that the document at issue is a PSR within the meaning of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32, and was therefore properly disclosed to the Federal Bureau of Prisons; that Long should have addressed any inaccuracies in the PSR pursuant to Rule 32 at or before sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>ing; and that he cannot now use Rule 36 to obtain the relief sought, which involves far more than correction of a clerical error. <em>See United States v. Yakle, </em>463 F.3d 810, 811 (8th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. We also deny his pending motion to supplement the record.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-18\">. The Honorable Paul A.
