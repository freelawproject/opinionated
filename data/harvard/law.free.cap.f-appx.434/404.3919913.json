He argues the district court plainly erred in applying a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D) because his Virginia conviction of assault of a police officer was not a felony for purposes of that section. To demonstrate plain error, Rosales-Miranda must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court may correct the error when it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks, brackets, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-21\">If the defendant was previously deported after \u201ca conviction for any other felony,\u201d his offense level is increased by four levels. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D). \u201cFelony\u201d is defined as \u201cany federal, state, or local offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-22\">As Rosales-Miranda acknowledges, he was convicted under Section 18.2-57(0 of the Virginia Code, which makes the offense of assault on a law enforcement officer a Class 6 felony. Va.Code \u00a7 18.2-57(C). Section 18.2 \u2014 10(f) of the Virginia Code provides that a Class 6 felony is punishable by \u201ca term of imprisonment of not less than one year nor more than five years,\u201d but the statute allows imposition of a sentence of \u201cconfinement in jail for not more than 12 months\u201d in the discretion of the trial court or the jury. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 18.2-10(f). Rosales-Miranda, who was sentenced to a six-month period of detention in the Fairfax County Detention Center, relies on Section 18.2-10\u00a9 to argue that his conviction was not a felony for purposes of Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(D) as the maximum term of confinement for his offense does not exceed one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-23\">\u201cAbsent mandatory minimum sentences ... Class 6 felonies are generally punishable by no less than one and no more than five years imprisonment.\u201d <em>Rawls v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 334, 634 S.E.2d 697, 703 n. 8 (2006) (citing \u00a7 18.2-10). Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>though the Virginia trial court had the discretion to impose a jail sentence of no more than 12 months, under the plain language of Section 18.2-10 Rosales-Miranda\u2019s Virginia offense was punishable by a maximum of five years of imprisonment. The offense in question was therefore a felony for purposes of Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(D). <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 2. Ramirez has failed to show error, plain or otherwise, in the application of the Section 2L1.2(b)(1)(D) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Rosales-Miranda also claims that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the enhancement. As the previous discussion illustrates, an objection to application of the enhancement under Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(D) would have been merit-less. Counsel is not ineffective for failing to make a meritless objection. <em>See Clark v. Collins, </em>19 F.3d 959, 965-66 (5th Cir. 1994). Further, because an objection would have been unsuccessful, Rosales-Miranda fails to establish the required prejudice. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Rosales-Miranda has failed to show that his trial attorney was ineffective. <em>See United States v. Saenz-Forero, </em>27 F.3d 1016, 1021 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
