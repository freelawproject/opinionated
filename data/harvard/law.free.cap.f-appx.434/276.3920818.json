Nov. 13, 2009) (the \u201cBIA Order\u201d). The BIA Order affirmed the January 7, 2008 decision of an immigration judge. <em>See In re Amenu </em>(Immigr.Ct.Ar-lington, Va. Jan. 7, 2008) (the \u201cIJ Decision\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By virtue thereof, Amenu\u2019s requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (the \u201cCAT\u201d), were each denied. Because the IJ and the BIA misapprehended the facts, engaged in speculation, and otherwise failed to properly consider relevant evidence, we grant the petition for review, vacate the BIA Order, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-17\">Amenu legally entered the United States in April 1988, but remained in this country longer than authorized. In December 1988, Amenu filed an application for asylum, which was denied in September 1989. In January 1990, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (the \u201cINS\u201d) directed to Amenu an order to show cause why she was not subject to deportation. Later, in 1990, Amenu\u2019s case was \u201cadministratively closed\u201d by an IJ because her address was unavailable. In October 2006, the case was recalendared at the joint request of Amenu and the Department of Homeland Security (the \u201cDHS\u201d), which had absorbed the INS in 2003. In February 2007, Amenu renewed her request for relief by filing a new application, by which she sought asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection. On August 13, 2007, the IJ conducted an evidentiary hearing on Amenu\u2019s application for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The evidence presented at the IJ hearing and the materials filed in support of Amenu\u2019s application revealed the following. Amenu\u2019s father served in Ethiopia\u2019s cabinet when Haile Selassie was the Emperor of Ethiopia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the so-called Derg regime overthrew Emperor Selassie\u2019s government in 1974, the Derg authorities arrested Amenu\u2019s father and detained him for seven years. The Derg authorities also arrested and detained Amenu on three separate occasions. She was first detained in 1978 in Ethiopia for fifteen days while the Derg authorities determined whether Amenu\u2019s father had concealed property belonging to Emperor Selassie. Amenu was next detained in 1984 for twenty-four hours because she had not participated in a mandatory \u201cMay Day\u201d demonstration. Amenu\u2019s third detention by the Derg was her longest \u2014 in 1987, she was held for twenty-five days upon refusing to accept her nomination to the Executive Committee of the Women\u2019s Association, a position she believed would be used for propaganda purposes. During her 1987 confinement, Derg soldiers beat and kicked Amenu. She was eventually released, and thereafter traveled to and entered the United States as a nonimmigrant visitor. The Derg regime was overthrown in 1991 and a different regime, called the Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front (the \u201cEPRDF\u201d), now controls Ethiopia\u2019s government.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Amenu\u2019s application for relief expressed fear that she would face persecution from the EPRDF government if she returns to Ethiopia. To substantiate her application, Amenu appended and filed several supporting exhibits and testified at the IJ hearing. The exhibits included State Department reports concerning political conditions in Ethiopia, a picture of Amenu participating in a demonstration against the EPRDF government, the affidavit of a woman named Ghennet Girma Woldegior-gis, correspondence showing Amenu\u2019s efforts to depose Woldegiorgis, and a legal memorandum supporting Amenu\u2019s application for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">At the IJ hearing, Amenu testified that she has been a member, since about 1995, of the Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Party (the \u201cEPRP\u201d), a political organization that opposes the EPRDF government. According to the 2007 Ethiopia Asylum Country Profile (the \u201c2007 Report\u201d), the EPRP is among the \u201c[m]ajor [p]olitical organizations in the Diaspora\u201d not registered with Ethiopia\u2019s mandatory National Election Board. J.A. 203; <em>see id. </em>at 236. The EPRDF government does not recognize the EPRP or allow it to operate in Ethiopia. <em>See id. </em>at 87, 251. Amenu also testified that she has attended EPRP meetings since 1995 \u201c[a]t least once a month\u201d and has participated in EPRP demonstrations \u201ctwo to three times a year,\u201d for a total of \u201cabout fifteen\u201d demonstrations. <em>Id. </em>at 106-07, 129. Amenu appended to her application for relief two letters from the EPRP\u2019s Washington, D.C. office, dated in 2000 and 2006, which confirmed that she is an \u201cactive member\u201d of the EPRP and expressed concern that she \u201cwill face an imminent danger to her life and safety\u201d should she return to Ethiopia. <em>Id. </em>at 212-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Elaborating on Amenu\u2019s EPRP activities was the affidavit of Ghennet Girma Wolde-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>giorgis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Woldegiorgis is a close childhood friend of Amenu, and \u2014 despite being the daughter of the current Ethiopian President \u2014 is \u201cone of the prominent figures of\u2019 the EPRP. J.A. 251. Woldegiorgis herself fled Ethiopia in the 1970s, joined the EPRP in 1975, and was granted asylum by France in 1981. In 1993, Woldegiorgis traveled to Ethiopia to attend a \u201cPeace and Reconciliation Conference,\u201d during which the EPRDF detained her. Wolde-giorgis now regularly travels to Washington, D.C., where she coordinates and attends EPRP events. On her visits to the United States, Woldegiorgis and Amenu are together \u201cfrequently\u201d for EPRP meetings, dinners, and other public social gatherings. <em>Id,.; see id. </em>at 87 (Amenu\u2019s testimony corroborating same).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The Woldegiorgis affidavit attested to Amenu\u2019s EPRP activities, including her attendance at meetings, her distribution of leaflets, and her participation in demonstrations. Woldegiorgis further declared, \u201cI know that the Ethiopian government through its embassy monitors my activity in Washington, D.C.,\u201d keeping an eye on the persons \u201cwith whom I socialize, attend meetings and so on.\u201d J.A. 251. According to the affidavit, because of Amenu\u2019s attendance at EPRP demonstrations and her association with Woldegiorgis, \u201c[t]he EPRDF government is aware of [AmenuJ\u2019s EPRP activities,\u201d and Amenu \u201cwould face grave danger to her life\u201d if she returns to Ethiopia. <em>Id. </em>Amenu echoed Woldegior-gis\u2019s concern that their visible association would attract the attention of the EPRDF and cause Amenu to be persecuted. <em>See id. </em>at 87, 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Amenu is also a supporter of the All Amhara People\u2019s Organization (the \u201cAAPO\u201d), an opposition group that advocates on behalf of those Ethiopians of Am-hara heritage, a loose description of the ethnic group that historically has ruled Ethiopia. Some tensions exist between Amharas and the EPRDF, although it is unlikely that a person \u201cwould be targeted simply because of his or her Amhara ethnicity.\u201d J.A. 186. Amenu has donated money to and distributed pamphlets in support of the AAPO. Amenu testified that the EPRDF twice arrested her older brother for his involvement with the AAPO, after which he fled to the United States, where he was granted asylum. According to Amenu, the EPRDF sought to kill her younger brother, who then fled to Kenya, where he died. Amenu testified that both of her brothers were \u201cprominent individuals\u201d in the AAPO in Ethiopia. J.A. 110. She also confirmed that the EPRDF authorities killed her nephew.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Another of the exhibits to Amenu\u2019s application for relief was Ethiopia\u2019s entry for the 2006 State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices (the \u201c2006 Report\u201d). The introductory portion to the 2006 Report observed that \u201copposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>tion parties [in Ethiopia] engaged in a steady process of consolidation\u201d in a series of elections in 2005, but that the EPRDF remains in power and has suppressed opposition political groups. J.A. 228. In addition, the 2006 Report recited information concerning several human rights abuses in Ethiopia, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2V\">limitation^] on citizens\u2019 right to change them government during the most recent elections; unlawful killings, and beating, abuse, and mistreatment of detainees and opposition supporters; [and] arbitrary arrest and detention, particularly [of] those suspected of sympathizing with or being members of the opposition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><em>Id. </em>In the 2005 elections, \u201c[opposition parties made an unexpectedly strong showing, increasing their parliamentary representation from 12 ... to 172\u201d of 547 seats, with the EPRDF controlling 872 seats. <em>Id. </em>at 238. In those same elections, however, \u201c[observers reported killings, disappearances, voter intimidation and harassment, and unlawful detentions of opposition party supporters, <em>particularly in the Amhara </em>\u201d and certain other regions of the country. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Protests later in 2005 resulted in the arrest of \u201cseveral dozen opposition leaders,\u201d the detention of between 30,000 and 50,000 demonstrators without charge, and \u201carbitrary detention and killings\u201d by the military. <em>Id. </em>at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">By the IJ Decision of January 7, 2008, Amenu\u2019s three requests for relief were denied. According to the IJ, \u201c[i]t is not reasonable to conclude that [Amenu] would be targeted by the current government and face problems upon her return to Ethiopia today.\u201d IJ Decision 8. The IJ found that Amenu testified credibly regarding her father\u2019s involvement in the Selassie government and her detentions at the hands of the Derg regime. Notably, the IJ recited what was purported to be Amenu\u2019s testimony that, during an interrogation following her third Derg detention in Ethiopia, a military leader told Amenu \u201cthat the regime knew she was involved in the EPRDF.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3, 6. The IJ thus determined that Amenu had suffered past persecution based on her third arrest and detention. Notwithstanding such past persecution, however, the IJ found that Am-enu did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution, on the ground that the overthrow of the Derg regime constituted a fundamental change in circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">The IJ also assessed whether Amenu had shown a well-founded fear of persecution due to her AAPO associations and EPRP activities. The IJ recited that Am-enu\u2019s \u201cprimary argument is that the authorities will persecute her because of her Amhara ethnicity,\u201d which is unrelated to the Derg regime\u2019s persecution of her. IJ Decision 7. The IJ then found that Am-enu had not demonstrated \u201ca reasonable likelihood that the government will target her based on her ethnicity alone,\u201d because \u201cnothing in the record ... indicates that the government targets individuals for persecution solely because of their Amhara ethnicity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>With respect to Amenu\u2019s associations with and support for the AAPO, the IJ \u201crecognize[d] that the government has continued to attack AAPO members in Ethiopia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. Nevertheless, the IJ determined that Amenu had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>not demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution because she \u201cwas never involved in the AAPO in Ethiopia\u201d and \u201chas not indicated that the Ethiopian government continues to target her brother or nephew for [their AAPO] activities.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The IJ accepted Amenu\u2019s claim of membership in the EPRP, but found that she was \u201cexaggerating the scope of her current EPRP activities.\u201d IJ Decision 5. The IJ recognized that \u201chuman rights violations continue to occur against political opponents [under] the ruling government\u201d and that \u201cthe ruling government has previously persecuted EPRP activists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7 (citing the 2006 Report). Nonetheless, the IJ offered multiple grounds for his determination that Amenu had failed to show a well-founded fear of persecution on account of her EPRP activities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">\u2022 Amenu \u201cadmitted that she used to attend monthly EPRP meetings, but now goes to EPRP events only \u2018two to three times per year.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. Because she is not an EPRP \u201cleader\u201d and her activities are \u201cvery minimal,\u201d she is \u201cnot ... active enough in the EPRP to draw attention by the Ethiopian authorities as a political opponent,\u201d <em>id.;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">\u2022 The \u201cletter [from the EPRP] does not refer to any specific current activities, but simply states in a conclusory manner that she is an \u2018active member\u2019 of the Washington, [D.C.] branch,\u201d and no evidence shows that active membership \u201cmeans anything more than paying annual membership dues,\u201d <em>id.;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">\u2022 Amenu \u201cdid not participate in the [EPRP] in Ethiopia, where the government had targeted opponents,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 7;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">\u2022 The EPRP \u201cis becoming a decreasingly significant political entity\u201d that \u201cno longer merits inclusion in the State Department reports,\u201d <em>id. </em>(citing, inter alia, the 2007 Report);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">\u2022 The Woldegiorgis affidavit \u201cfails to show that [Amenu] more than minimally participates in EPRP activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. \u201cMoreover, in the absence of other credible testimony and corroborating evidence, self-serving affidavits from individuals who are biased in support of a friend are not sufficient to establish a respondent\u2019s claims,\u201d <em>id.; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-11\">\u2022 According to the 2006 Report, opposition parties in Ethiopia \u201chave engaged in a steady process of consolidation\u201d and \u201chave made an unexpectedly strong showing in recent elections,\u201d while \u201cmajor changes\u201d have occurred in the EPRDF government, <em>id. </em>at 7.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">Accordingly, the IJ Decision denied Am-enu\u2019s application for relief. The BIA Order, filed on November 13, 2009, adopted the IJ Decision. In supplementing the IJ Decision, the BIA explained that, \u201c[a]l-though the [EPRDF] is not above reproach,\u201d the State Department material appended to Amenu\u2019s application \u201cactually indicates that individuals have more access to freedom of expression, political participation, and rule of law.\u201d BIA Order 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">Amenu thereafter filed her petition for review. By order of January 4, 2010, a panel of this Court granted Amenu\u2019s unopposed motion for a stay of the BIA Order pending our disposition of this matter. We possess jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">When the BIA has adopted and supplemented an IJ decision, we review both rulings for substantial evidence. <em>Jian Tao Lin v. Holder, </em>611 F.3d 228, 235 (4th Cir.2010). In applying this standard of review, factual findings \u201care conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,\u201d 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B), and an assessment of witness credibility constitutes such a finding. <em>See Kourouma v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 234, 240 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In order to properly assess Amenu\u2019s petition for review, we first trace the legal architecture of her requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. We then describe the IJ and BIA\u2019s obligation to consider the relevant evidence and offer cogent reasons for their decisions. Applying those principles to Am-enu\u2019s petition for review, we identify several errors. Finally, we evaluate whether those errors were harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">In order to gain eligibility for asylum, Amenu must satisfy the relevant requirements for refugee status. As applicable here, the term \u201crefugee\u201d means an alien \u201cwho is unable or unwilling to return to\u201d her native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). An applicant bears the burden of demonstrating that she is a refugee. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a). The applicant \u201cmay qualify as a refugee either because ... she has suffered past persecution or because ... she has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1208.13(b). If the applicant demonstrates that she has suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground, she is \u201cpresumed to have a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of the original claim\u201d; if the fear of future persecution is \u201cunrelated to the past persecution,\u201d however, the presumption does not apply. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1208.13(b)(1). If the presumption applies, it may be rebutted by an IJ finding by a preponderance of the evidence that, inter alia, \u201c[t]here has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">If the presumption does not apply or is rebutted, an applicant may still possess a well-founded fear of future persecution. The applicant\u2019s fear of persecution is well-founded if (1) she subjectively fears persecution in her native country on account of a protected ground, (2) \u201c[tjhere is a reasonable possibility\u201d of such persecution if she returns, and (3) she is unable or unwilling to return to or avail herself of the protection of her country because of fear, unless (4) she could avoid persecution by relocating to another part of the country and it is reasonable to expect her to do so. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(i)(A) \u2014 (C), (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">As relevant here, an applicant is entitled to withholding of removal if she \u201cestablish[es] that it is more likely than not that ... she would be persecuted on account of [a protected ground] upon removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2). If the applicant \u201cfail[s] to establish the less stringent ... standard of proof required for asylum relief,\u201d she \u201cis necessarily also unable to establish\u201d the \u201cmore demanding\u201d standard of proof required for withholding of removal. <em>Abdel-Rahman v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 444, 449 (4th Cir.2007). Finally, an applicant is entitled to protection under the CAT if she establishes that she \u201cis more likely than not to be tortured in the country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2), (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">The Supreme Court has recognized that a proper judicial review of an agency decision \u201crequires that the grounds upon which the administrative agency acted be clearly disclosed and adequately sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>tained.\u201d <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 94, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943). We have applied <em>Chenery </em>to petitions seeking review of BIA removal orders, explaining that, where \u201ca BIA order does not demonstrate that the agency has considered an issue, \u2018the proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nken v. Holder, </em>585 F.3d 818, 822 (4th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>INS v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam)). In conducting such a review, it is \u201cour responsibility to ensure that unre-butted, legally significant evidence is not arbitrarily ignored by the factfinder.\u201d <em>Ba-haron v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 228, 233 (4th Cir.2009). As we have explained, \u201c[t]hose who flee persecution and seek refuge under our laws have the right to know that the evidence they present of mistreatment in their home country will be fairly considered and weighed by those who decide their fate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Accordingly, an IJ cannot \u201cbase [a] decision on only isolated snippets of [the] record while disregarding the rest.\u201d <em>Bahar-on, </em>588 F.3d at 233. Similarly, an IJ may not \u201cdistort[ ] or disregard[ ] important aspects of the alien\u2019s claim,\u201d or rule based \u201con an inaccurate perception of the record.\u201d <em>Jian Tao Lin v. Holder, </em>611 F.3d 228, 237 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor may an IJ \u201crely on speculation, conjecture, or an otherwise unsupported personal opinion to discredit an applicant\u2019s testimony or [her] corroborating evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Marynenka v. Holder, </em>592 F.3d 594, 601 (4th Cir. 2010)). Instead, \u201can IJ who rejects a witness\u2019s positive testimony ... should offer a specific, cogent reason for ... disbelief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235-36 (internal quotation marks omitted). At the same time, the obligation to provide a \u201cspecific and cogent reason\u201ddoes not \u201cimply that an IJ must provide extensive reasons for each and every item of testimony that is rejected,\u201d but rather \u201cleaves ample room for the IJ to exercise common sense in rejecting an applicant\u2019s testimony even if the IJ cannot point to contrary evidence in the record to refute it.\u201d <em>Tewabe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 540 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Our review of the IJ Decision and the BIA Order reveals a pattern of factual misapprehensions \u2014 not only of the evidence before the IJ, but also concerning the nature of Amenu\u2019s claims \u2014 as well as several instances of speculation and conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">As to the first category of errors, we identify at least six factual misapprehensions involving evidence going to the heart of Amenu\u2019s claims. Specifically, the IJ Decision inaccurately characterizes Am-enu\u2019s claims; misapprehends her testimony regarding her EPRP activities; crafts a factual finding on the basis of testimony that she never gave; omits specific corroborative factual statements in the Wolde-giorgis affidavit; relies on an inaccurate portrait of the status of Amenu\u2019s family members; and erroneously asserts that the EPRP is not significant enough to be listed in the State Department\u2019s reports about Ethiopia.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">First, the IJ misportrays Amenu\u2019s \u201cprimary argument\u201d as being that she would face persecution because of her \u201cAmhara ethnicity,\u201d and then knocks down this straw by reasoning that the EPRDF does not target individuals \u201csolely\u201d on account of their Amhara ethnicity. <em>See </em>IJ Decision 7. In fact, Amenu\u2019s avowed fear of persecution stems not from her ethnicity as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>such, but from her EPRP activities and her activities on behalf of (and family ties to prominent members of) the AAPO. Indeed, Amenu\u2019s application for relief describes her fear, reiterated in her testimony and in the Woldegiorgis affidavit, that she will face persecution \u201cbecause of her actual or imputed opposition to the EPRDF and on suspicion of membership in opposition political organizations.\u201d J.A. 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Second, the IJ misapprehends Amenu\u2019s testimony regarding her EPRP activities. Specifically, the IJ describes Amenu\u2019s \u201cadmi[ssion]\u201d that \u201cshe used to attend monthly EPRP meetings, but now goes to EPRP events only \u2018two to three times per year.\u2019 \u201d IJ Decision 5. Amenu made no such admission. Rather, she testified that, since 1995, she has consistently attended monthly EPRP <em>meetings </em>and attended an average of two to three EPRP <em>demonstrations </em>per year. The IJ thus conflated demonstrations with meetings, and his finding that Amenu vyas not sufficiently active in the EPRP to justify the EPRDF\u2019s attention is therefore faulty, as it proceeds from an inaccurate perception of Amenu\u2019s avowed level of EPRP participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Third, the IJ fashions a finding \u2014 apparently from whole cloth \u2014 that, during an interrogation following her third arrest, a Derg military leader told Amenu that they knew of her EPRDF activities. <em>See </em>IJ Decision 3, 6. From this, the IJ Decision intimates that, because the Derg regime has been overthrown and the EPRDF is now in power, Amenu has nothing to fear from the current government. Amenu, however, gave no such testimony, and there is no evidence suggesting that she has ever been involved with the EPRDF government.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Fourth, the IJ omits important aspects of the Woldegiorgis affidavit from his analysis. Those omitted portions explain Wol-degiorgis\u2019s prominence in the EPRP, her close friendship and frequent public outings with Amenu, and Woldegiorgis\u2019s belief that the EPRDF is aware of Amenu\u2019s participation in the EPRP because the EPRDF monitors the EPRP events that Amenu attends. It appears that the IJ summarily rejected those aspects of the Woldegiorgis affidavit on the sole ground that he deemed the affidavit to be a \u201cself-serving\u201d statement from someone \u201cbiased in support of a friend\u201d for which there was no \u201cother credible testimony and corroborative evidence.\u201d IJ Decision 6. The IJ was not entitled, however, to invoke such a ground for disbelieving Woldegiorgis\u2019s factual assertions, and in doing so \u201cdisregard[ed] important aspects of [Amenu\u2019s] claim[s].\u201d <em>Jian Tao Lin, </em>611 F.3d at 237. As to corroboration, we have explained that \u201c[t]here is no general rule that evidence offered in corroboration requires independent corroboration,\u201d and therefore such evidence cannot \u201cbe discredited on the ground that it <em>automatically </em>require[s] corroboration.\u201d <em>Marynenka, </em>592 F.3d at 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Nor does the IJ\u2019s blanket allegation of bias justify his discrediting of Woldegior-gis\u2019s factual assertions. We begin by observing that the IJ\u2019s description of the affidavit as \u201cself-serving\u201d is misplaced, as the affidavit was on behalf of Amenu only, and there was never an assertion that Woldegiorgis received any benefit from executing it. The IJ also erred in describing Woldegiorgis merely as Amenu\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d \u2014 she is also a prominent figure in the EPRP who has attracted additional attention from the EPRDF government because she is the daughter of Ethiopia\u2019s President. As we have explained, a letter from a party leader on behalf of a member seeking asylum can both corroborate and provide independent support for an appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>cant\u2019s claims, and the IJ is not free to \u201ccompletely ignore[ ]\u201d such evidence. <em>Ca-mara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 369-70 (4th Cir.2004). Moreover, the IJ failed to offer a \u201cspecific and cogent\u201d reason to reject Woldegiorgis\u2019s factual specifications. <em>Marynenka, </em>592 F.3d at 601. The IJ is not free to summarily reject an affiant\u2019s uncontroverted and plausible factual allegations. As we explained in <em>Tewabe, </em>an immigration case where the IJ \u201cattached the bare label \u2018implausible\u2019 to [the applicant]^ testimony without providing specific and cogent reasons for doing so,\u201d such an \u201cunexplained characterization is unsustainable because [the applicant]^ testimony is not inherently implausible.\u201d 446 F.3d at 539. Indeed, in <em>Tewabe, </em>the witness was more likely to be \u201cbiased\u201d than Woldegiorgis, as the witness there was the applicant herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Fifth, the IJ relies on an \u201cinaccurate perception\u201d of the status of Amenu\u2019s family members. <em>Jian Tao Lin, </em>611 F.3d at 237. The IJ Decision was premised in part on Amenu\u2019s perceived failure to show \u201cthat the Ethiopian government continues to target her brother or nephew\u201d for their AAPO activities. IJ Decision 8. This aspect of the IJ\u2019s reasoning is erroneous. It is also somewhat perplexing because the IJ Decision elsewhere recites Amenu\u2019s testimony that her nephew died at the hands of the EPRDF and that her brother fled from the EPRDF to the United States, where he was granted asylum. The IJ Decision also overlooks Amenu\u2019s testimony that another brother died in Kenya after fleeing the EPRDF. Clearly, the EPRDF is incapable of \u201ccontinuing] to target\u201d Am-enu\u2019s family members, and thus the IJ erred in expecting Amenu to produce evidence thereof. Moreover, the IJ Decision was issued without the benefit of our recent decision in <em>Baharon, </em>where we explained that \u201c[violence or threats to one\u2019s close relatives is an important factor\u201d in determining whether an applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution. 588 F.3d at 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Sixth, the IJ erroneously asserts that the EPRP is \u201cdecreasingly significant\u201d because it \u201cno longer merits inclusion in the State Department reports.\u201d IJ Decision 7 (citing, inter alia, the 2007 Report). Strikingly, the EPRP is listed as a \u201c[m]ajor [political organization ]\u201d in one of the very reports that the IJ Decision perceives as not mentioning the EPRP at all. J.A. 203 (the 2007 Report).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">The second category of errors in the IJ Decision is the speculation and conjecture that it utilizes to support the proposition that Amenu failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. As explained above, an IJ is not entitled to engage in speculation or conjecture, or rely on unsupported personal opinion, to discredit an applicant\u2019s evidence. <em>See Marynenka, </em>592 F.3d at 601. Three specific aspects of the IJ Decision contravene this settled principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">First, the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Amenu is unlikely to stand out as an EPRDF opponent because she has never held a leadership position in the EPRP \u2014 and engaged in only limited activities for the EPRP \u2014 is entirely speculative, and overlooks the likelihood that Amenu would stand out as an EPRDF opponent for multiple reasons. We need not look far to identify how Amenu\u2019s opposition activities could otherwise come to the EPRDF\u2019s attention \u2014 namely, her close friendship and frequent public outings with Woldegiorgis, an EPRP leader and daughter of the Ethiopian President whose uncontroverted affidavit specifies that (1) her own activities are monitored by the EPRDF and (2) the EPRDF is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>aware of Amenu\u2019s involvement with the EPRP. Indeed, Amenu expressed her personal fear of the EPRDF government on account of those associations, both in her application for relief and in her testimony. <em>See </em>J.A. 87, 348. Moreover, the State Department reports make clear that the EPRDF\u2019s suppression of contrary views is hardly limited to those at the upper echelons of opposition groups. Those reports reveal multiple human rights violations against individuals other than opposition leaders \u2014 including \u201cunlawful killings, and beating, abuse, and mistreatment of detainees and <em>opposition supporters </em>by security forces,\u201d as well as \u201carbitrary arrest and detention, particularly [of] those suspected <em>of sympathizing with </em>or <em>being members of </em>the opposition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223 (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>at 225-26, 235, 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Second, it was speculative for the IJ to assert that Amenu is not likely to face persecution because she did not participate in the EPRP or the AAPO <em>in Ethiopia. See </em>IJ Decision 7-8. Such reasoning appears to rest on the questionable premise that the EPRDF will persecute only those who have engaged in opposition activities within the geographical bounds of Ethiopia. The IJ offers no evidentiary support for this premise, and we are unwilling to accept it, especially when the IJ \u201crecognizes that the [EPRDF] has continued to attack AAPO members in Ethiopia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. Put simply, \u201cthere is nothing implausible about the idea that\u201d the EPRDF will persecute, on their return to Ethiopia, individuals who have engaged in opposition activities while abroad. <em>Camara, </em>378 F.3d at 369 (rejecting IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding because IJ\u2019s reasoning was \u201cbased only on speculation\u201d). Indeed, the IJ\u2019s premise in this regard is contradicted because, when Woldegiorgis returned to Ethiopia for the 1993 conference, the EPRDF government detained her.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Finally, the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Amenu is not likely to face persecution because the EPRP is \u201ca decreasingly significant political entity\u201d is also based on speculation and conjecture. That is, the IJ\u2019s conclusion is premised on the dubious assumption that the EPRDF will persecute individuals involved in an opposition group only so long as it perceives the group as significant. Yet the IJ offers no basis for the proposition that the EPRDF \u2014 which, he concedes, continues to contravene the cease to persecute members of an opposition group (like the EPRP) that it had previously persecuted, simply on account of the group\u2019s diminishing prominence.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Having identified errors in the IJ Decision (and, by extension, the BIA Order), we must, in deciding whether to vacate and remand, also assess whether those errors are harmless. <em>See Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 190 n. 8 (4th Cir. 2004) (explaining that harmless error analysis applies to immigration cases). Even where the agency has failed to consider all the evidence or where some of the reasons offered for its decision are invalid, we may yet affirm if \u201cthe alleged error clearly had no bearing on the ... substance of the decision reached.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). By contrast, we have remanded where, \u201c[w]ithout [its] erroneous perception of the record, it is far from clear that the [adjudicator] would have\u201d made the inferences and conclusions that it made, <em>Jian Tao Lin, </em>611 F.3d at 238; if \u201cit is not apparent from the [agency] order that it considered the crux of [the applicant\u2019s] argument,\u201d <em>Nken, </em>585 F.3d at 823; or if \u201cit is likely that the [adjudicator] would have reached a different outcome if he had given due consideration to the independent evidence that he [improperly] dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>counted,\u201d <em>Anim v. Mukasey, </em>535 F.3d 243, 261 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">In these circumstances, we are unable to say that the IJ and the BIA would reach the same decision again, if they properly assess the evidence and refrain from speculation and conjecture. To begin with, the IJ\u2019s speculative assumptions taint his reasoning, and removing even one of these pillars could well result in a different outcome. We are just as skeptical that the IJ\u2019s misapprehensions of fact were harmless. To begin with, the prejudice to Am-enu is self-evident, in that the IJ expressly relies on his erroneous perceptions of three crucial facts: Amenu\u2019s avowed level of EPRP activities; the \u201cdecreasing! ] significance]\u201d of the EPRP; and the absence of ongoing persecution against Amenu\u2019s family members. <em>See </em>IJ Decision 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">We are also convinced that the IJ\u2019s treatment of the Woldegiorgis affidavit was prejudicial. <em>Cf. Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 542 n. 2 (4th Cir.1999) (finding agency\u2019s failure to consider affidavit from applicant\u2019s spouse to be harmless, where most of affidavit related to issue upon which applicant prevailed in agency proceedings and balance of affidavit did not undermine BIA\u2019s reasoning). The IJ\u2019s failure to fully assess Woldegiorgis\u2019s uncontroverted factual statements prejudiced Amenu in at least two respects. First, such failure caused the IJ to overlook how those corroborative facts lend credence to Amenu\u2019s claim that the EPRDF is aware of her EPRP activities because of her association with Woldegior-gis and participation in monitored demonstrations. Second, such failure resulted in the IJ overlooking the possibility that the EPRDF might become aware of and persecute Amenu, not only because of her level of EPRP activities, but also because of her -visible association with a prominent opposition figure whose social and political activities the EPRDF monitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we grant Am-enu\u2019s petition for review, vacate the BIA Order, and remand for such other and further proceedings as may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">\n<em>PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-12\">.
