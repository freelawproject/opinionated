She entered her guilty plea pursuant to a written plea agreement that contained an appeal waiver. Her counsel moves to withdraw, and has filed a brief under <em>An-ders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), acknowledging the appeal waiver, but arguing that a defendant should be permitted to seek appellate review of the judgment and imposition of sentence by the district court notwithstanding an appeal waiver. Richter seeks appointment of new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-23\">We conclude that this appeal is barred by the appeal waiver. The appeal falls within the scope of the waiver; the record establishes that Richter knowingly and voluntarily entered into both the plea agreement and the appeal waiver; and enforcing the waiver would not result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-92 (8th Cir. 2003) (en banc) (setting forth criteria for enforcing appeal waiver). We have also reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and we have found no non-frivolous issue for appeal beyond the scope of the appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-24\">Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we deny Richter\u2019s motion for new counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-21\">. The Honorable Ralph R. Erickson, United States District Judge for the District of North Dakota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
