MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">In this employment discrimination case, Glory Johnson-Stanton appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s order granting Management and Training Corporation\u2019s (MTC\u2019s) motion for summary judgment. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">Ms. Johnson-Stanton worked for MTC for twenty-eight years, until \u201cher GED/ ESL Senior Instruction position was eliminated effective May 31, 2007[,] as part of a reduction in force action.\u201d R. at 17. She retained counsel and sued MTC in April 2009, alleging that she had been terminated in violation of Title VII because of her \u201crace (African American) and national origin (African American).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">MTC sought summary judgment, arguing that Ms. Johnson-Stanton\u2019s claims were either time-barred or failed on the merits. After obtaining two extensions of time to file an opposition, Ms. Johnson-Stanton\u2019s attorney joined with MTC in a \u201cStipulation to Submit MTC\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment for Decision Without Opposition from Plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474. Specifically, the stipulation provided that Ms. Johnson-Stanton had \u201cchosen not to oppose MTC\u2019s Motion or to oppose the entry of any of the relief sought in MTC\u2019s Motion based on the record supporting MTC\u2019s Motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">The district court granted MTC summary judgment, and</p>\n<p id=\"b776-14\">Ms. Johnson-Stanton appealed pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-15\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b776-16\">\u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Fredericks v. Jonsson, </em>609 F.3d 1096, 1098 (10th Cir. 2010). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>McCarty v. Gilchrist, </em>646 F.3d 1281, 1284-85 (10th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-17\">Ms. Johnson-Stanton does not assert that summary judgment is unsupported by the facts or law. Instead, she argues that her attorney was \u201cincompeten[t]\u201d and failed \u201cto properly represent [her] in the case against MTC.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 7, 8. She states that she terminated her attorney after he and MTC filed the stipulation, and that after the district court entered summary judgment, she notified the court \u201cconcerning the behavior of [her] attorney,\u201d but was told to contact the Utah State Bar. <em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-18\">Ms. Johnson-Stanton presents a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. \u201cThe general rule in civil cases is that the ineffective assistance of counsel is not a basis for appeal or retrial.\u201d <em>Nelson v. Boeing Co., </em>446 F.3d 1118, 1119 (10th Cir.2006); <em>cf. id. </em>at 1120 (recognizing that \u201cthe only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>context in which courts have recognized a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in civil litigation is in immigration cases\u201d). \u201cIf a client\u2019s chosen counsel performs below professionally acceptable standards, with adverse effects on the client\u2019s case, the client\u2019s remedy is not reversal, but rather a legal malpractice lawsuit against the deficient attorney.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 1119.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b776-11\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-17\">. We express no opinion on the representation of Ms. Johnson-Stanton\u2019s counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
