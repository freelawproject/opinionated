In light of the City\u2019s September 2010 amendment to the Hollywood Signage Supplemental Use District (\u201cHollywood SUD\u201d) prohibiting new super-graphic signs, <em>see </em>Los Angeles City Ordinance No. 181340, at \u00a7 5(B)(11), and thus eliminating both the Hollywood SUD sign reduction program, <em>see </em>Los Angeles City Ordinance No. 176172, at \u00a7 9, and the City\u2019s prior delegation of authority to the Community Redevelopment Agency to negotiate exceptions to that program in exchange for fees, <em>see id., </em>we dismiss this appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">The statutory change renders Paramount\u2019s claims for declaratory and injunctive relief moot. <em>See Outdoor Media Group, Inc. v. City of Beaumont, </em>506 F.3d 895, 900-01 (9th Cir.2007). This is not the \u201crare\u201d situation \u201cwhere it is virtually certain that the repealed law would be reenacted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 901 (quoting <em>Native Vill. of Noatak v. Blatchford, </em>38 F.3d 1505, 1510 (9th Cir.1994)). The only exceptions to the wholesale supergraphic ban in the amended Hollywood SUD are for projects with vested rights under California law and grandfathered projects that were approved on or before November 12, 2008. <em>See </em>Los Angeles City Ordinance No. 181340, at \u00a7 6(K). Even if the City improperly denied Paramount supergraphic permits, however, Paramount \u201clacked a vested property right in its unapproved billboard permit application.\u201d <em>See Outdoor Media Group, </em>506 F.3d at 903. That Paramount has raised similar claims in another lawsuit is irrelevant to whether this appeal is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-14\">Paramount\u2019s claim for damages does not present a live controversy, because Paramount, for strategic reasons, disavowed damages before the district court. <em>See </em>June 6, 2008 District Court Order at 11; <em>see also Seven Words LLC v. Network Solutions, </em>260 F.3d 1089, 1096 (9th Cir.2001). Paramount here asserts that it only disavowed claims for past damages, and that it remains entitled to seek damages incurred between the district court\u2019s order on June 6, 2008 and the City\u2019s amendment of the Hollywood SUD on September 28, 2010. The record belies Paramount\u2019s assertion that it limited its disavowal to \u201cpast\u201d damages. On April 28, 2008, Paramount filed its Statement of Genuine Issues, which deemed \u201cuncontroverted\u201d the City\u2019s representation that \u201cParamount has acknowledged that it is not seeking damages in this action.\u201d In any event, Paramount is not able to demonstrate that any alleged damages it incurred after the district court\u2019s order resulted from application of the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>the Hollywood SUD challenged in the complaint. Moreover, the City confirmed at oral argument that its post-judgment enforcement actions are based on the versions of Los Angeles Municipal Code \u00a7\u00a7 14.4.4(B)(9) and 14.4.4(B)(11) amended as of August 14, 2009, and that is has not, and will not, seek damages on the basis of the provisions eliminated as a result of the September 2010 amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Paramount\u2019s interest, if any, in attorney\u2019s fees is \u201cinsufficient to create an Article III case or controversy where none exists on the merits of the underlying claim.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., </em>494 U.S. 472, 480, 110 S.Ct. 1249, 108 L.Ed.2d 400 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Paramount\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b685-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
