For essentially the same reasons assigned by the Tax Court, we AFFIRM the Tax Court\u2019s March 20, 2007 Order dismissing, for lack of jurisdiction, the claims of the Anderson Revocable Living Trust, and of Randall K. Whited and Dennis L. Whited, in their individual capacities; and we AFFIRM the Tax Court\u2019s September 2, 2009, Order and Decision granting summary judgment for the Commissioner assessing a tax deficiency and late filing penalty against the Estate of Deane Anderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-16\">During her lifetime, Deane Anderson established the Anderson Revocable Living Trust (\u201cthe Trust\u201d), and named Randall K. Whited and Dennis L. Whited as beneficiaries of the Trust. When Anderson died, Randall and Dennis became trustees of the Trust, and all of Anderson\u2019s property was transferred to the Trust. Anderson\u2019s will named Randall as the executor of her estate (\u201cthe Estate\u201d). Nine months after Anderson\u2019s death on December 30, 2001, the Estate\u2019s taxes and tax return were due. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6075(a), 6151(a). Accordingly, on September 30, 2002, Randall, as executor of the Estate, paid the IRS $20,000, anticipating that the Estate would owe taxes, and requested an extension of time to file the Estate\u2019s tax return. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 6081(a); 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.6081-l(a). The parties agree that the IRS automatically granted a six-month extension for the Estate to file its return, which allowed the Estate until to March 30, 2003, to file its return. <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.6081-l(b). The Estate contends that the IRS later granted it a second extension to file its return but then revoked that extension while still allowing the Estate until September 30, 2003, to pay its taxes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>The Commissioner acknowledges that the Estate requested a second extension of time to file its return; however, the Commissioner contends that the IRS treated that request as a request only for an extension of time to pay its taxes, and that it granted only an extension of the time to pay until September 30, 2003. The parties agree that the Estate later filed its tax return and submitted another payment of $1,000 in anticipation of taxes that the Estate owed. The Estate contends that it filed its return on September 29, 2003, while the Commissioner contends that the Estate\u2019s return was filed on October 6, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Along with its return, the Estate submitted a letter requesting the IRS to calculate its tax liability, which is permitted by statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based on the information that the Estate submitted with its return, the IRS calculated the Estate\u2019s tax liability as $5,673.02, and in late 2003, issued the Estate a refund of $15,411.62, based on the $21,000 in payments that the Estate had already made plus $114.64 in interest. The IRS later audited the Estate\u2019s return and made several adjustments, which included rejecting a deduction for a \u201cnet loss during administration\u201d of the Estate, from a $90,000 loss on a commodities trade, to which the IRS concluded that the Estate was not entitled.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These adjustments resulted in a net increase in the taxable estate. Accordingly, on June 2, 2006, the IRS issued a Notice of Deficiency, indicating that the Estate owed $52,946 in taxes plus a late-filing penalty of $9,655. The IRS sent copies of the Notice of Deficiency separately to Randall and to Dennis.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">The Estate, represented by Randall as the executor; the Trust, represented by Randall as trustee; and both of the Whit-eds, in their individual capacities, petitioned the Tax Court for a redetermination of the Estate\u2019s tax deficiency and late-filing penalty. They did not explicitly contend that the adjustments made in the deficiency assessment were incorrect, but instead they made a number of arguments about why the Notice was improper and why the IRS was estopped from pursuing the alleged deficiency. The Tax Court granted the IRS\u2019 motion to dismiss the cases brought by the Trust and the Whit-eds individually because the court determined that \u201c[it] ha[d] no jurisdiction over th[e] Trust, or those individuals, [the Whit-eds,] in their individual capacities in this case.\u201d After some discovery, the IRS moved for summary judgment and the Estate filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The Tax Court granted the IRS\u2019 motion, denied the Estate\u2019s cross-motion, and adjudged a deficiency in the Estate\u2019s taxes of $52,946; the court also assessed a late-filing penalty of $9,655 against the Estate. The Estate, the Trust, and the Whiteds timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\u201cThis Court has jurisdiction to review final decisions of the Tax Court under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1),\u201d and \u201capplies the same standard of review to decisions of the Tax Court that it applies to district court decisions. Findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and issues of law are reviewed de novo. Clear error exists when this [C]ourt is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>Terrell v. Comm\u2019r, </em>625 F.3d 254, 258 (5th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citations omitted) (quoting <em>Green v. Comm\u2019r, </em>507 F.3d 857, 866 (5th Cir.2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The Tax Court dismissed the Trust and the Whiteds from the case, leaving the Estate, represented by Randall Whited as the executor, as the sole petitioner. The Tax Court determined that it had no jurisdiction over the Trust or the Whiteds in their individual capacities because no notice of tax deficiency or liability had been issued to them. \u201cThe Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction is a question of law that we review de novo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 259 (citing <em>Ferguson v. Comm\u2019r, </em>568 F.3d 498, 502 (5th Cir.2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">\u201cThe Tax Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, and its jurisdiction can be exercised only to the extent authorized by Congress.\u201d 17 Charles Alan Wright et al., <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 4102, 382-84 (3d ed.2007) (citing <em>Estate of Bran-son v. Comm\u2019r, </em>264 F.3d 904, 908 (9th Cir.2001)). \u201cIn deficiency cases,\u201d such as this, \u201cthe Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to petitions filed by the party named in the notice of deficiency.\u201d <em>L.V. Castle Inv. Group, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>465 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2006) (citing 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6213(a); <em>Hempel v. United States, </em>14 F.3d 572, 573 n. 3 (11th Cir.1994)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, the Notice of Deficiency was addressed to \u201cEstate of Deane Anderson, Randall K. Whited, Co-Executor\u201d and to \u201cEstate of Deane Anderson, Dennis L. Whited, Co-Executor.\u201d The record does not include a notice of deficiency nor of liability issued to the Anderson Revocable Living Trust, nor to Randall K. Whited or Dennis L. Whited, in their individual capacities. Accordingly, they were not proper petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>ers, and the Tax Court did not err in dismissing them for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Estate of Smith v. Comm\u2019r, </em>77 T.C. 326, 329, 1981 WL 11283 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The Appellants concede that the Estate does not have a claim of equitable recoupment against its tax deficiency for its deduction for a $90,000 net loss from a commodities trade during the administration of the Estate. Instead, they argue obversely that because the Estate cannot claim equitable recoupment as a defense against its own tax deficiency, the Tax Court perforce must have jurisdiction over the Trust\u2019s claim for an equitable recoupment defense against the Trust\u2019s tax liability. The Appellants simply misunderstand not only the nature of the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction, which we have already explained, but also the doctrine of equitable recoupment. The jurisdiction of the Tax Court over a party in such a case as this, as defined by Congress, must commence by the issuance of a tax deficiency to that party. In order for the Tax Court to recognize an equitable recoupment defense for a party, it must first have jurisdiction of that party. Thus, the application of the doctrine of equitable recoupment by the Tax Court for a party depends upon the court having jurisdiction over that party, not the other way around; the court\u2019s jurisdiction is defined by statute, not by equitable doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u201cThe doctrine of equitable recoupment is a judicially created doctrine that ... operates as a defense that may be asserted by a taxpayer to reduce the Commissioner\u2019s timely claim of a deficiency....\u201d <em>Menard, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>130 T.C. 54, 62, 2008 WL 441046 (2008) (citing <em>United States v. Dalm, </em>494 U.S. 596, 605, 110 S.Ct. 1361, 108 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990); <em>Bull v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 247, 262, 55 S.Ct. 695, 79 L.Ed. 1421 (1935); <em>O\u2019Brien v. United States, </em>766 F.2d 1038, 1049 (7th Cir.1985); <em>Estate of Mueller v. Comm\u2019r, </em>101 T.C. 551, 552, 1993 WL 516196 (1993); <em>Estate of Orenstein v. Comm\u2019r, </em>T.C. Memo.2000-150 (2000)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cThe doctrine prevents an inequitable windfall to ... the Government that would otherwise result from the inconsistent tax treatment of a single transaction, item, or event affecting the same taxpayer or a sufficiently related taxpayer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Dalm, </em>494 U.S. at 605-06, 110 S.Ct. 1361; <em>Mueller, </em>101 T.C. at 552). \u201cWhen applied for the benefit of a taxpayer, the equitable recoupment doctrine allows a taxpayer to recoup the amount of a time-barred tax overpayment by allowing the overpayment to be applied as an offset against a deficiency if certain requirements are met.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Bull, </em>295 U.S. at 262, 55 S.Ct. 695; <em>Crop Assocs.-1986 v. Comm\u2019r, </em>113 T.C. 198, 200, 1999 WL 713650 (1999)). \u201cIn order to establish that equitable recoupment applies, a party must prove the following elements: (1) The overpayment ... for which recoupment is sought by way of offset is barred by an expired period of limitation; (2) the time-barred overpayment ... arose out of the same transaction, item, or taxable event as the overpayment or deficiency before the Court; (3) the transaction, item, or taxable event has been inconsistently subjected to two taxes; and (4) if the transaction, item, or taxable event involves two or more taxpayers, there is sufficient identity of interest between the taxpayers subject to the two taxes that the taxpayers should be treated as one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62-63 (citing, <em>inter alia, Dalm, </em>494 U.S. at 604-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>05, 110 S.Ct. 1361); <em>see also Estate of Branson v. Comm\u2019r, </em>264 F.3d 904, 909-10, 915 &amp; n. 7 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The Appellants\u2019 contend that in order to avoid double taxation on the same transaction, under the theory of equitable recoupment, the Trust should be allowed to file a new amended tax return to claim a deduction for the loss on the commodities trade and receive a refund for its overpaid taxes. However, their argument is based on their failure to understand the limited jurisdiction of the Tax Court in this case. The Tax Court had jurisdiction over the Estate and not the Trust. Therefore, to assert a defense of equitable recoupment in this case, it was the Estate \u2014 against which the Commissioner is asserting a tax deficiency \u2014 that would have had to allege and prove that defense to its own assessed tax deficiency. <em>See Menard, </em>130 T.C. at 62 (\u201cThe doctrine of equitable recoupment ... operates as a defense that may be asserted by a taxpayer to reduce the Commissioner\u2019s timely claim of a deficiency.\u201d). We are aware of no authority, and the Appellants cite none, that demonstrates that the Tax Court had jurisdiction over the Trust or the Whiteds in them individual capacities. Therefore, the Tax Court could not and did not exercise its jurisdiction to decide whether the Trust or the individuals not before the court theoretically were entitled to invoke an equitable recoupment defense against their own tax liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">After reviewing the record, studying the briefs, and hearing oral argument we affirm the judgment of the Tax Court, essentially for the same reasons given in the Tax Court\u2019s September 2, 2009, Order and Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the Tax Court\u2019s March 20, 2007, Order, and the Tax Court\u2019s September 2, 2009, Order and Decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
