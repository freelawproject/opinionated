We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-19\">Lee sued various prison officials contending that their treatment and housing of her led to her infection with MRSA. She requested appointment of counsel; the district court denied the request and her motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-20\">Appellees moved to dismiss this appeal as frivolous after Lee filed her brief on the merits; Lee filed a response to the motion. We determine that it is unnecessary to decide the motion because Lee\u2019s brief does not demonstrate that the district court\u2019s conclusion that she was not entitled to counsel is in error. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order and DENY AS MOOT the Appellees\u2019 Motion to Dismiss and for Extension of Time to file Appellee\u2019s Brief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b421-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
