The dismissal was based on his failure to comply with an order to pay an initial partial filing fee within a specified time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-20\">Upon careful review, <em>see Boyle v. Am. Auto. Serv., Inc., </em>571 F.3d 734, 742 (8th Cir.2009) (standard of review), we conclude that the dismissal of Mr. Bailey\u2019s action was an abuse of discretion because \u2014 based on his certified inmate account statements and his assertions in the district court \u2014 it appears that his failure to make an initial partial payment on time was due to a lack of available funds. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(1) (stating that court shall collect initial partial filing fee \u201cwhen funds exist\u201d), (b)(4) (providing that prisoner shall not be prohibited from bringing civil action because he lacks assets and means to pay initial partial filing fee); <em>Taylor v. Delatoore, </em>281 F.3d 844, 850 (9th Cir.2002) (for prisoners whose prior account balances resulted in assessment of initial fee, but who do not have funds available when payment is ordered, \u00a7 1915(b)(4) should protect them from having their cases dismissed for non-payment); <em>cf. Glass v. Scottrade, </em>354 Fed.Appx. 276, 276 (8th Cir.2009) (unpublished per curiam) (district court abused its discretion in denying plaintiffs motion to reopen her case, where court had dismissed under Rule 41(b) for failure to pay partial filing fee within 30 days, and plaintiff explained in motion to reopen that she acted promptly to attempt to comply with court\u2019s order and that payment was late for reasons beyond her control).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s Rule 41(b) dismissal, and we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-16\">. We note, however, that the district court's decision to sever Mr. Bailey\u2019s initial complaint into three separate actions \u2014 thus obligating him to pay three separate filing fees\u2014 appears to have been warranted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
