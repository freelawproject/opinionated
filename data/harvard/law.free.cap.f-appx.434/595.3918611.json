St. Eve, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b618-11\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>****</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">Petitioner Ollince Toussaint, a native and citizen of Haiti, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from an Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review credibility findings for substantial evidence, <em>Liu v. Holder, </em>640 F.3d 918, 924-25 (9th Cir.2011), we review <em>de novo </em>claims of due process violations, <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000), and we review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to remand, <em>Lin v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 981, 984 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-17\">Petitioner claims that the IJ\u2019s conduct during the asylum hearing violated his due process rights. Petitioner has failed, however, to demonstrate that \u201cthe proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that [he] was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.\u201d <em>Colmenar, </em>210 F.3d at 971 (internal quotation marks omitted). To the contrary, petitioner was given an opportunity \u201cto be represented by counsel, prepare an application for ... relief, and ... present testimony and other evidence in support of the application.\u201d <em>Zetino v. Holder, </em>622 F.3d 1007, 1013 (9th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Vargas-Hernandez v. Gonzales, </em>497 F.3d 919, 926-27 (9th Cir.2007) (ellipses in original and internal quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, petitioner\u2019s due process claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-18\">In addition, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See Liu, </em>640 F.3d at 924-25. As petitioner concedes, the statements he made in his asylum application, his asylum interview, and his removal hearing contained discrepancies, inconsistencies, and omissions regarding his alleged experience of political persecution. Petitioner\u2019s testimony regarding events that preceded (and precipitated) his departure relate directly to the basis of his asylum claim. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001) (explaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>that an IJ may base his credibility finding on discrepancies and inconsistencies that relate to the basis for the alien\u2019s alleged fear of persecution and relate to the heart of the asylum claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Finally, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen where he failed to show prima facie eligibility for the relief sought. <em>Romero-Ruiz v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 1057, 1063-64 (9th Cir.2008). Nor did petitioner establish that the \u201cevidence sought to be offered [wa]s material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d <em>Rodriguez v. INS, </em>841 F.2d 865, 867 (9th Cir.1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"****\">\n<p id=\"b618-19\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
