Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit concerning the issuance and execution of a parole revocation warrant. He argues that the parole warrant was illegally issued, that part of his confinement pursuant to the warrant was unlawful, and that his claims are not barred by <em>Heck. See </em>Tex. Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 508.281 (requiring a revocation hearing to occur before 41 days after arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-20\">Almendarez\u2019s suit is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. \u201c[T]o recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for harms caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal author- ' ized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To the extent that Almendarez\u2019s parole was revoked as a result of the warrant, the holding in <em>Heck </em>is applicable to claims attacking the validity of the parole proceedings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>See McGrew v. Tex. Bd. of Pardons &amp; Paroles, </em>47 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir.1995). Regardless, as the district court noted, because Almendarez has been granted credit toward his sentence for his convictions for indecency with a child and sexual assault, any ruling by the district court calling into question the validity of the parole warrant and his incarceration pursuant to the warrant would necessarily imply the invalidity of his current sentence. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Additionally, as for Almenda-rez\u2019s claim that Tex. Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 508.254 violates the Constitution, where an issue raised on appeal has not been advanced in the district court, it is not properly before the court of appeals. <em>Williams v. Ballard, </em>466 F.3d 330, 335 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Consequently, the district court\u2019s order dismissing Almendarez\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b419-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
