On appeal, he challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-24\">A district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Giberson, </em>527 F.3d 882, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>886 (9th Cir.2008). A court\u2019s conclusions regarding the particularity and breadth of a search warrant are also reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Brobst, </em>558 F.3d 982, 991 (9th Cir.2009). Factual findings supporting a suppression ruling are reviewed for clear error. <em>Giberson, </em>527 F.3d at 886. \u201cA magistrate judge\u2019s finding of probable cause is entitled to great deference and this court will not find a search warrant invalid if the magistrate judge had a \u2018substantial basis\u2019 for concluding that the supporting affidavit established probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Crews, </em>502 F.3d 1130, 1135 (9th Cir.2007) (internal quotations omitted). A court\u2019s determination of whether reasonable suspicion existed to justify an investigatory stop is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>581 F.3d 994, 998 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The facts presented to the issuing judge established probable cause to believe that a search of Rios\u2019s home would uncover evidence that Rios had committed the crime of Identity Theft under Washington law, based on the underlying predicate crimes of Obstruction of Justice and/or Making a False Statement to a Public Servant. <em>See </em>Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 9.35.020, 9A.76.020, 9A.76.175; <em>State v. Presba, </em>131 Wash.App. 47, 126 P.3d 1280, 1284 (2005). Rios argues that there was no probable cause to search his house and car because the officer\u2019s telephonic affidavit did not identify the specific crime(s) underlying the suspected offense of identity theft. However, there is no requirement that an affidavit or search warrant explicitly identify the suspected offense. <em>See United States v. Hill, </em>55 F.3d 479, 481 (9th Cir. 1995); <em>United States v. Koyomejian, </em>970 F.2d 536, 548 (9th Cir.1992) (Kozinski, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The search warrants allowed the search and seizure of \u201crecords, identification paperwork, or anything in the identification \u2014 the name of Jose Rios-Jose Para Junior, or others.\u201d This phrase meets the requisite level of particularity because it enables the officers to determine what they may seize. <em>See United States v. SDI Future Health, </em>568 F.3d 684, 702 (9th Cir.2009). Even assuming that the \u201cor others\u201d language is overbroad, these words are a relatively insignificant portion of the warrant, and they may be severed from the rest of the warrant language without requiring the suppression of any evidence relevant to Rios\u2019s conviction. <em>See id. </em>at 706-07; <em>United States v. Sears, </em>411 F.3d 1124, 1129-31 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Finally, Rios waived his challenge to the initial stop by not raising it in the district court and not preserving it for appeal in his guilty plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Bynum, </em>362 F.3d 574, 583 (9th Cir.2004). Even if we were to consider Rios\u2019s challenge on the merits, we would find that the initial stop of Rios\u2019s car was supported by reasonable suspicion. By the time that Rios\u2019s car was pulled over, the officers had reason to believe that (a) Rios was wanted on two outstanding felony warrants; (b) Rios lived at the home at which the officers first saw the car; (c) Rios had connections to the business that issued the car\u2019s temporary license plate; and (d) the physical appearance of the car\u2019s driver matched Rios\u2019s description. This was enough to support reasonable suspicion to stop Rios\u2019s car. <em>See Johnson, </em>581 F.3d at 999 (2009) (\u201cReasonable suspicion is formed by specific, articulable facts which, together with objective and reasonable inferences, form the basis for suspecting that the particular person detained is engaged in criminal activity.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b671-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
