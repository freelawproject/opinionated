Blank argues that the District Court erred in concluding that: (1) his federal claims against the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and several of its employees were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); and (2) Main Line Animal Rescue (\u201cMLAR\u201d) and its CEO and president William Smith were not acting under the color of state law. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">II. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">We write only for the parties and assume their familiarity with the factual and procedural history of this case, which is set forth in the District Court\u2019s opinion. <em>See Blank v. Pa. Soc\u2019y for the Prev. of Cruelty to Anim., et al., </em>No. 10-3222, 2010 WL 3927590, at * 1 (E.D.Pa. Oct. 5, 2010). We have little to add to the District Court\u2019s reasoning, as explained in Judge Bartle\u2019s opinion, for granting the motion to dismiss as to the same issues raised on appeal. Thus we will limit our discussion to one aspect of the District Court\u2019s opinion and otherwise affirm for substantially the same reasons expressed therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">Although we agree with the District Court that Blank\u2019s federal claims constitute an impermissible collateral attack on his convictions, <em>see Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, we part ways with the District Court on one particular point. The District Court concluded that the \u201cCommonwealth\u2019s entire case hinged on the evidence of animal cruelty obtained through the July 17, 2008 raid.\u201d <em>Blank, </em>2010 WL 3927590, at * 3. Because several Defendants visited Blank\u2019s kennel prior to the July 17, 2008 raid and witnessed poor living conditions and animal injuries, we cannot say with confidence that his convictions were based exclusively on evidence obtained from the purportedly illegal search and seizure that took place on July 17, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">Nonetheless, we think Blank\u2019s federal claims are barred by <em>Heck </em>because they are premised on the theory that this additional evidence was \u201cconcoct[ed],\u201d \u201cdistorted,\u201d and \u201cmisrepresented\u201d as part of a broad conspiracy to conduct an illegal search and seizure and deprive Blank of his constitutional rights. (App. at 28-30.) Elsewhere in his complaint, Blank contends that the conduct of several Defendants resulted in \u201cthe continued filing and prosecution of charges and cases that should never have been filed and prosecuted.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 42.) In sum, Blank\u2019s federal claims are contingent on the proposition that genuine evidence of the crimes to which he pled guilty did not exist and that no investigation or charges would have been brought against him but for a deliberate conspiracy carried out by the Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>dants. Accordingly, Blank\u2019s claims are irreconcilable with his guilty plea, and if successful, they would necessarily imply the invalidity of his convictions. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Thus, while we differ with the District Court regarding the significance of the July 17, 2008 raid, we agree with the District Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Blank\u2019s federal claims are barred by <em>Heck.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order of the District Court granting the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-10\">. The District Court had jurisdiction over Blank's \u00a7 1983 action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1343(a)(3)-(4), and 1367. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court's decision to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>Mayer v. Belichick, </em>605 F.3d 223, 229 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
