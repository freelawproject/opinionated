The BIA affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cU\u201d) denial of Wu\u2019s claims related to political persecution based on a finding of adverse credibility. The BIA also affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of Wu\u2019s claims related to religious persecution, because Wu\u2019s credibility was already in doubt and she failed to provide corroborating evidence of her Christian faith. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8' U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), and we grant Wu\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">We review adverse credibility determinations for substantial evidence. <em>Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002) (citation omitted). Under this standard, the BIA\u2019s determinations are to be upheld if they are supported by \u201creasonable, substantial and probative evidence\u201d in the record, <em>Kumar v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 1043, 1049 (9th Cir.2006) (citations omitted), but \u201c[m]inor inconsistencies in the record that do not relate to the basis of an applicant\u2019s alleged fear of persecution, go to the heart of the asylum claim, or reveal anything about an asylum applicant\u2019s fear for his safety are insufficient to support an adverse credibility finding,\u201d <em>Mendoza Man-imbao v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 655, 660 (9th Cir.2003) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When, as here, the BIA does not express disagreement with any portion of the IJ\u2019s decision, cites <em>Matter of Burbano, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994), and adds its own review of the evidence and the law, we review both the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s decisions. <em>See Joseph v. Holder, </em>600 F.3d 1235, 1239-40 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">In this case, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is based on supposed inconsistencies between Wu\u2019s written application and testimony related to (1) when an intra-uterine device (\u201cIUD\u201d) was forcibly implanted in her body surrounding two forced abortions<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) the date petitioner was arrested by Chinese authorities during a family church meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">The IJ\u2019s first finding is simply incorrect. Wu\u2019s written application indicated that she was forced to have her first abortion and have an IUD implanted in 1985. After that time, the IUD caused various health problems, so it was eventually taken out. Wu got pregnant again in 1994, when she was forced to have her second abortion and pay a fine. When the government attorney cross-examined Wu before the IJ, she was asked if the IUD was implanted on the same day as her first abortion. Speaking through a translator, Wu responded that the IUD was implanted \u201cimmediately\u201d after the first abortion. Upon further questioning, Wu clarified that the IUD was implanted the \u201csecond time,\u201d after she \u201cwent back to the hospital.\u201d On the day of the first abortion, Wu testified that \u201c[she] could not take it. It was so painful [she] could not have the IUD.\u201d After she developed health problems, the IUD was removed and Wu got pregnant again.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>The only plausible interpretation of Wu\u2019s testimony is that it was consistent with her written statement. When asked to clarify what she meant by the word \u201cimmediately,\u201d Wu said that she went back to the hospital for a second visit for the implantation of the IUD. Because of health problems related to the IUD, it was later removed, and she subsequently got pregnant again. The chronology of Wu\u2019s story \u2014 from the first forced abortion to the implantation and removal of the IUD to the second abortion \u2014 remained the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The IJ\u2019s strained interpretation of Wu\u2019s testimony is based entirely on ambiguity in the word \u201cimmediately,\u201d but Wu\u2019s meaning was made clear by her subsequent testimony. It was too painful for her to receive the IUD on the same day as the first abortion, so she went back to the hospital a \u201csecond time\u201d for that procedure. As Wu testified, \u201cAfter the IUD was placed, it was later removed. Afterwards I was pregnant.\u201d In other words, for the IJ to think that \u201cimmediately\u201d meant \u201cthe same day\u201d and \u201csecond time\u201d meant \u201csecond abortion,\u201d she had to ignore the rest of Wu\u2019s testimony. Wu never said that she received an IUD after the second forced abortion, which took place almost a decade after the first. Basing an adverse credibility determination on an applicant\u2019s fine-grained word usage is particularly inappropriate in cases, such as this, where there is an obvious language barrier. <em>Mendoza Manimbao, </em>329 F.3d at 662 (citations omitted). Wu\u2019s preferred language is Mandarin Chinese, and she used a translator throughout the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Even if the IJ were correct that there was an inconsistency in Wu\u2019s testimony, the IJ was obligated to consider and address Wu\u2019s explanation for that discrepancy. <em>Soto-Olarte v. Holder, </em>555 F.3d 1089, 1091 (9th Cir.2009). The \u201clack of consideration given to [Wu\u2019s] proffered explanation was error and prevents the underlying inconsistency from serving as substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Instead of addressing Wu\u2019s explanation for why she did not receive the IUD on the same day as the first abortion, the IJ once again ignored Wu\u2019s testimony. The IJ\u2019s oral decision said that \u201c[a]n invasive abortion[] obviously causes the fetus to be aborted and brought out, thinning of the uterus wall lining, traumatic body treatment, the lining of the uterus, thin and raw, how an IUD would be placed in a person\u2019s body \u2018immediately\u2019 after is of question.\u201d This is precisely the explanation that Wu offered. The IJ cannot simply ignore that explanation and then use it to undermine Wu\u2019s credibility. The IJ\u2019s finding is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The same is true of the only other basis for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which has to do with the date petitioner was arrested by Chinese authorities during a family church meeting. Petitioner\u2019s written statement attached to her asylum application indicated that her arrest took place on April 27, 2003, but she testified that the arrest happened on April 27, 2002. We have made it clear that minor inconsistencies in the record cannot support an adverse credibility finding. A simple mistake of one year, especially where the date is correct as to day and month, is the very definition of a minor inconsistency. <em>See Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1166 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">Because neither of the IJ\u2019s findings in support of his adverse credibility determination constitutes substantial evidence, we grant the petition and remand to the agency to consider whether Wu, now considered credible, has established eligibility for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">On remand, the BIA should take note of the fact that the IJ should not have demanded corroborating evidence regarding Wu\u2019s religious faith. See <em>Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1227 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201c[W]here allegations are otherwise unrefuted and credible, the IJ may not require corroboration of claims.\u201d) (citing <em>Ladha v. INS, </em>215 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Petition for review GRANTED; REMANDED to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b615-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
