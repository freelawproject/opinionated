Johnson contends that the California state court violated the Sixth Amendment by imposing an upper-term sentence based on the aggravating factors of the increasing seriousness of his prior convictions and unsatisfactory performance on parole. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) and \u00a7 2253 and we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-15\">On July 22, 2005, a jury in California Superior Court, San Mateo County, found Johnson guilty of unlawful vehicle taking, possession of a firearm by a felon, possession of ammunition by a felon, possession of drug paraphernalia, and receiving stolen property. Before the trial, Johnson stipulated to having been previously convicted of a felony for robbery in 1998. On September 30, 2005, Johnson was sentenced to the upper-term of three years for the possession of a firearm by a felon, which was then enhanced to six years because the judge found that he had violated parole numerous times and that his prior convictions were of increasing seriousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-16\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of a petition for writ of habe-as corpus. <em>Lopez v. Thompson, </em>202 F.3d 1110, 1116 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc). Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), \u201c[federal habeas relief may not be granted for claims subject to \u00a7 2254(d) unless it is shown that the earlier state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to\u2019 federal law then clearly established in the holdings of [the Supreme] Court; or that it \u2018involved an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>unreasonable application of such law; or that it \u2018was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts\u2019 in light of the record before the state court.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 785, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254) (citations omitted). \u201cWe review the state court\u2019s last reasoned decision.\u201d <em>Maxwell v. Roe, </em>628 F.3d 486, 495 (9th Cir.2010). In denying Johnson\u2019s appeal, the California Court of Appeal relied on the reasoning of the California Supreme Court in <em>People v. Black, </em>41 Cal.4th 799, 62 Cal.Rptr.3d 569, 161 P.3d 1130 (Cal. 2007) <em>(\u201cBlack II </em>\u201d). Thus, we \u201clook to the reasoning of [Black II] to determine whether the AEDPA requirements have been met.\u201d <em>Butler v. Curry, </em>528 F.3d 624, 640 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the Supreme Court held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. In <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the Supreme Court expanded <em>Apprendi, </em>holding that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by </em>the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">In <em>Cunningham v. California, </em>549 U.S. 270, 127 S.Ct. 856, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007), the Supreme Court struck down California\u2019s determinate sentencing law, which prescribed that a middle-term sentence should be imposed, unless in the judge\u2019s sole discretion, there were mitigation or aggravation factors to warrant a lower-term or upper-term sentence, which could be established by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 278, 127 S.Ct. 856. The Court held this law violated <em>Apprendi, </em>stating that \u201c[i]f the jury\u2019s verdict alone does not authorize the sentence, if, instead, the judge must find an additional fact to impose the longer term, the Sixth Amendment requirement is not satisfied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290, 127 S.Ct. 856. In <em>Black II, </em>the California Supreme Court considered a defendant\u2019s challenge to his sentence in the wake of <em>Cunningham. </em>The court broadly applied the \u201cprior conviction\u201d exception outlined in <em>Apprendi, </em>holding that it includes \u201cnot only the fact that a prior conviction occurred, but also other related issues that may be determined by examining the records of the prior convictions.\u201d 62 Cal.Rptr.3d 569, 161 P.3d at 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">It cannot be said that there is clearly established Supreme Court precedent that is contrary to the holding in <em>Black II. </em>The scope of the \u201cprior conviction\u201d exception has not been defined by the Supreme Court, and the state court\u2019s decision is a reasonable interpretation of that exception. We therefore deny relief. <em>See Kessee v. Mendoza-Powers, </em>574 F.3d 675, 676-77 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Further, even assuming there was a constitutional error, any such error is harmless, as it is clear that a jury would have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Johnson violated parole numerous times and that his prior convictions were of increasing seriousness. <em>Butler, </em>528 F.3d at 648 (\u201c[Our court] must grant relief if we are in \u2018grave doubt\u2019 as to whether a jury would have found the relevant aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d) (cita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>tions omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AbD\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b665-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
