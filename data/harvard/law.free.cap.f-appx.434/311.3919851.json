We VACATE and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">United States Border Patrol (\u201cBorder Patrol\u201d) agents stopped Calhoun at a Texas port of entry. Calhoun looked suspicious, which prompted Border Patrol agents to check his vehicle\u2019s license plate. This check alerted the Border Patrol agents to consider Calhoun \u201carmed and dangerous.\u201d Thereafter a second agent, Cynthia Sandoval, approached Calhoun\u2019s truck and asked that he step out of the vehicle. When Calhoun refused, Sandoval attempted to open the driver\u2019s side door, but Calhoun started the ignition and began driving off. Sandoval ran alongside the truck for about 30 feet, simultaneously reaching into the truck to turn off the ignition and trying to hit Calhoun with her baton. Calhoun was \u201cshoving\u201d or \u201cbrushing\u201d or \u201cpushing\u201d the agent\u2019s arms away. The agent finally let go of the truck and Calhoun sped off.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-16\">Calhoun was eventually apprehended, after which he pled guilty to flight from a checkpoint in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 758. The Pre Sentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) stated that the applicable sentencing guideline was United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) \u00a7 2A2.4, for obstructing or impeding officers (base offense level 10), increased by 3 levels because the offense involved physical contact and by 2 levels because the victim sustained bodily injury. The PSR noted, however, that \u00a7 2A2.4(c)(l) directed a sentencing court to apply \u00a7 2A2.2 \u201c[i]f the conduct constituted aggravated assault.\u201d The PSR recommended that the court apply \u00a7 2A2.2 because Calhoun committed a felony assault with an intent to commit another felony (flight from a checkpoint).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-17\">At his sentencing hearing, Calhoun objected to the aggravated assault cross-reference, under \u00a7 2A2.2. Calhoun argued that the offense of conviction could not be the \u201cother felony\u201d contemplated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>\u00a7 2A2.2 because the offense of conviction led to the cross-reference in the first place, therefore the other felony must be separate from the offense of conviction. Calhoun also argued that if the court accepted the PSR\u2019s interpretation, it would render the enhancement under \u00a7 2A2.4 for bodily injury a nullity, because any time a person impeded an officer and caused bodily injury, it would always be aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The district court disagreed with Calhoun. The district court noted that the defendant need not cause the bodily injury to trigger the enhancement. Instead, the victim must merely have \u201csustained bodily injury.\u201d The court reasoned the enhancement is not a nullity and the cross-reference is applicable. Calhoun was sentenced under \u00a7 2A2.2 to a term of fifty-four months\u2019 imprisonment and three years of supervised release. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Terrazas, </em>529 F.3d 293, 296 (5th Cir. 2008). Specifically, we review the application of cross-reference provisions de novo. <em>United States v. Hicks, </em>389 F.3d 514, 529 (5th Cir.2004). If the district court did not make the necessary factual findings, we must conduct a de novo review of those facts. <em>See United States v. Castaneda, </em>162 F.3d 832, 836 &amp; n. 24 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Calhoun pled guilty to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 758, which proscribes flight from a checkpoint operated by a federal law enforcement agency. The circumstances involving his flight and subsequent arrest, including the role played by Sandoval, implicate two provisions of the Guidelines. Section 2A2.4 is entitled \u201cObstructing or Impeding Officers\u201d and lists as its specific offense characteristics: \u201cif the offense involved physical contact; or dangerous weapon;\u201d or if \u201cthe victim sustained bodily injury.\u201d U.S.S.G \u00a7 2A2.4b. Section 2A2.4 also includes a cross-reference which instructs the district court to apply \u00a7 2A2.2 if \u201cthe conduct constituted aggravated assault.\u201d U.S.S.G \u00a7 2A2.4c. The commentary to \u00a7 2A2.2 defines aggravated assault as \u201ca felonious assault that involved (A) a dangerous weapon with intent to cause bodily injury (i.e., not merely to frighten) with that weapon; (B) serious bodily injury; or (C) an intent to commit another felony.\u201d U.S.S.G \u00a7 2A2.2 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">Calhoun argues that the district court erred by sentencing him under the aggravated assault Guideline pursuant to the cross-reference contained in \u00a7 2A2.4c. He contends that the facts of his case do not support a finding that his conduct falls \u201cwithin the ambit\u201d of the aggravated assault Guideline because the \u201cintent to commit another felony\u201d referenced in the application of the guideline was the underlying offense for which he was convicted: flight from a checkpoint. The Government, meanwhile, argues that the district court neither abused its discretion nor erred in its application of the cross-reference. We agree with Calhoun.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-14\">There is no evidence that Calhoun intended to commit an assault on Sandoval. <em>United States v. Feola, </em>420 U.S. 671, 684, 95 S.Ct. 1255, 43 L.Ed.2d 541 (1975). This dissonance is amplified by our review of the PSR against our review of the sentencing hearing at the district court. The district court \u201cadopt[ed] the factual findings contained within the [PSR],\u201d which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>states that \u201cit does not appear that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the defendant intended to commit bodily injury.\u201d Yet, this finding contradicts the district court\u2019s legal conclusion that Calhoun assaulted the agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">To salvage its argument, the Government relies on our unpublished decision in <em>United States v. Ortegon, </em>45 Fed.Appx. 318 (5th Cir.2002). Because we conclude <em>Ortegon </em>is unpersuasive and distinguishable from the facts at hand, the Government\u2019s reliance on it is misplaced. In <em>Ortegon, </em>a panel of this court considered a defendant who drove his car from Mexico through a primary inspection lane at the American border checkpoint at El Paso, Texas. <em>Id. </em>Defendant Ortegon tried to drive off when checkpoint personnel asked him to give them his keys. As Ortegon fled the checkpoint, a Border Patrol agent jumped into the passenger seat to avoid being struck by the car. Once inside, the officer attempted to turn off the ignition, only to be met by repeated punches by Ortegon. Ortegon\u2019s vehicle was eventually stopped by another officer, and Ortegon was arrested. A search of his vehicle yielded 45.15 kilograms of marijuana. Ortegon pled guilty to assaulting a federal officer by inflicting bodily injury, importing marijuana, and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">While the similarity of this case to <em>Or-tegon </em>is evident \u2014 both involve attempts to flee a checkpoint \u2014 the congruence ends there. In <em>Ortegon, </em>the officer was halfway inside the defendant\u2019s vehicle when the attempted flight occurred and the defendant affirmatively punched the checkpoint officer. Here, the officer ran alongside the vehicle in an attempt to stop the vehicle. Furthermore, there is no allegation that Calhoun ever punched \u2014 or attempted to punch \u2014 Sandoval, as was the case in <em>Or-tegon. </em>Moreover, in <em>Ortegon, </em>the defendant attempted to drive his vehicle into the way of the checkpoint officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Here, Sandoval ran alongside the vehicle and relented only when she determined that she would be unable to keep pace with Calhoun\u2019s car. Also, Sandoval\u2019s injuries were not directly from Calhoun\u2019s hand, as was the case in <em>Ortegon. </em>Sandoval testified that she sustained scratches and bruises on her arm from the truck, and not Calhoun directly. Stated differently, <em>Or-tegon </em>is distinguishable from this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Calhoun\u2019s conduct is more accurately described as physical contact, for which \u00a7 2A2.4 supplies an enhancement, and not as an assault, for which \u00a7 2A2.2 supplies a higher base offense level. This court has stated that \u201calthough there is some overlap between \u00a7 2A2.2 and \u00a7 2A2.4, the logical conclusion is that \u00a7 2A2.4 is meant to apply to possession of weapons and verbal threats, while \u00a7 2A2.2 is meant to apply to something more.\u201d <em>United States v. Hooker, </em>997 F.2d 67, 75 (5th Cir.1993). In addition to possessing a weapon and a verbal threat, \u00a7 2A2.4 must also cover some form of physical contact that is less than a forcible assault,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> otherwise the enhancement for physical conduct would be a nullity. Calhoun\u2019s conduct does not look like \u201csomething more\u201d than possessing a weapon, a threat, or physical contact: He sped away from a checkpoint while an agent held on to the truck for about 30 feet. He did not physically attack her, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>testified that he did not intend to harm her. This conclusion is underscored by the lack of a finding by the district court that Calhoun used his truck as a dangerous weapon \u2014 i.e., with intent to injure Sandoval. Considering all of the above on de novo review, we hold that Calhoun did not commit an assault, and thus the district court erred in applying \u00a7 2A2.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment of sentence and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
