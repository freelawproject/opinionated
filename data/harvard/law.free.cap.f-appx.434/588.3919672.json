We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s granting of a Rule 60(a) motion, denial of a Rule 55(c) motion, and denial of a Rule 60(b) motion. <em>Cintron v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., </em>813 F.2d 917, 919 (9th Cir.1987) (Rule 60(a) motion); <em>Franchise Holding II v. Huntington Rests. Group, Inc., </em>375 F.3d 922, 925 (9th Cir.2004) (Rule 55(c) motion); <em>Fantasyland Video, Inc. v. County of San Diego, </em>505 F.3d 996, 1005 (9th Cir.2007) (Rule 60(b) motion). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(a), a district court may \u201ccorrect a clerical mistake or a mistake arising from oversight or omission whenever one is found in a judgment, order, or other part of the record.\u201d Relief under Rule 60(a) is not limited to clerical mistakes committed only by the clerk; the Rule applies to mistakes by the court, the parties, and the jury as well. <em>See Day v. McDonough, </em>547 U.S. 198, 210-11, 126 S.Ct. 1675, 164 L.Ed.2d 376 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">The district court properly exercised its discretion under Rule 60(a) to correct a clerical error in the original default judgment. The Complaint was served on M.C. Hammer, with an \u201calso known as\u201d name of Stanley \u201cBerrell.\u201d There is no question that service was proper or that Burrell had notice of the proceedings against him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because service was proper, this amendment was not a substantive change but remedied a misspelling of the \u201calso known as\u201d name of a correctly identified defendant. <em>See Har-man v. Harper, </em>7 F.3d 1455, 1457 (9th Cir.1993) (\u201cThe basic distinction between \u2018clerical mistakes\u2019 and mistakes that cannot be corrected pursuant to Rule 60(a) is that the former consist of \u2018blunders in execution\u2019 whereas the latter consist of instances where the court changes its mind\u201d). The district court simply corrected a \u201cblunder in execution\u201d and did not \u201cchange its mind.\u201d Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in correcting the spelling of Mr. Burrell\u2019s last name under Rule 60(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(1) permits a court to reopen judgments for reasons of \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, but only on motion made within one year of the judgment.\u201d <em>Pioneer Inv. Services Co. v. Brunswick Associates Ltd. Partnership, </em>507 U.S. 380, 393, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). If a 60(b)(1) motion is untimely, the district court lacks jurisdiction to consider the merits of the motion. <em>Nevitt v. United States, </em>886 F.2d 1187, 1188 (9th Cir.1989). The district court entered default judgement on June 10, 2002. Burrell did not move for relief until over seven years later on September 2009. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Thus, Burrell failed to move for relief within one year, as required by the limitation on 60(b)(1) motions. Burrell argues that the correction of the spelling of his also known as name under Rule 60(a) affects his substantive rights and thus resets the running of the one year limitation set out in 60(b)(1). However, corrections under 60(a) do not toll applicable time limitations. <em>Cf. Harman, </em>7 F.3d at 1457 (\u201cCorrections under Rule 60(a) do not affect the underlying judgment, and, consistent therewith, do not affect the time for filing a notice of appeal.\u201d). As such, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of the motion to vacate default judgment. <em>See Lyon v. Agusta S.P.A., </em>252 F.3d 1078, 1088 (9th Cir.2001).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Burrell\u2019s Rule 55(c) motion to vacate entry of default. The Federal Rules provide that a \u201ccourt may set aside an entry of default for good cause.... \u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(c). To determine \u201cgood cause\u201d, a court must \u201ceonsider[ ] three factors: (1) whether [the party seeking to set aside the default] engaged in culpable conduct that led to the default; (2) whether [they] had [no] meritorious defense; or (3) whether reopening the default judgment would prejudice\u201d the other party. <em>See Franchise Holding II, </em>375 F.3d at 925-26 (citations omitted). \u201cThis standard ... is disjunctive, such that a finding that any one of these factors is true is sufficient reason for the district court to refuse to set aside the default.\u201d <em>United States v. Signed Personal Check No. 730 of Yubran S. Mesle, </em>615 F.3d 1085, 1091 (9th Cir.2010) (citations omitted). This Circuit has held that a \u201cdefendant\u2019s conduct is culpable if he has received actual or constructive notice of the filing of the action and intentionally failed to answer.\u201d <em>Alan Neuman Prods. Inc. v. Albright, </em>862 F.2d 1388, 1392 (9th Cir.1988). Culpability. involves \u201cnot simply nonappearance following receipt of notice of the action, but rather conduct which hindered judicial proceedings....\u201d <em>Gregorian v. Izvestia, </em>871 F.2d 1515, 1525 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it conducted the requisite test to determine good cause and applied this legal standard in a way that was neither illogical, implausible, nor unsupported by the record. <em>See United States v. Hinkson, </em>585 F.3d 1247, 1261-62 (9th Cir.2009) (en banc) (discussing abuse of discretion analysis). The district court found Burrell\u2019s culpable conduct led to the default judgment and relied on pertinent factors such as \u2014 (1) Burrell\u2019s status as a sophisticated business man; (2) Burrell\u2019s admission that he ignored documents addressed to Stanley \u201cBerrell\u201d; (3) evidence in the record suggesting Burrell disregarded several conspicuous indications that he was a party to a lawsuit; and (4) the fact that Burrell appeared for the debtor\u2019s examination in 2004. The district court\u2019s finding of Burrell\u2019s culpability is supported by the record. There is sufficient evidence to suggest Burrell intentionally failed to answer, thereby hindering the judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b611-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-14\">. Burrell does not appeal the district court\u2019s finding that service was proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b612-5\">. The subject matter of the motion was covered by 60(b)(1). Thus, other subsections of 60(b), such as 60(b)(6), are not available. <em>Lil-jeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp., </em>486 U.S. 847, 864 n. 11, 108 S.Ct. 2194, 100 L.Ed.2d 855 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b612-10\">GOODWIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AkX\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">I respectfully dissent. Changing Stanley Burrell\u2019s name on the default judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(a) altered the substantive rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Further, this change cannot be insulated from review simply by being backdated. Finally, it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to switch back and forth between using Burrell\u2019s true name and an incorrect name, then to deny his Rule 60(b) motion, thereby preventing the Plaintiff\u2019s claims from being decided on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The district court correctly noted that Rule 60(a) cannot be used to make changes that alter parties\u2019 substantive rights. <em>See Hasbrouck v. Texaco, Inc., </em>879 F.2d 632, 636 (9th Cir.1989). A writ of execution for money judgment and a garnishment order for withholding earnings against \u201cBerrell\u201d failed to collect on the judgement.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">That a judgement against \u201cBerrell\u201d could not be executed, while one against \u201cBurrell\u201d can be executed makes plain that substantive rights were altered by changing the name on the judgment. Using Rule 60(a) to make such a change is wrong as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Backdating the change of a party\u2019s name is also problematic. The district court and the Plaintiff were aware of Burrell\u2019s true name years before the name on the default judgement was changed, as evidenced by the use of \u201cBurrell\u201d on the order to appear for a debtor\u2019s exam. Burrell complied with the order that used his true name. Nonetheless, and quite inexplicably, the district court reverted to using \u201cBerrell\u201d during further proceedings, later altering the name on the judgement <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>The majority holds that the effect of backdating is to deprive the courts of jurisdiction to consider the merits of Burrell\u2019s motion for relief. Nonetheless, it is impossible for me to see how the district court could have been aware of Burrell\u2019s true name, entered judgement against a different name, only to later refer to the act as a clerical error corrected <em>nunc pro tunc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">Default judgments, moreover, are appropriate only in extreme circumstances. <em>TCI Group Life Ins. Plan v. Knoebber, </em>244 F.3d 691, 695, (9th Cir.2001). Relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) can be had for any reason that justifies relief, and such relief should be \u201cliberally applied.\u201d <em>TCI Group Life Ins. Plan, </em>244 F.3d at 695. \u201c[Wjhere there has been no merits decision, appropriate exercise of district court discretion under Rule 60(b) requires that the finality interest should give way fairly readily, to further the competing interest in reaching the merits of a dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The allowable time to bring a Rule 60(b)(6) motion need only pass a reasonableness test. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1). Extraordinary circumstances can extend a reasonable period far beyond one year. <em>Washington v. Penwell, </em>700 F.2d 570, 572-73 (9th Cir.1983), <em>abrogated on other grounds as recognized by Jeff D. v. Kempthorne, </em>365 F.3d 844, 852 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">Calling a party into a debtor examination under his true name then later filing a judgment against him under another incorrect name is both illogical and extraordinary. Denying the Rule 60(b) motion was an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I would vacate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>the amended default judgement and remand to let the district court decide Plaintiffs claims on their merits, if any, as this circuit\u2019s precedents and good sense require. <em>See TCI Group Life Ins. Plan, </em>244 F.3d at 695; 12 J. Moore, Fed.Prac. \u00b6 60.22[3][a],</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-8\">. The majority suggests that relief from judgement under Rule 60(b)(6) is not available since the subject matter of the motion falls under Rule 60(b)(1). While it is correct that the subject matter of the motion can only fall under one Rule 60(b) subsection, this circuit has long recast a party\u2019s own characterization of subject matter from one subsection to another. <em>See McKinney v. Boyle, </em>404 F.2d 632, 634 (9th Cir. 1968). The facts here are not that the Plaintiff merely misspelled Burrell\u2019s name. The court\u2019s use of Burrell\u2019s true name to call him in for a debtor\u2019s exam, only to revert to using \"Berrell\u201d on the judgement removes the subject matter from Rule 60(b)(1). In is within this court\u2019s discretion to recognize this situation as a \"reason that justifies relief\u201d and an extraordinary circumstance under Rule 60(b)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
