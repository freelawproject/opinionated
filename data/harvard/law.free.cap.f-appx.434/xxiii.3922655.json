LYNCH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b23-20\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b23-21\">In August 2009, Joseph Mark Shay pled guilty to receipt and distribution of child pornography. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252A(a)(2), 2256(8)(a). After applying various enhancements, the district court calculated an offense level of 37 and a Guidelines range from 210 months\u2019 incarceration to the statutory maximum<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of 240 months, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2252A(a)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, and sentenced Shay to 210 months\u2019 incarceration and supervised release for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-22\">After sentence was imposed, this Court decided <em>United States v. Dorvee, </em>616 F.3d 174 (2d Cir.2010). Dorvee had been sentenced to just over 233 months\u2019 incarceration (effectively, the statutory maximum of 240 months minus a credit for time served on a related state sentence) for distribution of child pornography. We found his sentence both procedurally and substantively unreasonable, <em>id. </em>at 176, concluding that \u201cit would be manifestly unjust to let Dorvee\u2019s sentence stand,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 188.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>this case, the district court did not have the benefit of our opinion in <em>Dorvee </em>when it set Shay\u2019s sentence. The Guidelines calculation and offense conduct in Dorvee\u2019s case were strikingly similar to those in Shay\u2019s. Dorvee, like Shay, collected and distributed thousands of images with his computer, some of which involved prepubescent minors or sadistic conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 177. Dorvee had problems with his mental health, <em>id. </em>at 177-78; Shay has problems with his physical health. The biggest difference between them appears to be that Dorvee chatted with and distributed pornographic images to people he believed were minors, and was caught on his way \u201cto meet, to photograph, and to engage in sexual conduct with\u201d one of them. <em>Id. </em>at 176. There is no evidence, by contrast, that Shay ever attempted to contact or engage with minors in any inappropriate way.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">While we are not prepared to hold at this time that Shay\u2019s sentence, like Dor-vee\u2019s, was necessarily procedurally or substantively unreasonable, the similarity between the cases makes it appropriate, at a minimum, to vacate the judgment and remand to the district court, so that the district court can consider the potential effect of <em>Dorvee </em>on this case in the first instance, and decide whether the sentence it originally imposed remains appropriate in light of our reasoning in <em>Dorvee, </em>or whether there are distinguishing factors in this case that are not apparent on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE and REMAND Shay\u2019s sentence for further consideration in light of <em>Dorvee.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b23-15\">. The government contended at oral argument that 240 months did not represent the true maximum because Shay pled guilty to <em>two </em>counts, whose sentences could have run consecutively instead of concurrently. We need not address this contention, which does not affect our resolution of the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b23-23\">. On remand, the district court re-sentenced Dorvee to just over 121 months of incarceration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
