We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d), and we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision on appeal from a bankruptcy court. <em>Greene v. Savage (In re Greene), </em>583 F.3d 614, 618 (9th Cir.2009). We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusions of law and interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code <em>de novo, </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">The district court properly held that \u25a0Coleman\u2019s appeal was moot under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(m) since the debtors\u2019 business had already been sold and the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusion that the buyer, Mark Franks, was a good faith purchaser was not clearly erroneous. <em>Paulman v. Gateway Venture Partners III, L.P. (In re Filtercorp, Inc.), </em>163 F.3d 570, 576 (9th Cir.1998) (\u201cWhen a sale of assets is made to a good faith purchaser, it may not be modified or set aside unless the sale was stayed pending appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-16\">Although Franks was an executive of one of the debtors\u2019 companies, a sale to an insider is not <em>per se </em>bad faith. <em>See id. </em>at 577. Further, following testimony, the bankruptcy court found that the debtors had properly considered \u201ca number of alternatives\u201d besides the sale to Franks, but \u201c[n]one that promised a greater return to creditors materialized.\u201d The bankruptcy court determined that \u201cFranks is the only possible buyer and that his purchase price is above the fair market value of the business.\u201d Thus, the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusion that Franks was a good faith purchaser was not \u201cillogical, implausible, or without support in the record.\u201d <em>Retz v. Samson (In re Retz), </em>606 F.3d 1189, 1196 (9th Cir.2010) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-17\">Coleman\u2019s appeal is also constitutionally moot, since there have been \u201cintricate and involved transactions\u201d in reliance on the bankruptcy court\u2019s order confirming the reorganization plan, and reversal would affect the rights of numerous third parties. <em>See Trone v. Roberts Farms, Inc. (In re Roberts Farms, Inc.), </em>652 F.2d 793, 797 (9th Cir.1981); <em>Southwest Prods., Inc. v. Durkin (In re Southwest Prods., Inc.), </em>144 B.R. 100, 105 (9th Cir. B.A.P. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b641-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
