Ellington, Jr., pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon/user of controlled substance and one count of possession of marijuana. He was sentenced to a total of fifty-one months\u2019 imprisonment and three years of supervised release. While on supervised release, Ellington violated several conditions of his supervised release. The district court revoked Ellington\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to eighteen months in prison followed by no further supervised release. Ellington appeals his sentence, claiming that the district court\u2019s sentence was plainly unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">This court will affirm a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release if it is not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>595 F.3d 544, 546 (4th Cir.2010). The first step in this review requires a determination of whether the sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 438 (4th Cir.2006). \u201cThis initial inquiry takes a more \u2018deferential appellate posture concerning issues of fact and the exercise of discretion\u2019 than reasonableness review for [Guidelines sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 656 (4th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439) (applying \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard of review for probation revocation). Only if the sentence is procedurally or substantively unreasonable does the inquiry proceed to the second step of the analysis to determine whether the sentence is plainly unreasonable. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 438-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">A supervised release revocation sentence is procedurally reasonable if the district court considered the advisory policy statement range based upon Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors applicable to supervised release revocation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) (2006); <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 438-40. A sentence is substantively reasonable if the district court stated a proper basis for concluding the defendant should receive the sentence imposed, up to the statutory maximum. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 440. \u201cA court need not be as detailed or specific when imposing a revocation sentence as it must be when imposing a post-conviction sentence, but it still must provide a statement of reasons for the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>595 F.3d at 547 (internal quotation marks omitted). After thoroughly reviewing the record, we conclude that Ellington\u2019s sentence was both procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
