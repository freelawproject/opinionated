Cabrera has appealed his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-24\">Cabrera contends that the district court committed a procedural error in determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>ing his sentence by considering facts that had no basis in the record, that is, the likelihood that Cabrera had entered the United States illegally on more occasions than had been disclosed in the presentence report. Because Cabrera did not preserve this claim of error adequately in the district court, we have reviewed it for plain error. <em>See United States v. Gutierrez, </em>635 F.3d 148, 152 (5th Cir.2011). Under the plain-error standard, we will \u201cremedy forfeited error only when it is plain and affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). If these elements are met, we have \u201cdiscretion to correct the forfeited error only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In sentencing a defendant, \u201c[t]he district court must make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). By stating that the \u201claw of averages\u201d supported the supposition that Cabrera had entered the United States illegally on more than four occasions, the district court arguably considered facts that were outside the record and that were not individualized. Assuming without deciding that the district court erred, we hold that Cabrera cannot show that his substantial rights were affected. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 361. The district court\u2019s decision to sentence Cabrera at the top of the guidelines range was amply supported by the fact that Cabrera had entered the country illegally on four occasions and was not deterred by a prior sentence of imprisonment for illegal reentry. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
