In April 2010, he pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement in which the Government agreed to consider moving for a downward departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines in exchange for Douglas\u2019s cooperation. However, after Douglas made a statement about his involvement in the counterfeiting operation, the Government determined that his cooperation was of little value, and declined to move for a downward departure. At sentencing, Douglas moved for a variance based on the same cooperation, which the Court denied. He was sentenced to 33 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release. Douglas appeals the denial of his motion. We now affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-21\">Douglas argues that the District Court erred by failing to take into account his cooperation during the sentencing hearing. We disagree. It is clear from the transcript of the sentencing hearing that the District Court was aware of its discretion to grant a variance. Douglas\u2019s attorney pointed this out to the Court several times, noting that it could consider Douglas\u2019s assistance even though the Government de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>dined to make a motion for a downward departure. App. 127-129.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The prosecutor similarly recognized the Court\u2019s discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 129.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, although the Court ultimately declined to grant a variance in favor of Douglas, it was aware of its discretion to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Moreover, the Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Douglas\u2019s motion. The Court rejected Douglas\u2019s variance argument, stating that \u201cI don\u2019t think [Douglas\u2019s honesty was that much assistance to the Government, so we\u2019re not going to be able to make any adjustment for his assistance in this prosecution....\u201d App. 124. Additionally, it stated that it was concerned about the total number of Douglas\u2019s victims and his recidivism. Ultimately, it imposed a sentence of 33 months, at the low end of the Guidelines\u2019 range (33 to 41 months), which it noted was consistent with the sentence imposed on similarly situated defendants. This was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-14\">. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). We review a district court\u2019s sentencing decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 328 (3d Cir.2006), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Kim-brough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\">. Specifically, Douglas\u2019s counsel stated that \"the Court has the opportunity to make its own independent determination of what [Douglas] did do and what help did it \u2014 what help, if any, did it present to this particular case.\u201d App. 128. Counsel continued, \"I just ask the Court reconsider that because it\u2019s not dispositive that the Government made [the] determination [not to move for a downward departure] now. Now that we\u2019re in this advisory guideline system, other courts have made it their own \u2014 have been able to make their own determinations under a different set of judgments as to whether a defendant can get a variance for cooperation ... when he doesn\u2019t get a 5K1 motion specifically from the Government, and I\u2019d ask the Court to reconsider that issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128-29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b145-22\">. The prosecutor clarified as follows: \"I didn\u2019t mean to suggest that because a 5K motion was not filed that the Court can't consider [Douglas's cooperation]. Certainly it can. The Government, in terms of the Court\u2019s 3553 analysis, would ask the Court to recognize that it does have the discretion to vary for that reason and many others but to exercise the discretion to not give a variance for that reason.\u201d App. 129.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
