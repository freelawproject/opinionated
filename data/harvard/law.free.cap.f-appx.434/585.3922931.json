We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b608-17\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b608-18\">Williams contends that the admission of evidence of two prior bad acts violated Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. We review a district court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence of prior bad acts under Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ramirez-Robles, </em>386 F.3d 1234, 1242 (9th Cir.2004). \u201cThe government must ... show that the evidence satisfies Federal Rule of Evidence 403 such that its probative value is not outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where the probative value is slight, moderate prejudice is unacceptable. <em>Id. </em>at 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-19\">As discussed below, we are persuaded that the totality of the evidence, exclusive of the prior bad acts, was sufficient to persuade a rational trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt of Williams\u2019s guilt. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (\u201c[T]he relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d). Assuming without deciding that the district court\u2019s admission of some or all of the 404(b) evidence in this case was error, any error was more probably than not harmless. <em>See United States v. Mehrmanesh, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>689 F.2d 822, 832 (9th Cir.1982) (\u201cBecause the error in admission of this evidence amounted only to a violation of an eviden-tiary rule, we consider whether the error affected \u2018substantial rights.\u2019 Under this standard we may affirm if, after consideration of the record, we find that the admission of this evidence was more probably than not harmless.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal based on insufficiency of the evidence. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>105 F.3d 1330, 1332 (9th Cir.1997). \u201cWhile mere proximity to the scene of illicit activity is not sufficient to establish involvement in a conspiracy, a defendant\u2019s presence may support such an inference when viewed in context with other evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Penagos, </em>823 F.2d 346, 348 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The evidence connecting Williams to the conspiracy in this case, although circumstantial, was more than just slight. Any rational trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the snake pendant and the documents bearing Williams\u2019s name, as well as his admission of a brief period of residence in the apartment to which the FedEx parcel initially was delivered, connected Williams to the conspiracy. The evidence of anti-theft powder on Williams\u2019s hands was sufficient to support a determination that he had both knowledge and possession of the drugs in the FedEx package. Additionally, the jury was entitled to disbelieve Williams\u2019s testimony. <em>See United States v. Kenny, </em>645 F.2d 1323, 1346 (9th Cir.1981) (\u201cWhen the defendant elects to testify, he runs the risk that if disbelieved, the trier of fact may conclude that the opposite of his testimony is the truth.\u201d). The jury also could choose to credit the expert testimony that it was highly unlikely that the co-conspirators in the apartment would have opened the FedEx package in Williams\u2019s presence and permitted him to handle the narcotics if he were not a co-conspirator. <em>See United States v. Magallon-Jimenez, </em>219 F.3d 1109, 1113 (9th Cir. 2000) (finding \u201cmanifestly reasonable\u201d the inference that it was highly unlikely that a non-conspirator would be in a truck \u201cwith a 10 pound box of cocaine at his feet if he were merely tagging along as a friend\u201d). Moreover, the jury could infer an intent to possess with an intent to distribute from the quantity of the drugs in the FedEx package. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cWe have repeatedly inferred an intent to distribute from a large quantity of drugs.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">Williams challenges the district court\u2019s application of a two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm pursuant to section 2Dl.l(b)(l) of the Sentencing Guidelines. \u201cThis court reviews the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo, the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines to the facts of this case for abuse of discretion, and the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Kimbrew, </em>406 F.3d 1149, 1151 (9th Cir. 2005). The two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm in a drug offense \u201cshould be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 3. \u201cUnder the Guidelines, a defendant convicted of conspiracy may be sentenced not only on the basis of his own conduct, but also on the basis of the \u2018conduct of others in furtherance of the execution of the jointly-undertaken criminal activity that was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>909 F.2d 1346, 1349 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Cir.1990) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.S cmt. n. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Here, the evidence reasonably demonstrated that the occupants of the apartment were carrying out a conspiracy to distribute drugs. Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying the two-level enhancement to Williams\u2019s sentence for possessing a firearm because it was not clearly improbable that the gun found above a ceiling tile in the bedroom, with the magazine in a nearby dresser drawer, was connected to the offenses of which Williams was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b608-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
