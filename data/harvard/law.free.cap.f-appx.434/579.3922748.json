We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-19\">1. The Association bears the burden of showing that a \u201ccollapse\u201d occurring during the policy period caused its loss. <em>See Lewis v. Aetna Ins. Co., </em>264 Or. 314, 505 P.2d 914, 916 (1973). Given the ongoing nature of the property damage and the expert testimony that there\u2019s no way to determine when the damage happened, no rational trier of fact could conclude that the Association has made such a showing. <em>See T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass\u2019n, </em>809 F.2d 626, 631 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-20\">2. The district court correctly concluded that no \u201centire collapse\u201d of \u201cany part of a building\u201d occurred. The language in the Collapse Endorsement was drafted specifically to limit coverage to actual collapses. <em>Sexton v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>2003 WL 23274849, at *2, 2003 Del.Super. LEXIS 430, at *5-6 (Dec. 30, 2003); <em>see also Assurance Co. of Am. v. Wall &amp; Assocs. LLC of Olympia, </em>379 F.3d 557, 563 (9th Cir.2004). Damage of the type seen here is more properly treated as imminent collapse or as structural impairment. <em>E.g., id. </em>at 558 (in which gypsum sheathing had \u201cturned to mush\u201d); <em>Schray v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>402 F.Supp.2d 1212, 1215 (D.Or.2005) (where property had \u201csignificant rot and decay of some structural members\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-21\">3. Because we affirm on the above bases, we need not decide whether the district court erred in its interpretation of the term \u201csudden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b601-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Cir.
