The district court varied upward from the advisory Guidelines sentencing range of zero to six months and sentenced Montiel, <em>inter alia, </em>to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment-the statutory maximum. As he did in district court, Montiel contends his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Although, <em>post-Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and a sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its findings of fact, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">In this instance, the advisory sentencing range is not at issue. Accordingly, we consider whether the district court committed, on another basis, any significant procedural error. <em>Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. We next \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">In contending his sentence was procedurally unreasonable, Montiel claims the district court failed to state adequate reasons for a sentence that was both the statutory maximum and substantially above the advisory sentencing range. As noted, Montiel challenged the sentence on this basis in district court; therefore, we review for an abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565 n. 6 (5th Cir.2008). The district court gave a lengthy explanation for the sentence, citing Montiel\u2019s numerous encounters with law enforcement, particularly his multiple (more than five) reentries into the United States following deportations, usually within a very short time. (Regarding those encounters, Montiel has been arrested for, <em>inter alia, </em>attempted murder, assault, gang assault, robbery, and grand larceny.) The court also cited: Montiel\u2019s likelihood of recidivism; and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing goals of promoting respect for the law, deterring future criminal conduct, and protecting the public. Accordingly, Montiel has not shown that the district court abused its discretion. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 564-65 &amp; n. 6; <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707-08 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">In contending his sentence was substantively unreasonable, Montiel claims the district court gave insufficient weight to the Guidelines, his work history, his youth, and personal characteristics. The district court acknowledged Montiel\u2019s youth and his fluency in English, but found that Montiel\u2019s above-discussed lack of respect for the laws of the United States, and the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, necessitated a sentence above the advisory sentencing range. Along that line, there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>no indication that the court: failed to \u201caccount for a factor that should have received significant weight\u201d; gave \u201csignificant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor\u201d; or made \u201ca clear error of judgment in balancing the [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] sentencing factors\u201d. <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 708 (citation omitted). Accordingly, Montiel has shown no more than a disagreement with the district court\u2019s balancing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
