Guip-pone brought this action individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (\u201cWARN\u201d) Act, Pub.L. No. 100-379, 102 Stat. 890 (1988), codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2101-09, against, <em>inter alia, </em>Defendants-Appellees Bay Har-bour Management LC; Bay Harbour Master Ltd.; BH S &amp; B Inc.; York Capital Management, LP; and YSOF S &amp; B Investor, LLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>In a Decision and Order dated May 18, 2010, the district court granted Defendants-Appellees\u2019 second motion to dismiss Guippone\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court then entered partial final judgment in favor of Defendants-Ap-pellees in an order dated June 11, 2010. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">On appeal, Guippone argues that the district court\u2019s entry of partial final judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees under Rule 54(b) was improper because the court failed to give a reasoned explanation for entering partial final judgment. Before adjudicating the merits of an appeal, we must determine whether we have jurisdiction. <em>See Muhammad v. City of N.Y. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>126 F.3d 119, 122 (2d Cir. 1997). We review a district court\u2019s grant of Rule 54(b) certification for abuse of discretion. <em>See Harriscom Svenska AB v. Harris Corp., </em>947 F.2d 627, 629 (2d Cir. 1991); <em>see also Hudson River Sloop Clear-water, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>891 F.2d 414, 419 (2d Cir.1989) (noting that we \u201caccord considerable deference to the district court\u201d in determining whether there was \u201cno just reason for delaying final judgment on the appealed claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Section 1291 of Title 28 of the United States Code provides that \u201c[t]he courts of appeals ... shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Thus, \u201c[u]n-less the District Court directs entry of a final judgment, \u2018any order or other decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties does not end the action\u2019 [and] is, by definition, interlocutory.\u201d <em>City of New York v. Smokes-Spirits.com, Inc., </em>541 F.3d 425, 452 (2d Cir.2008) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b)), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds by Hemi Grp., LLC v. City of New York, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 983, 175 L.Ed.2d 943 (2010). Rule 54(b), however, provides that \u201c[w]hen an action presents more than one claim for relief \u2014 whether as a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim\u2014 or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the court <em>expressly determines </em>that there is no just reason for delay.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">We have \u201crepeatedly held that in making the \u2018express determination\u2019 required under Rule 54(b), district courts should not merely repeat the formulaic language of the rule, but rather should offer a brief, reasoned explanation.\u201d <em>Harriscom, </em>947 F.2d at 629 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Hudson River Sloop, </em>891 F.2d at 419 (\u201c[M]ere recitation of the language of the rule that \u2018there is no just reason for delay1 is insufficient to certify a claim under Rule 54(b).\u201d). \u201cSince the appellate court may review the Rule 54(b) certification for abuse of discretion, it does not suffice for the district court to announce its determination that \u2018there is no just cause for delay\u2019 in conclusory form,\u201d and instead \u201cits certification must be accompanied by a reasoned, even if brief, explanation of its conclusion.\u201d <em>Cullen v. Margiotta, </em>811 F.2d 698, 711 (2d Cir.1987). The absence of such an explanation justifies dismissal of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., O\u2019Bert ex. rel. Estate of O\u2019Bert v. Vargo, </em>331 F.3d 29, 41 (2d Cir.2003) (\u201c[W]e have frequently dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>appeals where no reasoned explanation for the Rule 54(b) judgment was given\u201d) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Here, the district court\u2019s order directing entry of partial final judgment was clearly inadequate. The order simply states, \u201c[u]pon consideration of the Bay Harbour and York Capital Defendants\u2019 Motion For Entry of Partial Final Judgment, it is hereby ORDERED that ... The Motion is GRANTED.\u201d The district court made no statement \u2014 let alone a conclusory one \u2014 as to why there was \u201cno just reason for delay.\u201d Cf<em>. Smith ex rel. Smith v. Half Hollow Hills Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>298 F.3d 168, 171 (2d Cir.2002) (\u201cAlthough the district court made a conclusory statement \u2018finding that there is no just reason for delay,\u2019 that statement was clearly inadequate.\u201d). In fact, the district court\u2019s order does not even mention Rule 54(b). Moreover, given the overlapping factual and legal issues in this case, the reasons for entry of partial final judgment are not so \u201cobvious\u201d that a reasoned explanation \u201cwould result only in unnecessary delay in the appeal process.\u201d <em>Fletcher v. Marino, </em>882 F.2d 605, 609 (2d Cir.1989) (excusing inadequate explanation because need for expedition and nature of public concern were obvious); <em>see also St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. PepsiCo, Inc., </em>884 F.2d 688, 693-94 (2d Cir.1989) (excusing inadequate explanation because, <em>inter alia, </em>reason for certification was \u201creadily apparent from the record\u201d and appeal presented \u201ca distinct and separable part of the suit\u201d). Consequently, the district court\u2019s Rule 54(b) certification was improper in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Defendants-Appellees contend, however, that the entry of partial final judgment was proper pursuant to <em>Vona v. Cnty. of Niagara, </em>119 F.3d 201 (2d Cir.1997). Defendants-Appellees\u2019 reliance on <em>Vona </em>is misplaced. In <em>Vona, </em>although the district court failed to expressly determine that there was \u201cno just reason for delay\u201d as required by Rule 54(b), we concluded that there was a final judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, because the case was marked \u201cclosed,\u201d making clear that the district court intended to take no further action in adjudicating the case. <em>See Vona, </em>119 F.3d at 205-06; <em>see also Houbigant, Inc. v. IMG Fragrance Brands, LLC, </em>627 F.3d 497 (2d Cir.2010) (per curiam) (\u201c[I]t was clear to us in <em>Vona </em>that the district court intended to take no further action in adjudicating the case.\u201d). Here, in addition to its failure to offer a reasoned explanation for directing entry of partial final judgment, the district court never closed\u2014 nor gave any indication that it intended to cease adjudicating \u2014 the present case. In fact, proceedings in this action have been ongoing since Guippone filed his notice of appeal. Defendants-Appellees\u2019 argument is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">For the foregoing reasons, this appeal is DISMISSED for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b28-6\">. In the same Decision and Order, the district court denied Defendant BHY S &amp; B HoldCo LLC\u2019s motion to dismiss Guippone's complaint. Defendants BH S &amp; B Holdings LLC and BHY S &amp; B Intermediate HoldCo did not file or join a motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b29-7\">. In reaching this conclusion, we note our receipt and full consideration of Appellees\u2019 most recent letter, filed after oral argument and pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 28(j).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
