We have reviewed the record included on appeal, as well as the parties\u2019 briefs, and we find no error in the district court\u2019s judgment. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>No. 6:08-cv-03760-GRA, 2010 WL 1643425 (D.S.C. Apr. 28, 2010). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
