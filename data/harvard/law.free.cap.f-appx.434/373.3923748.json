In his \u00a7 1983 complaint, Shirley alleged that the defendant violated his right of access to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The district court may deny a motion for leave to appeal IFP by certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith and by providing written reasons for the certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a). If a prisoner opts to challenge the district court\u2019s certification decision, the prisoner may file a motion in the court of appeals for leave to proceed IFP, which \u201cmust be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. This court, however, may dismiss the appeal as frivolous when it is apparent that an appeal would be merit-less. <em>Id. </em>at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The court\u2019s inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The district court adopted the findings and conclusions of the magistrate judge and dismissed Shirley\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous. This court reviews the dismissal of a complaint as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999). Shirley has failed to show that his appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits.\u201d <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As the magistrate judge noted, a prisoner must demonstrate a hindrance to his underlying claim to prevail on a claim that his right of access to the courts has been violated. <em>See Christopher v. Harbury, </em>536 U.S. 403, 415, 122 S.Ct. 2179, 153 L.Ed.2d 413 (2002); <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996); <em>see also Johnson v. Rodriguez, </em>110 F.3d 299, 311 (5th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">No constitutional violation occurs when a prisoner has time to re-prepare and file his legal document despite impediments caused by officials. <em>Richardson v. McDonnell, </em>841 F.2d 120, 122 (5th Cir. 1988). Although the officer may have confiscated Shirley\u2019s writ of habeas corpus and his application to proceed IFP, Shirley had time to re-prepare and timely file both. The magistrate judge found, therefore, that Shirley had suffered neither harm nor prejudice as a result of the alleged misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">As the district court noted in dismissing his claim, Shirley failed to address the magistrate judge\u2019s finding of no harm or prejudice, an error we note remains uncorrected in Shirley\u2019s present motion to proceed IFP. For the second time, Shirley has failed to brief an argument challenging the basis for the district court\u2019s decision, and thus he has waived any such challenge on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). We thus conclude that Shirley\u2019s appeal is without argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>able merit, and we dismiss the appeal as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Shirley is cautioned that the dismissal of his suit by the district court and the dismissal of his appeal count as strikes pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Ham-mons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). He is further cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
