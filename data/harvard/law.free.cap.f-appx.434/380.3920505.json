Because Phillips\u2019s application was dismissed on the respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment, review is de novo. <em>Madriz-Alvara-do v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 321, 327 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>On appeal, Phillips argues that \u00a7 8621 is discriminatory because it affords only prisoners with a history of substance abuse, not prisoners with other mental disorders that contribute to criminal behavior, an opportunity for treatment and incentives for completing treatment, such as early release. The district court correctly concluded that \u00a7 3621(e)(2)\u2019s exclusion of inmates without substance abuse problems was rationally related to the legitimate government interests in easing overcrowding, reducing recidivism, and preventing crime. <em>See Venegas v. Henman, </em>126 F.3d 760, 763 (5th Cir.1997). Further, there was no error with respect to he district court\u2019s conclusion that Congress did not need to spend any of its finite budget on improving Phillips\u2019s behavior with respect to drugs, since he did not have substance abuse issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">For the first time on appeal, Phillips alleges that he has conduct disorder. Phillips also suggests, for the first time on appeal, that \u00a7 3621 violates the Americans with Disabilities Act. We will not consider Phillips\u2019s arguments that are raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leggett v. Fleming, </em>380 F.3d 232, 236 <em>&amp; </em>n. 16 (5th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Phillips has moved for appointment of counsel. Phillips has not \u201cdemonstrated that the interests of justice would be served by the appointment of counsel.\u201d <em>United States v. Tubwell, </em>37 F.3d 175, 179 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
