We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-24\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions with respect to the settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>ment agreement; we review its factual conclusions \u201cunder the clearly erroneous standard of review.\u201d <em>Omega Eng\u2019g, Inc. v. Omega, S.A., </em>432 F.3d 437, 443 (2d Cir. 2005). A district court \u201cmay exercise supplemental jurisdiction to hear fee disputes between litigants and their attorneys when the dispute relates to the main action.\u201d <em>Alderman v. Pan Am World Airways, </em>169 F.3d 99, 102 (2d Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision to award fees under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The district court properly held that the settlement agreement was binding, enforceable, and disposed of all of plaintiffs claims against the defendants. <em>See Powell v. Omnicom, </em>497 F.3d 124, 129 (2d Cir. 2007) (stating \u201csettlement remains binding even if a party has a change of heart\u201d after he agreed to the terms of the settlement). Plaintiffs claims of fraud and duress are not substantiated by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The district court\u2019s exercise of supplemental jurisdiction over the fee dispute was proper. <em>See Achtman v. Kirby, McInerney &amp; Squire, LLP, </em>464 F.3d 328, 336 (2d Cir.2006) (observing that district courts have \u201cpower to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a fee dispute\u201d and that \u201cthe lower court\u2019s familiarity with the subject matter of the [underlying] suit len[ds] support to the exercise of jurisdiction\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). However, we vacate and remand in part, for the district court to make further factual findings that bear upon the award of fees including, <em>inter alia, </em>the timing of the commencement of counsel\u2019s representation and the pendency of other cases, litigated <em>pro se, </em>that are folded into the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Payment of the settlement amount will abide the determination of the fee dispute in light of the district court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Having considered all of Raghavendra\u2019s properly presented arguments, we hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">AFFIRM IN PART the order of the district court, because we find that the settlement agreement was binding and disposed of all of plaintiffs claims, and VACATE the award of attorneys fees and REMAND for further factual findings consistent with this order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
