On appeal, Abraham argues that the district court erred when it imposed a consecutive seven-year sentence on Count Three pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(l)(A)(ii) because he did not brandish a firearm. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-23\">We review de novo questions of statutory interpretation arising from the imposition of a sentence. <em>See United States v. Brandon, </em>247 F.3d 186, 188 (4th Cir.2001). Section 924(c)(1)(A) requires the imposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>tion of a consecutive five-year sentence where a defendant possesses a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence; however, \u201cif the firearm is brandished, [the defendant shall] be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii). For purposes of \u00a7 924(c), \u201cbrandish\u201d is defined as \u201cto display all or part of the firearm, or otherwise make the presence of the firearm known to another person, in order to intimidate that person, regardless of whether the firearm is directly visible to that person.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Abraham does not dispute that he engaged in a conspiracy in which his coconspirators brandished firearms. Instead, he argues that, because he personally did not \u201cdisplay\u201d the firearm, he lacked the specific intent required to have brandished the firearm and, therefore, be subject to the enhanced statutory penalty.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> However, \u201c[a] defendant may be convicted of a \u00a7 924(c) charge on the basis of a coconspirator\u2019s use of a gun if the use was in furtherance of the conspiracy and was reasonably foreseeable to the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>135 F.3d 291, 305 (4th Cir.1998). Because it was reasonably foreseeable that Abraham\u2019s coconspirators would brandish firearms in furtherance of the conspiracy and they did, in fact, do so, we hold that the district court did not err in subjecting Abraham to the enhanced penalties found in \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\"> Abraham seeks support from the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Dean v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 568, 129 S.Ct. 1849, 1853-54, 173 L.Ed.2d 785 (2009), of \u00a7 924(c)(4)\u2019s requirement that \u201d[t]he defendant must have intended to brandish the firearm\u201d for a specific purpose. <em>Dean </em>does not bolster Abraham\u2019s argument, however, as it does not speak to the concept of coconspirator liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
