He also pleaded guilty to a specific count of interstate travel for purposes of prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952(a)(3) and (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-23\">Quoting his brief, Barham raises the following questions on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-24\">1. Was appellant\u2019s guideline range mistakenly calculated because it was based on the treatment of victims as minors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>2. Is remand within the Court\u2019s discretion because the sentence was excessive?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkO\">Appellant\u2019s Brief, p. 4. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Barham asserts that the District Court mistakenly applied U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2G1.3 (2007) because he did not personally victimize any minors. Barham failed to preserve this issue and we review it for plain error. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>302 F.3d 139, 153 (3d Cir.2002).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Evidence before the District Court contradicts Barham\u2019s argument, showing that he prostituted a seventeen year-old girl. He also ignores the relevance of conduct of his co-conspirators who prostituted over forty minors. Given Bar-ham\u2019s admitted interaction with his co-conspirators, and the routine recruitment of minors that was pervasive in the conspiracy, there is no question that this conduct is attributable to him. Moreover, Barham\u2019s sentence of 108 months was calculated from the statutory m\u00e1ximums that resulted from his plea agreement. We conclude from all of this that the District Court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Barham also appeals the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. Yet, in its consideration of Barham\u2019s sentence, the District Court took into account the factors enumerated under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and assessed the reasonableness of the plea bargain sentence, weighing his role in the conspiracy with the gravity of the offense. We conclude that his sentence of 108 months is eminently reasonable and will affirm the judgment of sentence of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-8\">. Barham moved for permission not to attend a presentence evidentiary hearing, plainly stating in the motion that he was withdrawing his objections to the Report.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
