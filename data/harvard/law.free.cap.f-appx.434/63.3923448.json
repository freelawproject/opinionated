The District Court dismissed the petition, ruling that Stanko\u2019s claims were not appropriately brought in habeas because he did not challenge the fact or duration of his confinement. Stanko appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">We affirmed the District Court\u2019s order insofar as it had dismissed Stanko\u2019s claims about the conditions of his confinement because, as the District Court had pointed out, Stanko could not present such claims in a habeas petition. <em>See Stanko v. Obama, </em>398 Fed.Appx. 777, 778 (3d Cir.2010). However, we vacated the order to the extent that it had dismissed Stanko\u2019s challenge to the validity of disciplinary proceedings that had served to lengthen the time that he would spend in jail. <em>See id. </em>at 778-79 (citing, among other cases, <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 646-47, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-14\">On remand, in accordance with our mandate, and after soliciting a response from the warden<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and allowing a reply from Stanko, the District Court considered Stanko\u2019s claims that sounded in habeas. The District Court denied Stanko\u2019s petition. Stanko appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-15\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We \u201cexercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact.\u201d <em>See O\u2019Donald v. Johns, </em>402 F.3d 172, 173 n. 1 (3d Cir. 2005); <em>see also United States v. Friedland, </em>83 F.3d 1531, 1542 (3d Cir.1996) (\u201cOur review of the district court\u2019s order denying ... relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 is plenary.\u201d). Upon review, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment because no substantial issue is presented on appeal. <em>See </em>Local Rule 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-16\">Stanko alleged that his right to due process of law was violated in the disciplinary proceedings which resulted in the loss of 27 days of good conduct time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Due process protections attach in prison disciplinary proceedings in which the loss of good-time credits is at stake. <em>See Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 564-65, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). In <em>Wolff, </em>the Supreme Court held that an inmate must receive \u201c(1) advance written notice of the disciplinary charges; (2) an opportunity, when consistent with institutional safety and correctional goals, to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in his defense; and (3) a written statement by the factfinder of the evidence relied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action.\u201d <em>Superintendent v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">In <em>Hill, </em>the Supreme Court further explained that to meet the minimum requirements of due process, the findings of the prison disciplinary board must also be supported by some evidence in the record. <em>See id. </em>The \u201csome evidence\u201d standard \u201cdoes not require examination of the entire record, independent assessment of the credibility of witnesses, or weighing of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455, 105 S.Ct. 2768. \u201c[T]he relevant question is whether there is any evidence in the record that could support the conclusion reached by the disciplinary board.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">As the District Court explained with citations to the record, Stanko received advance written notice of the disciplinary charge on February 5, 2009, upon completion of the investigation into whether he had made threats that he would file liens against prison staff members. On that same day, he received notice of his rights in disciplinary proceedings. Stanko\u2019s hearing was held on February 12, 2009. At his hearing, where he was represented by an appointed staff member, Stanko had the opportunity to present evidence and call witnesses. Stanko, himself, provided a statement at his hearing; he also presented a statement from another witness (the inmate who notarized the documents containing the language construed as threats). At the conclusion of his hearing, Stanko was given a written statement of the evidence relied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action against him. In short, Stanko received the procedural protections set forth in <em>Wolff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">Furthermore, there is evidence in the record to support the finding of the disciplinary hearing officer that Stanko had \u201cinterfered with staff in the performance of their duties, most like, threatening another with any other offense.\u201d Stanko contended that he was merely filing requests for administrative remedies and did not, and was not attempting to, file a lien against any staff members. However, within the documents that Stanko deemed requests for administrative remedies, Stanko included language that if the claims were not \u201crebutted point for point categorically within three (3) months,\u201d they would become liens on all property and rights of the prison officials he named. He stated that the Federal Bureau of Prisons would serve as a \u201csurety\u201d and pay any money due not covered by the liens. At his hearing, Stanko asserted that he felt that he had \u201ca right to file this with surety.\u201d Accordingly, there is some evidence in the record that Stanko interfered with staff in the performance of their duties by making threats to file liens. As the District Court noted, the penalties imposed were consis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>tent with sanctions set forth in the relevant regulations. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Stanko made an additional argument, which the District Court misconstrued. The District Court took Stanko\u2019s statements about the prison\u2019s non-compliance with the \u201c24-hour rule\u201d to be a claim that Stanko did not receive advance notice of the charge (which he clearly did, see <em>supra). </em>Stanko instead (or additionally) asserted that his right to due process was violated because he was not charged with a disciplinary infraction within 24 hours of the time at which staff became aware of his involvement in the incident. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.15(a) (stating that the written charges \u201cordinarily\u201d should be given to the inmate within that time period). According to Stanko and at least some of the prison\u2019s records, the incident occurred, or prison officials became aware of the incident, on December 10, 2008. It is undisputed that Stanko did not get notice of the charge until February 5, 2009, one day after the conclusion of an investigation on February 4, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">However, even if the regulation were violated, its violation is not actionable in this case. Stanko cannot show.'that his right to due process was violated by a possible technical non-compliance-with the regulation where <em>Wolff </em>does not require issuance of the charge within 24 hours of the incident and where any delay did not prejudice him. <em>See Wilson v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 377, 380 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Von Kahl v. Brennan, </em>855 F.Supp. 1413, 1421 (M.D.Pa.1994) (explaining that \u201cat least in situations where the minimal requirements of due process have been met, an inmate must show prejudice to the rights sought to be protected by the regulation claimed to be violated\u201d). Also, although Stanko has a liberty interest in his good time credits, he did not show that the regulation itself created a liberty or property interest such that its violation abridged his due process rights. <em>See, e.g., Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 487, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">For these reasons, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-11\">. The District Court dismissed President Obama as a party to this action because\u2019 a writ of habeas corpus is properly directed to a petitioner\u2019s custodian, <em>see 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2243, in this case the warden of the facility where Stanko was confined at the time he filed his petition, <em>see Rumsfeld v. Padilla, </em>542 U.S. 426, 442, 124 S.Ct. 2711, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004). (As the District Court also noted, Stanko's transfer to another prison, which was not authorized pursuant Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, did not divest it (or us) of jurisdiction over this case.) <em>See Barden v. Keohane, </em>921 F.2d 476, 477 n. 1 (3d Cir. 1990); <em>cf. Padilla, </em>542 U.S. at 441, 124 S.Ct. 2711; <em>Ex parte Endo, </em>323 U.S. 283, 307, 65 S.Ct. 208, 89 L.Ed. 243 (1944).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b87-18\">. He also argued that his disciplinary hearing and its result constituted an unlawful bill of attainder, but this argument is a non-starter. <em>See United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>384 n. 30, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968) (defining a bill of attainder as \"a legislative Act which inflicts punishment on named individuals or members of an easily ascertainable group without a judicial trial\"). Neither a disciplinary hearing nor its result was a legislative act and thus, neither could constitute a bill of attainder.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
