Davis appeals, contending that the district court committed procedural error by rejecting, without an adequate explanation, his argument for a sentence below the Guidelines range based on the anticipated elimination of \u201crecency\u201d points for criminal history under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.1(e) (2009). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">Davis\u2019 criminal history score included two points awarded under USSG \u00a7 4Al.l(e) for having committed the instant offense less than two years after his release from confinement on a prior sentence. At his sentencing hearing in July 2010, Davis objected to the inclusion of these two points on the ground that the Sentencing Commission had submitted a proposed amendment to Congress to eliminate \u00a7 4Al.l(e) and consideration of the recency of a defendant\u2019s release from a prior sentence which would take effect in November 2010 unless Congress acted to block it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court overruled his objection and subsequently declined to impose a variance sentence below the advisory Guidelines range on the same ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-15\">We review a sentence for procedural and substantive reasonableness, <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), first ensuring that the district court did not commit any \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d such as failing to properly calculate the applicable Guidelines range, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2010) factors, or failing to adequately explain the sentence. <em>Id. </em>When either party \u201cpresents non-frivolous reasons for impos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ing a different sentence than that set forth in the advisory Guidelines, a district judge should address the party\u2019s arguments and explain why he has rejected those arguments.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If no procedural error occurred, we presume that a sentence within a properly calculated Guidelines range is reasonable. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Davis argues that the inclusion of the two criminal history points under \u00a7 4Al.l(e)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> resulted in a Guidelines range that was greater than necessary, to meet the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a). He maintains that he presented a non-frivolous argument for a sentence below the Guidelines range \u2014 the proposed elimination of recency points \u2014 but the district court did not provide an explanation that permits \u201cmeaningful appellate review,\u201d as required by <em>Carter, </em>564 F.3d at 330 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50-51, 128 S.Ct. at 597). Davis argues that the district court\u2019s explanation for imposing a sentence within the Guidelines range was not coherent, that the appeals court may not guess at the district court\u2019s reason for rejecting his request for a variance, and that resentenc-ing is necessary so that the district court may more clearly explain its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">We disagree. The district court adequately responded to Davis\u2019 argument for a below-Guidelines sentence by explaining that Davis\u2019 continued criminal conduct after release from a prior sentence indicated that he had not decided to end his criminal activity. As a result, the court did not believe that the proposed change in the Guidelines warranted a sentence below the Guidelines range. The court\u2019s explanation was brief but sufficient to comply with <em>Gall </em>and <em>Carter. </em>Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not commit procedural error and the within-Guidelines sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-16\">. <em>See </em>USSG App. C, Amendment 742, eff. Nov. 1, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b225-7\">. The district court did not clearly err in overruling Davis\u2019 objection to his criminal history score, correct under the applicable 2009 Guidelines Manual. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 IB 1.11(a) (sentencing court shall use Guidelines effect on date of sentencing).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
