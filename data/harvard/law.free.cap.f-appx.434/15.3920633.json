Mar. 4, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006). Because Chai\u2019s motion was untimely, as it was filed approximately five years after the final administrative decision, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), reopening could be granted only upon a showing of changed country conditions or through the BIA\u2019s exercise of its authority to reopen <em>sua sponte, </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Because Chai does not challenge the BIA\u2019s finding that he failed to demonstrate a change in country conditions, the only issue before us is whether the BIA erred in declining to reopen his case <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to reopen Chai\u2019s case <em>sua sponte </em>under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), because that decision was \u201centirely discretionary.\u201d <em>Ali, </em>448 F.3d at 518. Whereas in <em>Mah-mood v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 466, 471 (2d Cir.2009), we vacated and remanded the agency\u2019s decision because it was based on an erroneous legal assumption, here, the BIA declined to exercise its discretion to reopen Chai\u2019s case because he failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances. <em>See Guyadin v. Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 465, 468-69 (2d Cir.2006) (emphasizing that it is not possible to create jurisdiction over a discretionary determination by simply framing a challenge to such a determination as a legal question). Because the BIA\u2019s conclusion that there were no exceptional circumstances was based on its factual findings regarding the country conditions, there is no basis for this Court to exercise jurisdiction. <em>Cf. Mahmood, </em>570 F.3d at 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">To the extent Chai challenges the BIA\u2019s review of the record, we have jurisdiction to consider that argument because it is a question of law. <em>See Luna v. Holder, </em>637 F.3d 85, 92 (2d Cir.2011). Given the BIA\u2019s explicit references to the documentation submitted with the motion to reopen, there is no basis to find that it ignored any evidence. <em>See Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 275 (2d Cir. 2006) (holding that the BIA is not required to \u201cexpressly parse or refute on the record each individual argument or piece of evidence offered by the petitioner\u201d as long as it \u201chas given reasoned consideration to the petition, and made adequate findings\u201d); <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 337 n. 17 (2d Cir.2006) (presuming that the agency \u201chas taken into account all of the evidence before [it], unless the record compellingly suggests otherwise\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
