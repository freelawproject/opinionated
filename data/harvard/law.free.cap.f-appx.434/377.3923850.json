The district court denied the motion because the un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>derlying lawsuit has been dismissed, <em>see Butler v. Pendergraff, </em>No. 10-20328 (Sept. 3, 2010) (unpublished), and it denied Butler\u2019s request for leave to proceed IFP because Butler is subject to the three-strikes sanction of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Butler v. Strong, </em>No. H-10-5225 (S.D.Tex. Jan. 26, 2011) (recognizing that Butler is subject to \u00a7 1915(g) bar).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">By moving to proceed IFP, Butler is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Thus, his request \u201cmust be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This court\u2019s inquiry into a litigant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Under Section 1915(g), a prisoner may not proceed IFP in a civil action or in an appeal of a judgment in a civil action if he has, on three or more prior occasions, brought an action or appeal that was dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or for failure to state a claim, unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. \u00a7 1915(g). Butler contends that he suffers from various physical maladies, and that the Texas Department of Criminal Justice will not provide him with \u201cstem cell surgery\u201d recommended by his physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Butler does not state, and the record does not reflect, that his health problems have anything to do with the denial-of-access-to-the-courts claim asserted in his original complaint. <em>See Adepegba v. Ham-mons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996) (to proceed IFP, civil rights claims of prisoner subject to statutory sanction must be related to imminent danger of serious physical injury). Because Butler has not shown that he wishes to raise a nonfrivolous issue with respect to the district court\u2019s order requiring him to pay the appellate filing fee or with respect to its order dismissing the motion for change of venue, his request for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
