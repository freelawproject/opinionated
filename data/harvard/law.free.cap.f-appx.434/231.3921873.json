We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-23\">On appeal Spencer first contends that his plea was unknowing and involuntary because the. district court made misrepresentations of law and fact at his plea hearing. Because Spencer withdrew his motion to withdraw his guilty plea in the district court and did not raise any objections during the Rule 11 plea colloquy, the plea colloquy is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. General, </em>278 F.3d 389, 393 (4th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 524-27 (4th Cir.2002). To demonstrate plain error, a defendant must show that: (1) there was an error; (2) the error was plain; and (3) the error affected his \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). A defendant\u2019s substantial rights are affected if the court determines that the error \u201cinfluenced the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty and impaired his ability to evaluate with eyes open the direct attendant risks of accepting criminal responsibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Goins, </em>51 F.3d 400, 402-03 (4th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Martinez, </em>277 F.3d at 532 (holding that defendant must demonstrate he would not have pled guilty but for the error). Our review of the record indicates that the district court did not err, much less plainly so, in accepting Spencer\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-24\">Next Spencer contends that the district court erred in failing to adequately consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>er the statutory sentencing factors and to adequately state its reasons for the chosen sentence. This court reviews a sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Lay-ton, </em>564 F.3d 330, 335 (4th Cir.2009). In so doing, the court first examines the sentence for \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d including \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The district court is not required to \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006). However, the district court \u201cmust place on the record an \u2018individualized assessment\u2019 based on the particular facts of the case before it. This individualized assessment need not be elaborate or lengthy, but it must provide a rationale tailored to the particular case at hand and adequate to permit \u2018meaningful appellate review.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Garter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586) (internal footnote omitted). A reviewing court then considers the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. After reviewing the record, we conclude that Spencer\u2019s sentence was both procedurally and substantively reasonable.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Lastly, Spencer claims that the district court failed to depart pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K2.13 (2009) because it did not understand the extent of its authority to do so. \u201cAn appellate court lacks the authority to review a sentencing court\u2019s denial of a downward departure unless the court failed to understand its authority to do so.\u201d <em>United States v. Herder, </em>594 F.3d 352, 362 (4th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the district court clearly understood its authority to depart from the Guidelines, we lack authority to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b254-5\"> In concluding that the basis for the district court\u2019s chosen sentence articulated at the sentencing hearing fully satisfied <em>Gall\u2019s </em>requirements, we reject Spencer\u2019s argument that the court\u2019s failure to also prepare a written statement explaining its decision to sentence him outside of the applicable Guidelines range constitutes reversible error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
