We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We grant the petition and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-20\">1. \u201cWe have long held that the BIA abuses its discretion when it fails to provide a reasoned explanation for its actions.\u201d <em>Movsisian v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1095, 1098 (9th Cir.2005). A rational system of law requires similar treatment of identical asylum claims, or, at the very least, a reasonable explanation of inconsistent treatment. <em>See Njuguna v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 765, 771 m 4 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 1015, 1019 n. 2 (9th Cir.2003). Here, the government failed to provide any explanation for why it denied Rahman\u2019s application for asylum but granted his older sister\u2019s. Both siblings\u2019 applications were based on the detention and abuse of their mother, Tajrina Rahman, and on the mother\u2019s captors\u2019 threat to kidnap and kill her children. We remand with instructions that the agency provide an explanation for the inconsistent treatment of Rahman\u2019s application and that of his sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-21\">2. \u201cThe government in immigration cases may be subject to equitable estoppel if it has engaged in affirmative misconduct.\u201d <em>Salgado-Diaz v. Gonzales, </em>395 F.3d 1158, 1165 (9th Cir.2005). The government has a duty to adjudicate applications for asylum. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 555(b); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 103.2(b)(19), 208.14, 208.19. The record contains no evidence as to whether the government ever issued a final decision on the asylum application Tajrina Rahman filed in 1993, on which she listed Rahman as a derivative beneficiary. At oral argument and in response to our April 7, 2011 order, the government asserted that the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) \u201cdenied\u201d Rahman\u2019s mother\u2019s asylum application. However, the only evidence in the record as to the status of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Tajrina Rahman\u2019s application is a July 14, 1997 letter in which the asylum office informed her that it had recommended approval of her application.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The record reflects that the government attorney was prepared stipulate to the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) granting Rahman asylum as soon as the grant of asylum to Rahman\u2019s mother became final. The IJ postponed the hearing on the merits of Rahman\u2019s asylum claim several times in order to provide additional time for the agency to issue a final approval of his mother\u2019s asylum application. At an immigration court hearing on July 25, 2002, government counsel stated that the government \u201clost the file\u201d of the Rahman family.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">On remand, the BIA shall determine whether the government\u2019s loss of Tajrina Rahman\u2019s file and failure to adjudicate her asylum application for over a decade constitutes affirmative misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The petition for review is GRANTED and the case is REMANDED. The panel retains jurisdiction for purposes of any future appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b673-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
