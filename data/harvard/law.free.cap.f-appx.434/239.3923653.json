Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Administrative findings of fact, including findings on credibility, are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2006). Legal issues are reviewed de novo, \u201caffording appropriate deference to the [Board]\u2019s interpretation of the [Immigration and Nationality Act] and any attendant regulations.\u201d <em>Li Fang Lin v. Mukasey, </em>517 F.3d 685, 691-92 (4th Cir.2008). This court will reverse the Board only if \u201cthe evidence ... presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812; <em>see Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he agency decision that an alien is not eligible for asylum is \u2018conclusive unless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maryn-enka v. Holder, </em>592 F.3d 594, 600 (4th Cir.2010) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-23\">We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding. We further conclude that Awantang failed to present sufficient independent evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>of past persecution, notwithstanding the adverse credibility determination, as discussed in <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 370 (4th Cir.2004). We therefore uphold the denial of Awantang\u2019s requests for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 367 (\u201cBecause the burden of <em>proof for </em>withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Finally, we find that substantial evidence supports the finding that Awantang failed to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2010). We find that Awantang failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-10\"> In upholding the denial of relief, we specifically reject Awantang\u2019s claim that the agency erred in admitting an investigative report conducted by U.S. State Department Special Agent Miguel A. Eversley, and find that consideration of the report was not fundamentally unfair. <em>See Anim v. Mukasey, </em>535 F.3d 243, 256 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
