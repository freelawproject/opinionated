TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b758-21\">Jesus Robles was convicted of conspiracy to possess, and possession of, marijuana with the intent to distribute. He challenges his conviction, arguing the district court erred by admitting testimony of pri- or, uncharged misconduct. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) such evidence is admissible if it is inextricably intertwined or intrinsic to the charged crime. Because we find the evidence was intrinsic to the charged conspiracy and probative of Robles\u2019s involvement, we conclude the district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-22\">Accordingly, exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-23\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A40\">A. DEA Investigation and Arrest</p>\n<p id=\"b758-24\">In February 2009, a DEA agent performing hotel interdiction duties in Kansas City, Kansas, noticed a Mexican national, Taurino Cereceres-Morales, had checked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>into a Best Western motel. Cereeeres-Morales had presented a Mexican electoral card for identification, paid with cash, and did not have a car. Suspicious of these circumstances, the agent searched law enforcement databases for his name and returned no matches. But a 2003 DEA investigation had come across a marijuana shipment addressed to \u201cTaurino Cere-ceres,\u201d and, with this information, the agent began surveillance of Cereeeres-Morales. Over the next several days, Robles and Juan Morales both joined Cere-ceres-Morales at the motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">On February 17, 2009, the three men rented a U-Haul, drove to a Yellow Freight facility, and obtained a shipment of 40 boxes, which were labeled as containing cookies. The three drove to the home of Joel Areguin and unloaded the boxes into his garage. At this point, DEA agents approached the garage and identified themselves. After speaking with the men, the agents received written consent to search the premises from Areguin as well as Morales, who was renting a room in Areguin\u2019s home. All four men denied ownership of the 40 boxes in the garage. The agents searched the boxes and discovered 7 boxes contained marijuana and cookies, and the remaining 33 boxes held only cookies. In total, the 7 boxes contained 221 bundles of marijuana. The four men were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The DEA agents seized documents and cell phones from the men. Cereeeres-Morales had a phone number and address for Morales and a phone number for Robles. When interviewed by a DEA agent, Robles had no form of identification, and said he was staying at a residence in Kansas City but could not produce an address. He claimed he was at the residence all day the previous day. Robles, when told he had been seen at a restaurant with the other men as well as driving the U-Haul truck, stated Morales had rented the U-Haul and denied any knowledge of the marijuana. During the interview, Robles\u2019s phone received a push-to-talk call from someone identified as \u201cMoo Moo\u201d in the phone\u2019s contact list, which was later identified as being Jorge Cabada.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">B. Post-Arrest Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">In the ensuing investigation, the DEA learned Robles\u2019s flight to Kansas City was paid for by Jorge Cabada and the email associated with the flight belonged to \u201cGeorge Cabada,\u201d believed to be the same person. Robles had flown to Kansas City under the alias \u201cIsaac Botello\u201d and entered the same name in the Yellow Freight visitor\u2019s log when picking up the marijuana. Isaac Botello was a real person who lived in California and had a California driver\u2019s license. DEA agents discovered a Missouri state identity card with the name Isaac Anthony Botello, and the same date of birth as the Isaac Botello in California, but with a picture looking like Robles. Cereeeres-Morales also listed Cabada\u2019s cell phone as a local contact number when checking into the Best Western motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">The DEA subpoenaed and analyzed the phone records for the cell phones from Robles, Cereeeres-Morales, Morales, and two from Cabada, as well as phones from the Best Western motel and other phone numbers discovered in the investigation. The government analyzed phone records over the period from February 1-23, 2009 and discovered numerous contacts between the phones. Robles\u2019s phone connected twice with a Best Western phone, 35 times with Morales\u2019s phone, and 29 times with the second Cabada phone. Morales\u2019s phone connected with the first Cabada phone 25 times, a Best Western phone 44 times, and the second Cabada phone 4 times. Because Cereceres-Morales\u2019s cell phone used an international number origi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>nating in Mexico, the DEA could not obtain records for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Robles, along with Cereceres-Morales and Morales, was indicted and charged \u25a0with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana, and possession with intent to distribute the same. The conspiracy was alleged to have occurred on or about February 17, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">C. Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Before trial, Robles filed a motion in limine to exclude under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) any evidence of any prior, uncharged marijuana distribution by him. At a pre-trial hearing, the government argued it would offer evidence that was \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of the charged conspiracy, and therefore Rule 404(b) would not apply because the evidence did not pertain to a separate, prior act. R., Vol. 2 at 394. Robles argued the information concerned events several years prior to the charged conspiracy, had no bearing on an alleged conspiracy in February 2009, and should be excluded under Rule 404(b). The district court concluded preliminarily that the evidence should not be excluded under Rule 404(b), under the assumption \u201cthe government\u2019s evidence is going to tie this all into the same conspiracy,\u201d but nevertheless kept the motion under advisement subject to trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">At trial, the government called Iran Rodriguez to testify about Robles\u2019s involvement in marijuana distribution with Cabada. Robles objected on the grounds the testimony was irrelevant, inadmissible, and highly prejudicial. He argued there was no evidence directly connecting Cabada to the charged conspiracy and the government was attempting to make Robles appear guilty simply through association with Cabada. The government responded that Cabada was an unindicted co-conspirator in the conspiracy at issue and that Rodriguez would testify to substantive offenses in the ongoing marijuana distribution conspiracy. The district court overruled the objection and permitted Rodriguez to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">Rodriguez identified Cabada from a photograph and testified he met Cabada in 2002 and socialized with him at the time, but had no contact with him for at least the past 18 months. Rodriguez also identified Robles from a photograph. He had met Robles through Cabada, said Cabada and Robles were cousins, and felt he had a good relationship with Robles.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">Rodriguez then testified about Robles and Cabada\u2019s involvement in the distribution of marijuana. Robles objected to the line of questioning, arguing it was improper Rule 404(b) evidence going to propensity. The government responded that Rodriguez\u2019s testimony related to actions that were \u201cpart and parcel of the same conspiracy,\u201d R., Vol. 2 at 1344, and stated it would connect Cabada\u2019s marijuana distribution to the time period of the charged conspiracy. The court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">Rodriguez testified Cabada had told him about his marijuana distribution. Rodriguez had also overheard Cabada\u2019s discussions about matters regarding marijuana, money, and deliveries. Further, Rodriguez testified that, at some point between July 2008 and February 2009, Robles stated he was involved in distributing marijuana with Cabada.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">The jury convicted Robles on both counts. Morales was acquitted and Cere-ceres-Morales eventually pleaded guilty. Robles moved for a new trial, arguing Rodriguez\u2019s testimony should have been excluded under either Rule 404(b) or Rule 403. The district court denied the motion. It held Rodriguez\u2019s testimony was not Rule 404(b) evidence because the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>of Robles and Cabada\u2019s marijuana distribution between July 2008 and February 2009 was \u201cinextricably intertwined \"with the conspiracy.\u201d R., Vol. 1 at 251. The court also concluded the probative value of the testimony was not substantially outweighed by any danger of unfair prejudice or misleading the jury. The court sentenced Robles to 64 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">On appeal, Robles challenges the district court\u2019s admission of Rodriguez\u2019s testimony. He argues the testimony was impermissible under Rule 404(b), or alternatively, should have been excluded under Rule 403. We disagree. The testimony was properly admitted as intrinsic evidence of the charged marijuana distribution conspiracy, and its probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or misleading the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">A. Rule 404(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">We review a district court\u2019s admission of evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>441 F.3d 1152, 1156 (10th Cir.2006). We will not reverse a court\u2019s decision if it \u201cfalls within the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances and is not arbitrary, capricious or whimsical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and bracket omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">Rule 404(b) prohibits the admission of evidence of <em>\u201cother </em>crimes, wrongs or acts\u201d to prove an individual\u2019s character or propensity. Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) (emphasis added). \u201cRule 404(b) only applies to evidence of acts extrinsic to the crime charged.\u201d <em>United States v. Arney, </em>248 F.3d 984, 992 (10th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>United States v. Green, </em>175 F.3d 822, 831 (10th Cir.1999)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">\u201cIt is well settled that Rule 404(b) does not apply to other act evidence that is intrinsic to the crime charged.\u201d <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>131 F.3d 1428, 1432 (10th Cir.1997). \u201cOther act evidence is intrinsic when the evidence of the other act and the evidence of the crime charged are inextricably intertwined or both acts are part of a single criminal episode or the other acts were necessary preliminaries to the crime charged.\u201d <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>995 F.2d 1006, 1007 (10th Cir. 1993) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-13\">We have previously found acts occurring before a charged conspiracy to be intrinsic evidence because they were \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with that conspiracy. <em>See O\u2019Brien, </em>131 F.3d at 1432 (admitting ledger from a gambling operation that included entries outside the charged period of the conspiracy because they were intertwined with the charged criminal acts).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-14\">Here, we must determine whether Rodriguez\u2019s testimony regarding Robles and Cabada\u2019s marijuana distribution pertained to actions intrinsic to the charged marijuana conspiracy \u2014 making Rule 404(b) inapplicable \u2014 or concerned acts extrinsic to it \u2014 bringing the testimony within the scope of Rule 404(b). Robles argues the district court erroneously admitted Rodriguez\u2019s testimony. He claims his prior marijuana distribution with Cabada was extrinsic to the charged conspiracy and was subject to Rule 404(b) prohibition on the use of prior bad acts to show a defendant\u2019s character or propensity. We disagree. After a careful review of the record, we find Rodriguez\u2019s testimony was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>evidence of Robles and Cabada\u2019s relationship as well as their ongoing marijuana distribution and was intrinsic to the charged marijuana distribution conspiracy. Therefore, Rule 404(b) does not apply and the district court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Nonetheless, Robles contends the government did not charge an ongoing conspiracy and claims his distribution of marijuana with Cabada occurred at some unspecified point prior to the charged date of the conspiracy \u2014 \u201con or about February 17, 2009.\u201d Rodriguez\u2019s testimony, however, was that between July 2008 and February 2009 Robles stated he was distributing marijuana with Cabada. That is, Robles was distributing marijuana in the time leading up to the charged marijuana distribution conspiracy. Although the indictment alleges the conspiracy occurred around February 17, 2009, that does not preclude the existence of an uncharged conspiracy beginning before the charged term.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Next, Robles claims there is no link between his marijuana distribution with Cabada and the charged conspiracy. But the district court found Cabada was connected to the charged conspiracy and cited various pieces of evidence supporting this finding. <em>See </em>R., Vol. 1 at 250 &amp; n. 1. Robles does not show why this finding is clearly erroneous. Nor do we see any reason to question it.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Finally, Robles argues the two conspiracies are not inextricably intertwined because they are temporally removed, not part of a single criminal episode, and not preliminary to each other. As discussed, the two conspiracies involved the same people, same drugs, same offenses, and similar time periods. Thus, Robles\u2019s arguments are unpersuasive and fail to show the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">In addition, the district court clearly focused on whether Rodriguez\u2019s testimony related to the charged conspiracy. In fact, during Rodriguez\u2019s testimony the court called the government to the bench and warned that it was unclear whether his testimony related to the charged conspiracy. The court directed the government to elicit testimony from Rodriguez demonstrating it involved the same conspiracy. The government then specifically questioned Rodriguez regarding Robles\u2019s involvement with Cabada in the marijuana distribution and its approximate time frame. After eliciting this testimony, the government approached the bench to confirm with the court that it had sufficiently tied Robles and Cabada\u2019s marijuana distribution together. The court confirmed the substance of Rodriguez\u2019s testimony with the government \u2014 that Robles had told Rodriguez he was distributing marijuana with Cabada \u2014 and overruled the objection to the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">The district court admitted evidence of prior marijuana distribution by Robles and Cabada, finding they were \u201cinextricably intertwined with the conspiracy charged in the indictment.\u201d R., Vol. 1 at 251. Because Rodriguez\u2019s testimony was intrinsic evidence of the conspiracy, Rule 404(b) did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">In short, the district court\u2019s decision to admit Rodriguez\u2019s testimony was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">B. Rule 403</p>\n<p id=\"b762-11\">Robles also argues the district court should have excluded Rodriguez\u2019s testimony under Rule 403. While not covered by Rule 404(b), intrinsic evidence is still subject to the requirements of Rule 403, which provides that relevant evidence \u201cmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>prejudice ... or misleading the jury....\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Rodriguez\u2019s testimony was clearly probative of Robles\u2019s relationship with Cabada and his involvement in the marijuana distribution conspiracy. While a connection to a drug distribution conspiracy is prejudicial in the wider sense, we do not find the probative value of Rodriguez\u2019s testimony was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice or misleading the jury. Robles argues the evidence was prejudicial, but fails to show how the evidence caused <em>unfair </em>prejudice or misled the jury. The government\u2019s case centered around the allegation that Robles was involved in a marijuana distribution conspiracy that included Cabada. Rodriguez\u2019s testimony regarding Robles\u2019s participation in marijuana distribution with Cabada is not unfairly prejudicial because it relates to the heart of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted Rodriguez\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Robles\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b758-25\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel.
