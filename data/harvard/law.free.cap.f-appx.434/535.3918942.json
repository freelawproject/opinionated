We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-16\">In 2006, following a bench trial, the district court found Djoumessi guilty as charged of willfully holding a minor female in involuntary servitude, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1584, conspiracy to hold the victim in involuntary servitude, see <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 371, 1584, and harboring an alien for private financial gain, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324. We affirmed Djoumessi\u2019s convictions. <em>United States v. Djoumessi, </em>538 F.3d 547 (6th Cir.2008). Djoumessi petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, and the Court denied his petition on January 12, 2009. <em>Djoumessi v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 948, 173 L.Ed.2d 145 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-21\">On January 25, 2010, Djoumessi filed a motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 after the expiration of the one-year statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 2255(f)(1). Djoumessi claimed that the district court should permit the filing of the motion pursuant to the doctrine of equitable tolling for two reasons: (1) he mistakenly believed that the deadline for his motion was January 26, 2010, which was one year from the time the district court docketed the Supreme Court\u2019s letter indicating that certiorari had been denied; and (2) he was denied access to his legal documents for a period of seventy-one days during his transfer from state to federal custody after being paroled from his state convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-22\">The district court denied Djoumessi\u2019s untimely motion because, although the statute of limitations could be tolled, <em>see Holland v. Florida, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 2560, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010), and <em>Robertson v. Simpson, </em>624 F.3d 781, 784 (6th Cir.2010), Djoumessi failed to demonstrate the requisite extraordinary circumstances and diligence necessary to warrant equitable tolling. Nevertheless, the district court granted Djoumessi a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether his \u00a7 2255 motion is barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-25\">In these circumstances, we review the district court\u2019s decision regarding equita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>ble tolling for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Robertson, </em>624 F.3d at 784. Having carefully considered the record on appeal, the briefs of the parties, and the applicable law, we conclude that a panel opinion further addressing this issue would be dupli-cative and serve no jurisprudential purpose. We are satisfied, for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s thorough, well-written opinion of November 17, 2010, that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Djoumessi\u2019s belated \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-17\">. In 2001, Djoumessi was convicted by a jury in the Michigan circuit court of third-degree criminal sexual conduct and third-degree child abuse, stemming from the same events that led to the subsequent federal charges. His convictions and sentence of nine to fifteen years of imprisonment were affirmed by the Michigan Court of Appeals and the Michigan Supreme Court. <em>See People v. Djoumessi, </em>No. 238631, 2003 WL 22439688 (Mich.Ct.App. Oct.28, 2003) (unpublished), and 471 Mich. 866, 683 N.W.2d 672 (2004) (table), respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
