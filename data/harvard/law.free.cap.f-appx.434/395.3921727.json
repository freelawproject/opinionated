The property is subject to certain liens from two loans Vongkham entered into in 2005. According to the complaint, defendant JP Morgan Chase Bank claims to hold the note and deed of trust to the property and defendant Chase Home Finance claims to be the current mortgage servicer of the underlying loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-22\">Val-Com and Vongkham brought suit against the defendants, with Val-Com acting as authorized agent or attorney-in-fact of Vongkham with respect to the property. They alleged a variety of claims, all of which the district court dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The plaintiffs appeal only the dismissal of their Declaratory Judgment Act claims. They seek declarations of whether JP Morgan Chase is the owner and/or holder of the note and deed of trust, whether Chase Home Finance is the mortgage ser-vicer, and whether the defendants are entitled to enforce the note and deed of trust by means of a non-judicial foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-23\">The Declaratory Judgment Act authorizes the federal courts to \u201cdeclare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such a declaration may issue only '-to resolve an actual controversy between the parties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An actual controversy is a ; dispute that is \u201cdefinite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The controversy \u201c \u2018must be such that it can presently be litigated and decided and not hypotheti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>cal, conjectural, conditional or based upon the possibility of a factual situation that may never develop.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs have the burden of establishing the existence of an actual controversy under the Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Here, the plaintiffs have failed to carry that burden. The plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint does not allege \u2014 even on information and belief \u2014 that JP Morgan Chase is not the owner and/or holder of the note and deed of trust, that Chase Home Finance is not the mortgage servicer, or that the defendants have no right to enforce the note and deed of trust by administering a non-judicial foreclosure sale. While there could be a dispute between the parties, absent any allegation that defendants lack the interests they claim in the property, that dispute has not ripened into an actual controversy. Any such dispute is, at this point, hypothetical or conjectural. As a result, the district court was correct to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
