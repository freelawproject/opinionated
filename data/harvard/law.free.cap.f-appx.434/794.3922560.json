Arnold, United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b817-9\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">Wellington Specialty Insurance Company, an Arizona corporation, appeals from an adverse summary judgment declaring that insurance coverage exists under a policy it issued to Kendall Crane Service, a Florida corporation, for an accident in which Juan Francisco Garcia, a Florida resident, was injured. After careful review and with the benefit of oral argument, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">A general contractor, Thales Builders Corp., hired two separate subcontractors, Alameda Construction, Inc. and Kendall Crane, to work on a residential construction project. Alameda was hired to perform rough carpentry and rebar replacement work, and Kendall Crane was hired to provide a crane and operate it. Garcia was an employee of Alameda. He was not in privity with Kendall Crane; nor was Alameda in privity with Kendall Crane. At no time did he perform any work for Kendall Crane, and Kendall Crane never supervised or paid him.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-16\">Garcia was injured when a crane, which was operated by Kendall Crane\u2019s employees, struck him and caused him to fall to the cement floor below. He received workers\u2019 compensation benefits through Alameda\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy. Neither Thales nor Kendall Crane provided workers\u2019 compensation benefits to him. Garcia also sued Kendall Crane, Alameda, and Thales in state court, alleging that Kendall Crane was grossly negligent in operating the crane, which caused his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-17\">Kendall Crane then filed a claim with Wellington under its commercial general liability policy. Wellington defended under a reservation of rights, and brought this declaratory judgment action, arguing that an exclusion precluding coverage for bodily injury to employees applies. This exclusion states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-18\">This insurance policy does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak1\">\u201cBodily injury\u201d to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-19\">(1) An \u201cemployee\u201d, \u201ctemporary worker\u201d, independent contractor of any insured or employee of any independent contractor arising out of and in the course of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-20\">(a) Employment by any insured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-21\">(b) Performing duties related to the conduct of any insured\u2019s business; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-22\">(c) Arising out the injured party\u2019s employment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-23\">(2) A fellow \u201cemployee\u201d, \u201ctemporary worker\u201d, or independent contractor of any insured arising out of and in the course of such employment when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>insured is an \u201cexecutive officer\u201d of such employer; or</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">The policy defines the term \u201cemployee\u201d as follows: \u201c \u2018Employee\u2019 includes a \u2018leased worker.\u2019 \u2018Employee\u2019 does not include a \u2018temporary worker.\u2019 \u201d The term \u201cleased worker,\u201d in turn, is defined as \u201ca person leased to you by a labor leasing firm under an agreement between you and the labor leasing firm to perform duties related to the conduct of your business. \u2018Leased worker\u2019 does not include a \u2018temporary worker.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Wellington conceded that Garcia was not Kendall Crane\u2019s actual employee, leased worker, or temporary worker. But it argued that the term \u201cemployee\u201d in the exclusion refers not only to Kendall Crane\u2019s actual employees, but also to its statutory employees, as that term is defined in Florida\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws, and that Garcia was Kendall Crane\u2019s statutory employee as a matter of law. The district court rejected this argument, concluding that the employee exclusion does not apply, and thus that coverage exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">II. Discussion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">As Wellington concedes that Garcia was not an actual employee, leased employee, or temporary worker of Kendall Crane, the only way that the policy\u2019s employee exclusion applies is if it incorporates the concept of a statutory employee as defined in Florida\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws, and if Garcia in fact qualified as Kendall Crane\u2019s statutory employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">The concept of a statutory employee under Florida law comes from \u00a7 440.10(l)(b), Florida Statutes, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-11\">In case a contractor sublets any part or parts of his or her contract work to a subcontractor or subcontractors, all of the employees of such contractor and subcontractor or subcontractors engaged on such contract work shall be deemed to be employed in one and the same business or establishment, and the contractor shall be liable for, and shall secure, the payment of compensation to all such employees, except to employees of a subcontractor who has secured such payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">Based on the plain language of the statute, \u201c[i]t is absolutely basic ... that one cannot be a \u2018contractor\u2019 (and thus a statutory employer) within the meaning of this statute unless the \u2018contractor\u2019 has a contractual obligation, a portion of which is sublet to another.\u201d <em>Woods v. Carpet Restorations, Inc., </em>611 So.2d 1303, 1304 (Fla.Dist.Ct. App.1992). Here, Kendall Crane did not sublet its contractual obligation to Alameda. Thus, it could not have been the statutory employer of Alameda\u2019s employees, including Garcia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">Moreover, the purpose and structure of \u00a7 440.10(l)(b) confirm that the statute does not confer statutory-employer status on Kendall Crane. \u201c[T]he obvious legislative intent [of \u00a7 440.10(l)(b) is] to insure that a person performing a contractor\u2019s work, even as an employee of a subcontractor, shall be entitled to workers\u2019 compensation protection with the primary employer if the subcontractor fails to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>such coverage.\u201d <em>Roberts v. Gator Freight-ways, Inc., </em>538 So.2d 55, 60 (Fla.Dist.Ct. App.1989). In other words, it seeks \u201cto insure that a particular industry will be financially responsible for injuries to those employees working in it, even though the prime contractor employs an independent contractor to perform part or all of its contractual undertaking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The statute does this by making the general contractor \u201cresponsible for securing coverage for the subcontractor\u2019s employees.\u201d <em>Amorin v. Gordon, </em>996 So.2d 913, 916 (Fla.Dist.Ct. App.2008). In return, the statute immunizes general contractors from tort liability for the injuries of its subcontractors\u2019 employees. See Fla. Stat. \u00a7 440.10(1)(e). As such, the statute concerns the vertical relationship between a contractor and subcontractor, not the horizontal relationship between two subcontractors, which is the relationship at issue here. Indeed, the statute does not impose any obligation on a subcontractor to obtain workers\u2019 compensation coverage for another subcontractor\u2019s employees, and thus it would be nonsensical to call one subcontractor the statutory employer of the other subcontractor\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The case that Wellington principally relies upon for the contention that Garcia was Kendall Crane\u2019s statutory employee, <em>Florida Insurance Guaranty Ass\u2019n v. Re-voredo, </em>involved the vertical relationship between a subcontractor\u2019s employee and the general contractor, not the horizontal relationship between the subcontractor\u2019s employee and another subcontractor. 698 So.2d 890, 890 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1997). As this case involves a horizontal relationship between a subcontractor\u2019s employee and another subcontractor, <em>Revoredo\u2019s </em>holding that the subcontractor\u2019s employee was a statutory employee of the <em>general contractor, </em>and thus that the employee exclusion in the general contractor\u2019s insurance policy applied, is inapposite here.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Accordingly, the district court correctly determined that Garcia was not Kendall Crane\u2019s statutory employee and that the employee exclusion is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-8\">. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>drawing all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Dyer v. Lee, </em>488 F.3d 876, 878 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b818-9\">. To be sure, under \u00a7 440.10, Kendall Crane\u2019s and Alameda\u2019s employees were deemed to be \"employed in one and the same business or establishment.\u201d But that does not help Wellington, because the policy's exclusion only applies to employees of Kendall Crane, not to employees of some other business or establishment, which in this case is Thales's business.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
