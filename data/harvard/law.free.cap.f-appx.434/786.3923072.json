For the reasons set forth below, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of the petition and remand for an evidentiary hearing on the facts underlying Roper\u2019s request for equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">In January 2004, Roper pleaded guilty to various offenses, including burglary of a dwelling, grand theft, and dealing in stolen property, and was sentenced as a habitual violent felony offender. In July 2005, the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeals affirmed Roper\u2019s convictions and sentences. Roper filed a motion for rehearing, which was denied on September 15, 2005. The mandate issued on October 7, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">On October 8, 2007, Roper filed, through counsel, a Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850 motion for post-conviction relief. That motion was denied by the trial court, and the Fourth District Court of Appeal issued a mandate affirming Roper\u2019s convictions on November 6, 2009. Ten days later, on November 16, 2009, Roper filed a \u00a7 2254 federal habeas petition in district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">The district court referred Roper\u2019s petition to a magistrate judge. On April 13, 2010, the magistrate judge ordered Roper to show cause why his petition should not be dismissed as untimely. In response, Roper conceded that his habeas petition was not timely filed but argued that he was entitled to equitable tolling. Specifically, Roper argued that the limitations period should be equitably tolled from September 13, 2006 until September 17, 2007. In his habeas petition, Roper asserted that his attorney \u201crepeatedly assured\u201d him, his mother, and his sister \u201cduring their frequent in-person and telephone contacts\u201d that a Rule 3.850 motion had been filed on September 13, 2006. On September 17, 2007, however, the attorney admitted that no motion had, in fact, been filed and promised to file the Rule 3.580 motion by October 8, 2007. Roper also requested an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">The magistrate judge recommended that Roper\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing be denied and that his habeas petition be dismissed as untimely.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The magistrate judge concluded that equitable tolling was not warranted because Roper had failed to establish his own diligence in pursuing his rights and because there was no evidentia-ry support for his allegations regarding his attorney\u2019s representations. Roper filed objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. He submitted his own affidavit as well as affidavits from his mother Ruth and his sister Cheryl stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"akq-dedup-0\">During our frequent in-person and telephone contacts, [counsel] and his office repeatedly assured Ruth, Cheryl, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>and Affiant that Affiant\u2019s Rule 8.850 motions had been timely filed on September 13, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-4\">However, on September 17, 2007, [counsel] and his office finally conceded that Affiant\u2019s Rule 3.850 motions had yet to be filed and that he and his office would be timely filing those pleadings by October 8, 2007.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The district court overruled Roper\u2019s objections and adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. Roper requested a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on whether \u201cthe district court err[ed] by summarily denying [his] petition for writ of habeas corpus.\u201d The district court granted the COA without specifically enumerating the issues for appellate review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a petition for a writ of habeas corpus <em>de novo.\u201d San Martin v. McNeil, </em>633 F.3d 1257, 1265 (11th Cir.2011). \u201cWe also review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision on equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cHowever, [a] district court\u2019s determinations of the relevant facts will be reversed only if clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Howell v. Crosby, </em>415 F.3d 1250, 1251 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe review for abuse of discretion the denial of an evidentiary hearing for a habeas petition.\u201d <em>Pugh v. Smith, </em>465 F.3d 1295, 1298 (11th Cir.2006). Finally, \u201c[w]e construe <em>pro se </em>filings, like [Roper\u2019s], liberally.\u201d <em>Bellizia v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corn., </em>614 F.3d 1326, 1329 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">AEDPA sets a one-year statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas petition challenging a state court judgment. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The statute of limitations starts running on the latest of four events, including \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). The Supreme Court has explained that \u201c[f]inality attaches when [it] affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.\u201d <em>Clay v. United States, </em>537 U.S. 522, 527, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 1076, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">The limitations period is statutorily tolled for \u201c[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). The limitations period may be equitably tolled when a petitioner shows: \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.\u201d <em>San Martin, </em>633 F.3d at 1267 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe diligence required for equitable tolling purposes is \u2018reasonable diligence,\u2019 not \u2018maximum feasible diligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 2565, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010) (citations and quotation marks omitted). \u201cAs for the \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 prong, ... a defendant [must] show a causal connection between the alleged extraordinary circumstances and the late filing of the petition.\u201d <em>San Martin, </em>633 F.3d at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>In this case, AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period began to run on December 14, 2005 when Roper\u2019s state court judgment became \u201cfinal.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A); <em>Clay, </em>587 U.S. at 527, 123 S.Ct. at 1076. Roper filed a Rule 3.850 motion on October 8, 2007. Ordinarily, a properly filed Rule 3.850 motion like Roper\u2019s statutorily tolls AEDPA\u2019s limitations period. <em>See Brown v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>530 F.3d 1335, 1338 (11th Cir.2008). However, in the absence of equitable tolling, Roper\u2019s motion did not statutorily toll AEDPA\u2019s limitations period because it was filed 298 days after the limitations period expired on December 14, 2006. See <em>Tinker v. Moore, </em>255 F.3d 1331, 1333 (11th Cir.2001) (explaining that \u201ca state court petition ... that is filed following the expiration of the federal limitations period \u2018cannot toll that period because there is no period remaining to be tolled\u2019 \u201d); <em>Downs v. McNeil, </em>520 F.3d 1311, 1318 (11th Cir. 2008) (explaining that \u00a7 2244(d)(l)\u2019s \u201climitations period should be calculated according to the \u2018anniversary method\u2019 under which the limitations period expires on the anniversary date it began to run\u201d). Roper contends that equitable tolling is warranted from September 13, 2006 to September 17, 2007. If Roper is right, then his Rule 3.850 motion was filed before AEDPA\u2019s limitations period expired, and his habeas petition is not time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Roper says that equitable tolling is warranted because his lawyer affirmatively misrepresented that his Rule 3.850 motion had been filed on September 13, 2006. Roper\u2019s petition alleges that counsel \u201crepeatedly assured [him], his mother Cynthia \u2018Ruth\u2019 Roper, and his sister, Cheryl Roper, during their frequent in-person and telephone contacts\u201d that a Rule 3.850 motion was filed on that date. On September 17, 2007, however, counsel \u201cfinally conceded\u201d that no Rule 3.850 motion had been filed and promised to file by October 8, 2007. In support of his allegations, Roper submitted three affidavits with his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. In those affidavits, Roper, his mother, and his sister averred that: \u201cDuring our frequent in-person and telephone contacts, [counsel] and his office repeatedly assured Ruth, Cheryl, and Affi-ant that Affiant\u2019s Rule 3.850 motions had been timely filed on September 13, 2006.\u201d On September 17, 2007, counsel \u201cfinally conceded that [Roper\u2019s] Rule 3.850 motions had yet to be filed and that he and his office would be timely filing those pleadings by October 8, 2007.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">We have noted that \u201cordinary attorney negligence does not warrant equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Downs, </em>520 F.3d at 1325; <em>see also Holland, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2564 (\u201c[A] garden variety claim of excusable neglect, such as a simple miscalculation that leads a lawyer to miss a filing deadline, does not warrant equitable tolling.\u201d (citations and quotation marks omitted)). However, as the Supreme Court recently explained in <em>Holland, </em>equitable tolling can be applied in the \u201cabsence of an allegation and proof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, [or] mental impairment.\u201d <em>See </em>130 S.Ct. at 2559-60 (quoting <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>539 F.3d 1334, 1339 (11th Cir.2008); <em>id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>2568-64 (explaining that \u201cprofessional misconduct that fails to [rise to that level] could nonetheless amount to egregious behavior and create an extraordinary circumstance that warrants equitable tolling\u201d)). Here, Roper alleges that counsel affirmatively misrepresented that a Rule 3.850 motion had been filed on September 13, 2006. Affirmative misrepresentations by counsel about the filing of a state habeas petition can constitute extraordinary circumstances that warrant equitable tolling. <em>See Downs, </em>520 F.3d at 1325 (vacating a district court\u2019s order dismissing a habeas petition as untimely where the petitioner alleged that his attorney made affirmative misrepresentations about the filing of a state habeas petition that would have tolled the limitations period).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">To be eligible for equitable tolling, however, the petitioner must show \u201ca causal connection between the alleged extraordinary circumstances and the late filing of the petition.\u201d <em>San Martin, </em>633 F.3d at 1267. The affidavits Roper submitted do not include the dates that counsel \u201crepeatedly assured\u201d Roper and his family members that a Rule 3.850 motion had been filed on September 13, 2006. Based on the affidavits, counsel\u2019s purported misconduct occurred sometime prior to September 17, 2007, the date that counsel \u201cfinally conceded\u201d no Rule 3.850 motion had been filed. In order for a connection to exist between counsel\u2019s misconduct and the late filing of Roper\u2019s petition, the misrepresentations would have had to have been made before December 14, 2006, the date that AEDPA\u2019s limitations period would have expired in the absence of tolling.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>Because we construe <em>pro se </em>filings liberally, <em>see Bellizia, </em>614 F.3d at 1329, and that set of facts, if proven, would constitute \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying Roper\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Unlike in <em>San </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number><em>Martin, </em>there is reason to believe that an evidentiary hearing would help Roper demonstrate the required extraordinary circumstances to warrant equitable tolling. 633 F.3d at 1272. Moreover, Roper has proffered evidence in support of his claim for equitable tolling, and thus the record provides a basis for further inquiry by the district court. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Roper\u2019s habeas petition and remand for an evidentiary hearing on the facts underlying his request for equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-11\">. The magistrate judge also explained in a footnote that even if Roper\u2019s habeas petition was not time barred, he would not be entitled to relief on the merits because his ineffective assistance claim was frivolous and his claimed trial court error was not cognizable in federal court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b810-8\">. A district court may grant a COA if the petitioner \"has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). The district court's COA must specify the issues on which the petitioner has made that showing. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(3). However, \u201c[t]he district court\u2019s failure to enumerate the issues for appellate review does not deprive us of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1227-28 (11th Cir.2001). \"[W]e may either remand to the district court with instructions to enumerate the issues, or we may rule which issues raised by the petitioner warrant a COA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We take the second course here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b811-6\">. Roper\u2019s motion for rehearing was denied by the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal on September 15, 2005. On October 7, 2005, the mandate issued. As explained above, a state court judgment becomes final \"when the time for filing a certiorari petition [with the United States Supreme Court] expires.\u201d <em>Clay, </em>537 U.S. at 527, 123 S.Ct. at 1076. In Florida, the 90-day period for filing a petition for certiorari begins to run after a Florida appellate court affirms the conviction, not after the mandate is issued. <em>See Chavers </em>v. <em>Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>468 F.3d 1273, 1275 (11th Cir.2006). Thus, Roper\u2019s convictions became \u201cfinal\u201d on December 14, 2005, 90 days after September 15, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b812-5\">. The premise of Roper's argument is that he relied on the truthfulness of counsel\u2019s representation that a Rule 3.850 motion had been filed on September 13, 2006. However, even if it is true that counsel made misrepresentations to Roper about the filing of the motion, if counsel did not make those misrepresentations until after December 14, 2006, no connection exists between counsel\u2019s misconduct and the late filing of Roper\u2019s petition. In other words, in order for the filing of the Rule 3.850 motion to toll AEDPA\u2019s limitations period, the motion had to be filed before the limitations period expired on December 14, 2006. <em>See Tinker, </em>255 F.3d at 1333. Thus, if all contact between counsel and Roper and his family members occurred after December 14, 2006, counsel\u2019s misrepresentations, even if proven, did not have a \"causal connection ... [to] the late filing of the petition.\u201d <em>San Martin, </em>633 f.3d at 1267.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b812-6\">. We note that a petitioner must show \"not only 'extraordinary circumstances,\u2019 but also circumstances that are beyond the petitioner's conduct and unavoidable even with diligence\u201d in order for equitable tolling to be available. <em>Downs, </em>520 F.3d at 1323. Based on the allegations in the affidavits Roper submitted, Roper and his family members frequently contacted counsel in person and by telephone and were assured that a Rule 3.850 motion had been filed on September 13, 2006. Roper purportedly learned that no motion had been filed on September 17, 2007. By that time, AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period had already expired. Thus, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, Roper could not have accounted for the untolled time and filed a timely habeas petition. Roper\u2019s window for filing a timely petition had already expired. <em>Cf. Stewart v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t Corrs., </em>355 Fed.Appx. 275, 281 (11th Cir. 2009) (unpublished) (concluding that equitable tolling was not warranted where counsel affirmatively misrepresented that a tolling motion had been filed because \u201d[b]y exercising due diligence, [the petitioner] could have recalculated the deadline for filing his federal habeas petition, accounting for [the] additional, untolled time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">The district court found that Roper had failed to show reasonable diligence in pursuing his rights. The district court observed that Roper\u2019s 3.850 motion was timely filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>and noted that there was no evidence in the record that Roper \"contacted counsel in an attempt to clarify the deadline for filing the motion.\u201d Roper's argument for equitable tolling is based on the allegation that counsel affirmatively misrepresented that he filed a Rule 3.850 motion on September 13, 2006. As explained above, \"[tjhe diligence required for equitable tolling purposes is \u2018reasonable diligence,\u2019 not maximum feasible diligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holland, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2565. Upon being told by counsel that a Rule 3.850 motion had been filed, Roper was not required to discount counsel's representation in order to show \u201creasonable diligence.\u201d Thus, we conclude that the district court\u2019s due diligence finding was clearly erroneous. <em>Drew v. Dep't of Corrs., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir.2002) (\"[A] determination regarding a [petitioner's] diligence is a finding of fact that will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
