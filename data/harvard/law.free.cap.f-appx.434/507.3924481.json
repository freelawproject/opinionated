Campbell pled guilty to distribution of five grams or more of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Campbell appeals his sentence of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment, arguing that it is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. For the following reasons, we affirm Campbell\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-16\">On December 11, 2006, after Alonzo D. Campbell left the residence of his girlfriend, an undercover officer purchased over 3.35 grams of cocaine powder from Campbell. On December 14, 2006, an officer made a second controlled buy of 5.07 grams of cocaine base from Campbell at Campbell\u2019s mother\u2019s home. Search warrants were obtained and executed, and on December 15, 2006, police searched the homes of Campbell\u2019s girlfriend and his mother. At his girlfriend\u2019s home, police found a small quantity of marijuana, a digital scale, 19.6 grams of cocaine, and a picture of Campbell. Campbell\u2019s girlfriend denied that the cocaine was hers and stated that Campbell previously had a key to her apartment. At his mother\u2019s home, police found a stolen, 9-mm pistol with an obliterated serial number, a small quantity of marijuana, $40 in cash, seventy-two zi-ploc baggies, two digital scales, and a hand-held scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>On January 24, 2007, an indictment returned charging Campbell with distribution of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); distribution of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); maintaining a drug house, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1); being a felon in possession of firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1); possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(k); and possession of a stolen firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">On January 29, 2007, an information returned and pleas of not guilty were entered on behalf of Campbell. Campbell subsequently entered a plea of guilty to Count 2 of the indictment, charging him with distribution of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Pursuant to the plea agreement, the parties stipulated that, for purposes of sentencing, Campbell was accountable for drug amounts within the range of five to twenty grams of cocaine base, which made him subject to penalties under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii) and subject to a base offense level of 26 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties also stipulated that Campbell is a career offender under the provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. They stipulated that Campbell possessed a dangerous weapon during the commission of the offense and is accordingly subject to a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1(b)(1). The government recommended a reduction of three levels for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). The agreed-upon Guidelines range was 262-327 months, and the government agreed not to object to Campbell\u2019s request for a departure or variance \u201csuch that the sentence imposed is the statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months[\u2019] [imprisonment].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) prepared by a probation officer confirmed the agreed-upon Guidelines range and reiterated the government\u2019s agreement not to object to a sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Of the eleven juvenile adjudications and adult convictions listed in the PSR, only five contributed points to Campbell\u2019s criminal history calculation. The juvenile adjudications included an attempt to steal property, domestic violence, possession and use of tobacco by a minor, being a minor in possession of alcohol, attempted possession with intent to deliver marijuana, use of marijuana, and malicious destruction of property. His adult convictions included malicious destruction of personal property, being a disorderly person and gambling, being a minor in possession, delivery or manufacture of marijuana, and delivery of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">The district court held a sentencing hearing on February 13, 2008. During the sentencing hearing, defense counsel provided the court with a four-page psychological report prepared by Dr. Patrick K. Ryan, licensed psychologist and neuropsy-chologist and certified alcohol and drug counselor. The district court noted that it had not previously reviewed the report and thus took a brief recess to review the report. The report described Campbell as having a history of substance abuse, as well as concurrent mood instability and anxious episodes. The report concluded by diagnosing Campbell with Bipolar Disorder II and an unspecified anxiety disorder. After reviewing the report and resuming the sentencing hearing, the court entertained allocution from the parties, and the government declined to add any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>thing followings statements from the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The district court stated the following in pronouncing its sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">[O]ne significant factor in the series of events that have brought this gentleman here is likely the fact of his confrontation with mental health issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">There\u2019s nothing about the report that would suggest to the court that they are mental health issues with the gravity that\u2019s significantly different from many people who have not acted out in a way that has brought him the level of criminal history that this gentleman represents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">There is, in the court\u2019s judgement, a predicate for the court\u2019s exercise of some level of discretion under 3558(a) for a downward departure from the guidelines that are calculated in the case. I\u2019m satisfied the mental health issues provide that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">Notwithstanding that fact, this gentleman presents, in the court\u2019s judgment, a risk to the general public because of his inability to discipline any part of the exercise of his life. He presents with some seven convictions, some three dependents in less than a period of three years and no record at this point of an ability to discipline himself and to grasp the gravity of the mental health issues that he faces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">After noting that it had conducted \u201cseparate consideration of the factors ... under ... 18 USC Section 3553(a),\u201d the district court then imposed a sentence of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment in \u201can institution with a comprehensive drug treatment program as well as a mental health treatment program,\u201d with a number of other conditions regarding drug testing. Following the imposition of the sentence, the court addressed the defense counsel and inquired, \u201cany questions or objections concerning the terms of the sentencing?\u201d The defense responded, \u201c[n]o questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"axa-dedup-0\">The district court\u2019s Statement of Reasons noted that it sentenced Campbell below the advisory Guidelines range. It further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-11\">[Campbell\u2019s] motion for a variance, unopposed by the government, requested a sentence of 120 months. However, [Campbell] is a risk to the community. [Campbell] is unable to maintain self-control, as evidenced by his ongoing criminal record, and the fathering of three children in less than two years. The defendant is young, and has mental health and substance abuse problems that need to be addressed with treatment. The [c]ourt determines that the sentence imposed appears to be adequate for purposes of punishment, deterrence and rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">Campbell timely filed his notice of appeal on February 22, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-14\">We review the district court\u2019s sentencing determination for reasonableness under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Bolds, </em>511 F.3d 568, 578 (6th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). We review both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of a sentence. <em>Id. </em>Campbell challenges his sentence as both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-15\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-16\">If a defendant has been provided an opportunity to object to a procedural error in sentencing and the defendant fails to object, we review the procedural reasonableness of the sentence for plain error, not an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Vonner, </em>516 F.3d 382, 385 (6th Cir.2008). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>The district court must, however, provide the defendant with an opportunity to object by \u201cask[ing] the parties whether they have any objection to the sentence just pronounced that have not previously been raised.\u201d <em>United States v. Bostic, </em>371 F.3d 865, 872 (6th Cir.2004). If the district court does not provide this opportunity, we review for an abuse of discretion. \u201cA district court can satisfy the requirements of the <em>Bostic </em>rule only by clearly asking for objections to the sentence that have not previously been raised.... \u201d <em>United States v. Clark, </em>469 F.3d 568, 570 (6th Cir.2006). In the present case, the district court asked Campbell\u2019s counsel if there were \u201cany questions of objections concerning the terms of the sentencing.\u201d The district court then asked the government\u2019s counsel whether she had \u201cany questions or objections.\u201d We need not determine whether this question was sufficient to provide an opportunity to object consistent with the <em>Bostic </em>inquiry because our decision remains the same under both plain error and abuse of discretion standards of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In reviewing the procedural reasonableness of a sentence, we must ensure that the district court \u201ccorrectly calculat[ed] the applicable Guidelines range,\u201d that the district court \u201cgave both parties the opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem appropriate and then consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine whether they support the sentence requested by [each] party,\u201d and that the district court \u201cadequately explained] the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>Bolds, </em>511 F.3d at 579-80 (internal quotation marks omitted). Campbell argues that the district court made three procedural errors with respect to his sentence: (1) the district court erred in failing to acknowledge Campbell\u2019s non-frivolous arguments for a lesser sentence; (2) the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explain the chosen sentence; and (3) the district court failed to state specific reasons supporting Campbell\u2019s 240-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">First, Campbell argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to acknowledge two non-frivolous arguments in favor of a lesser sentence. Campbell\u2019s argument is that the court failed to effectively consider and respond to (1) the fact that the government did not object to a request for a 120-month sentence and (2) the severity of Campbell\u2019s mental health issues. During the sentencing hearing, Campbell\u2019s counsel argued that given the \u201clack of objection on the part of the government to a minimum term of sentence ... of 120 months\u201d and given Campbell\u2019s mental health, a sentence below the Guidelines range was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">In Campbell\u2019s plea agreement, the parties agreed upon a Guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. The PSR contemplated the same range. Additionally, in the plea agreement, the government stipulated that it did not object to the district court\u2019s granting a departure or a variance from the Guidelines range \u201csuch that the sentence imposed is the statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months.\u201d During the sentencing hearing, Campbell\u2019s counsel reiterated this fact and further argued that Campbell was a candidate for such a variance and the court was empowered to grant such a variance. The district court never specifically mentioned in court that the government did not object to imposing a lesser sentence than the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">During the sentencing hearing, Campbell presented Dr. Ryan\u2019s report detailing his mental health issues. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>court stated that it had not previously reviewed the report. Thus, the district court announced that it would take a \u201cfour or five minute[ ]\u201d recess \u201cin order ... to have a brief opportunity to digest the report.\u201d After reviewing the report, the district court stated that it \u201chad an opportunity to review the report.\u201d Later, before pronouncing Campbell\u2019s sentence, the district court noted that \u201cone significant factor\u201d in its consideration was Campbell\u2019s \u201cconfrontation with mental health issues.\u201d The district court then found that there was nothing in the report that suggested that Campbell\u2019s mental health issues were significantly grave as to set him apart from others with lesser criminal histories. On the other hand, the district court noted that Campbell\u2019s mental health served as a \u201cpredicate for the court\u2019s exercise of some level of discretion ... for a downward departure.\u201d The district court went on to discuss the reasons supporting the imposition of a 240-month sentence, which was below the Guidelines range but above the mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">In order to be procedurally reasonable, the district court must \u201cadequately articulate[ ] its reasoning for imposing the chosen sentence, including any rejection of the parties\u2019 arguments for an outside-Guidelines sentence and any decision to deviate from the advisory Guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Petrus, </em>588 F.3d 347, 352 (6th Cir.2009). \u201cWhere the defendant ... presents nonfrivolous reasons for imposing a different sentence ... the judge will normally go further and explain why he has rejected those arguments. Sometimes the circumstances will call for a brief explanation; sometimes they will call for a lengthier explanation.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 357, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). But, \u201ca district court\u2019s failure to address each argument ... head-on will not lead to automatic vacatur if the context and the record make the court\u2019s reasoning clear.\u201d <em>Petrus, </em>588 F.3d at 352 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">In this case, although the district court did not specifically mention the fact that the government agreed not to object to a sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, it did consider and address Campbell\u2019s argument that his mental health issues warranted a lower sentence. Campbell cites a number of cases in which, upon review of a sentence, we could not tell whether the district court considered a request for a variance. <em>See United States v. Wallace, </em>597 F.3d 794, 803 (6th Cir.2010) (vacating and remanding for resentencing because the district court \u201cwas completely nonre-sponsive\u201d to defendant\u2019s argument for a lesser sentence comparable to that of her co-conspirator); <em>United States v. Stephens, </em>549 F.3d 459, 467 (6th Cir.2008) (finding a sentence procedurally unreasonable because the district court made mention only of defendant\u2019s \u201cdepartures\u201d but made no mention of defendant\u2019s arguments for a \u201cvariance\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Swift, </em>357 Fed.Appx. 489 (3d Cir.2009) (reversing and remanding for resentencing because the district court failed to acknowledge the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure). But the district court here was not \u201ccompletely non-responsive\u201d to Campbell\u2019s arguments for a lesser sentence. The district court took a recess to read the psychologist\u2019s report, explicitly considered Campbell\u2019s mental health in the pronouncement of its sentence, and specifically referred to its discretion to sentence Campbell below the Guidelines due to this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Additionally, although the district court did not mention the government\u2019s agreement to object to a lesser sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, this issue was not presented as an independent argument for a lesser sentence. For instance, in <em>Wal</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number><em>lace, </em>the defendant\u2019s counsel clearly asked the district court to consider that the defendant\u2019s Guidelines range was \u201cdouble or triple\u201d that of her co-defendant\u2019s sentence and, furthermore, asked the \u201cthe Court to use its wisdom in sentencing [the defendant] \u2014 in light of ... [her co-conspirator\u2019s] ... lesser sentence.\u201d 597 F.3d at 803. The government\u2019s agreement not to object merely buttressed Campbell\u2019s overall argument that he was entitled to a lesser sentence and was not a distinct argument for a lesser sentence that the court was required to address.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">We therefore conclude that the district court did not procedurally err in sentencing Campbell because it thoroughly considered Campbell\u2019s arguments in favor of a lesser sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Second, Campbell argues that the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and failed to adequately explain its chosen sentence. Third, Campbell argues that the district court failed to state specific reasons supporting Campbell\u2019s 240-month sentence as required under \u00a7 3553(c)(2). These arguments are premised on the same allegations of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include the nature and circumstances of the offense and history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence imposed, the kinds of sentences available, the kinds of sentence and sentencing range established for the defendant, pertinent policy statements, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among similarly situated defendants, and the need to provide restitution. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7). Additionally, Section 3553(c)(2) states: \u201cThe court, at the time of sentencing, shall state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence, and, if the sentence ... is outside the range ... the specific reason for the imposition from the sentence different from that described, which reasons must also be stated with specificity in a statement of reasons.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">Campbell relies on our decision in <em>United States v. Thomas </em>to argue that \u201cgenerally notfing] \u2018the defendant\u2019s background and behavior in this particular case\u2019 \u201d and making \u201ca conclusory reference to \u2018considering the additional factors contained within ... [\u00a7 ] 3553(a)\u2019 \u201d are insufficient to allow the appellate court meaningful review of the district court\u2019s consideration of those factors. 498 F.3d 336, 340 (6th Cir. 2007). This case, however, is distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">In <em>Thomas, </em>the defendant raised a number of arguments in favor of a lesser sentence that the district court failed to address. We have already concluded that the district court adequately addressed Campbell\u2019s arguments for a lesser sentence. Additionally, the district court recognized that those arguments justified a lesser sentence than the Guidelines range. The district court found that Campbell\u2019s mental health issues detailed in the report were not significantly grave, but they did provide for \u201csome level of discretion ... for a downward departure from the guidelines.\u201d The district court\u2019s Statement of Reasons also acknowledged Campbell\u2019s \u201cmotion for a variance, unopposed by the government,\u201d that requested a 120-month sentence but rejected that full variance due to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">Regarding the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court went beyond its blanket statement that it engaged in \u201cseparate consideration of the factors that are the directives under Title 18 USC Section 3553(a).\u201d The district court specifically noted that Campbell \u201cis 23 years old and has qualified as a career offender under the guidelines.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The district court men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>tioned Campbell\u2019s \u201crisk to the general public because of his inability to discipline any part of the exercise of his life.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3558(a)(1), (2). The district court also made note of Campbell\u2019s criminal history including \u201csome seven convictions.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1). Furthermore, the district court designated Campbell \u201cto an institution with a comprehensive drug treatment program as well as a mental health treatment program.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">We conclude that the district court thoroughly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and adequately explained the reasons behind its imposition of the 240-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Campbell next challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. Because we conclude that the district court has not committed procedural error, we review the substantive reasonableness of Campbell\u2019s sentence, which is always reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. We will find a sentence to be substantively unreasonable only if the district court selected the sentence arbitrarily, based the sentence on impermissible factors, or gave an unreasonable amount of weight to a single permissible factor. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>579 F.3d 672, 677 (6th Cir.2009). Though a sentence within the Guidelines is presumptively reasonable, we may not hold that a sentence is presumptively unreasonable simply because it falls outside of the Guidelines. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Instead, we \u201cmay consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance. The fact that [we] might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">Campbell argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the 240-month sentence is \u201cfar greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).\u201d Campbell argues that the totality of the circumstances compels a lesser sentence. According to Campbell, those circumstances include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-11\">the disparity between the original Guidelines range of 84-105 months and the career offender range of 262 to 327 months; [] Campbell\u2019s history of bipolar disorder and drug addiction; [ ] Campbell\u2019s age and the fact that the offenses that triggered the career offender designation occurred when he was very young; the small quantity of the drug involved; and [] Campbell\u2019s parole violation, which resulted in additional incarceration for which he was given no credit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">The district court pl\u00e1ced reasonable weight on the 3553(a) factors in sentencing Campbell. It chose to rely on the career offender range because of Campbell\u2019s extensive criminal history at such a young age. The district court considered Campbell\u2019s mental health and substance abuse issues and varied downward from the Guidelines range in order to account for those issues. Additionally, the amount of drugs involved in the crime was accounted for in the original Guidelines range. Because the district court did not select Campbell\u2019s sentence arbitrarily, base his sentence on impermissible factors, or give an unreasonable amount of weight to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>single factor, <em>Brown, </em>579 F.3d at 677, there was no substantive error in the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Campbell\u2019s sentence as both procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-6\">. The plea agreement misstated this provision as U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.2(c)(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b536-7\">. Campbell also suggests that it is an odd coincidence that the ultimate sentence imposed was exactly double the mandatory minimum and this suggested the sentence was arbitrarily selected. We find no merit in this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
