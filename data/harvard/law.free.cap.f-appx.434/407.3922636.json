He contends that the district court reversibly erred by applying a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(7)(B) on the basis that the offense involved \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d to the aliens that were detained by him and his co-conspirators. Gomez-Aguirre acknowledges that the aliens were threatened and beaten, but argues that the harm experienced by the aliens constituted only \u201cbodily injury,\u201d which warrants only a two-level increase under \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(7)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-24\">In the district court, Gomez-Aguirre did not preserve an objection that the harm suffered by the aliens did not constitute \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d and his argument is therefore reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 358 (5th Cir.2005). To establish plain error, Gomez-Aguirre must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-25\">The determination whether the harm experienced by the aliens rises to the level of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d rather than \u201cbodily injury\u201d is a question of fact. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>19 F.3d 166, 171 (5th Cir.1994) (noting that the severity of a victim\u2019s injury is a question of fact); <em>see also United States v. Garza-Robles, </em>627 F.3d 161, 169-70 (5th Cir.2010) (affirming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>district court\u2019s factual finding that defendant suffered serious bodily injury). Because the district judge\u2019s factual finding was plausible in light of the record as a whole, Gomez-Aguirre fails to establish error, much less plain error. <em>See United States v. Wilcox, </em>631 F.3d 740, 753 (5th Cir.2011)(Even where the objection is preserved, \u201cthe court must determine whether the district court\u2019s conclusion was plausible in light of the record as a whole\u201d in assessing the propriety of a sentencing enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
