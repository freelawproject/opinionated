He has therefore abandoned any argument that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition was error. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Miller\u2019s assertion that the respondent\u2019s post-hearing brief was untimely is belied by the record. The respondent was given 15 days after the filing of the hearing transcript within which to submit the brief. The transcript was filed on March 15, 2010, and the respondent\u2019s brief was filed on March 30, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">To the extent that Miller argues that the district court erred in granting the respondent an extension of time to file its post-hearing brief, \u201c[a] federal district court has both specific and inherent power to control its docket.\u201d <em>In re United Markets Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>24 F.3d 650, 654 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also United States v. Colomb, </em>419 F.3d 292, 299 (5th Cir.2005). Miller cannot demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in granting the respondent an extension of time because he does not allege that he was prejudiced in any way by the modification in the briefing schedule. <em>See Huval v. Offshore Pipelines, Inc., </em>86 F.3d 454, 458 (5th Cir.1996); <em>see also Lockamy v. Dunbar, </em>399 Fed.Appx. 953, 955 (5th Cir.2010). Given the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
