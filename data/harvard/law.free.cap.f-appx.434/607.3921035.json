Appellant asserts that the district court committed procedural error in the imposition of his sentence and that his sentence, although 13 months less than the bottom of the Guideline Sentencing Range, is substantively unreasonable. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">We review all sentencing decisions by a district court for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, we ensure that the district court has not committed a \u201csignificant procedural error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Next, we consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, where we \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Cruz-Gramajo, </em>570 F.3d 1162, 1167 (9th Cir. 2009). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">\n<em>I. The District Court Did Not Commit Procedural Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b630-13\">Appellant asserts that the district court considered clearly erroneous facts in the imposition of his sentence, namely 1) Appellant\u2019s involvement in gangs and 2) the nature of Appellant\u2019s conduct and involvement in the WinCo incident. Second, Appellant contends that the district court did not adequately explain how the sentence reflects all of the Section 3553(a)(2) factors. We address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-14\">\n<em>A. The District Court Did Not Consider Clearly Erroneous Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b630-15\">\n<em>1. Appellant\u2019s Association with Gangs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b630-16\">While Appellant denied he is or ever has been associated with a gang, the record establishes that Appellant was seen associating with validated gang members or associates on at least three separate occasions, as documented by law enforcement. After reviewing the materials submitted by both parties,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district judge properly exercised his discretion in weighing the evidence before him to find that \u201c[t]he fact remains, however, he obviously runs with gang members and local law enforcement considers him at least a Norte\u00f1o gang associate.... \u201d Being that it is not this Court\u2019s \u201cduty to reweigh the evidence presented to the trial court,\u201d <em>United States v. Spangle, </em>626 F.3d 488, 497 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Cir.2010), we do not find the district court\u2019s factual finding so \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d as to constitute a procedural error. <em>See United States v. Ressam, </em>629 F.3d 793, 825 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">\n<em>2. The Nature of Appellant\u2019s Conduct Underlying His Prior Conviction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Appellant contends that \u201c[i]t is also clear that the district court\u2019s references to [Appellant\u2019s] involvement in the WinCo incident constituted a finding that he participated in a robbery.\u201d The record from the sentencing hearing indicates that while the district court was initially mistaken, both the defense and prosecution corrected the district court, before Appellant\u2019s sentence was imposed, that Appellant\u2019s prior conviction was for Assault with a Deadly Weapon. Further, the Pre-Sentence Report (\u201cP.S.R.\u201d), which the district court explicitly references throughout the sentencing proceeding, explains the facts underlying Appellant\u2019s prior conviction. However, after being apprised of the exact nature of the circumstances surrounding Appellant\u2019s prior conviction, the district court still found that \u201c[t]he defendant pled guilty to [Assault with a Deadly Weapon] then and was so adjudicated for his part in the thefts and the felonious assault as [Appellant] helped his associates escape.\u201d Thus, the district court\u2019s factual findings of the circumstances of Appellant\u2019s prior conviction were not \u201cillogical, implausible, or without support in the record.\u201d <em>Spangle, </em>626 F.3d at 497.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">\n<em>B. The District Court Adequately Explained The Section 3553(a) Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">While Appellant claims that the district court only \u201ccursorily invoked the 3553(a)(2) factors,\u201d \u201c \u2018[t]he district court need not tick off each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to show that it has considered them.\u2019\u201d <em>Ressam, </em>629 F.3d at 826 (quoting <em>United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 992 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc)). While \u201cthe district court still is required to articulate the reasons for the extent of the departure in sufficiently specific language to allow appellate review,\u201d <em>United States v. Ellsworth, </em>456 F.3d 1146, 1153 n. 3 (9th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), this requirement was satisfied here, as the district court noted Appellant\u2019s \u201cchaotic upbringing and lack of youthful guidance,\u201d and expressly adopted the P.S.R.\u2019s findings (which outline the mitigating circumstances surrounding Appellant\u2019s prior conviction) in recommending a downward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">\n<em>II. Appellant\u2019s Lower Than Guideline Range 24 Month Sentence is Not Substantively Unreasonable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">Appellant argues that it was substantively unreasonable for the district court to sentence Johnson to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment because Appellant is \u201cdemonstrably innocent of the felony conduct in connection with the predicate offense.\u201d In addition, Appellant seems to argue that his youth and disputed gang affiliation also warrant his requested split sentence and that the lower than guideline sentence of 24 months is still \u201cgreater than necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aor1\">Here, after having extensively reviewed the evidence before it and listening to each party\u2019s arguments, the district court exercised its discretion in finding that the underlying predicate conviction of assault with a deadly weapon was a serious crime. Moreover, after the judge was corrected by the parties regarding the exact nature of the underlying conviction, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>court still found that Appellant pled guilty to the underlying charge and chose to surround himself with validated gang members and possess a firearm as a prohibited person. The district court further considered Appellant\u2019s age, chaotic upbringing, and the mitigating circumstances surrounding the prior conviction and granted the P.S.R.\u2019s recommended downward departure from the Guideline range of 37-44 months to 24 months. The fact that the district court did not choose Appellant\u2019s sentence of choice of a split sentence does not make his sentence substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Whitehead, </em>532 F.3d 991, 993 (9th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b630-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-10\">. Appellant asserts that the district court may not rely on \"unsupported conclusions\u201d or \"brief and cryptic references\u201d in finding that Appellant continually associated with gang members. However, Appellant\u2019s own submission contains a transcript from an interview that discusses the incident where a law enforcement officer observed a picture on Appellant\u2019s cell phone with Appellant flashing a Norte\u00f1o gang sign and brandishing a firearm, the factual accuracy of which was never refuted by Appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b631-9\">. As Appellant concedes, pursuant to <em>Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994), he may not collaterally attack the circumstances surrounding his prior conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
