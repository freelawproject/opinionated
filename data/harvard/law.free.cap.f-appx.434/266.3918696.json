Betskoff appeals the district court\u2019s order remanding the underlying action to Maryland state court. We vacate and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-18\">\u201cCongress has placed broad restrictions on the power of federal appellate courts to review district court orders remanding removed cases to state court.\u201d <em>Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, </em>516 U.S. 124, 127, 116 S.Ct. 494, 133 L.Ed.2d 461 (1995). Thus, remand orders are generally \u201cnot reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). The Supreme Court has explained that the appellate restrictions of \u201c \u00a7 1447(d) must be read in pari materia with \u00a7 1447(c), so that only remands based on grounds specified in [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1447(c) [(2006)] [i.e., lack of subject matter jurisdiction and defects in removal procedures] are immune from review under \u00a7 1447(d).\u201d <em>Things Remembered, </em>516 U.S. at 127, 116 S.Ct. 494. Whether a remand order is reviewable is not based on a district court\u2019s explicit citation to \u00a7 1447(c); \u201c[t]he bar of \u00a7 1447(d) applies to any order invoking substantively one of the grounds specified in \u00a7 1447(c).\u201d <em>Borneman v. United States, </em>213 F.3d 819, 824-25 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-21\">Although a remand based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be entered at any time, either sua sponte or by any party, remand for a procedural defect \u201cmust be effected by granting a timely filed motion.\u201d <em>Ellenburg v. Spartan Motors Chassis, Inc., </em>519 F.3d 192, 196-97 (4th Cir.2008). Where, as here, a district court sua sponte remands a case as untimely removed, it acts outside the scope of \u00a7 1447(c), and the order is reviewable by this court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-22\">Here, the district court\u2019s remand order was entered sua sponte, based on its finding that removal was untimely under \u00a7 1447(c). However, we have held that \u201ca district court is prohibited from remanding a case sua sponte based on a procedural defect absent a motion to do so from a party.\u201d <em>Ellenburg, </em>519 F.3d at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-23\">Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>In light of .this disposition, we deny as moot Betskoffs motion to expedite. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-19\"> The statute provides an exception to the appellate ban for civil rights cases removed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443 (2006). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d) (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
