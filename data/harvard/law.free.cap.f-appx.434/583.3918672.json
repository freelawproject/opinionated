We review de novo and may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>UMG Recordings, Inc. v. Augusto, </em>628 F.3d 1175, 1178 (9th Cir.2011). We conclude that Kaufman lacks standing, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>we vacate the grant of summary judgment and remand to the district court with instructions to dismiss. <em>See Serena v. Mock, </em>547 F.3d 1051, 1054 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">In his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action, Kaufman alleges that the notices he received regarding post-tow hearings were deficient under state law because they failed to indicate a hearing could be requested by mail. However, Kaufman was aware that he could request a hearing by mail. He therefore lacks standing to challenge the sufficiency of the notice because he has no redressable injury. <em>See Serena, </em>547 F.3d at 1054; <em>Lone Star Sec. and Video, Inc. v. City of L.A., </em>584 F.3d 1232, 1238 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Kaufman did not request in-person hearings by mail \u2014 he filed forms requesting a \u201csupervisor\u2019s review\u201d of the tows by mail. Because Kaufman did not request an in-person hearing, he lacks standing to challenge the sufficiency or timing of the hearings under state or federal law. <em>See Serena, </em>547 F.3d at 1054 (failure to apply deprives a plaintiff of standing to challenge subsequent procedures). We note, however, that the record contains uncontroverted evidence that the department did consider and adjudicate Kaufman\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Kaufman also lacked standing to seek prospective injunctive relief because he did not demonstrate that he \u201cis threatened with a concrete and particularized legal harm ... [and] a sufficient likelihood that he will again be wronged in a similar way.\u201d <em>See Bates v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>511 F.3d 974, 985 (9th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Kaufman\u2019s claim for injunctive relief for lack of standing. <em>See City of L.A. v. Lyons, </em>461 U.S. 95, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">We decline to consider Kaufman\u2019s claims, raised for the first time on appeal, that the supervisor\u2019s reviews and notifications of the final determinations were untimely. <em>See White v. Martel, </em>601 F.3d 882, 885 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201cGenerally, arguments not raised before the district court are waived on appeal.\u201d). .</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">VACATED and REMANDED with instructions to DISMISS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b606-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
