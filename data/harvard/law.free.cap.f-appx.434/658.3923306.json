We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition as to Kmet\u2019s asylum and withholding claims and grant the petition as to Kmet\u2019s CAT claim and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">1. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Kmet\u2019s political opinion was not a central reason for his persecution. <em>See Parussimova v. Mukasey, </em>555 F.3d 734, 740 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201cThe Real ID Act requires that a protected ground represent \u2018one central reason\u2019 for an asylum applicant\u2019s persecution.\u201d). Kmet did not present compelling evidence that he was persecuted because he exposed government corruption. Further,</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">the evidence presented does not compel a finding that the government was involved or acquiesced in Kmet\u2019s persecution. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1999) (noting that a contrary result is not compelled where there is \u201c[t]he possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Accordingly, Kmet\u2019s asylum claim is denied. Because Kmet failed to demonstrate that he was eligible for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Fa-rah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">2. The BIA erred in failing to address Kmet\u2019s CAT claim. <em>See Sagaydak v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 1035, 1040 (9th Cir. 2005) (\u201cUs and the BIA are not free to ignore arguments raised by [a party].\u201d). Accordingly, we remand to the BIA to determine whether Kmet is entitled to CAT relief. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-15\">Each party shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b681-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
