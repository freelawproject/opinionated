McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b766-20\">Petitioner, a state prisoner proceeding pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-21\">Petitioner was convicted in 2004 of attempted first degree murder after deliberation, menacing, and third degree assault. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and the Colorado Supreme Court denied certiorari review. In 2008, Petitioner\u2019s motion for post-conviction relief under Colo. R.Crim. P. 35(a) was denied. This denial was affirmed on appeal, and the Colorado Supreme Court denied certiorari review.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-22\">Petitioner filed this \u00a7 2254 habeas motion with the district court in 2009. He raised three claims: first, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to prosecute him; second, he was subjected to double jeopardy; and third, the trial court and district attorney violated his due process rights when they improperly misidentified Petitioner as having a prior conviction in a case two years earlier. The district court ordered dismissal of the first two claims, then dismissed Petitioner\u2019s due process claim by separate order.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-23\">After carefully reviewing Petitioner\u2019s filings and the record on appeal, we conclude that reasonable jurists would not debate whether the district court erred in dismissing Petitioner\u2019s claims. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). The district court determined that Petitioner had not exhausted his first two claims, but nevertheless ruled on the merits. It found the trial court had jurisdiction over Petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>because any misidentification of Petitioner for a prior crime was irrelevant to the court\u2019s association of Petitioner with the particular crime of which he was now convicted. The district court also determined that Petitioner\u2019s double jeopardy claim was similarly without merit because he was not being punished or prosecuted for the \u201csame offense.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Monge v. California, </em>524 U.S. 721, 727-28, 118 S.Ct. 2246, 141 L.Ed.2d 615 (1998). As to Petitioner\u2019s due process claim, the district court correctly applied Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit precedent to conclude that the crux of Petitioner\u2019s claim \u2014 the trial court\u2019s alleged misidentification of Petitioner Nicholas Valdez as Nicholas \u201cLeonard\u201d Valdez \u2014 had already been addressed in Petitioner\u2019s first two claims. The district court also observed that, although the trial court did cite to a prior criminal case against Petitioner during sentencing, its sentencing decision was not based on the prior conviction but rather on Petitioner\u2019s history of escalating violence and his probationary status at the time the instant offense occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Therefore, for substantially the same reasons stated by the district court, we DENY the application for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS Petitioner\u2019s appeals. We GRANT Petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b766-17\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
