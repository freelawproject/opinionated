Boles appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant City of Philadelphia on the claims she brought under Title VII and Pennsylvania\u2019s Human Relations Act. For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-24\">Because we write primarily for the parties, we need not repeat the facts or proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>dural history of this case. Moreover, the district court has ably summarized the relevant background. <em>See Boles v. City of Phila. Water Dept., </em>2010 WL 2044473 (E.D.Pa. May 21, 2010). On appeal, Boles argues that the district court erred: (1) when it granted summary judgment to the City of Philadelphia on her claim that she was subject to disparate treatment on account of her race; and (2) when it failed to consider claims of retaliation and hostile work environment, which did not appear in Boles\u2019s complaint. Those claims were raised in Boles\u2019 response to the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">In his detailed and thoughtful opinion, Judge Dalzell carefully and clearly explained his reasons for granting the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>See id. </em>We can add little to Judge Dalzell\u2019s analysis and discussion and we will therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order for substantially the same reasons as set forth in that opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
