Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 12940 et seq. Vallimont also appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Chevron on his claim that he was retaliated against in violation of the aforementioned laws. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-16\">This court has found that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-17\">[a] plaintiff alleging disparate treatment under Title VII must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination by offering evidence that give[s] rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. A plaintiff may establish a prima facie case either by meeting the four-part test laid out in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), or by providing direct evidence suggesting that the employment decision was based on an impermissible criterion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-18\"><em>EEOC v. Boeing Co., </em>577 F.3d 1044, 1049 (9th Cir.2009) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-19\">To establish a prima facie case under the four-part test, a plaintiff must demonstrate: \u201cthat (1) he belongs to a protected class; (2) he was qualified for the position; (3) he was subject to an adverse employment action; and (4) similarly situated individuals outside his protected class were treated more favorably.\u201d <em>Chuang v. Univ. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>of Cal. Davis, Bd. of Trs., </em>225 F.3d 1115, 1123 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">After a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">[t]he burden of production, but not persuasion, then shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action. If the employer does so, the plaintiff must then show that the articulated reason is pretextual either directly by persuading the [fact-finder] that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence. When the evidence is direct, we require very little evidence to survive summary judgment in a discrimination case. But when the plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence, that evidence must be specific and substantial to defeat the employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-7\"><em>EEOC, </em>577 F.3d at 1049 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">California courts also apply the Title VII burden shifting analysis in analyzing state discrimination claims under FEHA. <em>See Metoyer v. Chassman, </em>504 F.3d 919, 941 (9th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., </em>24 Cal.4th 317, 354, 100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (Cal.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">The district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Chevron on Vallimont\u2019s reverse racial and gender discrimination claims under Title VII and FEHA. Even assuming arguendo that Vallimont established a prima facie case of discrimination, Chevron articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to terminate him. Jeffrey Hedges, the division manager, made the decision to terminate Vallimont based on findings of misconduct that violated Chevron\u2019s equal employment and anti-harassment policies. These findings were based on an investigation done by Kathryn Gallacher, an employee relations counselor at Chevron who had previously performed close to one hundred investigations and had never met Val-limont, the workers interviewed, or any of the management employees prior to the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">The district court properly determined that Vallimont failed to raise questions of fact regarding pretext. Vallimont has not demonstrated that other similarly situated employees were treated more favorably, as he has not identified any other worker who \u201camassed a record of misconduct comparable to\u201d his own. <em>See Leong v. Potter, </em>347 F.3d 1117, 1124 (9th Cir. 2003). Additionally, the record does not establish that Hedges played a large role in Gallacher\u2019s investigation and improperly attempted to sway her findings. Rather, Gallacher ran the investigation without attempts by Hedges to bias the outcome. Moreover, even if Gallacher\u2019s investigation were flawed, the record is void of any indication that Hedges lacked a sincere belief in her findings. <em>See Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., </em>281 F.3d 1054, 1063 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">Furthermore, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to Vallimont\u2019s retaliation claims. In evaluating retaliation claims under Title VII and FEHA, we consider the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden shifting analysis requiring a plaintiff to first set forth a prima facie case of retaliation. <em>See Miller v. Fairchild Indus., Inc., </em>885 F.2d 498, 504 n. 4 (9th Cir.1989); <em>see also Flait v. North Am. Watch Corp., </em>3 Cal.App.4th 467, 475-476, 4 Cal.Rptr.2d 522 (Cal.Ct.App.1992). A plaintiff must demonstrate that: \u201c1) he engaged in a protected activity; 2) he suffered an adverse employment decision; and 3) there was a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employ-</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>ment decision.\u201d <em>Villiarimo, </em>281 F.3d at 1064. If a prima facie case is established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2C\">[t]he burden of production then shifts to the defendant-employer to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory explanation for the adverse employment action. If the employer successfully rebuts the inference of retaliation, the burden of production shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the defendant\u2019s proffered explanation is merely a pretext for impermissible retaliation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><em>Miller, </em>885 F.2d at 504 n. 4 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Vallimont has not established a prima facie case of retaliation because he has not demonstrated that he engaged in protected activity. The record does not show that he informed Chevron that Isabel Delgadillo received preferential treatment on the basis of her race, gender, or national origin in violation of Title VII or FEHA. And again, even assuming arguendo that Vallimont has set forth a prima facie case, Chevron asserted a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action-an investigation revealed findings of inappropriate conduct in violation of company policy. Vallimont has failed to demonstrate that questions of fact exist as to whether this reason was really a pretext for unlawful retaliation because he has not shown that Hedges did not honestly believe Gallacher\u2019s report regarding Vallimont\u2019s misconduct to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Finally, Vallimont\u2019s claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy fails. \u201cIn order to sustain a claim of wrongful discharge in violation of fundamental public policy, [a plaintiff] must prove that his dismissal violated a policy that is (1) fundamental, (2) beneficial for the public, and (3) embodied in a statute or constitutional provision.\u201d <em>Turner v. An-heuser-Busch, Inc., </em>7 Cal.4th 1238, 1256, 32 Cal.Rptr.2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022 (1994). Vallimont argues that Chevron\u2019s act of discriminating against him on the basis of race and gender violates public policy. However, as addressed above, Vallimont has not raised questions of fact as to whether he was wrongly terminated or retaliated against on the basis of race or gender.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Because Vallimont has failed to set forth questions of material fact, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Chevron on all appealed claims was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b620-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
