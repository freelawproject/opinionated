Doyle asserts that Chase violated the CFAA by accessing, without Doyle\u2019s authorization, Doyle\u2019s USB thumb drive, which contained personnel records sealed by the California state court. Doyle contends that he satisfied the \u201closs\u201d requirement as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(e)(ll) because of his need for a forensic computer expert to detect and delete all of the documents that were copied from the thumb drive to Chase\u2019s computers.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-19\">The district court concluded that even accepting Doyle\u2019s theory of loss, his assessment of loss is entirely speculative. We agree. Doyle bases his loss assessment solely on two expert declarations. The district court correctly concluded that the discussion of damages in the first declaration was too speculative to survive summary judgment. <em>See e.g., Soremekun v. Thrifty Payless, Inc., </em>509 F.3d 978, 984 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201cConclusory, speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise genuine issues of fact and defeat summary judgment.\u201d). The second, which attempts to calculate the basis for the future expenditure of more than $5,000, was submitted well beyond the discovery deadlines. The district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to consider this untimely declaration. <em>See, e.g., Yeti by Molly, Ltd. v. Deckers Outdoor Corp., </em>259 F.3d 1101, 1106 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b678-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided <em>by </em>9th Cir.
