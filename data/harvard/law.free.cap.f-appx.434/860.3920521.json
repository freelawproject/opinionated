Rios-Zavala argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-20\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing Rios-Zavala within the guideline range. Although Rios-Zava-la was permitted to return voluntarily to Mexico in 2003 after being arrested for his role in a conspiracy to commit forgery, border patrol agents again apprehended Rios-Zavala after he returned to the United States illegally in August 2004, November 2004, December 2004, June 2007, and in June 2010. The district court considered \u201call the [sentencing] factors,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and reasonably determined that a sentence that exceeded one year was necessary to address Rios-Zava-la\u2019s repeated illegal reentries, and would provide adequate punishment, promote respect for the law, and deter future similar misconduct. Rios-Zavala argues that the district court \u201cnever seriously considered\u201d his dire economic circumstances, but the district court \u201crecognize[d] and un-derst[oo]d that things [were] bad in Mexico [and Rios-Zavala] came here trying to earn a living.\u201d The district court nevertheless found that Rios-Zavala\u2019s poverty did not outweigh his criminal history and the need to deter him from entering the United States yet again. Rios-Zavala\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-21\">Rios-Zavala\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
