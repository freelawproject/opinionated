For the following reasons, we will vacate and remand to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b106-14\">Because we write for the parties, who are familiar with the facts and procedural history of this case, we summarize them only briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-16\">In 1999, Great Western pursued a legal malpractice action against Appellees Brownstein Vitale &amp; Weiss, P.C., and Brownstein &amp; Vitale, P.C. (collectively Brownstein <em>&amp; </em>Vitale) in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. The parties agreed to submit the matter to binding arbitration before Tom Rutter (Rutter), an arbitrator with Appellee ADR Options, Inc. (ADR Options). The parties\u2019 arbitration agreement stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-17\">Each party and participating attorney has disclosed any past or present relationship with the arbitrator, direct or indirect, whether financial, professional, social or any other kind. The arbitrator has also disclosed any past or present relationship with any party or attorney. It is understood that any doubt has been resolved in favor of disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-18\">In September 2003, Rutter entered an arbitration award in favor of Brownstein <em>&amp; </em>Vitale. Great Western then filed a petition to vacate the award in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, alleging that ADR Options had undisclosed conflicts of interest with defense counsel for Brownstein <em>&amp; </em>Vitale. The court denied the petition to vacate, and Great Western appealed to the Superi- or Court of Pennsylvania, which affirmed on September 22, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-19\">While the petition to vacate was pending, Great Western filed a series of amended complaints in Pennsylvania state court against ADR Options, Brownstein <em>&amp; </em>Vi-tale, and Rutter, alleging breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, fraud, and violations of Pennsylvania\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (UTPCPL). The Court of Common Pleas dismissed the actions, and the Supe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>rior Court of Pennsylvania affirmed in May 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In February 2008, Great Western filed a federal action in the District of New Jersey, alleging that certain members of the Pennsylvania state judiciary conspired to issue favorable rulings in exchange for future employment at ADR Options. The District Court dismissed Great Western\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim on March 16, 2009, and denied its motions for reconsideration and leave to amend. In a precedential opinion, we affirmed the District Court\u2019s determinations, finding that the complaint failed to plead facts plausibly suggesting a conspiracy. <em>Great W. Mining &amp; Mineral Co. v. Fox Rothschild LLP, </em>615 F.3d 159 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Undeterred by defeats in both federal court and the state courts in Pennsylvania, Great Western sued ADR Options in New Jersey Superior Court for breach of contract, fraud, and violations of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act (CFA) on account of alleged overbilling during the 2003 arbitration. That case settled on September 11, 2009, but before it did, Great Western filed this action against ADR Options and Brownstein &amp; Vitale in the District of New Jersey, alleging breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, fraud, and violations of the CFA and the UTPCPL. In its amended complaint, Great Western alleged that Brownstein &amp; Vitale represented ADR Options in two separate actions in 1997, that it had a duty to disclose this attorney-client relationship pursuant to the arbitration agreement, and that its failure to do so resulted in an unfavorable arbitration award for Great Western. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Appellees moved to dismiss Great Western\u2019s amended complaint on the basis of improper venue, lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and failure to state a claim for relief. On April 6, 2010, the District Court granted Appellees\u2019 motions to dismiss, finding that venue in the District of New Jersey was improper and that transfer to another venue would not be in the interest of justice. App. at 5a (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a) (providing that when venue is improper, a district court \u201cshall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought\u201d)). Although the Court chose not to reach the merits, it held that \u201cit is apparent that Great Western is attempting to initiate a new action that has previously been decided at least two or three times on the merits, involving the same parties, events, and legal claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6a. In its order denying Great Western\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the District Court rejected Great Western\u2019s contention that \u201cthe Court has been hoodwinked by defendant\u2019s clever strategy of misrepresenting the facts,\u201d again stating that \u201cit is clear that this litigation had been previously litigated several times.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8a.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Great Western filed this timely appeal, claiming the District Court erred in dismissing its amended complaint for improper venue. Appellees urge us to affirm for numerous reasons, including: (1) venue was improper; (2) the Rooker-Feldman doctrine bars jurisdiction; (3) the claims are barred by res judicata and the entire controversy doctrine; (4) ADR Options is immune from suit; and (5) Great Western fails to state a claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">Appellees claim we have no subject matter jurisdiction over Great Western\u2019s appeal because, under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, we are barred from considering a claim that is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with a state court adjudication. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number><em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). We exercise <em>de novo </em>review over questions of subject matter jurisdiction, <em>Pennmont Sec. v. Frucher, </em>586 F.3d 242, 245 (3d Cir.2009), and \u201chave an independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists,\u201d <em>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 514, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The Rooker-Feldman doctrine bars a federal claim only if four requirements are satisfied: \u201c(1) the federal plaintiff lost in state court; (2) the plaintiff complaints] of injuries caused by [the] state-court judgments\u2019; (3) those judgments were rendered before the federal suit was filed; and (4) the plaintiff is inviting the district court to review and reject the state judgments.\u201d <em>Great Western, </em>615 F.3d at 166 (quoting <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>544 U.S. at 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517). Here, Great Western does not allege that its injuries were <em>caused </em>by the state courts\u2019 refusal to vacate Rutter\u2019s arbitration award or award it monetary relief. Rather, the gravamen of Great Western\u2019s complaint is that Appellees\u2019 failure to disclose material information regarding their prior attorney-client relationship caused Great Western to submit to binding arbitration before an allegedly biased arbitrator. Because \u201cthe injury complained of in federal court existed prior to the state-court proceedings and thus could not have been caused by\u2019 those proceedings,\u201d <em>Great Western, </em>615 F.3d at 167, the second and fourth requirements of <em>Exxon Mobil </em>have not been satisfied. Thus, the Rooker-Feldman doctrine is no obstacle to our jurisdiction over this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Turning to the merits, we consider the District Court\u2019s finding that venue was improper in New Jersey. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal determination, and review its decision to dismiss Great Western\u2019s amended complaint for abuse of discretion. <em>Jumara v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>55 F.3d 873, 878 (3d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">In federal diversity suits, venue is proper in any district where: (1) \u201cany defendant resides, if all defendants reside in the same State;\u201d (2) \u201ca substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated;\u201d or (3) \u201cany defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the action is commenced, if there is no district in which the action may otherwise be brought.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(a). For purposes of Section 1391(a)(1), \u201ca defendant that is a corporation shall be deemed to reside in any judicial district in which it is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the action is commenced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1391(c). Because improper venue is an affirmative defense, the burden of proving lack of proper venue remains \u2014 at all times \u2014 with the defendant. <em>Myers v. Am. Dental Ass\u2019n, </em>695 F.2d 716, 724-25 (3d Cir.1982) (comparing jurisdictional questions \u201cconcerning the court\u2019s power to entertain the action\u201d with \u201cdilatory defenses [such as venue] that do not concern the court\u2019s authority to adjudicate,\u201d and holding that while the plaintiff bears the burden of proving the former, defendants must plead facts showing the absence of the latter). As such, it is not necessary for the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>to include allegations in his complaint showing that venue is proper. <em>Id. </em>at 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">In its amended complaint, Great Western alleged that ADR Options and Brownstein &amp; Vitale were corporations \u201cdoing business\u201d in the State of New Jersey, so venue was proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(a) and (c). <em>See Wilson v. Paradise Vill. Beach Resort &amp; Spa, </em>395 NJ.Super. 520, 528, 929 A.2d 1122 (App.Div.2007) (holding that, under New Jersey law, any party that \u201cmaintains minimum contacts with the ... state that are continuous and substantial\u201d will be subject to personal jurisdiction). Brownstein &amp; Vitale argued in its motion to dismiss that venue was improper in New Jersey, because all defendants were citizens of Pennsylvania resident in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The law firm failed to acknowledge, however, that a corporation may \u201creside\u201d in more than one state, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) (providing for transfer of a case where both the original and the requested venue are proper), and presented no evidence showing that it was not subject to personal jurisdiction in New Jersey.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(c). Thus, the firm failed to satisfy its burden of showing that venue was improper in the District of New Jersey, and the District Court erred in dismissing Great Western\u2019s amended complaint on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Appellees maintain that even if the District Court\u2019s venue determination is erroneous, we should affirm the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Great Western\u2019s amended complaint on alternative grounds, including claim preclusion, arbitral immunity, and failure to state a claim for relief. <em>See United States v. Sanchez, </em>562 F.3d 275, 279 (3d Cir.2009) (holding that an appellate court may affirm the result reached by a district court on alternative grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">Although these arguments may well be meritorious, because \u201cthe resolution of [these] issue[s] requires the exercise of discretion or fact finding,\u201d we find that \u201cit is inappropriate and unwise\u201d to decide these matters in the first instance. <em>Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Basell USA Inc., </em>512 F.3d 86, 97 (3d Cir.2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see K-Land Corp. No. 28 v. Landis Sewerage Autk, </em>173 N.J. 59, 800 A.2d 861, 868 (2002) (recognizing that equitable considerations can relax New Jersey\u2019s mandatory-joinder requirements when joinder would be \u201cunfair\u201d); <em>M\u00edreles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 11-12, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991) (addressing standard for overcoming judicial immunity). Thus, we leave it to the District Court on remand to evaluate the merits of Appellees\u2019 alternative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>For the reasons stated, we will vacate the order of the District Court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-5\">. Appellees assign too much weight to <em>Exxon Mobil's </em>use of the phrase \"inextricably intertwined.\u201d In <em>Great Western, </em>we explained that the phrase \"inextricably intertwined\u201d \"is simply a descriptive label attached to claims that meet the [four] requirements oudined in <em>Exxon Mobil.\" </em>615 F.3d at 170 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-6\">. ADR Options did not raise the venue issue in its motion to dismiss and its failure to do so constituted a forfeiture of that right. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(h); <em>see also Myers, </em>695 F.2d at 721 (\"The federal rules single out four defenses which must be raised by the defendant\u2019s initial responsive pleading in order to be preserved. Such a rule reflects a strong policy against tardily raising defenses that go not to the merits of the case but to the legal adequacy of the initial steps taken by the plaintiff in his litigation.\u201d). Where a defendant fails to timely object to venue, \"it is inappropriate for the trial court to dispose of the case <em>sua </em>sponte.\". <em>Sinwell v. Shapp, </em>536 F.2d 15, 19 (3d Cir. 1976). However, because Brownstein &amp; Vitale objected to venue and Great Western had adequate opportunity to respond, the District Court did not err in considering the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b109-12\">. Based on the limited record before us, it appears that corporate Appellee Brownstein &amp; Vitale has strong ties to the District of New Jersey. These contacts include: membership in the New Jersey State Bar, a substantial caseload in New Jersey courts, and an office in Cherry Hill, New Jersey.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
