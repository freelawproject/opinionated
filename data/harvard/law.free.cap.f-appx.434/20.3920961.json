Sept. 15, 2010). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-17\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of Dong\u2019s motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that such motions are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322-23, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992)). We review the BIA\u2019s factual findings regarding country conditions under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 169 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-18\">There is no dispute that Dong\u2019s January 2010 motion to reopen was untimely and number-barred because it was her third motion to reopen and her administrative order of removal became final in 2004. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a (c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Although Dong contends that the time and number limitations do not apply to her motion to reopen as it is \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), her arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-19\">In connection with her motion to reopen, Dong submitted letters and supporting documents from Ling Li and Kang Qi Zhang that purported to describe conditions in specific areas of China. Each letter was unsworn and addressed to \u201cRespectful Judge,\u201d the supporting documen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>tation was unauthenticated, and neither Li nor Zhang was from Dong\u2019s home village or explained his connection to Dong. Moreover, certain documents relating to Li indicated he was punished for a \u201csmuggling crime,\u201d not for violating China\u2019s family planning policy as Dong alleged. After considering them, the BIA reasonably declined to accord evidentiary weight to either the letters or the supporting documents. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006) (finding that the weight accorded to the applicant\u2019s evidence in immigration proceedings lies largely within the discretion of the agency); <em>see also Jian Hui Shao, </em>546 F.3d at 172-73 (concluding that the BIA reasonably determined that evidence merely referencing the family planning policy\u2019s mandatory sterilization requirement without any indication that such sterilizations are performed by force is insufficient to establish an objectively reasonable fear of persecution). Because Dong did not submit any other evidence in support of her family planning claim, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying her motion to reopen on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">The BIA also reasonably refused to accord evidentiary weight to a letter from Dong\u2019s pastor, as it contained only one sentence and failed to identify when Dong began attending church services. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 342. Moreover, as the BIA found, Dong\u2019s alleged conversion to Christianity represented a change in her personal circumstances, as opposed to changed country conditions in China. <em>See Yuen Jin v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 143, 155 (2d Cir.2008). The current regulatory scheme generally prevents aliens from reopening their removal proceedings by changing their personal circumstances in response to changes in their country. <em>See Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 274 (2d Cir.2006). In addition, the record supports the BIA\u2019s determination that, although China has engaged in discrimination and abuse of Christians, Dong failed to establish that conditions in China had changed fundamentally since her merits hearing, as required to warrant reopening. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 342 (holding that the weight afforded to the applicant\u2019s evidence in immigration proceedings lies largely within the discretion of the agency). Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s denial of Dong\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
