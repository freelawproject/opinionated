After extinguishing his direct appeal, Higgins filed a state habeas petition that asserted claims under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), among others. Under <em>Brady, </em>Higgins claimed that the State had withheld evidence of pending criminal charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>against the State\u2019s main witness, and under <em>Strickland, </em>he claimed that trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by failing to present certain evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After considering both claims on the merits, the state district court denied habeas relief. The state court of appeals and supreme court denied relief as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Higgins then renewed his <em>Brady </em>and <em>Strickland </em>claims in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. The magistrate judge concluded that the \u00a7 2254 petition could be disposed of without an evidentiary hearing, and, on the basis of the record alone, recommended that Higgins\u2019s petition be dismissed with prejudice. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation in its entirety. <em>See Higgins v. Cain, </em>No. 09-CV-2632, 2010 WL 890998 (E.D.La. Mar.8, 2010). We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on one issue: whether the district court erred in failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing on Higgins\u2019s <em>Brady </em>and <em>Strickland </em>claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">After we granted the COA, the Supreme Court issued <em>Cullen v. Pinholster, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011), and we directed the parties to submit supplemental briefing on <em>Pinholster</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>s applicability to the sole issue on appeal. In <em>Pinholster, </em>the Supreme Court held that review under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) \u201cis limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1398. This is because \u201c \u00a7 2254(d)(1) ... \u2018requires an examination of the state court decision at the time it was made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pape v. Thaler, </em>645 F.3d 281, 288, 2011 WL 2476437, at *3 (5th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>Pinholster, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1398). Accordingly, \u201cevidence introduced in federal court has no bearing on \u00a7 2254(d)(1) review.\u201d <em>Pinholster, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1400.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Higgins contends that neither his <em>Brady </em>claim nor <em>Strickland </em>claim was decided on the merits by the state habeas court, and therefore \u00a7 2254(d)(1) does not apply. We disagree; the state habeas court\u2019s order denying relief clearly adjudicated both claims on the merits. Additionally, both claims involve mixed questions of law and fact. <em>See Banks v. Thaler, </em>583 F.3d 295, 309 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cClaimed <em>Brady </em>violations are mixed questions of law and fact....\u201d); <em>Gregory v. Thaler, </em>601 F.3d 347, 351 (5th Cir.2010) (\u201cClaims of ineffective assistance of counsel involve mixed questions of law and fact and are governed by \u00a7 2254(d)(1).\u201d). \u201cThis court reviews questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact under section 2254(d)(1).\u201d <em>Richardson v. Quarterman, </em>537 F.3d 466, 472 (5th Cir.2008). The district court was therefore correct \u2014 and required \u2014 to review Higgins\u2019s <em>Brady </em>and <em>Strickland </em>claims under \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">Thus, under <em>Pinholster, </em>the district court in its review was limited to the record that was before the state habeas court. <em>See </em>131 S.Ct. at 1398. To have granted an evidentiary hearing would have been error. <em>See, e.g., Pape, </em>645 F.3d at 288, 2011 WL 2476437, at *3 (\u201cUnder <em>Pinholster ... </em>the district court erred by conducting the evi-dentiary hearing and by relying on evidence from that hearing to conclude that the state habeas court had unreasonably applied <em>Strickland.\u201d). </em>The district court therefore did not err in denying Higgins <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>an evidentiary hearing on his <em>Brady </em>and <em>Strickland </em>claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-21\">Pursuant to 5th Cir.
