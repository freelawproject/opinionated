We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-21\">Martinez-Rivas argues that the IJ erred in concluding he did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his race. This court reviews the BIA\u2019s decision that a petitioner has not established eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal for substantial evidence. <em>Karouni v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1163, 1170 (9th Cir.2005). \u201cThis standard limits reversals of BIA decisions to situations where the Petitioner has presented evidence so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find that Petitioner has not established eligibility for asylum.\u201d <em>Ali v. Ashcroft, </em>394 F.3d 780, 784 (9th Cir.2005) (internal quotation and alteration marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Although Martinez-Rivas has clearly suffered harassment and discrimination on account of his race, the evidence presented, even taken cumulatively, does not compel a finding of past persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Because Martinez-Rivas did not establish eligibility for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Contrary to Martinez-Rivas\u2019s contention, the BIA acted within its discretion in determining that he failed to file a timely motion to reopen. Martinez-Rivas did not file his motion until two weeks after the deadline, the 2005 country report he submitted with his motion to reopen could have been presented to the IJ, and the 2006 country report does not show materially different conditions in Guatemala. <em>See, e.g., Garcia v. Holder, </em>621 F.3d 906, 912 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201cA motion to reopen must be based on evidence that is \u2018material and [that] was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1)) (alteration in Garcia).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b699-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
