He claims that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the government\u2019s improper questions and comments regarding his post-arrest silence. Gatti argues that the Government\u2019s unobjected-to reference to his post-arrest silence undermined his duress defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-21\">To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show: (1) that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient in that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness; and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689-94, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). A failure to establish either prong defeats the claim. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The court indulges in a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that counsel\u2019s representation fell \u201cwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance\u201d or that, \u201cunder the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To demonstrate prejudice, a movant \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-22\">Duress is a difficult defense to establish. <em>Lee v. Hunt, </em>631 F.2d 1171, 1178 (5th Cir.1980). The evidence adduced at trial was inconsistent with a duress defense in the following respects. Even if Gatti\u2019s version of events is accepted as true, Gatti recklessly placed himself in the situation at issue by agreeing to engage in criminal activity (i.e., the theft of a truck) with Larry Thompson, Sr., whom he knew to have a violent history. <em>See United States v. Posada-Rios, </em>158 F.3d 832, 873 (5th Cir.1998). Additionally, after he was no longer in the presence of Thompson, and thus no longer under any threat of immi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>nent and impending harm, Gatti encountered police officers but failed to surrender when he first had an opportunity to do so. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, any damaging effect of the government\u2019s references to Gatti\u2019s post-arrest silence was ameliorated by counsel\u2019s rehabilitation of Gatti on redirect examination. Gatti has not shown that there was a reasonable probability of a different outcome but for counsel\u2019s not objecting. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
