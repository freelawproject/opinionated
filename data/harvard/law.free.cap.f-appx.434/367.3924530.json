Due to Landeros\u2019 Sentencing Guidelines criminal-history category\u2019s un-derrepresenting the seriousness of his criminal history, the district court departed upwardly from the presentence investigation report\u2019s (PSR) recommended Guidelines\u2019 sentencing range of 18 to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment and sentenced him, <em>inter alia, </em>to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. Landeros maintains the district court erred by departing upwardly, claiming the Guidelines accurately accounted for his prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Although, <em>post-Booker, </em>the sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guideline sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir. 2005). Lopez does not claim procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">As discussed, \u201cthe district court\u2019s decision to depart upwardly and the extent of that departure\u201d is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). An upward departure is <em>not </em>an abuse of discretion if it furthers the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 factors and is justified by the facts of the case. <em>Id. </em>That our court \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court\u201d. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">The district court departed upwardly based on Guideline \u00a7 4A1.3 (authorizes upward departure if defendant\u2019s criminal-history category underrepresents seriousness of his criminal history or likelihood of recidivism). Section 4A1.3(a)(2)(E) states: an upward departure may be based on \u201cprior similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in a criminal conviction\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-15\">In considering the \u00a7 3553 factors, the district court noted: Landeros had repeatedly reentered and committed crimes in the United States; and, despite his numerous reentries, he had only one prior conviction for illegal reentry. Because the district court\u2019s stated reasons for imposing the upward departure furthered the \u00a7 3553 factors and were supported by the PSR, the district court did not abuse its discretion in departing upwardly. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 805 (5th Cir.2008) (upholding 42-month upward variance from 30-month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Guidelines maximum based on prior deportations and lack of respect for law).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
