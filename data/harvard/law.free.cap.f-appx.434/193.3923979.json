Schmidt was sentenced to a total of 420 months\u2019 imprisonment, which resulted from the district court granting the Government\u2019s motion for an upward departure from his advisory Guidelines range of 168-210 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, Schmidt ehal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>lenges both the reasonableness of the district court\u2019s decision to depart above his advisory Guidelines range and the reasonableness of the extent of the departure. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">As we have explained, \u201c[N]o matter what provides the basis for a deviation from the Guidelines range[,] we review the resulting sentence only for reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Evans, 526 </em>F.3d 155, 164 (4th Cir.2008). In doing so, the court applies an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Diosdado-Star, </em>630 F.3d 359, 363 (4th Cir.2011). In assessing a sentencing court\u2019s decision to depart from a defendant\u2019s Guidelines range, this court \u201cconsider[s] whether the sentencing court acted reasonably both with respect to its decision to impose such a sentence and with respect to the extent of the divergence from the sentencing range.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez-Villanueva, </em>473 F.3d 118, 123 (4th Cir.2007). We will find a sentence to be unreasonable if the sentencing \u201ccourt provides an inadequate statement of reasons or relies on improper factors in imposing a sentence outside the properly calculated advisory sentencing range.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Schmidt first argues that, because he is sixty-four years old and in ill-health, a sentence at the high end of the pre-depar-ture Guidelines range would have been sufficient to incapacitate him for most if not all of the remainder of his natural life. Thus, Schmidt asserts the district court abused its discretion in departing upward from that range and that a 420-month sentence is greater than necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">We conclude the district court acted reasonably in departing under the three identified guideline provisions. The court utilized <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4A1.3, p.s. (1998), to increase Schmidt\u2019s criminal history category from I to IV. Pursuant to this provision, a district court may depart upward from an applicable Guidelines range if \u201creliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.3, p.s. To determine whether a departure sentence is appropriate in such circumstances, the court may consider, inter alia, prior similar conduct that did not result in a conviction. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4A1.3(e), p.s. Plainly, Schmidt\u2019s undetected twenty-plus-year history of producing child pornography and molesting children qualifies as a basis for departure under this provision. The district court further concluded this conduct warranted, conservatively, eight criminal history points, resulting in a Category IV criminal history. We discern no abuse of discretion in that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">The district court next increased Schmidt\u2019s total offense level from thirty-five to thirty-nine, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K2.0, p.s. and USSG \u00a7 5K2.8, p.s. As the district court discussed at length, the 1998 edition of the Sentencing Guidelines did not adequately account for the volume of pornographic pictures amassed by Schmidt, Schmidt\u2019s use of alcohol to weaken his victims, or the unusually heinous and degrading conduct in which Schmidt forced his victims to engage. We conclude the district court reasonably applied these departure provisions to increase Schmidt\u2019s total offense level. <em>See United States v. Grubbs, </em>585 F.3d 793, 804 (4th Cir.2009) (explaining that a departure pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K2.0, p.s., must be based on a factor related to the offenses charged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>the indictment), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1923, 176 L.Ed.2d 392 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Schmidt next argues the court abused its discretion in finding such an extensive departure was warranted to deter him from future criminal activity and to protect the public because the unrefuted record evidence demonstrates that Schmidt voluntarily stopped producing child pornography in 1999. Thus, Schmidt contends the court\u2019s reliance on these two reasons constitutes an abuse of discretion. Schmidt also asserts that the significant departure is unreasonable, given that he extensively cooperated with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">While the extent of the departure in this case is significant, we conclude that the court\u2019s sentencing decision is reasonable in light of Schmidt\u2019s long history of recidivism, which reflects his manifest disrespect for the law, and the need to impose a sentence reflecting the seriousness of the underlying offense and to provide just punishment. <em>See Evans, </em>526 F.3d at 158, 166 (approving a nearly four-fold increase from the Guidelines sentence). Further, the district court\u2019s careful consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) sentencing factors,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as well as the court\u2019s meaningful articulation of its reasons for departing from the Guidelines range, support our decision to defer to the district court\u2019s determination as to the extent of the departure. <em>Diosdado-Star, </em>630 F.3d at 366-67 (affirming substantive reasonableness of variance sentence six years greater than Guidelines range because it was based on district court\u2019s thoughtful examination of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as a whole).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-18\">. The district court noted that in the alternative it would have imposed the same 420-month sentence as a variance sentence if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>had incorrectly calculated the Guidelines range or incorrectly departed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b217-10\">. Schmidt also contends that the district court failed to properly weigh the need to provide him with appropriate mental health treatment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D). This contention is belied by the record, however, as the district court specifically ordered that, while incarcerated, Schmidt should receive any such treatment that was available.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
