(collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d) in his employment discrimination action under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621, <em>et seq. </em>First, Gortemoller argues that he made a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination under the ADEA because he presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Todd Evans, a younger individual, replaced him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, Gortemoller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>contends that he demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Defendants\u2019 articulated reason for his termination was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1023 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cA genuine issue of material fact does not exist unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a reasonable jury to return a verdict in its favor.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1023 (quoting <em>Haves v. City of Miami </em>52 F.3d 918, 921 (11th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). \u201c \u2018The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiffs position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>Earley v. Champion Int\u2019l Corp., </em>907 F.2d 1077, 1080 (11th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2512, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)). Consequently, \u201c[i]f the evidence is <em>merely colorable, </em>or is <em>not significantly probative, </em>summary judgment may be granted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 249-50, 106 S.Ct. at 2511) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">The ADEA prohibits employers from discriminating against employees who are at least 40 years old on the basis of age. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 623(a)(1), 631(a). A plaintiff must prove through direct or circumstantial evidence \u201cthat age was the \u2018but for\u2019 cause of\u2019 the discharge. <em>Mora v. Jackson Mem\u2019l Found., Inc., </em>597 F.3d 1201, 1204 (11th Cir.2010) (per curiam) (citing <em>Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2343, 2350, 174 L.Ed.2d 119 (2009)). We use the burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), \u201cto evaluate ADEA claims that are based upon circumstantial evidence of discrimination.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">\u201cUnder that framework, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He may do so by showing \u201cthat he (1) was a member of the protected age group, (2) was subjected to adverse employment action, (3) was qualified to do the job, and (4) was replaced by or otherwise lost a position to a younger individual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the plaintiff establishes his <em>prima facie </em>case, the defendant \u201cmust articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At that point, the plaintiff must proffer evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the employer\u2019s reasons are a pretext for discrimination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>Only the fourth element of Gortemoller\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case is disputed; therefore the only issue on appeal is whether he was replaced by or otherwise lost his position to a younger individual. To make this determination, we consider, among other things, Gortemoller\u2019s position and responsibilities. <em>See Hawkins v. Ceco Corp., </em>888 F.2d 977, 982-84 (11th Cir.1989) (evaluating this fourth element in the context of racial discrimination). Gortemoller\u2019s responsibilities included: (1) conducting research to determine what new product to produce, (2) creating specifications and working with designers on product, (3) selecting designs produced by Defendants\u2019 designers, (4) developing and merchandising product, (5) traveling overseas to look at product, and (6) traveling to market to sell product and evaluate the competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The record evidence demonstrates that Gortemoller was not replaced by a younger individual. When Gortemoller was fired, Defendants streamlined their product-design process by implementing a web-based computer program called Design Net, which allows salespeople to communicate directly with designers about what products are needed and allows customers to provide feedback directly to salespeople and designers. While Evans \u2014 who Defendants employed for eight years leading up to Gortemoller\u2019s termination \u2014 oversees this streamlined process, he does not perform Gortemoller\u2019s former duties; no one in particular does, as the Defendants replaced their top-down process, in which one person (Gortemoller) acted as an intermediary between salespeople, customers, and designers and made the decisions about what and how products were made, with a decentralized process, in which salespeople, customers, and designers communicate directly with one another and make decisions together, through this communication, about what and how products are made. Further, the only duty that Evans now performs that arguably resembles a duty Gortemoller used to perform\u2014 traveling overseas to look at products \u2014 is something that Evans did before and after Gortemoller was terminated; it is not a duty for which Evans became responsible after Gortemoller\u2019s was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Because the record evidence indicates that Evans did not replace Gortemoller, but that his responsibilities are now satisfied by Defendants\u2019 use of Design Net, the district court did not err in determining that Gortemoller failed to establish a <em>pri-ma facie </em>case of age discrimination. Because we affirm on that basis, we need not address Gortemoller\u2019s pretext argument. <em>See Morris v. Emory Clinic, Inc., </em>402 F.3d 1076, 1082 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (ceasing its analysis after concluding plaintiff failed to carry his burden under <em>McDonnell Douglas).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-15\">. Gortemoller argues, for the first time on appeal, that he is entitled to relief under a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>\"reduction-in-force\u201d theory. Such claims do not require the plaintiff to prove that he was replaced by a younger individual. <em>See Benson v. Tocco, Inc., </em>113 F.3d 1203, 1208 (11th Cir.1997). But because Gortemoller did not raise his reduction-in-force argument before the district court, it is waived and will not be considered. <em>See Access Now v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1329-31 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b884-11\">. As of December 1, 2010, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a) now contains the summary judgment standard. It reads, in pertinent part, \"[t]he court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Because the district court issued its order on November 29, 2010, we cite the version of the rule effective at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
