He was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. He then admitted that he was a Mexican citizen, born in Sinaloa, Mexico, and that he did not possess any documents allowing him to enter the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">The government filed an information charging Nunez-Beltran with one count of improper entry by an alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325. The day before trial, the government filed a bill of particulars, specifying that it intended to proceed on theories under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1325(a)(1) and (a)(2). At the end of the bench trial, Nunez-Beltran was convicted of violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(a)(1), and sentenced to sixty days of imprisonment. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">1. \u201cAn indictment is considered duplicitous if a single count combines two or more different offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Renteria, </em>557 F.3d 1003, 1007 (9th Cir. 2009). We aren\u2019t certain whether 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1325(a)(1) and (a)(2) set forth different offenses or different means of committing the same offense. <em>Cf. Renteria, </em>557 F.3d at 1008. That inquiry is a difficult one, <em>see United States v. Arreola, </em>467 F.3d 1153, 1157 (9th Cir.2006); <em>Schad v. Arizona, </em>501 U.S. 624, 643, 111 S.Ct. 2491, 115 L.Ed.2d 555 (1991) (plurality opinion), but one we fortunately need not undertake.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">\u201cDuplicity in an indictment ... constitute^] reversible error only if\u2019 it is prejudicial. <em>United States v. Aguilar, </em>756 F.2d 1418, 1422 (9th Cir.1985). Nunez-Beltran has not articulated any viable theory of how the alleged duplicity prejudiced him and we see none.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">At the conclusion of the bench trial, the magistrate judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-14\">[T]he Court finds that the Government has met their burden of proof ... beyond a reasonable doubt and that the defendant is guilty of the offense charged, 1325(a)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">There can therefore be no doubt that the magistrate judge found Nunez-Beltran guilty of the violation set forth in \u00a7 1325(a)(1), and that the magistrate judge did not rely on the \u00a7 1325(a)(2) theory in determining Nunez-Beltran\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-16\">Nunez-Beltran asserts that the information\u2019s alleged duplicity caused him to be convicted on the \u00a7 1325(a)(1) theory on the basis of evidence that was only admissible in support of the \u00a7 1325(a)(2) theory. We disagree. There is no reason to think that either the magistrate judge or the district judge erroneously considered inadmissible evidence. For that matter, we fail to see how any such error would have been avoided by an information that alleged violations of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1325(a)(1) and (a)(2) in separate counts, as Nunez-Beltran has not demonstrated that severance would have been appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-17\">We are not persuaded by Nunez-Bel-tran\u2019s claim that the alleged duplicity prejudiced him by providing inadequate notice of the government\u2019s theory of prosecution. Nunez-Beltran does not explain how the lack of notice caused him prejudice, and we are unable to conclude that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-18\">2. We also reject Nunez-Beltran\u2019s argument that there was insufficient evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>dence that he was an alien for the district court to convict him of violating \u00a7 1325(a)(1) beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cWhen the primary evidence of citizenship offered by the Government consists of the defendant\u2019s own admissions, those admissions require some independent corroborating evidence in order to serve as the basis for a conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>105 F.3d 1330, 1332 (9th Cir. 1997) (quotation omitted). \u201cTo satisfy the corroboration requirement, the Government must introduce independent evidence tending to establish the trustworthiness of the admissions, unless the confession is, by virtue of special circumstances, inherently reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">This corroboration requirement is easily met here. Nunez-Beltran\u2019s attempt to cross the border without documentation and without inspection, as well as his repeated admissions that he was born in Mexico, his admission that he had never been to the United States, and his admission that his parents and wife were born in Mexico and were Mexican citizens all \u201ctend[ ] to establish the trustworthiness of [his] admission[ ]\u201d of alienage. <em>Hernandez, </em>105 F.3d at 1332 (quotation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Garcia-Villegas, </em>575 F.3d 949, 951 (9th Cir.2009). These statements and actions, and the circumstances in which they were made or taken, eliminate any reasonable doubt as to the accuracy of Nunez-Beltran\u2019s admission that he was not a United States citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b663-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

Because the issue was not raised, we do not address whether attempting to enter the United States on foot through a vehicle lane at a designated port of entry constitutes an attempt to enter at a \u201ctime or place other than as designated by immigration officers.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
