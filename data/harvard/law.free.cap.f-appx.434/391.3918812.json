SunTrust states it later became the holder of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>note and deed of trust, as well as the mortgage servicer. In April 2010, the complaint alleges that Val-Com acquired the property from the Holts pursuant to a general warranty deed, subject to the note and deed of trust. After the mortgage went into default, SunTrust sought a nonjudicial foreclosure. To avoid foreclosure, Val-Com filed suit in Texas state court on its own behalf and on behalf of the Holts. SunTrust removed to federal district court. Val-Com\u2019s amended complaint alleged a variety of claims, all of which the district court dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The plaintiffs appeal only the dismissal of their Declaratory Judgment Act claims. They seek declarations as to whether SunTrust a) is the owner and/or holder of the note and deed of trust, b) is entitled to enforce the note and deed of trust, c) may administer a foreclosure of the home on behalf of the mortgagee, and d) is entitled to enforce the note and deed of trust by means of a non-judicial foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The Declaratory Judgment Act authorizes the federal courts to \u201cdeclare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such a declaration may issue only to resolve an actual controversy between the parties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An actual controversy is a dispute that is \u201cdefinite and concrete, touching the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The controversy \u201c \u2018must be such that it can presently be litigated and decided and not hypothetical, conjectural, conditional or based upon the possibility of a factual situation that may never develop.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs have the burden of establishing the existence of an actual controversy under the Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">Here, the plaintiffs have failed to carry that burden. The plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint does not allege \u2014 even on information and belief \u2014 that SunTrust is not the owner and/or holder of the note and deed of trust, that SunTrust is not the mortgage servicer, or that SunTrust lacks authority to enforce the note and deed of trust by administering a non-judicial foreclosure sale. The only related factual allegation in the complaint is that SunTrust was not the original lender on the note and deed of trust. Plaintiffs never allege that SunTrust is not the current holder and owner of the note and deed of trust. Further, the plaintiffs fail to allege any facts suggesting that the note and deed of trust are non-negotiable or that they were improperly transferred or indorsed. While there could be a dispute between the parties, absent these allegations, any such dispute is, at this point, hypothetical or conjectural. As a result, the district court was correct to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b413-25\">Pursuant to 5th Cir.
