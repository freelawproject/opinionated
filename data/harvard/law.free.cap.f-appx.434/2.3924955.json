We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-14\">On appeal, Wiggins argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint as frivolous without setting forth the factual or legal basis to support its conclusion, and in concluding that the court lacked jurisdiction. We affirm on the basis that Wiggins lacks Article III standing, with the consequence that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-16\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>accepting all material facts alleged in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. <em>See Morrison v. Nat\u2019l Austl. Bank Ltd., 547 </em>F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir.2008), aff'd,-U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2869, 177 L.Ed.2d 535 (2010). Dismissal of a case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is proper \u201cwhen the district court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it.\u201d <em>Makarova v. United States, </em>201 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir.2000). Here, the district court correctly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Wiggins\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-20\">\u201cArticle III, Section 2 of the Constitution restricts federal courts to deciding \u2018Cases\u2019 and \u2018Controversies\u2019 and thus imposes what the Supreme Court has described as the \u2018irreducible constitutional minimum of standing,\u2019 \u2014 injury-in-fact, causation, and redressability.\u201d <em>Jenkins v. United States, </em>386 F.3d 415, 417 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting <em>Baur v. Veneman, </em>352 F.3d 625, 631-32 (2d Cir.2003)). Therefore, to meet the requirements of Article III standing, \u201c[a] plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\u201d <em>Allen v. Wright, </em>468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984). The injury alleged must be \u201cconcrete in nature and particularized to [the plaintiff].\u201d <em>In re U.S. Catholic Conference, </em>885 F.2d 1020, 1023-24 (2d Cir.1989). In determining standing, the Court\u2019s focus is on \u201cthe party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction, rather than the justiciability of the issue at stake in the litigation.\u201d <em>Fulani v. Bent-</em></p>\n<p id=\"b26-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number><em>sen, </em>35 F.3d 49, 51 (2d Cir.1994). \u201c[A]n asserted right to have the Government act in accordance with law is not sufficient, standing alone, to confer jurisdiction on a federal court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Allen, </em>468 U.S. at 754, 104 S.Ct. 3315); <em>see also Lance v. Coffman, </em>549 U.S. 437, 439, 127 S.Ct. 1194, 167 L.Ed.2d 29 (2007) (per curiam) (\u201c[A] plaintiff raising only a generally available grievance about government \u2014 claiming only harm to his and every citizen\u2019s interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large \u2014 does not state an Article III case or controversy.\u201d (internal quotation mark omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">Wiggins\u2019s complaint contains no suggestion that he has suffered or is likely to suffer any concrete or particularized harm stemming from the Second Department\u2019s alleged practice of denying defendants in criminal cases a full and fair review on appeal. To the extent that Wiggins attempts to rely on the assertion of harm arising from his desire as a citizen that the government act in accordance with the Constitution, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that such assertions of generalized injury are insufficient to establish standing. <em>See, e.g., Lance, </em>549 U.S. at 439, 127 S.Ct. 1194. Moreover, while Wiggins\u2019s complaint indicates that he is in the process of investigating his criminal conviction for statutory or constitutional grounds on which it could be overturned, and that he is therefore likely to \u201cconfront\u201d the Second Department\u2019s allegedly unconstitutional practice, \u201c[a] future injury or threat of injury does not confer standing if it is \u2018conjectural or hypothetical\u2019 and not \u2018real and immediate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Amnesty Int\u2019l USA v. Clapper, </em>638 F.3d 118, 134 (2d Cir.2011) (quoting <em>O\u2019Shea v. Littleton, </em>414 U.S. 488, 494, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974)). Wiggins\u2019s asserted threat of future injury \u2014 that he might find a ground for overturning his criminal conviction, and that the Second Department then might deprive him of a full and fair review of his hypothetical claim \u2014 is attenuated and speculative, and is therefore insufficient to satisfy the standing requirements of Article III.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Because the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and was therefore precluded from making a determination on the merits of the case, <em>see Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., </em>526 U.S. 574, 583-85, 119 S.Ct. 1563, 143 L.Ed.2d 760 (1999), we need not address the district court\u2019s finding that Wiggins\u2019s claim was frivolous. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
