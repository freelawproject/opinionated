R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-22\">Matthew Hepple, a New Mexico state prisoner appearing pro se, appeals from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>the district court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of his complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">On May 23, 2011, Hepple, an inmate incarcerated at the Lea County Correctional Facility in Hobbs, New Mexico, initiated these civil proceedings by filing in the District of New Mexico a pleading entitled \u201cPETITION TO STRIKE TERMINATION OF PARENTAL RIGHTS/CUSTODY\u201d (Petition). ROA, Vol. 1 at 1. The Petition alleged that on August 10, 2007, Hepple and his wife pled no contest in the District Court of Valencia County, New Mexico, to charges of child abuse and neglect filed against them by New Mexico\u2019s Children, Youth &amp; Families Department. The Petition further alleged that in September 2008, the District Court of Valencia County, at the conclusion of a week-long hearing, terminated the parental rights of Hepple and his wife. According to the Petition, Hepple appealed to the New Mexico Court of Appeals, which, by written decision issued on May 19, 2010, affirmed the termination of parental rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After outlining several reasons why the state court termination-of-parental-rights proceedings were flawed (e.g., ineffective assistance of counsel), the Petition asked the federal district court to \u201cstrik[e] the termination of parental rights\u201d order, <em>id. </em>at 9, and \u201cto decree an order granting [Hepple\u2019s] parental rights, visitation privileges; restoring his parental discretion to whom temporary custody of his minor children are; and any further relief th[e] court m[ight] deem proper/necessary,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">The district court, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, reviewed Hepple\u2019s petition and concluded that it should \u201cbe dismissed without prejudice for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39. In support, the district court noted that, under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, <em>see Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983), it lacked jurisdiction to take the action requested by the Petition, i.e., to strike the state court decisions \u201cand replace them with its own orders regarding the custody of [Hepple\u2019s] children.\u201d ROA, Vol. 1 at 40. The district court further noted that any additional \u201creview of Hepple\u2019s state-court judgment and the underlying rulings could proceed only to the New Mexico Supreme Court and then to the United States Supreme Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41. Accordingly, the district court issued a final order on June 6, 2011, dismissing the Petition without prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">On June 20, 2011, Hepple filed a motion for reconsideration alleging, in pertinent part, that, following the New Mexico Court of Appeals\u2019 affirmance of the termination of parental rights order, he had filed an unsuccessful petition for writ of certiorari with the New Mexico Supreme Court. On July 13, 2011, the district court denied Hepple\u2019s motion for reconsideration, noting that the additional facts alleged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>Hepple\u2019s motion \u201cma[de] no difference in the Court\u2019s [jurisdictional] analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Hepple filed a timely notice of appeal. He has since filed with this court a motion for leave to proceed without prepayment of costs or fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Hepple contends on appeal that the district court erred in concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the Petition. We review the district court\u2019s decision de novo. <em>See Mann v. Boatright, </em>477 F.3d 1140, 1145 (10th Cir.2007) (holding that the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is reviewed de novo).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">After carefully examining the record on appeal and liberally construing Hepple\u2019s pleadings, we agree with the district court that the Petition was subject to dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. That doctrine, the Supreme Court has held, applies to cases brought by parties who have lost in state court \u201ccomplaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the [federal] district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 283, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). The doctrine undoubtedly applies in this case because Hepple\u2019s Petition, at bottom, sought relief from the now-final New Mexico state court order terminating his parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Hepple\u2019s motion for leave to to proceed on appeal without prepayment of costs or fees is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b793-24\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\">. Hepple attached to his Petition a copy of the New Mexico Court of Appeals' decision affirming the termination of Hepple\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b794-8\">. Section 1915A mandates, in pertinent part, screening of civil cases filed by prisoners against governmental entities and employees: \"The court shall review, before docketing, if feasible or, in any event, as soon as practicable after docketing, a complaint in a civil action in which a prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or officer or employee of a governmental entity.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
