Rios concedes that he unsuccessfully raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel based on his attorney having fallen asleep during trial in the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion that he filed in 1999. However, because his \u00a7 2255 motion was denied pri- or to the en banc decision in <em>Burdine v. Johnson, </em>262 F.3d 336 (5th Cir.2001), he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>contends that he is entitled to raise this issue again in a writ of audita querela. Rios asserts that the decision in <em>Burdine </em>requires a presumption of prejudice and that sleeping counsel is a structural error that requires automatic reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The writ of audita querela arises under the All Writs Act. <em>United States v. Banda, </em>1 F.3d 354, 355 (5th Cir.1993). \u201cThe All Writs Act is a residual source of authority to issue writs that are not otherwise covered by statute.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania Bureau of Corr. v. U.S. Marshals Serv., </em>474 U.S. 34, 43, 106 S.Ct. 355, 88 L.Ed.2d 189 (1985). The writ of audita querela was abolished in the civil context by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 60(b). <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>599 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2010). This court has \u201cacknowledged, with some reservation, that the writ of audita querela might [ ] survive in criminal adjudications, if there is a gap for it to fill.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487-88. \u201cIf it still exists, the writ of <em>audita querela </em>can only be applied to rectify a judgment which, though correct when rendered, has since become infirm.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>599 F.3d at 490. It is not available for equitable relief. <em>Id. </em>at 488. The writ of audita querela also is not available if the legal objection raised can be brought pursuant to any other postconviction remedy. <em>Id. </em>Thus, a prisoner may not seek a writ of audita querela if he \u201cmay seek redress under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Banda, </em>1 F.3d at 356. The fact that a movant cannot meet the requirements for bringing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion does not render the \u00a7 2255 remedy unavailable. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir. 2000). Because Rios may, and has, pursued relief for his ineffective assistance claim under \u00a7 2255, the writ of audita querela is not available to him. <em>See Miller, </em>599 F.3d at 488, 490; <em>Banda, </em>1 F.3d at 356. Even if the writ was available, Rios has not shown that the decision in <em>Burdine </em>subsequently rendered the judgment against him infirm. <em>See Burdine, </em>262 F.3d at 348-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Rios also argues that he is barred by the gate keeping provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act from filing another \u00a7 2255 motion and that the constitutionality of those provisions will be called into question if he may not proceed by writ of audita querela. Because Rios did not properly raise this issue before the district court, having mentioned it only in his notice of appeal, we do not address this issue for the first time on appeal. <em>See Wiley v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>585 F.3d 206, 212-14 &amp; n. 21 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
