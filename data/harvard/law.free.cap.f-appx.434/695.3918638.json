We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The district court correctly began with the lodestar method of calculating attorneys\u2019 fees and then permissibly used the percentage of common fund crosscheck to arrive at a reasonable fee award under California law. <em>In re Consumer Privacy Cases, </em>175 Cal.App.4th 545, 96 Cal.Rptr.3d 127, 136-37 (Ct.App.2009).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">The district court\u2019s finding that the settlement was worth nothing to class was not illogical, implausible, or unsupported by the record. <em>See United States v. Hinkson, </em>585 F.3d 1247, 1261-62 (9th Cir.2009) (en banc). The agreed-upon disclaimers gave no value to class members, who had already purchased the hard drives.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">The district court did not err by including costs and attorneys\u2019 fees in one award. Suzuki cites no cases requiring a district court to differentiate between attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Further, Suzuki agreed to a settlement that did not differentiate between attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. <em>\u2018\u201cIf an agreement is reached on the amount of a settlement fund and a separate amount for attorney fees and expenses, </em>both amounts must be disclosed to the class. Moreover, the sum of the two amounts ordinarily should be treated as a settlement fund for the benefit of the class, with the agreed-on fee amount constituting the upper limit on the fees that can be awarded to counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Consumer Privacy Cases, </em>96 Cal.Rptr.3d at 133 (quoting the Manual for Complex Litigation (4th ed.2008) \u00a7 21.71, p. 525).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in applying the percent of common fund cross-check, the panel does not reach Appellant\u2019s challenge of the use of .69 multiplier in the revised lodestar, as the district court did not ultimately rely on the lodestar number.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b718-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-21\">. California state law governs the question of attorneys\u2019 fees, because the underlying causes of action are based on state law. <em>Vizcaino v. Microsoft Corp., </em>290 F.3d 1043, 1047 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
