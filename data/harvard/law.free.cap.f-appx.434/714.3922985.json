We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006). We deny in part and grant in part the petition for review as to Acevedo-Gudiel, and we remand his claims to the BIA for further proceedings. By separate order, we open a new petition for review as to Acevedo-Perez and transfer his claims to that separate petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-25\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Acevedo-Gudiel did not suffer past persecution based on his mistreatment, including threats, by gang members. <em>See Lim v. Immigration and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number><em>Naturalization Service, </em>224 F.3d 929, 936-37 (9th Cir.2000). As Acevedo-Gudiel has not established past persecution, he is not entitled to a presumption of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1); <em>Mo-lina-Estrada v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1096 (9th Cir.2002). With respect to future persecution, the agency did not consider Acevedo-Gudiel\u2019s claim based on his imputed political opinion. <em>See Sagaydak v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 1035, 1040 (9th Cir.2005) (agency may not ignore arguments raised by a petitioner). Accordingly, we deny in part and grant in part the petition for review as to Acevedo-Gudiel, A097-340345, and remand his asylum and withholding of removal claims for further proceedings. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">By separate order filed concurrently with this disposition, we have opened a new petition for review as to Herminio Antonio Acevedo-Perez, A070-076-043, and transferred his claims to that petition: No. 11-71496.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">.The docket is closed as to No. 08-74861.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Each party shall bear its own costs for this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b736-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
