In July 1988, the Machnicks filed a preliminary subdivision plan. They proposed a \u201cconventional\u201d rather than \u201ccluster\u201d subdivision of their 116.2-acre parcel (subject property) into seven lots. The subject property is located in the Rural Agricultural (RA) zoning district.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">Section 15-200 of the Ordinance defines \u201cconventional\u201d subdivision as the subdivision of a lot in accordance with specified lot size <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>requirements and regulations. That Section also defines \u201ccluster\u201d subdivision as \u201c[a]n alternative means of subdividing a lot premised on the concept of reducing lot size requirements for the provision of open space in conjunction with the development.\u201d In defense of their proposed plan, the Machnicks\u2019s counsel represented to the Planning Commission (Commission) that they had evaluated clustering the lots but decided that \u201cthe layout of the land renders towards conventional lots.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The final subdivision plan was filed in December 1988. In response to an issue raised by the Commission, the Machnicks agreed to reduce the total number of lots from seven to six. The Commission recommended that the Board approve the final plan with six lots. However, the Board denied the plan, finding that it did not provide 85% open space as required by the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Section 2-406(5) is located in the \u201cGeneral Regulations\u201d portion of the Ordinance which is applicable to all zoning districts. It provides that: \u201cIn the RC [Rural Conservation] &amp; RA zoning districts the Board shall require 85 % open space in order to accomplish the purposes in 5-102.3, .4 and .5 unless the Board makes a finding that a lesser amount would accomplish the purposes of the above sections.\u201d The standards set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 5-102.3, .4, and .5 address such concerns as the protection of natural resources and features, scenic resources and qualities, and compatibility with existing uses in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">In moving that the Machnicks\u2019s plan be denied, Supervisor Herbert specifically cited \u00a7 2-406(5), as well as the fact that the subject property is bordered on three sides by an active farm. In response, the Machnicks stated to the Board that clustering (which was necessary to meet the 85% open space provision) was not desirable because only one spot on the property could accommodate the clustered homes. The Board voted unanimously to deny the Machnicks\u2019s plan. The official Board minutes reflect that the plan was denied \u201cbecause it did not meet the 85% open space requirement of the Ordinance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The Machnicks filed an amended bill of complaint in the trial court seeking injunctive relief, declaratory judgment, and compensatory damages. They contended that because their subdivision plan was for \u201cResidential Development, Minor,\u201d rather than \u201cResidential Development, Major,\u201d as defined in the Ordinance, their conventional subdivision was a permitted use in the RA district and not subject to the provisions of \u00a7 2-406(5). \u201cResidential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Development, Major\u201d plans are allowed in RA districts only by special exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">The Machnicks also argued to the trial court that pursuant to \u00a7 2-406(2), only the Planning Commission, and not the Board of Supervisors, may require the developers of a proposed conventional subdivision to cluster their lots. Section 2-406(2) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">In a proposed residential subdivision, a cluster subdivision may be required upon the determination by the Commission that cluster development will promote the public interest by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">A. Conserving scenic and/or natural, and/or historic resources, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">B. Assisting in mitigating agriculture/residential interface problems, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">C. Assisting in maintaining the existing general character of the area and/or preserving land values.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">In its letter opinion, the trial court ordered the Board to execute a Certificate of Approval for the Machnicks\u2019s plan. The trial court held that the Board, by its zoning ordinance, had delegated to the Commission the authority to require clustering. It cited \u00a7 2-406(2) in support of its holding. The trial court further found that since the title to \u00a7 2-406 was \u201cCluster Subdivision:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-10\">[the] open space requirement thereunder, as well as other provisions contained in its subsections, relate to \u2018Cluster Subdivision.\u2019 The Court finds no such requirement in that Ordinance for a \u2018minor\u2019 and \u2018conventional\u2019 subdivision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Based on these findings, the trial court concluded that the Board had applied erroneous principles of law in denying the Machnicks\u2019s final subdivision plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">The trial court did not address \u00a7 3-408 in its letter opinion or final order. Section 3-408 sets forth minimum open space requirements for all zoning districts. Footnote 8 of that section contains the following reference provision: \u201cFor cluster requirements in all Residential and Rural Zoning Districts, see \u00a7 2-406.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">The Board argues that the trial court erred: (1) in failing to interpret \u00a7 2-406(5) and \u00a7 3-408 as requiring the application of open space requirements to all RC and RA district plans, regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>less of whether the plans submitted propose \u201cmajor conventional,\u201d \u201cminor conventional\u201d or \u201ccluster\u201d subdivision; and (2) in interpreting \u00a7 2-406(2) as limiting the authority to require clustering to the Planning Commission, not the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The Board contends that since the subject property is in a RA district, pursuant to \u00a7 2-406(5), 85% open space is required unless the Board makes a finding that a lesser amount would accomplish the purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 5-102.3, .4 and .5. In response, the Machnicks contend that the clustering regulations in \u00a7 2-406 are not applicable to a given plan unless an applicant voluntarily chooses to cluster, or unless the Commission requires clustering under \u00a7 2-406(2). They argue that the title to \u00a7 2-406, \u201cCluster Subdivision\u201d, evinces a clear legislative intent that it not be applied to all subdivisions. We disagree with the Machnicks.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The plain language of \u00a7 2-406(5) mandates an 85% open space requirement in RA districts unless the Board makes certain findings that this is not necessary. No such findings were made in the case before us. Where the language in an ordinance or statute is plain and unambiguous, it must be given that plain meaning or intent. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">In reaching this conclusion, we do not dispute the Machnicks\u2019s contention that the title to \u00a7 2-406, \u201cCluster Subdivision,\u201d must be given due consideration in determining whether the provisions contained therein apply to their subdivision plan. <em>See Jordan </em>v. <em>Town of South Boston, </em>138 Va. 838, 845, 122 S.E. 265, 267 (1924). However, we find that consideration of the title \u201cCluster Subdivision\u201d does not lead us to conclude that \u00a7 2-406 is not applicable to all residential subdivisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">The Machnicks themselves concede that \u00a7 2-406(2) applies to all residential subdivisions, whether conventional or cluster. Since that section, as well as \u00a7 2-406(5), come under the general title of \u00a7 2-406, \u201cCluster Subdivision,\u201d we find no merit in their argument that \u00a7 2-406(5) is restricted in scope to exclude \u201cminor\u201d conventional subdivisions, while \u00a7 2-406(2) is not. Further, nothing in the plain language of \u00a7 2-406(5) indicates that it is to be restricted in such a manner. Thus, we conclude that the title \u201cCluster Subdivision\u201d details clustering requirements applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>to all requests for residential subdivision including both \u201cmajor\u201d and \u201cminor\u201d conventional development plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">The fact that \u00a7 2-406(5) incorporates by reference some, but not all, of the standards of \u00a7 5-102, does not alter our conclusion that the language of \u00a7 2-406(5) is plain and unambiguous. Section 2-406(5), unlike \u00a7 5-102, contains no language limiting its applicability to major residential developments. Further, nothing in the content of the standards incorporated from \u00a7 5-102 suggests that they would be inapplicable to minor conventional subdivisions. Thus, we conclude that the incorporation of some of the standards of \u00a7 5-102 into \u00a7 2-406(5) does not restrict the application of \u00a7 2-406(5) to \u201cmajor\u201d residential developments only.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">We further find that \u00a7 3-408 does not compel a different result. Footnote 8 specifically references \u00a7 2-406 for determination of cluster requirements in all zoning districts. Footnote 9 lists an open space requirement applicable to \u201cmajor\u201d subdivisions in RA districts. A \u201cGeneral Note\u201d appearing after those footnotes provides that: \u201cA hyphen as an entry in the chart above indicates that either that item is not applicable or that particular item is not regulated in that case.\u201d A hyphen appears under footnotes 8 and 9 in \u00a7 3-408. We cannot, as urged by the Machnicks, interpret the hyphen under footnote 9 as meaning there are no other minimum open space requirements in RA districts. To do so would directly contradict footnote 8 which refers to \u00a7 2-406 for cluster requirements in <em>all </em>districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">We also disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that under the Ordinance, the Commission has authority to require clustering in \u201cminor\u201d subdivisions, but that the Board does not. Such a position distorts the role of the Commission. First, under the Ordinance, the Commission has no authority to <em>require </em>any applicant to cluster. Section 2-406(2) provides that: \u201cIn a proposed residential subdivision, a cluster subdivision may be required upon the determination by the Commission that cluster development will promote the public interest . . . .\u201d We read this provision to mean that clustering may be required <em>by the Board </em>if the Commission makes certain findings in its recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The role of the Commission is to make recommendations to the Board. Section 10-7 of the Fauquier County Subdivision Ordinance specifically provides that: \u201cThe Commission shall con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>sider final plats and <em>make recommendations </em>to the governing body.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Commission does not have authority to require the Board, which is the governing body, to approve any subdivision plan. Rather, it makes recommendations to the Board which the Board may accept or reject within its legislative authority. As set forth in \u00a7 10-7, \u201c[t]he governing body retains unto itself the authority of final approval of final plats which authority it may delegate to its agent.\u201d There is no evidence in the record before us that the Board delegated its final approval authority to the Commission. Therefore, we conclude that while the Board may require clustering under \u00a7 2-406(2) if the Commission makes certain findings in its recommendations, under \u00a7 2-406(5) the Board must require an 85% open space requirement in RA districts. Had the Board intended that \u00a7 2-406(5) apply only to \u201cmajor\u201d subdivisions which require special exception approval, it could have so stated either in that section or in Article 5 which contains provisions for special exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">For the reasons stated, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and will enter final judgment dismissing the amended bill of complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-15\"> We construe the Ordinance as it existed on February 21, 1989, the date of the Board\u2019s denial of the subdivision plan at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b486-6\"><em> </em>Since we reverse the judgment of the trial court, we do not reach the Machnicks\u2019s assignment of cross-error regarding whether a notice of claim must be filed pursuant to Code \u00a7 15.1-550 <em>et seq., </em>prior to bringing an action for damages against a local governing body in the circuit court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
