PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Upon his motion, the Commonwealth and the court concurring, Saunders was tried by the court without a jury upon indictments charging capital murder, robbery, and use of a firearm in the commission of capital murder. Invoking the grounds defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-31(4), the capital murder indictment charged that the murder was accomplished \u201cin the commission of robbery, while armed with a deadly weapon\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">At the first stage of a bifurcated trial conducted pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(A), Saunders was found guilty as charged in the indictments. The court sentenced him to life imprisonment for robbery and to two years\u2019 imprisonment for the firearm offense. At the penalty phase of the capital murder trial, the court heard evidence in aggravation and mitigation and considered the probation report as required by Code \u00a7 19.2-264.5. Resting its decision upon the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicate, Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C), the court sentenced Saunders to death for capital murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">We have consolidated Saunders\u2019 appeal of the capital murder conviction with the automatic review of his death sentence accorded him by statute, Code \u00a7 17-110.1(A) and (F), and have given them priority on our docket as required by Code \u00a7 17-110.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">II. FACTS IN EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">Under familiar principles, we view the evidence and the reasonable inferences it raises in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. On the afternoon of July 17, 1989, Dale Guill withdrew five one-hundred dollar bills and five twenty dollar bills from his bank account and drove to an apartment occupied by Lacy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Johnson and Katrina Wilson<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. At Guill\u2019s request, Lacy accompanied him on a ride through the neighborhood in search of a cocaine dealer. While Guill and Lacy were searching for cocaine, defendant Saunders and Levi Poole arrived at the apartment. As on previous visits, Saunders was carrying a leather pouch containing a pistol described of record as a .22 caliber \u201cF. I. E. revolver\u201d with a long, gold-colored barrel.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Lacy had taken the apartment keys, and Katrina, accompanied by Saunders and Poole, walked to a nearby market to get some beer. As they were leaving, Lacy and Guill arrived in Guill\u2019s car. They reported that their search had been unsuccessful. Out of Guill\u2019s hearing, Saunders exclaimed to Lacy, \u201cI should rob this white [expletive deleted], but you know him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">With Guill in the driver\u2019s seat, Lacy beside him, Saunders in the back seat behind Guill, and Katrina in the back seat behind Lacy, the party resumed the search for narcotics. Guill parked the car near a car wash on Memorial Drive and waited for a drug dealer to appear. Katrina decided to leave the group, got the apartment keys from Lacy, and began the walk back to their apartment. At this point, Guill was showing Lacy a warrant he had received charging nonsupport of a child. Lacy testified that he heard a \u201cbang\u201d, that Guill \u201clunged forward like he was heavy hit in the back and I looked back ... it was a gold gun stuck in my face and Saunders tell me, \u2018Don\u2019t say nothing.\u2019 \u201d Lacy asked him why he had shot Guill, and Saunders replied, \u201cHe\u2019s white.\u201d Continuing, Lacy testified that Saunders put the gun in its leather pouch, got out of the car, opened the driver\u2019s door and, \u201cleaning over in the car\u201d, spoke to the lifeless body before him, \u201cMove [expletive deleted], get the hell off me\u201d. Lacy watched as Saunders \u201c[w]ent to searching Dale\u2019s pockets\u201d, \u201csnatched his chain off\u201d his neck, raised his arm and \u201ctook his ring off his hand.\u201d As Saunders continued \u201ccussing [Guill] out\u201d, Lacy stated, Saunders \u201cbrushed\u201d away the hair, \u201clooked at the wound on his head\u201d, and then \u201ccovered it back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Saunders started to leave \u201cand then he stopped and came back and snatched [Guill\u2019s] shirt off\u2019, \u201c[s]tuffed it in the gas tank\u201d, and was \u201ctrying to light it with some matches.\u201d Running from the scene of the crime, Saunders and Lacy overtook Katrina on her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>way home. \u201cI heard a noise,\u201d Katrina said, \u201cIt sound like a shot.\u201d Saunders replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I just killed that man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Saunders offered Guill\u2019s wallet to Lacy. When Lacy refused, Saunders removed the contents, discarded the documents in a sewer, and threw the wallet in bushes along High Street. Lacy testified that \u201c[t]hen he started counting, \u2018Hundreds, hundreds, hundreds\u2019 \u201d, inspecting the money taken from Guill\u2019s \u201cwallet or his pockets, or wherever he got it.\u201d In her testimony, Katrina described the same event, quoting the same language. When they reached the Johnson apartment, Saunders \u201cwent upstairs and washed his hands\u201d in order \u201c [t]o get the blood off of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In a conversation with Saunders the next day, Katrina told Saunders that she and Lacy were so upset they \u201ccouldn\u2019t sleep\u201d. Katrina testified that Saunders replied, \u201c \u2018Don\u2019t let that bother ya\u2019ll. I slept like a baby. Every time I think about it, I smell gunpowder.\u2019 \u201d Lacy confirmed that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">On July 19, 1989, Lacy reported the homicide to the police and assisted them in the recovery of Guill\u2019s wallet and the cards it contained. Saunders was arrested and imprisoned awaiting indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Bernard Smith, a convicted felon confined to the same prison, testified that Saunders told him that he had \u201c[s]hot [Guill] in the back of the head\u201d with a \u201c.22\u201d caliber gun \u201cdown by the car wash on Memorial Drive.\u201d Asked what Saunders had \u201csaid about the shooting\u201d, Smith replied, \u201cHe just said he wouldn\u2019t give him the money so he shot him and then he . . . after he shot him, he got his jewelry and his money, and left.\u201d Smith added that Saunders had told him that \u201cLacy snitched on him . . . and that he wanted somebody to knock Lacy off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The forensic pathologist who performed an autopsy on Guill\u2019s body testified that Guill had suffered \u201calmost an instantaneous death\u201d resulting from \u201ca contact gunshot wound to the back of the head\u201d with the bullet passing through \u201cthe most vital area of the brain which we call the brain stem\u201d. The bullet, removed from \u201cone of the sinuses in the front of the face . . . above the right eye\u201d, was identified by the firearms expert as \u201ca .22 caliber coated lead bullet\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">Having made an unsuccessful motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, the defense called Betty Brandon as a witness. Brandon testified that, during a party held in her apartment the night of the murder, Lacy had told her that he, in company with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Saunders and Poole, \u201chad followed this dude and they robbed him\u201d and that he, Lacy, \u201cwas the one that got the money\u201d. On cross-examination, Brandon said that Lacy had been \u201cdoing drugs\u201d during their conversation, and she acknowledged that she and Saunders \u201cgrew up together\u201d and that she was \u201ca friend of the defendant\u201d. Anthony Martin, a friend of Saunders\u2019 brother, testified that Lacy told him that he had \u201cspent the dead man\u2019s money\u201d but that he had not shot the man.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The defense introduced two other witnesses in the guilt phase. Saunders\u2019 mother testified that she had never seen her son with a gun. Sandra Mease testified that she had \u201cdated\u201d both Saunders and Guill, but not both during the same period of time. Mease said she knew nothing about the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">In rebuttal, the Commonwealth recalled Lacy who expressly denied engaging in the conversation Martin described. Concerning Brandon\u2019s testimony, Lacy said that Brandon was a drug addict, that he had not attended the party in her apartment, that he had not made the statement attributed to him, and that Saunders had never given him any of the money taken from Guill.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Upon consideration of the evidence and argument by counsel, the trial court convicted Saunders of the crimes charged in the indictment, ordered a pre-sentence report, and continued the case to hear further evidence in the penalty phase. We will detail later further facts relevant to particular issues addressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">III. THE GUILT PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">On appeal, Saunders contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of capital murder in the commission of robbery. First, we review the proof of criminal agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">Lacy Johnson, an eyewitness to the crime, testified that Saunders shot Guill in the head with a .22 caliber revolver, a weapon he and Katrina Wilson had seen him carrying on prior occasions. Moments after the shooting, Saunders told Katrina that he had \u201cjust killed that man\u201d and began counting the hundred-dollar bills his victim had withdrawn from his bank account earlier that day. Later, at the Johnson apartment, Saunders washed blood off his hands. Awaiting trial in jail, Saunders told Bernard Smith, a fellow inmate, that he had shot Guill in the back of the head with a .22 caliber gun. The firearms experts identified the bullet removed from Guill\u2019s face as \u201ca .22 caliber coated lead bullet\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>On brief, Saunders charges that \u201cthe court did not give adequate weight to the prior criminal records of Lacy Johnson or Bernard Smith\u201d and \u201cdid not place adequate emphasis on the marriage of Lacy Johnson and Katrina Wilson very shortly after the crime.\u201d For those reasons, he suggests, the testimony of those witnesses was unworthy of belief. But the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be accorded their testimony are questions for the fact finder, and \u201c[w]hen the sufficiency of the evidence is attacked, the judgment of the trial court sitting without a jury is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict\u201d. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 609, 613, 212 S.E.2d 268, 271 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">We think the evidence that Saunders was the criminal agent was overwhelming. Even so, Saunders challenges the sufficiency of the evidence that robbery was the motive for the killing. The defendant says that \u201cnone of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses advanced money as a motive\u201d and that \u201c[rjobbery was an afterthought in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">We disagree; the defendant overlooks uncontradicted testimony. Preceding the killing, Saunders made the statement that he \u201cshould rob\u201d Guill. In prison following his arrest, Saunders acknowledged that the reason he had shot Guill was that \u201che wouldn\u2019t give him the money\u201d. Consequently, we hold that \u201cthe evidence supports the conclusion that the killing and the theft were interdependent objects of a common criminal design.\u201d <em>Edmonds </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 229 </em>Va. 303, 310, 329 S.E.2d 807, 813, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 975 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">IV. THE PENALTY PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The trial court based its penalty decision upon the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicate, <em>i.e., </em>a finding of \u201ca probability . . . that [the defendant] would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society\u201d. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C). Saunders challenges the foundation of that finding and asks us to \u201creduce the sentence to one of imprisonment for life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">A. <em>Evidentiary Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"AFg\">(1) Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Saunders complains that, in making its finding, \u201cthe court swept away the testimony of two expert psychiatrists\u201d. Saunders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>says that Dr. Paul Mansheim, a defense witness, \u201ccould express no opinion on future dangerousness\u201d. However, in reply to a question summarizing the details of the commission of the crime and the defendant\u2019s comments and conduct following the murder, the witness agreed that \u201cit\u2019s not ... a good sign, when somebody is able to do something like that, under those circumstances.\u201d \u201cI guess it demonstrates that he was dangerous, once,\u201d Dr. Mansheim added, but \u201cI don\u2019t think it necessarily demonstrates that the person is going to do it again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">The other expert opinion to which Saunders refers was contained in a pre-trial letter written by Dr. Arthur Centor, a forensic clinical psychologist. Dr. Centor, called as an expert witness by the Commonwealth, had conducted an interview with the accused in August preceding the November trial. Based upon that interview and investigative reports furnished to him at that time, Dr. Centor wrote a letter to defense counsel in which he concluded that Saunders \u201cdoes not show a high probability of future dangerousness\u201d. However, in the penalty phase following Saunders\u2019 conviction, Dr. Centor testified that \u201c[i]f the trier of facts finds credibility in . . . statements [by the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses], there was a danger that [Saunders] would commit further criminal acts of violence, that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In <em>Edmonds </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra, </em>where we reviewed similar conflicts in the testimony of expert witnesses called by the defense and the Commonwealth, we affirmed a judgment imposing the death penalty. We did the same in <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 114, 128, 360 S.E. 352, 361 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 1015 (1988), where a psychiatrist opined that the defendant could \u201cfunction adequately in a structured environment.\u201d Only recently, in <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 192, 402 S.E.2d 196 (1991), we reaffirmed our earlier opinion upholding a death sentence, notwithstanding an expert\u2019s testimony that \u201cStockton would not \u2018pose a future continuing serious threat of violence to either himself or to others\u2019 if he \u2018continues to be incarcerated in the Virginia correctional system.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212 n.8, 402 S.E.2d at 208 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">While, as we held in <em>Edmonds, 229 </em>Va. at 311, 329 S.E.2d at 813, citing <em>Barefoot </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 891 (1983), expert opinion on the question of future dangerousness is competent evidence, we reject the proposition implicit in Saunders\u2019 complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>that the fact finder is not free to disregard such testimony. The question is a factual issue. It is peculiarly the function of the fact finder to determine what weight, if any, should be accorded expert opinion on that issue, whatever that opinion might be.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">(2) Unadjudicated Crimes</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The defendant assigns error to the \u201c[ajdmission of evidence of unadjudicated crimes.\u201d He contends that this was a violation of his \u201cright to due process\u201d because, he says, \u201cit permits a sentence of death to be imposed based on unreliable evidence\u201d. The defendant has reference to the testimony of three witnesses at the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Bernard Smith, a fellow inmate, testified that he had seen Saunders break a store window with a crowbar and steal a number of items including \u201ca long barrel, .22\u201d with \u201cgold on it.\u201d Smith also testified that Saunders had \u201csaid something about him and Cody went to D.C. and killed some man up there, over some drugs and money\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Katrina testified that Saunders had told her that he \u201chad killed a man in D.C., and took his reefer\u201d on \u201c[tjhe weekend before\u201d the Guill killing. Lacy testified that he had heard Saunders describe the murder victim in the District of Columbia as \u201c[sjome drug dealer that he knocked off . . . took his drugs and money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">We need not review the long line of precedents in which we have upheld the admission of such evidence,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because in its ruling on the penalty question, the trial court expressly stated that it was \u201cnot basing any of its findings upon any unadjudicated crimes, which have been admitted into evidence .... [Tjhe Court has excluded that testimony from any findings which it here makes.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>The transcript of the penalty proceeding shows that in determining future dangerousness, the court relied exclusively upon evidence of circumstances surrounding the offense, Saunders\u2019 lack of remorse, his record of criminal convictions, and his conduct while awaiting sentencing. Consequently, we find no merit in Saunders\u2019 assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">B. <em>Propriety of Penalty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Pursuing his argument that the trial court erred in finding future dangerousness, Saunders contends that the sentence imposed was the product of passion and prejudice and that the penalty was excessive and disproportionate to that imposed in similar cases. In our consideration of those arguments, we will conduct an independent review of the record as required by Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(1) and (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">(1) Circumstances Surrounding the Crime</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The evidence to be considered in determining whether the defendant constitutes a future danger to society \u201cmay include the circumstances surrounding the offense\u201d. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(B). Saunders concedes, as he must, that the trial court \u201caccepted the Commonwealth\u2019s version of the facts concerning Guill\u2019s death\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The uncontroverted facts of record identify this killing as a dispassionate, unprovoked execution of an unsuspecting victim, followed by a threat to use the murder weapon again if necessary to silence an eyewitness to the crime. <em>Cf. Delong </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 357, 371, 362 S.E.2d 669, 677 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 929 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">Circumstances following commission of the offense are also relevant. Minutes after his attempt to incinerate his victim, Saunders told Katrina and Lacy that he had \u201ckilled that man\u201d but not to \u201cworry about it.\u201d Saunders was surprised to learn that they were too troubled to sleep when he had \u201cslept like a baby.\u201d The recollection of what he had done only caused him to \u201csmell gunpowder.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-10\">Testimony that a defendant who committed murder . . . and then expressed no regret or remorse for the act he committed, is obviously proper testimony for a jury to consider in determining whether such person would in all probability commit criminal acts of violence in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number><em>Clark </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 201, 210, 257 S.E.2d 784, 790 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1049 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">(2) Criminal Record</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The fact finder is expressly enjoined to consider \u201cthe past criminal record of convictions of the defendant\u201d. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.2. Thus, the legislature recognizes the danger that a repeat offender will repeat again.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">As the trial court observed, Saunders\u2019 \u201cpast criminal record evidences a continuous path of criminal activity, which has not been deterred by probation, supervision or incarceration.\u201d That record shows that Saunders\u2019 history of criminal conduct began at the age of eleven. \u201cMalicious Damage at Grove Park School\u201d was the first of twelve charges referred to a juvenile court. Later, Saunders was convicted of eight felonies, including assault and battery of a police officer, and twelve misdemeanors. In the five years preceding the Guill murder, Saunders had been placed on probation on four separate occasions. Within a week after his third probation, he had been charged with new offenses. Following his fourth probation, he failed to report as required to his probation officer. After revoking suspensions of two five-year sentences previously imposed, the court suspended the revocation, imposed a jail sentence, and returned Saunders to probation for a period of one year. Before the end of that year, Saunders had been arrested and convicted of four additional offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">(3) Prior History</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">In addition to evidence of the circumstances surrounding the offense and the defendant\u2019s criminal record, the statute authorizes consideration of \u201cevidence of the prior history of the defendant\u201d. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(C). That includes, of course, evidence of Saunders\u2019 most recent history. In his challenge to the propriety of the penalty, Saunders complains that the trial court \u201crendered a death verdict based largely on the feelings inspired by Mr. Saunders\u2019 post-trial conduct at the Danville City Jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">The conduct to which the defendant refers occurred while he was incarcerated awaiting the sentencing hearing. At that hearing, the Commonwealth introduced the testimony of several police officers and a number of inmates of the city jail. In mutually consistent testimony, the witnesses described six incidents:</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>(1) Looking for a missing spoon, an officer conducted a search of Saunders\u2019 cell. Using profane language, Saunders challenged the officer\u2019s right to search, lit a match, and threw it on a bed-sheet. The officer \u201cstomped\u201d the sheet to extinguish the fire and completed the search. As he was leaving, however, he noticed on the catwalk outside the cell another sheet afire. After the officer had extinguished the blaze, Saunders confessed and declared, \u201cWhen ya\u2019ll leave, I\u2019m gonna burn the whole damn jail down.\u201d Because he was \u201ctired of jail rules\u201d, Saunders \u201ctook his jail regulation book . . . tore it in half, and threw it out in . . . the common area\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">(2) On April 28, 1990, a fellow inmate accused Saunders of stealing an article from his cell. Saunders struck him in the face with his fist and \u201cjust kept on hitting\u201d until three other inmates joined in the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">(3) During a routine search for contraband conducted the same day, officers found a razor concealed in the commode in Saunders\u2019 cell and retrieved from his sink a television antenna that had been \u201cinserted completely hidden from sight, inside the drainport\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">(4) On April 29, Saunders intervened on behalf of the aggressor in a fight between two inmates. Saunders beat the victim with a mop handle. The injuries inflicted by the assailants required a hospital examination. The victim testified that his rings were removed from his fingers and that Saunders told him that \u201che would kill [him] if [he] said anything to the guards\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">(5) On April 30, following the two fights in which Saunders had participated, the officers asked him to accompany them to an isolation cell. Refusing to leave, Saunders said, \u201cYou might as well go ahead and get your riot gear, and come on.\u201d When taken to the isolation cell, he threatened to tear out the fluorescent light fixture in the ceiling. Climbing on the bunk, the commode, and the sink, Saunders tried to reach the fixture. The officers restrained him, locked him in the cell, and left. Another officer, observing the cell on a television monitor, saw Saunders climb back on the sink and remove the plastic cover and one of the bulbs from the light fixture. He refused to surrender the bulb and broke it against the bars. Later, he removed another bulb and did the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Using his foot, Saunders shattered the plastic cover. He picked up one piece \u201ceight or ten inches\u201d in length and \u201cput it in his sock.\u201d Then, he broke off an arm\u2019s length of the plastic cover \u201ctwo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>to three inches\u201d wide and \u201cpointed\u201d like \u201ca spear\u201d on one end. Carrying it in one hand, Saunders \u201cpaced around the cell with it . . . and then . . . pulled the rest of the lights down\u201d. The officers \u201ccouldn\u2019t get in there to feed him ... he was standing up at the front of the cell, with this weapon, and they were scared\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Saunders\u2019 probation officer tried to persuade him to surrender the weapons he had made so that the officer would have \u201ca chance to say something positive\u201d about him at the sentencing hearing. Saunders first refused. \u201cI wanna hurt someone else,\u201d he said. Naming three of the officers responsible for placing him in the isolation cell, he said that he wanted them \u201cto come back here, because I wanna stab \u2018em in the throat with this\u201d. Finally agreeing to surrender the weapons, he told the probation officer, \u201cThe only reason I gave it up is because I won\u2019t gonna get a chance to get the ones I wanted to get\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">(6) On May 2, Saunders set another fire in his cell. The sentencing hearing was held the next day as scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Saunders contends that the trial court was unduly influenced by the testimony of what he characterizes as \u201cthe parade of witnesses\u201d from the jail, because, he says, they were \u201cpeople known by the court\u201d. We think that this evidence was uniquely probative of future dangerousness. At a time when self-interest would prompt model behavior, Saunders acquired and secreted a razor and television antenna, fashioned two other potentially lethal weapons, expressed a desire to use those weapons against guards at the jail, and repeatedly assaulted, or attempted to assault, other inmates and correctional officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">We hold that the evidence fully justifies the trial judge\u2019s finding of future dangerousness, and in our review of the record, we have discovered nothing whatever to support the argument that his decision to impose the death penalty was tainted by passion or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">(4) Disproportionality Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-110.1(E), we have accumulated, segregated, and indexed the records of all capital murder appeals reviewed by this Court, including those in which a life sentence was imposed. In making our determination whether a sentence of death in a particular case \u201cis excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases\u201d, Code \u00a7 17-110.1(C)(2), we give special attention to those in which that penalty was, as here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>based solely upon the \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d predicate. Those cases are collected and cited in our recent opinion in <em>Quesinberry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 364, 381-82, 402 S.E.2d 218, 229 (1991). Having compared the records in those cases with the record in this appeal, we are satisfied that \u201cjuries in this jurisdiction generally approve the supreme penalty for comparable or similar crimes.\u201d <em>Stamper </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 284, 257 S.E.2d 808, 824 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 972 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Finding no error in the conduct of either phase of the defendant\u2019s trial and no cause to commute the death sentence to life imprisonment, Code \u00a7\u00a7 17-110.1, we will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\"> Lacy and Katrina, engaged in March, were married in August, 1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b143-9\"> <em>See, e.g., Stockton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 192, 209-10, 402 S.E.2d 196, 206 (1991); <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 295, 317, 384 S.E.2d 785, 798-99 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 1093, 110 S.Ct. 1171 (1990); <em>O\u2019Dell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 672, 700, 364 S.E.2d 491, 507, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 871 (1988); <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 313, 346-47, 356 S.E.2d 157, 175-76, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 873 (1987); <em>Beaver </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 521, 529, 352 S.E.2d 342, 347, <em>cert. denied, </em>483 U.S. 1033 (1987); <em>Pruett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 266, 285, 351 S.E.2d 1, 12 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>482 U.S. 931 (1987); <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 469, 488, 331 S.E.2d 422, 436 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1099 (1986); <em>Poyner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 401, 418, 329 S.E.2d 815, 827-28, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 865 (1985); <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 289, 298, 302 S.E.2d 520, 526, <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 865 (1983); <em>Quintana </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 127, 147-48, 295 S.E.2d 643, 653 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1029 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
