Pittard, a resident of Clarksville, Mecklenburg County, died in February 1989, leaving a will drawn by an attorney dated in September 1987. Item I of the will provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-11\">\u201cI desire my just debts and all expenses of the administration of my estate, including such taxes as may be levied against my estate, paid as soon after my death as practicable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>In the will, the testator made 38 cash bequests, a gift of mineral rights, two devises of real estate (one with a bequest of tangible personal property), and two equal residuary bequests \u2014 one to a group of nine tax-exempt organizations and the other to a group of relatives (a nephew, a niece-in-law, and two greatnephews).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\">The will was duly probated and appellees \u2022 Central Fidelity Bank, William G. Pittard, and Pattie D. Pittard qualified as executors of the estate. Uncertain whether estate taxes should be apportioned among the beneficiaries and, if not, which fund or funds should be charged with those taxes, the executors filed a bill of complaint below in December 1989 joining the beneficiaries as defendants and seeking the court\u2019s advice and guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Following a hearing and the argument of counsel, the trial court ruled that Item I of the will \u201cmanifests an intention on the part of the decedent, within the purview of Section 64.1-165, Code of Virginia, to direct the payment of such taxes and administrative costs from the property which passes under the residuary clause of the decedent\u2019s will,\u201d and \u201cthat the apportionment of estate tax required under Section 64.1-161, Code of Virginia, is not applicable to\u201d the specific bequests and devises made in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Separate petitions for appeal from the trial court\u2019s November 1990 final decree were filed by the following parties which were defendants below: Lynchburg College and Patrick Henry Boys Home, The College of William and Mary in Virginia, and American Cancer Society, Virginia Division, Incorporated. We awarded the appeals and consolidated the cases. A number of the individual beneficiaries have appeared as appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The sole question presented on appeal is whether Pittard\u2019s will, particularly the provisions of Item I, contains sufficient direction to prevent the application of Virginia\u2019s apportionment statute, Code \u00a7 64.1-161, or, stated differently, contains sufficient direction to meet the requirements of Virginia\u2019s anti-apportionment statute, Code \u00a7 64.1-165. We answer that query in the affirmative because the result in this case is controlled by our decision in <em>Baylor </em>v. <em>National Bank of Commerce, </em>194 Va. 1, 72 S.E.2d 282 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Initially, certain basic principles of law should be reviewed. The Commonwealth and the federal government impose taxes on estates. The federal law provides for the states to determine how the tax burden shall be borne by those who share in the taxed estate. <em>Riggs </em>v. <em>Del Drago, </em>317 U.S. 95, 97-98 (1942); <em>Alexan</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number><em>dria Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>213 Va. 620, 622, 194 S.E.2d 723, 725 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">In Virginia, all the debts and liabilities of a testator must be paid before any bequests can be effectual; the first mandate of a will is that the testator\u2019s just debts should be paid promptly. <em>Edmunds </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>78 Va. 720, 726 (1884). When legacies are to be used to pay debts, the residuary legacy is liable first. <em>Id. </em>at 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Without an apportionment statute, the burden of estate taxes, unless otherwise directed by the testator, would fall upon the residuary estate, which ordinarily benefits the natural objects of the testator\u2019s generosity. To correct this apparent inequity, Virginia, along with a number of other states, has enacted an apportionment statute. The statute, Code \u00a7 64.1-161, is based on the principle that estate taxes should be equitably apportioned among the taxable legatees. <em>Alexandria Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>213 Va. at 625, 194 S.E.2d at 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The statute provides that estate taxes assessed upon an estate shall be charged against the share of each beneficiary of the estate in the proportion that the value of the beneficiary\u2019s interest bears to the total value of the estate, \u201cexcept that in making such proration each such person shall have the benefit of any exemptions, deductions and exclusions allowed by . . . law in respect of such person or the property passing to him.\u201d \u00a7 64.1-161.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The statutes dealing with apportionment, found in Article 7, Chapter 6 of Title 64.1 of the Code, expressly preserve, however, \u201cthe right of a testator to designate such parts of his assets as he desires to bear the burden of all taxes.\u201d <em>Baylor, </em>194 Va. at 7, 72 S.E.2d at 285. Code \u00a7 64.1-165, the anti-apportionment statute, provides in pertinent part: \u201cBut it is expressly provided that the foregoing provisions of this article are subject to the following qualification, that none of such provisions shall in any way impair the right or power of any person by will ... to make direction [for] the payment of such estate or inheritance taxes and to designate the fund or funds or property out of which such payment shall be made; and in every case the provisions of the will . . . shall be given effect to the same extent as if this article had not been enacted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">So the pertinent inquiry, as we have indicated, is whether Pittard\u2019s will discloses an intention by the testator that the burden of estate taxes should fall entirely upon the probate estate, contrary to the statutory rule of apportionment. In responding to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>query, we apply ordinary rules of construction relating to wills. In construing a will, a court must ascertain the intent of the testator from the language of the document, if possible. <em>Gillespie </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>242 Va. 300, 303, 410 S.E.2d 617, 620 (1991), decided today. If it is made \u201cclear\u201d that the testator intended there should not be an apportionment of taxes, such intent must be given effect. <em>Simeone </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>204 Va. 860, 863, 134 S.E.2d 281, 283-84 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\">The appellants argue that the testator \u201cmerely expressed a general desire to have taxes on his estate paid in a timely fashion,\u201d and that Item I is \u201cno more than simple \u2018boilerplate\u2019 language,\u201d insufficient to invoke the anti-apportionment statute. They say that the emphasis of the words in Item I is not \u201con speculative tax allocation instructions, but rather on the <em>time </em>for paying all obligations \u2014 \u2018as soon after my death as practicable.\u2019 \u201d According to the appellants, \u201cPittard wanted his legatees to receive their distributions promptly, and the sooner the debts and taxes were paid, the sooner the legatees could enjoy their gifts. To read any more into his request for prompt payment would require speculation and conjecture.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">In <em>Baylor, </em>this Court considered similar language. In that case, the testator in Item 1 directed his executors to pay \u201call my just debts, funeral expenses and any inheritance, estate, and transfer taxes which may be assessed against my estate, or any beneficiary under this Will, including any share of Federal Estate or other taxes which may be chargeable against any person or persons who may receive any proceeds of life insurance upon my life . . . as soon as practicable after my death.\u201d 194 Va. at 3, 72 S.E.2d at 283. The question presented was whether the testator\u2019s widow, who was given \u201cone-third of my personal estate,\u201d was entitled to receive one-third of the gross personal estate or one-third of the personal estate diminished by the payment of costs of administration, funeral expenses, debts, and estate and inheritance taxes. <em>Id. </em>at 2, 72 S.E.2d at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The Court said: \u201cThe testator made no distinction between debts, funeral expenses and State inheritance and Federal transfer taxes. It is clear from the language used that he intended all of the items to be treated alike and to be paid in the same manner and from the same fund.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5, 72 S.E.2d at 284. Quoting the <em>Baylor </em>trial judge, the Court stated: \u201c \u2018As the debts must be deducted from the personal estate before the widow\u2019s one-third thereof may be determined, it follows . . . that the funeral ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>penses and taxes mentioned must likewise be deducted therefrom prior to such determination. Any other conclusion would fail to give effect to the provisions of the will.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5-6, 72 S.E.2d at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\">In <em>Baylor, </em>the widow contended that the trial court, in ruling against her, failed to apply the provisions of the apportionment statutes. This Court, after quoting the anti-apportionment statute, stated that the testator, in making the provision for the payment of debts and taxes, \u201csimply exercised the right expressly reserved to him in the Apportionment statutes,\u201d noting that the point \u201cwas not seriously argued before the trial judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7-8, 72 S.E.2d at 286. Again quoting the trial judge, this Court noted that the language of the will \u201c \u2018constituted an effective direction relieving the executors from the necessity of complying with the requirements of the Apportionment statute,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c \u2018this appears to be in accordance with the great weight of authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 72 S.E.2d at 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><em>Baylor, </em>39 years later, is still in accord with the great weight of authority. An annotator has summarized the majority rule, referring to so-called \u201ctax clauses\u201d like Item I of Pittard\u2019s will: \u201cWhere there is no express designation of the fund which is to be burdened with taxes but there is a general direction to the executor to pay all debts, expenses, and taxes, there is an implied direction that the taxes are to be paid from the fund which also bears the burden of debts and expenses.\u201d Annotation, <em>Construction and Effect of Will Provisions Expressly Relating to the Burden of Estate or Inheritance Taxes, </em>69 A.L.R.3d 122, 130, 445 (1976 and Supp. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">This is precisely the situation with Pittard\u2019s will. In clear language, there is a general direction to pay all debts, expenses of administration, and taxes; that command, \u201cI desire,\u201d implicitly is addressed to the executors.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> There is no express designation of the fund to be burdened with taxes but there is an implied direction that the taxes are to be paid from the fund which bears the burden of debts and administration expenses. Indeed, the testator specifically stated that he considered debts and expenses of administration as \u201cincluding\u201d estate taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Paraphrasing <em>Baylor, </em>we find that the testator made no distinction between debts, administration expenses, and estate taxes. As we said in <em>Baylor. </em>\u201cIt is clear from the language used that he intended all of the items to be treated alike and to be paid in the same manner and from the same fund.\u201d 194 Va. at 5, 72 S.E.2d at 284. Accordingly, we hold the trial court correctly ruled that the language of Pittard\u2019s will, particularly that contained in Item I, demonstrates the testator\u2019s intention to relieve the executors from the necessity of complying with the requirements of the apportionment statute, Code \u00a7 64.1-161.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\">The appellants labor in vain to distinguish this case from <em>Baylor. </em>Actually, their argument amounts to an invitation that we overrule <em>Baylor, </em>they urge that we adopt the reasoning of the courts in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>283 Md. 644, 392 A.2d 1103 (1978), and <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank of Morgantown </em>v. <em>McGill, </em>377 S.E.2d 464 (W.Va. 1988). We decline the invitation. Maryland and West Virginia follow the minority rule on this subject; both courts acknowledge that the view they adopt is at odds with <em>Baylor. Johnson, </em>283 Md. at 650-51, 392 A.2d at 1107-08; <em>McGill, </em>377 S.E.2d at 468 n.6. We refuse to change the Virginia rule, especially in an area of the law such as this where stability is so important.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Consequently, the decree of the trial court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-6\"> Precatory words expressing desire, recommendation, or request are uniformly considered imperative when addressed to an executor. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Trustees of the Baptist Orphan</em>age, 194 Va. 901, 905, 75 S.E.2d 491, 494 (1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
