Determining that the issue involves a matter of significant precedential value within the meaning of Code \u00a7 17-116.07(B), we agreed to review the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">The parties were divorced by a May 1987 final decree which incorporated a property settlement agreement obligating the father to pay $1,600 per month for the support of the parties\u2019 four minor children. In July 1987, the father voluntarily left a salaried management position with a Richmond stock brokerage firm for a commissioned sales position with another Richmond stock broker. At the time of the change, the father\u2019s earnings at the new job had been projected to be about the same as at his former employment. Following the stock market \u201ccrash\u201d in October 1987, however, his annual income diminished approximately $10,000 from the sum he had been earning from the first employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">In January 1989, the father filed a petition in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court of Henrico County alleging a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>material change in his financial circumstances and seeking a reduction in his child support obligation. That court reduced the obligation to $830 per month. On appeal, the Circuit Court of Henrico County, after a hearing, denied the reduction request and ordered the father to continue to pay the original amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The chancellor ruled that the father had proved \u201cthere is a financial change in circumstances\u201d and held \u201cthat this is a material change of circumstances.\u201d The chancellor noted, explicitly relying on <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Lowry, </em>232 Va. 110, 348 S.E.2d 259 (1986), that the father must also prove \u201cthat the lack of ability to pay is not due to any voluntary act or neglect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Additionally, the chancellor determined that the father\u2019s change from a management position to a sales position was \u201ca voluntary act and a lateral move\u201d with \u201csimilar income potential.\u201d In making the change, the chancellor found, the father \u201caccepted the risk involved in being a commissioned stockbroker.\u201d Concluding, the chancellor decided that the father had failed to meet the requirements of <em>Edwards </em>and that he had failed to prove he was entitled to a reduction in the support obligation. The father appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Upon appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court, holding that the court \u201cimposed an erroneous standard of proof\u201d on the father. <em>Antonelli </em>v. <em>Antonelli, </em>11 Va. App. 89, 90, 396 S.E.2d 698, 699 (1990). In its opinion, the Court of Appeals summarized the settled principles that we articulated in <em>Edwards </em>which are to be applied to requests to modify court-ordered support obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">When invoking the divorce court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 20-108, following entry of a final decree of divorce, a party seeking a change in court-ordered child support has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence a material change in circumstances justifying modification of the support requirement. <em>Edwards, </em>232 Va. at 112, 348 S.E.2d at 261. In discharging this burden, a father seeking a reduction in support payments must also make a full and clear disclosure about his ability to pay, and he must show his claimed lack of ability to pay is not due to his own voluntary act or because of his neglect. <em>Id. </em>at 112-13, 348 S.E.2d at 261. In other words, the father must establish that he is not \u201cvoluntarily unemployed or voluntarily under employed.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The Court of Appeals, in the course of its opinion, elaborated on the <em>Edwards </em>statement that the father must show his inability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>to pay is not due to his \u201cown voluntary act or because of his neglect.\u201d Noting that the father in this case \u201cclaimed to have made a bona fide employment change from which he expected career satisfaction and financial success,\u201d <em>Antonelli, </em>11 Va. App. at 94, 396 S.E.2d at 701, the Court of Appeals said that, while any career change is a \u201cvoluntary act,\u201d the law defining child support obligations is not \u201cintended to frustrate ambition or enterprise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals construed the term \u201cvoluntary act\u201d to mean a \u201cwillful act done for the purpose of frustrating the feasibility or enforceability of the support obligation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Accordingly, the Court of Appeals held that a father \u201cwho shows a reduced ability to satisfy his obligation, which is not due to his wrongdoing, his neglect of his affairs, or his intentional diminution of his financial ability other than in connection with a bona fide and reasonable business undertaking, is entitled to have that reduction considered along with the other usual factors, including his general earning capability, in determining his child support obligation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Applying those criteria, the Court of Appeals said that the circuit court found that the father had demonstrated a change of circumstances, but was silent on \u201cthe required corollary finding of whether this change justified the reduction sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The circuit court, according to the Court of Appeals, failed to determine whether the father\u2019s voluntary act in changing employment was \u201ca bona fide and reasonable business undertaking or whether it was for the purpose of reducing his ability to support his children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95, 396 S.E.2d at 701. Finding such failure to be error, the Court of Appeals remanded the matter to the circuit court \u201cfor further proceedings\u201d and for \u201creconsideration of the merits of the petition for reduction in child support.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">We agree with the gloss the Court of Appeals has placed on <em>Edwards. </em>We disagree, however, with the Court of Appeals\u2019 application of those principles to this case, the effect of which is to afford the father another opportunity to prove what he failed to prove in the first instance. In sum, we do not believe that the chancellor imposed an erroneous standard of proof on the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The record demonstrates that the chancellor applied the elementary principles, recently summarized in <em>Edwards, </em>appropriate to reduction requests such as the one presented in this case. The only unusual feature here is that the fact pattern is one not presented in earlier cases. <em>See Edwards, </em>232 Va. at 113 n.*, 348 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>S.E.2d at 261 n.*. As we interpret the chancellor\u2019s decision, he did not penalize the father merely because he voluntarily changed employment, as the Court of Appeals seems to indicate. Rather, the chancellor, recognizing that the change was \u201ca lateral move\u201d with \u201csimilar income potential,\u201d determined that the father \u201caccepted the risk involved in being a commissioned stockbroker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The effect of the chancellor\u2019s decision to deny the reduction was to hold that the father gambled with the children\u2019s ability to receive his financial support, and lost. Of course, a father is not prohibited from voluntarily changing employment. But, the chancellor, in the exercise of judicial discretion, implicitly held that when the father who was under court order to pay a certain sum for child support, which he was able to pay given his employment, chose to pursue other employment, albeit a bona fide and reasonable business undertaking, the risk of his success at his new job was upon the father, and not upon the children. We cannot say that this demonstrates the chancellor imposed an erroneous standard of proof in denying the father relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Consequently, the judgment of the Court of Appeals will be reversed. We will award the mother a sum on account of attorney\u2019s fees in this Court, and we will remand the case to the Court of Appeals directing it to fix a sum on account of attorney\u2019s fees for the mother in that court. We will also direct the Court of Appeals to remand the case to the circuit court for reconsideration of its denial of the mother\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees there, and for entry of an order dismissing the father\u2019s petition for reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b184-7\">JUSTICE WHITING,</author>\n<p id=\"AnC\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">I dissent for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">First, the trial court and the majority treat the allocation of the risk of the father\u2019s bona fide job change as an \u201ceither/or\u201d proposition, and require the father to assume the entire risk of its success, regardless of whether his job change was a reasonable business decision made in good faith. In doing so, they regard as irrelevant the evidence already in this record that would support a finding that the father\u2019s job change was a bona fide and reasonable business undertaking. I think that this evidence was relevant and should have been considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Nor can I agree that the Court of Appeals fell into the same \u201ceither/or\u201d error by allocating the entire risk upon the children and not the father, as the majority implies. Rather, I believe the Court of Appeals remanded the case for the trial court\u2019s reconsideration of all relevant factors; \u201calong with the other usual factors\u201d is the Court of Appeals\u2019 language.' <em>Antonelli </em>v. <em>Antonelli, </em>11 Va. App. 89, 95, 396 S.E.2d 698, 701 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">In my opinion, one \u201cusual\u201d or relevant factor to be considered should be an allocation of the burden of the father\u2019s reduced income between the father and his children, if the evidence already before the trial court establishes that the job change was based on a reasonable business decision, made in good faith. Should the trial court find that a reduction was justified in these circumstances, it need not impose the entire burden of the father\u2019s reduced income on either the father or the children. Instead, it should apportion the burden between the two in deciding how much to reduce the father\u2019s support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">This seems fair for two reasons. First, if the father had been a custodian of the children, either before or after the marriage terminated, the children would have shared the benefits and burdens of this risk with their father.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Second, Code \u00a7 20-108 authorizes the court to \u201crevise and alter [its] decree concerning the . . . maintenance of the children and make a new decree concerning the same, as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require.\u201d Thus, if the father\u2019s job change had increased his income, this \u201cchanged circumstance\u201d might authorize an increase in the support payments due the mother as custodian of the children. Because the children can share in the benefits resulting from an increase in the father\u2019s income, a trial court should consider whether the children should bear any burden resulting from their noncustodial father\u2019s decreased income, provided his decision to change jobs was made in good faith and was a reasonable business decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">My second reason for dissenting is that I do not agree with the majority that the \u201ceffect\u201d of the Court of Appeals\u2019 remand of the case was to give the father a second opportunity to prove an element of his case that he had not proven in the first instance. I find nothing in that Court\u2019s opinion which would authorize the father to introduce any additional evidence in this case. Rather, I believe that the Court of Appeals clearly directed the trial court to recon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>sider the previously disregarded evidence in the following language of one of its concluding paragraphs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\">The trial court found that Mr. Antonelli had demonstrated a material change of circumstances. It was silent as to the <em>required corollary finding </em>of whether this change justified the reduction sought. The trial court found that Mr. Antonelli\u2019s career change was a voluntary act. It <em>should also have determined </em>whether that change was a bona fide and reasonable business undertaking or whether it was for the purpose of reducing his ability to support his children. It <em>should have determined </em>whether his financial reverses resulted from his wrongful act or neglect. It <em>should have considered the case findings, </em>along with the other usual factors, in ruling on Mr. Antonelli\u2019s petition. Its failure to do so was error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\"><em>Antonelli, </em>11 Va. App. at 94-95, 396 S.E.2d at 701 (emphasis added). Therefore, I believe that the remand was simply one requiring the trial court to apply the proper standard of consideration to the evidence before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">As the Court of Appeals did, I would remand this case with instructions that the trial court correct its error by considering the previously disregarded evidence as one of the relevant factors in deciding whether and how much to reduce the court-ordered support payments.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
