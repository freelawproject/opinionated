Finding that the <em>Corbin </em>rule does not apply here, we will affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-13\">The following scenario spawned the question for decision in this case: On October 31, 1987, Larry Berry, a member of the police department of the City of Manassas Park in Prince William County, responded to a call concerning a disturbance at a Hardee\u2019s restaurant. Upon arrival, Officer Berry observed the defendant, Wallace Elwood Martin, emerging from the restaurant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>an apparently intoxicated condition. Berry asked Martin for identification and inquired about what had happened inside the restaurant. Martin became \u201cvery loud and boisterous,\u201d and Berry placed him under arrest for being drunk in public.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">When Berry, who was in full uniform, attempted to \u201cwalk [Martin] over to the police car,\u201d Martin \u201cturned . . . and shoved\u201d Berry. The two fell against Berry\u2019s cruiser and then to the ground, with Martin atop Berry. They struggled on the ground for \u201cquite a while\u201d until Berry was able to get Martin \u201coff of [him].\u201d Martin broke away and stepped \u201con to the sidewalk,\u201d some seven feet from Berry.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Then, as Berry \u201cwas pulling [himself] up off the ground\u201d and had gotten \u201calmost in an upright position,\u201d he looked up and saw that Martin was pointing a gun at him. Martin pulled the trigger and Berry heard a \u201cclick,\u201d but the gun did not fire. Berry ran behind a parked vehicle and heard another \u201cclick\u201d from Martin\u2019s gun. Berry pulled his weapon out and shot at Martin, but missed. Still pointing his gun at Berry, Martin began to run, and Berry fired again, this time hitting Martin in the right shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">When other police officers arrived, Martin\u2019s gun was discovered, unloaded, on the ground about ten feet from where he lay. He was transported to a hospital for treatment. He told a police officer the next day that he \u201cwould have shot the bastard if [he] had a gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">As a result of his encounter with Berry, Martin was charged with three misdemeanor offenses, <em>viz., </em>obstructing justice by threats or force, drunk in public, and carrying a concealed weapon. Martin was also charged with two felonies, <em>viz., </em>attempted capital murder of a law enforcement officer for the purpose of interfering with the performance of his official duties and use of a firearm in the commission of attempted capital murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">At a single hearing in general district court, Martin was convicted of the three misdemeanor offenses and held for the grand jury on the two felony charges. After he was indicted for attempted capital murder and use of a firearm, he filed a plea of former jeopardy. In a pretrial ruling, the trial court granted the plea and dismissed the two felony indictments, holding that the charge of obstructing justice was a lesser included offense of the charge of attempted capital murder of a law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">The grand jury then indicted Martin for attempted murder and use of a firearm in the commission of attempted murder. To these indictments, Martin filed a \u201cPlea of Former Jeopardy and Res <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Judicata.\u201d The trial court denied this plea, a jury convicted Martin of both offenses, and the trial court confirmed the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">Martin filed a petition for appeal in the Court of Appeals which focused principally upon the denial of his plea of former jeopardy and res judicata. The Court refused the petition. Martin filed in this Court a petition for appeal with the same principal focus, and we refused that petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Martin sought certiorari from the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated this Court\u2019s judgment, and remanded the case \u201cfor further consideration in light of <em>Grady </em>v. Corbin, 495 U.S. 508 (1990).\u201d Upon return of the case, we granted Martin an appeal to consider the question whether, in light of <em>Corbin, </em>the trial court erred in denying his \u201cPlea of Former Jeopardy and Res Judicata.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">In <em>Corbin, </em>the Supreme Court held that, even though the second of two successive prosecutions may not be barred by the test enunciated in <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299 (1932), the second prosecution is barred \u201cif, to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, the government will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted.\u201d 495 U.S. at 510, 110 S.Ct. at 2087.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Under <em>Blockburger, </em>the second of two prosecutions is not barred if each offense \u201crequires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d 284 U.S. at 304. The second prosecution involved in this case passes the <em>Blockburger </em>test. While attempted murder requires proof of an intent to kill, <em>Epps </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 150, 154, 216 S.E.2d 64, 68 (1975), obstruction of justice does not. And, while obstruction of justice requires proof of the intimidation or impediment of a judge, magistrate, justice, juror, witness, or law enforcement officer, Code \u00a7 18.2-460(A) (now Code \u00a7 18.2-460(B)), attempted murder does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">The crucial question, therefore, is whether <em>Corbin\u2019s </em>\u201csame conduct\u201d rule bars Martin\u2019s prosecution for attempted murder. Martin argues that the prosecution is barred under <em>Corbin </em>because, in establishing an essential element of the charge of attempted murder, the Commonwealth proved he obstructed justice by threats or force, and this was conduct constituting an offense for which he had already been prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">We disagree with Martin. We do not think this case is controlled by <em>Corbin. </em>There, Corbin, the accused, drove across the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>center line of a New York highway while intoxicated and struck two oncoming vehicles, causing the death of one person and the serious injury of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">Corbin was issued two traffic tickets charging him with the misdemeanors of driving while intoxicated and failing to keep to the right of the median. He plead guilty to both charges in town justice court, but the judge was not informed that a fatality had occurred and the prosecutors who were conducting a homicide investigation were not made aware of the misdemeanor prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Later, Corbin was indicted on homicide and assault charges. A bill of particulars filed by the state identified three acts the prosecution intended to rely on to prove the charges: (1) driving while intoxicated, (2) failing to keep to the right of the median, and (3) driving at an excessive speed. 495 U.S. at 514, 110 S.Ct. at 2089.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Corbin\u2019s motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds was denied by the appellate division of the New York trial court, but that state\u2019s Court of Appeals reversed. The Supreme Court of the United States affirmed this latter decision. Referring to its new \u201csame conduct\u201d standard, the Court stated: \u201cThis is not an \u2018actual evidence\u2019 or \u2018same evidence\u2019 test. The critical inquiry is what conduct the State will prove, not the evidence the State will use to prove that conduct.\u201d 495 U.S. at 521, 110 S.Ct. at 2093 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The Court noted Corbin\u2019s concession that <em>Blockburger </em>did not bar prosecution of the homicide and assault offenses. The Court held, however, that the prosecution was barred because in its bill of particulars the state had \u201cadmitted it [would] prove the entirety of the conduct for which Corbin was convicted \u2014 driving while intoxicated and failing to keep right of the median \u2014 to establish essential elements of the homicide and assault offenses.\u201d 495 U.S. at 523, 110 S.Ct. at 2094.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">Here, however, the Commonwealth has not admitted that, in the prosecution for attempted murder, it relied upon the same conduct for which Martin was convicted of obstructing justice. Rather, the Commonwealth contends that, unlike Corbin\u2019s conduct, Martin\u2019s conduct in obstructing justice can be readily differentiated from his conduct in attempting to commit murder. Nor is this a case like <em>Corbin, </em>where the prosecutor\u2019s right hand did not know what his left hand was doing and the judge was kept in the dark about the fatality caused by Corbin\u2019s conduct. Finally, unlike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>Corbin, </em>there is present in this case a clear legislative intent to segment the misdemeanor offense of obstructing justice from the felony charge of attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">With respect to this latter point, Code \u00a7 18.2-460(A) (now Code \u00a7 18.2-460(B)) makes the obstruction of justice by threats or force a misdemeanor. It is significant that the statutory language does not read \u201cthreats or force <em>or the presentation of a </em>weapon.\u201d The absence of language relating to use of a weapon indicates, in our opinion, the legislative intent to include in the misdemeanor offense of obstructing justice less violent types of conduct and to make conduct accompanied by the use of a weapon subject to prosecution for greater offenses, such as attempted murder. Indeed, it is inconceivable that the General Assembly would make an offense involving the use of a deadly weapon only a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The evidence in the present case fits well within the legislative framework. As noted previously, the evidence showed that Martin \u201cturned . . . and shoved\u201d Berry and then struggled with him on the ground for \u201cquite a while.\u201d This evidence fully established a discrete misdemeanor offense of obstructing justice that became complete with Martin\u2019s turning and shoving Berry and struggling with him on the ground. The evidence concerning Martin\u2019s later conduct involving the use of a weapon was not necessary, therefore, to the prosecution for obstructing justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The separate offense of attempted murder commenced only after Martin and Berry had separated and Martin had stepped some seven feet away. The evidence of Martin\u2019s drawing of his weapon, at which time it may be inferred he formed the intent to kill Berry, his pulling of the trigger, and his making the statement that he \u201cwould have shot the bastard if [he] had a gun,\u201d fully established the attempted murder offense. The evidence of Martin\u2019s conduct in shoving Berry and struggling with him was not necessary, therefore, in the words of <em>Corbin, </em>\u201cto establish an essential element\u201d of the offense of attempted murder. 495 U.S. at-, 110 S.Ct. at 2087. Hence, <em>Corbin </em>does not apply to bar Martin\u2019s prosecution for attempted murder. <em>See United States </em>v. Clark,_F.2d_, (4th Cir. 1991) (No. 90-5771) <em>(Corbin </em>inapplicable where conduct involved in prior prosecution not necessary to proof of essential element of second prosecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">Martin argues, however, that because the trial court ruled the encounter between Martin and Berry \u201cwas one act,\u201d the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>monwealth is estopped from contending that the encounter was \u201ca series of separate assaults.\u201d However, the record does not contain any ruling that the encounter between Martin and Berry \u201cwas one act.\u201d At one of the places cited by Martin, the trial judge made the general observation that \u201ca single act may be an offense against two statutes,\u201d but this was not a finding that the encounter between Martin and Berry constituted only \u201cone act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Be that as it may, it is clear that the trial court did not dismiss the attempted capital murder indictment because it considered the encounter between Martin and Berry as \u201cone act.\u201d Rather, the court dismissed the indictment because it found that the charge of obstructing justice, for which Martin had already been prosecuted, was a lesser included offense of the charge of attempted capital murder of a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Contrary to Martin\u2019s further contention, it does not follow that the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the capital murder charge constituted a dismissal of the attempted murder charge as well. In the first place, while obstructing justice may be a lesser included offense of attempted capital murder of a police officer, it is not a lesser included offense of attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Furthermore, jeopardy attaches only after a jury is empaneled and sworn in a jury trial or the first witness is sworn in a bench trial. <em>Bradshaw </em>v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 484, 492, 323 S.E.2d 567, 572 (1984); <em>Rosser </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>159 Va. 1028, 1031-32, 1036, 167 S.E. 257, 257 (1933). Here, the capital murder charge was dismissed in a pretrial ruling, prior to the empaneling and swearing of a jury or the swearing of any witnesses. Hence, dismissal of the attempted capital murder charge cannot form the basis of a double jeopardy bar to the prosecution for attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Finally, Martin argues that Code \u00a7 19.2-294 barred his conviction for attempted murder after he had been convicted of obstructing justice. We disagree. Code \u00a7 19.2-294 provides that \u201c[i]f the same act be a violation of two or more statutes, . . . conviction under one of such statutes . . . shall be a bar to a prosecution or proceeding under the other or others.\u201d Even if we assume that Martin\u2019s conduct constituted only one act, we must yet hold that Code \u00a7 19.2-294 is not a bar to prosecution for attempted murder after a conviction of obstructing justice. While obstructing justice may be a statutory offense, attempted murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>is not; it is a common law offense. <em>See Blythe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 222 </em>Va. 722, 725, 284 S.E.2d 796, 797 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">We hold that Martin\u2019s prosecution for attempted murder was not barred for any of the reasons he has advanced. <em>A fortiori, </em>Martin\u2019s prosecution for use of a firearm in the commission of attempted murder was not barred. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
