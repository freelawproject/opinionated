Balsey, a 74-year-old widow, was brutally attacked in her home in the City of Covington. The victim died the next day from stab wounds to her chest and back combined with \u201cblunt force\u201d injuries to her head sustained during the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Within a month, appellant Rocky Dale Rogers, age 24, was arrested. Subsequently, he was indicted for the following crimes arising from the attack: statutory burglary, Code \u00a7 18.2-90; robbery, Code \u00a7 18.2-58; and rape, Code \u00a7 18.2-61. In addition, the defendant was indicted for capital murder. The grand jury charged defendant with the willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing of the victim while in the commission of robbery when armed with a deadly weapon, or while in the commission of, or subsequent to, rape. Code \u00a7 18.2-31(4)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Following several pretrial hearings, including a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress certain statements made to the police, he was tried on all the charges by a single jury in November 1990. The jury fixed the following punishments for the noncapital offenses: life imprisonment for rape; 50 years imprisonment for robbery; and 20 years imprisonment for statutory burglary. The jury also found defendant guilty of capital murder as charged in the indictment. During the second phase of the bifurcated capital proceeding, the jury fixed defendant\u2019s punishment at death based upon the vileness and future dangerousness predicates of the capital murder sentencing statute. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4. Subsequently, the trial court considered a probation officer\u2019s report and, after a hearing in December 1990, sentenced defendant to death for the capital murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The death sentence is before us for automatic review under Code \u00a7 17-110.1(A), <em>see </em>Rule 5:22, and we have consolidated this review with defendant\u2019s appeal of the capital murder conviction. Code \u00a7 17-110.1(F). In addition, by order entered in March 1991, we have certified the appeals of the noncapital convictions from the Court of Appeals; the effect of the certification is to transfer jurisdiction over the noncapital appeals to this Court for all purposes. Code \u00a7 17-116.06(A). We have consolidated those appeals (Record No. 910480) with the capital murder appeal (Record No. 910479).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">The defendant did not brief or argue orally the assignments of error attacking the noncapital convictions. Additionally, the defendant on brief does not request us to reverse those convictions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Therefore, we will make no further specific reference to the validity of those convictions, and they will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The dispositive question in the capital murder appeal is whether the evidence is legally sufficient to establish that the defendant was the actual perpetrator of the crime. In summarizing the evidence, we will follow established principles and view the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Cheng </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 42, 393 S.E.2d 599, 608 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">On the day of the attack, about 2:00 p.m., Lucille Byrd visited the victim at the victim\u2019s home, 314 East Prospect Street, to deliver a belated Christmas present. Byrd stayed with the victim until about 4:00 p.m. and left the present, a card with a $20 bill enclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">About 5:15 p.m. on that day, Robbie Balsey Entsminger, the victim\u2019s daughter, visited her mother, who lived alone, to \u201ccheck up\u201d on her because the victim had suffered a \u201cstroke\u201d about 18 months earlier. She was \u201con her way to recovery\u201d from the stroke and could speak but not write. The daughter left the home about 6:15 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Between 6:30 p.m. and 6:45 p.m. on that day, Robert Edward Bolden observed the defendant in the 300 block of East Prospect Street when the witness was about \u201ca house away\u201d from the victim\u2019s residence. Bolden left a house in that block and, when he entered his automobile parked at the curb, found his left turn signal was inoperable. As Bolden \u201cgot out of the car and started messing with a bulb in the front, [he] looked down the street and [defendant] was in front of [the victim\u2019s] house and was walking towards\u201d the witness, with a \u201cmedium stride\u201d not walking \u201creal fast.\u201d Defendant was coming \u201cup\u201d the sidewalk toward the witness and, when the two were six feet apart, Bolden recognized the defendant because the witness\u2019 nephew previously \u201chad some trouble\u201d with defendant. Bolden noticed that Rogers was not clean shaven and was missing front teeth. Bolden returned momentarily to the home he had just left. When he returned to his car, defendant had \u201cdisappeared.\u201d Bolden \u201cpulled out\u201d of the parking space at 6:50 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">About 6:40 p.m. on the day in question, Mrs. Garnet Bryan was watching a news program on television in her residence at 316 East Prospect Street. She and the victim lived in the same two-story duplex house. The respective residences were separated by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>party wall. At that time, the witness heard the victim \u201chit the floor.\u201d The sound came from the victim\u2019s dining room, according to the witness. Assuming the victim had fallen, as was often the case immediately after the victim experienced the stroke, Bryan went to the front door of the victim\u2019s residence to render assistance. She had a key to the door but was unable to enter because an outside storm door was locked. The witness said, \u201cI pounded on the door to let her know I knew she had fallen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Bryan returned to her home and called the victim on the telephone, allowing it to ring three times. Receiving no answer, Bryan called the Selman residence at 312 East Prospect Street, \u201con the other side\u201d of the victim\u2019s home. Mr. Selman was not at home but Mrs. Selman offered to go with Bryan to assist the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Bryan and Selman met on the sidewalk and proceeded beside the victim\u2019s house to her back porch, which was on the Selman side of the home, to gain entry. As they entered the screened porch, the exterior door was standing open. They \u201cwent on up on the porch and the kitchen door was open, and went on in, the light was on in the kitchen and [they] knew there was something wrong then,\u201d because the night \u201cwas awful cold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">As Bryan entered the kitchen, followed closely by Selman, Bryan was struck on the shoulder by an individual that both women later identified as the defendant. Defendant was coming from the victim\u2019s dining room \u201cfastening up his jacket as he was coming out.\u201d According to Bryan, defendant said, \u201cyou just step right on out of here. She\u2019s been taken care of, and she\u2019s going to be all right, and she don\u2019t need you.\u201d According to Bryan, she replied, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll just see for myself\u2019 and she \u201cpushed past\u201d the defendant. Then, she said, \u201che took out and ran off the back porch and was gone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The women found the victim lying face down in the dining room \u201cperfectly nude\u201d with her clothing beside her \u201cfull of blood.\u201d Her shirt had been \u201cpushed up on her body\u201d and there was a \u201cknife sticking out of her back.\u201d The knife was one of a set of steak knives with white plastic handles from the victim\u2019s kitchen drawer.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">After observing the victim, Selman \u201cturned back around and went back to the back door.\u201d She said, \u201cthat\u2019s when I heard running, and I assumed that he had just, you know, run on away.\u201d When asked the direction the defendant was running, she said, \u201cIt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>sounded like going out back [toward the alley] because it was cold outside and I could hear crunching of the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Returning to the dining room, Selman assisted Bryan in trying to care for the victim. She \u201cstarted to groan\u201d and the women covered her with a quilt because \u201ccold air was coming in that back door.\u201d Using the telephone in the dining room, they called the local rescue squad first and then the local police. The first policeman to arrive at the scene received the call at 6:45 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">After the police were called, Mr. Selman came to the front door of the victim\u2019s residence. In order to allow him to enter, Mrs. Selman not only had to unlock both front doors but had to pull a front-hall \u201crunner\u201d rug back from against the inside door because it had been \u201cpushed clean against\u201d the door, blocking it.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The floor plan of the first floor of the home shows a hallway extending from the front door to the rear to the kitchen door. Steps to the second floor run from the front door parallel to the hallway. Adjacent to the hallway on the front is a living room. The dining room joins the living room to the rear and extends from the party wall across the whole width of the home past the kitchen door. A small pantry is oif the kitchen at the very rear of the home adjacent to the back porch. The pantry has one door which leads to the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Bryan testified that she saw no one but the defendant in the house or outside the house and that defendant \u201cwas by himself.\u201d Mrs. Selman stated that from the time they confronted defendant in the kitchen when he \u201cran out,\u201d they detected no one else in the house. She said she did not \u201csee anyone else stirring, hear any other noises, anything like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">The police and rescue squad personnel arrived at the scene at the same time, before 7:02 p.m. The victim was alive, lying against a buffet in the dining room near the door to the kitchen. The knife \u201cwas bent up so it was imbedded in her back . . . above her bra strap.\u201d One of the paramedics cut bandages \u201cand secured the knife in place where it was at.\u201d The victim was semi-conscious and was able to talk but she \u201cwasn\u2019t saying anything relevant.\u201d She was lying on her stomach in a pool of blood which apparently was coming from head wounds. When she was moved, \u201ca glass candlestick holder\u201d which \u201chad some blood on it\u201d was uncovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">The victim\u2019s daughter arrived at the scene shortly after 7:00 p.m., having been called by Bryan. In order to collect her mother\u2019s personal effects, she went upstairs to her mother\u2019s bedroom. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>light and a television set were \u201con\u201d in the bedroom. In plain view on a dresser were two diamond rings and a watch. The victim\u2019s wallet was inside a shoulder bag hanging in the bedroom closet. The wallet contained credit cards and about $70 in cash. None of the furnishings or items in the bedroom had been disturbed and there was no indication \u201cthere had been any type of rummaging around.\u201d All of the upstairs windows were closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">The $20 bill left as a Christmas gift was not found by the daughter or by anyone else at the scene. Upon arrival at the scene, however, the police observed four $1 bills lying in plain view in a dish on a table in the downstairs hallway.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The victim was transported to the emergency room of a local hospital. The emergency room physician found the knife inserted in her back about two inches beneath the skin, and removed it. The physician observed two other wounds about the width of the knife\u2019s blade on the victim\u2019s back near the site where the knife was imbedded. The knife was sticking into bare skin, not through any clothing. The victim was blue about the head and neck \u201cbecause she had been severely beaten around her head, particularly her ears.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">On January 11, the day following the victim\u2019s death, Dr. David W. Oxley, a state medical examiner, performed an autopsy on the decedent. The examiner found that the victim had sustained a fracture of the jawbone, fracture of the right orbital rim (\u201cthe bony part of the eye socket\u201d), fracture of the nose, bruises inside her lips, and contusion of the throat. The examiner opined that the latter injury was consistent with an aborted attempt at strangulation and that all the other injuries were caused by \u201cblunt force, blows\u201d from a fist or the candleholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The examiner also found a stab wound to the chest which passed \u201cbackward through the breast bone,\u201d penetrating the heart. The depth of penetration was three and one-half inches. This was a \u201clethal wound,\u201d the examiner said.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">In addition, the examiner found three stab wounds on the \u201cleft side of the back\u201d; two were superficial while the third entered the chest cavity. It began between ribs and went \u201cup toward the mid line of the body and penetrated the left ventrical of the heart.\u201d This wound was also lethal, according to the examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">Also, the examiner found a bruise and swelling about the decedent\u2019s left hand which appeared to be \u201ca defense wound\u201d sustained by a person under attack who is trying to protect her face <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>or head from \u201cblunt force.\u201d The examiner also found that the decedent\u2019s vagina was torn and lacerated consistent with forcible penetration of the vagina during a sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">The examiner opined that the stab wounds could have been caused by the knife found in the decedent\u2019s back. He testified that the decedent\u2019s \u201cdeath was due to stab wounds of the back and chest with perforations of the right and left ventrical to the heart combined with hemorrhage and shock and the blunt force injuries that she suffered to her head and face.\u201d According to the examiner, the \u201cmost serious of her wounds\u201d were \u201cthe stab wounds to the heart.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">On January 10, the day after the attack, Lt. C. R. Thurston of the Covington Police Department interviewed defendant at police headquarters. The defendant was not under arrest and voluntarily came to the police station. The defendant told Thurston about his activities on the day in question, which mainly involved drinking whiskey with Troy Malcolm, age 19, and another friend. At that time, the defendant was living at the Malcolm home located at \u201c128 Prospect Street.\u201d Defendant and Malcolm\u2019s 16-year-old sister, Valerie, were \u201cgirlfriend boyfriend.\u201d During the January 10 interview, defendant \u201cbasically\u201d told Thurston that \u201che didn\u2019t know anything about what had happened to Ms. Balsey.\u201d Defendant was allowed to leave the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">On January 13, Thurston interviewed defendant in Salem at State Police Headquarters. Defendant still was not under arrest and voluntarily went with police officers to Salem for the questioning. According to Thurston, defendant changed \u201chis story\u201d, to \u201csome degree.\u201d He said that \u201con the night that the lady was killed,\u201d he saw Troy Malcolm beside the victim\u2019s home, observed him \u201cput his shoulder\u201d against the back door trying to gain access, and that defendant \u201cjust went and walked away.\u201d He stated that later Malcolm returned to his home with blood on his jacket. According to defendant, Malcolm stated, \u201c \u2018That old bitch didn\u2019t have but $20 and I had to hit her and I stuck a knife in her.\u2019 \u201d Defendant was not placed under arrest at that time and was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">On January 14, Thurston and another officer observed defendant in the community walking with Valerie. When the couple saw the officers, defendant dropped a paper bag he was carrying and the couple walked rapidly away. The bag contained clothes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>according to Valerie. She and defendant left the Covington area that day and hitchhiked to Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">On January 15, Thurston interviewed Troy Malcolm. Immediately after taking a recorded statement from Malcolm, Thurston obtained an arrest warrant for defendant charging him with capital murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">On January 27, Thurston and Ronald E. Cruise, a special agent of the Virginia State Police, interviewed defendant at police headquarters of Susquehanna Township, a small community adjacent to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Defendant had been arrested for trespassing in nearby Dolphin County, Pennsylvania, and was in custody on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">During the course of the two-hour interrogation, which was recorded on audio tape, the defendant admitted to forcible entry through the locked kitchen door, to robbery of the victim of the $20 bill, and to rape. The defendant did not admit that he stabbed her. Indeed, he repeatedly denied knowing who stabbed her. There are many inconsistencies and contradictions in the statement. Essentially, defendant finally gave the following version of the events in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Defendant stated that during the day of the crimes he and Troy Malcolm had been consuming whiskey and beer; defendant also had been smoking marijuana and was very drunk. Defendant stated that he and Malcolm entered the house intending \u201cto rob the woman.\u201d They did not believe anyone was in the house but when they broke through the kitchen door, \u201cthe lady was standing right there in the kitchen.\u201d According to defendant, \u201cShe hollered \u2018get out of my house\u2019 or something,\u201d and Malcolm struck her in the face with his fist. She fell to the floor; defendant denied striking her.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">According to defendant, he then ran upstairs because Malcolm had informed him that the victim kept money there in a metal box and \u201che had drew me a map exactly where it was, earlier.\u201d Defendant stated that after searching the upstairs, he returned to the first floor where he saw the victim lying on the floor and Malcolm was \u201cstill hitting the woman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Asked to explain the presence of human blood on a jacket he was wearing that night, defendant had two answers. First, he said he \u201cgrabbed her\u201d when she \u201ctried to get up after she was bleeding\u201d and he \u201claid her back down.\u201d Second, he said that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>been in a fight about two weeks earlier \u201cwhen I got my teeth knocked out and when I got stabbed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Upon closer questioning, defendant finally admitted, \u201cI had intercourse with her.\u201d According to defendant, this was after Malcolm \u201ctore her clothes off\u201d and after a third individual named \u201cHillbilly\u201d had raped her. According to defendant, the victim \u201cwas laying, like, on her back\u201d when he raped her; he denied seeing any knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Defendant did not know \u201cHillbilly\u2019s\u201d proper name and stated he had met him through \u201ca drug deal.\u201d He said that \u201cHillbilly\u201d had a star tattoo at the corner of his left eye and \u201ca pot plant\u201d tattoo on his left arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">He said that \u201cHillbilly\u201d and Malcolm ran out the back door. Defendant stated that he remained in the house \u201clooking at that lady for a minute\u201d because \u201cI was scared, man, \u2018cause I ain\u2019t never seen nothing like that.\u201d He said that he then left the house and \u201cran into\u201d two women as he was leaving.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Repeatedly during the questioning, special agent Cruise referred to statements made to the police by Malcolm such as: \u201cI have told you that Troy Malcolm has laid the whole thing on you . . . . Troy said he was back in the pantry, cowering, because of all the things that were going on.\u201d Defendant denied the accuracy of that statement. Cruise also stated: \u201cI got Troy Malcolm\u2014who admits to being in the house. Yeah, we went up there. We did it. . . . \u2018I\u2019m back in the pantry,\u2019 Troy says, \u2018and Rocky\u2019s in there doing all the bastardly deeds.\u2019 \u201d Defendant responded, \u201cNo. That ain\u2019t the way it happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Near the end of the interrogation, after Cruise and Thurston had encouraged defendant to reveal who stabbed the victim, defendant said: \u201cI didn\u2019t see that, man. You can sit there and plead with me all day, man, I did not see that. I didn\u2019t see that woman get stabbed. You can sit here and talk to me until my head turns, fall off, man, but I did not see that woman get stabbed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">David William Stull, Jr., a convict residing at the Southampton Correctional Center, testified that he \u201cslept right beside\u201d Rogers in a prison dormitory when they were incarcerated in \u201c \u201887, maybe \u201888.\u201d Stull, who said he was known as \u201cHillbilly,\u201d exhibited to the jury a star tattoo at the corner of his eye and a tattoo of a marijuana plant on one arm, both of which Stull had worn since 1985. Stull was in prison on the day of the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>The Commonwealth presented extensive evidence in addition to the testimonial evidence. For example, the prosecutors offered photographs of the victim and of the exterior and interior of the home, the knife in question, and articles of clothing worn by the victim and the defendant at the time of the attack. In addition, the Commonwealth offered expert testimony describing the results of tests on blood and bodily fluids as well as the results of attempts to obtain fingerprints from many pertinent items of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Testing of the knife and candleholder revealed that no \u201clatent prints of value for identification purposes\u201d were \u201cpresent or were developed.\u201d Tests to determine the type of human blood found on clothes worn by defendant were \u201cinconclusive\u201d because the garments had been washed before acquired by the police. Defendant was included as a \u201cpossible source\u201d of semen found on the front of a sweater the victim was wearing and found on cotton removed from the victim\u2019s vagina and rectum; the cotton had been packed there after the attack and before the autopsy. Efforts to obtain a DNA profile from blood samples, vaginal swabs, and the sweater stain, and to relate the results to either the defendant or Malcolm, were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The defendant presented no evidence during the guilt phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Only the actual perpetrator of the crime may be convicted of capital murder when, as here, the offenses constituting the charge of capital murder are the willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing of a person in the commission of robbery when armed with a deadly weapon, or while in the commission of, or subsequent to, rape. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 146, 149, 255 S.E.2d 525, 526-27 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 920 (1981); Code \u00a7 18.2-18. \u201cThus, neither an accessory before the fact nor a principal in the second degree may be so convicted.\u201d <em>Cheng, </em>240 Va. at 42, 393 S.E.2d at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">\u201cThe Commonwealth has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that one accused of capital murder was the actual perpetrator of the crime. Suspicion of guilt, however strong, or even a probability of guilt, is insufficient to support a conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And, when the evidence is wholly circumstantial, as in this case, \u201call necessary circumstances proved must be consistent with guilt and inconsistent with innocence and exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. The chain of necessary circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>stances must be unbroken.\u201d <em>Inge </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 360, 366, 228 S.E.2d 563, 567 (1976). When, as here, motive has been proved, \u201cthe underlying evidence of motive must concur with the circumstantial evidence of other inculpatory circumstances\u2014time, place, means, and conduct\u2014in identifying the accused as the criminal agent beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 213, 221, 381 S.E.2d 225, 230 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">. The defendant contends that the \u201cevidence adduced at trial was insufficient, as a matter of law, to support Rogers\u2019 conviction for capital murder. Specifically, the evidence is insufficient to prove that Rogers stabbed Ms. Balsey.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The Commonwealth maintains that the evidence was sufficient to establish a jury issue on the question of criminal agency. The Commonwealth\u2019s theory at trial was that defendant \u201cwas the last man in that house,\u201d tacitly conceding that at least one other person was present at some point during this criminal enterprise. At trial, the prosecution took the position that, during a ten-minute period, defendant entered through the kitchen, never went past the dining room, picked up the $20 bill (which defendant said was on a silver tray in the dining room), raped the victim while she was on her back, stabbed her in the chest, \u201crolled her over\u201d and stabbed her in the back \u201cthree times, and left [the knife] in the third time,\u201d and fled the scene, running past Bryan and Selman. At trial, the Commonwealth theorized that defendant did not go upstairs; otherwise the bedroom would have been in disarray and the $1 bills would have been taken from the downstairs hall table. The Commonwealth contended that the witnesses\u2019 statements that no person except defendant was heard or seen in the house are corroborated by facts that the front door was locked and blocked, and the upstairs windows closed, making the only available exit through the kitchen, and no one but defendant was seen to leave there.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">On appeal, the Attorney General urges a slightly different theory, apparently claiming that the defendant was always alone in the house. The Attorney General on brief says that the <em>\u201conly </em>evidence that other persons were present during the offense [was] the defendant\u2019s own statements to the police.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The Attorney General contends that the jury had the right to disbelieve those portions of defendant\u2019s statement and to conclude that he was \u201cthe only perpetrator.\u201d Also, the Attorney General argues, \u201cthere was no opportunity for any other person to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>been present or to have committed these crimes. It was not only reasonable for the jury to infer that the defendant acted alone, it would have been unreasonable for the jury to have concluded otherwise.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Whatever theory is adopted by the Commonwealth, we hold that the evidence is insufficient, as a matter of law, to prove that defendant actually stabbed the victim, or administered any other blows which caused her death. As we have said, all necessary circumstances must be consistent with guilt, must be inconsistent with innocence, and must exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We conclude that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Rogers was the so-called \u201ctriggerman\u201d and that he wielded the knife. Stated differently, the Commonwealth has failed to exclude Troy Malcolm as the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The prosecution, through its own evidence, placed Malcolm in the home during the events in question. In offering the contents of the January 27 interrogation, the Commonwealth established, through Cruise\u2019s questions, that Malcolm \u201cs\u00e1id he was in the pantry, cowering, because of all the things that were going on.\u201d Additionally, Cruise stated that, \u201cI got Troy Malcolm \u2014 who admits to being in the house.\u201d According to Cruise, Malcolm said, \u201cYeah, we went up there. We did it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The significant weakness in the Commonwealth\u2019s case is the lack of any evidence, direct or circumstantial, which places the murder weapon in defendant\u2019s hands. The evidence of defendant\u2019s conduct has not concurred with motive, time, place, and means in identifying the accused as the criminal agent beyond a reasonable doubt. Even if we completely discard defendant\u2019s repeated statements that he did not stab the victim, importantly there is no evidence that his fingerprints were on the knife. Indeed, there is no evidence which, by legitimate inference or otherwise, places the knife in his possession at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The evidence creates at least one reasonable hypothesis of defendant\u2019s innocence. Reasonably to be concluded from the evidence is that Malcolm was present in the home, as leader of the scheme to rob the victim. Malcolm stabbed her after defendant had raped her. Bryan\u2019s loud \u201cpounding\u201d on the front door and the subsequent ringing of the telephone alerted Malcolm, who fled the premises through the back door an instant before Bryan and Selman approached the rear of the house. At this moment, the drunk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>and scared defendant was standing in the dining room \u201clooking at that lady for a minute\u201d because he \u201cain\u2019t never seen nothing like that.\u201d He then attempted to leave through the kitchen as the witnesses arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Another scenario would have Malcolm conceal himself in the pantry, having already stabbed the victim, as the witnesses entered the kitchen. During the seconds while the witnesses were in the dining room before Selman returned momentarily to the kitchen, Malcolm ran from the pantry through the kitchen and was heard by Selman, when she returned to the kitchen, running toward the alley.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The Commonwealth argued at trial that the only inference to be drawn from the evidence is that Rogers stabbed the victim. This argument was based on the assertion that Rogers was the last person who left the home, that he admitted raping the victim while she was on her back, and that he could not have so raped her while she had a knife in her back. The argument does not persuade us for two reasons. First, that argument assumes that, in the sequence of events, the rape by defendant was the last crime committed before defendant left. Under the evidence, the rape of the victim, as we have indicated, could have occurred in point of time prior to the stabbings. Second, even if the rape by defendant occurred last, it could have been accomplished even though the knife was in the victim\u2019s back. We have closely examined the knife in the record; in view of the amount of bend to the blade and the angle of entry, the victim could have been lying on her back, or partly so, with it sticking in her back. After the rape, she could have turned over to the position in which she was found by the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">In summary, the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth creates a strong suspicion, indeed a probability, that defendant was the criminal agent in the victim\u2019s death. But, as we have said, suspicious circumstances and probability of guilt, no matter how strong, are insufficient to sustain a criminal conviction. Because the circumstances of defendant\u2019s conduct do not exclude the reasonable hypothesis that Troy Malcolm killed the victim, the capital murder prosecution fails. <em>See Cheng, </em>240 Va. at 43, 393 S.E.2d at 608; <em>Stover </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 222 </em>Va. 618, 624, 283 S.E.2d 194, 197 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of conviction in the capital murder case and remand it for a new trial for an offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>no greater than murder in the first degree. Because of the remand, we have considered those assignments of error which raise issues that may arise upon retrial. We have concluded that the trial court correctly ruled on each of those questions; thus, there is no merit in those assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Record No. 910479 - <em>Reversed and remanded.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Record No. 910480 - <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
