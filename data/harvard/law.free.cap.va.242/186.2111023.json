(collectively Durastill) in return for certain contractual rights. First, Love became an \u201cindependent distributor\u201d of water purification stills sold by Durastill; second, she was entitled to enter Durastill\u2019s training program for distributors; and third, Love was to receive $1,250 for each new distributor she recruited to Durastill\u2019s program. Upon paying $5,000 to Durastill, each new distributor would acquire the same rights as Love. The first two provisions were in writing, the third was an oral agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">Love entered, but did not complete, Durastill\u2019s training program. On June 1, 1989, Love filed this action at law to recover her $5,000 payment, $2,000 in punitive damages, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. Love claimed: (1) that the contract was void because (a) it was procured by fraudulent misrepresentations, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>(b) it was a pyramid promotional scheme proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-239; and (2) that Durastill breached its contract by failing \u201cto provide her with materially-useful training.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">After a non-jury trial, the trial court entered judgment for Durastill. The court found that Durastill\u2019s sales promotion program was \u201ca process whereby part of the money paid by Mrs. Love was consideration for the opportunity to receive compensation in return for inducing other persons to become participants in the program.\u201d Nevertheless, because \u201cthere was no possibility of a carry over of commissions to persons subsequently recruited by [Love\u2019s] recruits,\u201d the court concluded that the contract was not \u201cthe type pyramid or promotional scheme prohibited by\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-239. Love appeals only this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The parties agree that the issue on appeal is whether the trial court\u2019s factual finding that Love\u2019s payment for the opportunity to be compensated for recruiting other program participants is sufficient to establish a \u201cpyramid promotional scheme\u201d within the statutory proscription.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">First, we consider the pertinent provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-239:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">Every person who contrives, prepares, sets up, operates, advertises or promotes any pyramid promotional scheme shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. For the purposes of this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">(a) <em>\u201cPyramid promotional </em>scheme\u201d means any program utilizing a pyramid or chain process by which a participant gives a valuable consideration for the opportunity to receive compensation ... in return for inducing other persons to become participants in the program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">Durastill contends that a necessary element of a pyramid promotional scheme is a multi-layered vertical integration between a distributor, the distributor\u2019s recruits, and the recruits of such recruits whereby each person in the pyramid receives compensation from the efforts of those in the pyramid beneath her or him. Thus, according to Durastill, because its program limits Love\u2019s commissions to those from her direct sales of Durastill distributorships and products, its program cannot be a pyramid promotional scheme within the purview of Code \u00a7 18.2-239.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">A \u201cpyramid sales scheme\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] device, illegal in many states, in which a buyer of goods is promised a payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>for each additional buyer procured by him.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1237 (6th ed. 1990). Neither that dictionary definition nor the statutory definition of Code \u00a7 18.2-239(a) indicates that there must be a multi-layered vertical chain of compensation flowing to <em>intermediate </em>participants from the efforts of their recruits.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Nevertheless, Durastill implies that we have already adopted its construction of Code \u00a7 18.2-239(a) in <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 298, 374 S.E.2d 13 (1988), and <em>Thaxton </em>v. <em>Common</em>wealth, 211 Va. 38, 175 S.E.2d 264 (1970). We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Although in both cases there were contractual provisions for the multi-layered vertical integration that Durastill claims to be an essential part of a statutory violation, neither case turned upon the definition of a \u201cpyramid promotional scheme.\u201d In <em>Bell, </em>the issue was whether the participants gave the statutorily required \u201cvaluable consideration.\u201d 236 Va. at 302, 374 S.E.2d at 16. In <em>Thaxton, </em>the decision turned upon whether the participants were agents of the out-of-state promoter, thus requiring the promoter to domesticate in Virginia. 211 Va. at 39, 175 S.E.2d at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Although we agree with Durastill that this penal statute must be construed strictly, \u201cthat rule of construction \u2018does not abrogate the well recognized canon that a statute or ordinance should be read and applied so as to accord with the purpose intended and attain the objects desired if that may be accomplished without doing harm to its language.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crone </em>v. <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc., </em>238 Va. 248, 254, 384 S.E.2d 77, 80 (1989) (quoting <em>Gough </em>v. <em>Shaner, </em>197 Va. 572, 575, 90 S.E.2d 171, 174 (1955)).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\"><em>Bell </em>makes plain one of the legislative purposes in enacting Code \u00a7 18.2-239. In describing the effect of the promotional scheme, we said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">[a]s the number in the chain of participants expands and the market for new recruits declines, the law of diminishing returns begins to operate against the interests of those who become participants late in the process. Once the market is exhausted, no participant . . . has an \u201copportunity to receive compensation ... in return for inducing other persons to become participants in the program.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2-239(a); <em>Bell, </em>236 Va. at 303, 374 S.E.2d at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">The <em>Bell </em>rationale applies here. Durastill\u2019s program is designed to create an expanding chain of participants, each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>whom pays Durastill $5,000 for the privilege of earning commissions by recruiting other participants. In order to recoup their $5,000 investments and to make additional profits, the distributors and their expanding chain of recruits are encouraged to sell as many distributorships as they can. As the base of the pyramid expands, there are fewer persons left to be potential distributors. Thus, the law of diminishing returns begins to operate against later recruits, eventually depriving them of their purchased \u201copportunity to receive compensation ... in return for inducing other persons to become . participants in the program.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-239(a). Clearly, this is an evil that Code \u00a7 18.2-239(a) sought to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Nor is harm done to the language of the statutory definition by concluding that the intermediate parties need not receive compensation from the efforts of their recruits to establish a pyramid promotional scheme. Durastill\u2019s scheme is within the language of the statutory definition of a pyramid promotional scheme because it \u201cutiliz[es] a pyramid or chain process\u201d that places Durastill at the apex of a pyramid resting upon a base of distributors who have been enticed into paying Durastill $5,000 for the ever-decreasing opportunity to recoup their investment by recruiting other distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that Durastill\u2019s promotional sales program is a \u201cpyramid promotional scheme\u201d that violates the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-239. Therefore, Durastill\u2019s contract with Love is \u201cagainst public policy,\u201d and made \u201cvoid and unenforceable\u201d by the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-239. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
