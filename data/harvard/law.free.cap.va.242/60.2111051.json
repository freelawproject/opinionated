Stanley had neglected and abused their three children. The J&amp;DR Court also awarded the custody of the children to the Fairfax County Department of Social Services (the department).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">On December 1, 1987, after the department\u2019s extensive efforts to counsel the parents had failed, the department filed foster care plans recommending adoption as the ultimate goal for the Stanley children. These plans further stated that the department intended to petition the court for termination of the Stanleys\u2019 residual parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>For reasons not disclosed in the record, the department did not file such petitions. However, on January 21, 1988, Jeanne B. Lynch, the guardian ad litem appointed to represent the three children, filed petitions to terminate both parents\u2019 residual rights to the children. On September 22, 1988, the department amended its foster care plan for one of the children to vest his maternal grandmother with his physical custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">On November 15, 1988, the J&amp;DR Court terminated both parents\u2019 residual rights with respect to the three children as provided in Code \u00a7 16.1-283(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Donna, but not Melvin, appealed to the circuit court. On February 24, 1989, the circuit court terminated Donna\u2019s parental rights. Donna appealed to the Court of Appeals which, on July 17, 1990, affirmed the circuit court\u2019s ruling as to two of the children but reversed its ruling as to the child who was in the maternal grandmother\u2019s physical custody.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>10 Va. App. 596, 605, 395 S.E.2d 199, 204 (1990). Deeming the question of the guardian ad litem\u2019s standing to petition for termination of parental rights to be one of significant precedential value, we awarded Donna an appeal limited to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Donna argues that a guardian ad litem can take no affirmative action to deprive his ward of any substantive right the ward already enjoys. Donna claims that a guardian ad litem has only an \u201cadvisory role.\u201d However, we have not regarded that role as merely advisory; instead, we have recognized that a guardian ad litem can appeal an adverse ruling, <em>see Givens </em>v. <em>Clem, </em>107 Va. 435, 437, 59 S.E. 413, 414 (1907), and can consent to a transfer to another jurisdiction of a case involving an infant\u2019s rights. <em>Lemmon </em>v. <em>Herbert, 92 </em>Va. 653, 659, 24 S.E. 249, 251 (1896). Accordingly, we conclude that a guardian ad litem may file affirmative pleadings necessary to protect the ward\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Finally, although Code \u00a7 16.1-283 is silent as to <em>who </em>may initiate termination proceedings, Donna notes that this section prohibits the filing of a termination petition prior to the filing of a foster care plan documenting termination as being in the best interest of the children. And Donna points out that Code \u00a7 16.1-281 expressly requires that the department prepare and file such foster care plans in the Stanley cases. Asserting that these code sections must be strictly construed, Donna concludes that because the filing of a foster care plan by the department is a necessary predicate to a termination proceeding, the legislature must have intended that the department would be the <em>only </em>entity that could file a termination petition in these cases. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">We will not give this procedural aspect of Code \u00a7 16.1-283 a strict construction. It is intended to provide for the protection of abused and neglected children. In describing the purpose and intent of the \u201cJuvenile and Domestic Relations District Court Law,\u201d Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-226 to -334, Code \u00a7 16.1-227 provides that such law \u201cshall be construed liberally and as remedial in character. ... It is the intention of this law that in all proceedings the welfare of the child and the family is the paramount concern of the Commonwealth . . . .\u201d And the best interest of the child must be the primary concern of the court. <em>Bailes </em>v. <em>Sours, </em>231 Va. 96, 99, 340 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Even though Code \u00a7 16.1-283 says nothing about <em>who </em>may file a petition for termination of parental rights, Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A) (1990 Supp.) provides that \u201c[t]he authority of the juvenile court to adjudicate matters involving the . . . disposition of a child shall not be limited to the consideration of petitions filed by a mother, father, or legal guardian but shall include petitions filed at any time by any party with a legitimate interest therein.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A guardian ad litem certainly has a legitimate interest in whether his ward is to be subjected to continued abuse and neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Further, Code \u00a7 16.1-266(A) requires the J&amp;DR Court to \u201cappoint a discreet and competent attorney-at-law as guardian ad litem to represent the child\u201d in abuse and neglect proceedings as well as in proceedings involving the termination of residual parental rights. And, Code \u00a7 8.01-9 requires that \u201c[e]very guardian ad litem shall faithfully represent the . . . interest of the person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>under a disability for whom he is appointed.\u201d Therefore, if a guardian ad litem feels that the best interests of his ward compel termination of the parents\u2019 residual rights, he can and should file an appropriate termination petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">For all these reasons, we conclude that a guardian ad litem has standing to file a petition for termination of residual parental rights. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE CARRICO, with whom JUSTICE STEPHENSON joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">I would reverse. A guardian ad litem is \u201ca special guardian appointed by the court in which a particular litigation is pending to represent an infant, ward or unborn person in that particular litigation, and <em>the status of guardian ad litem exists only in that specific litigation in which the appointment occurs.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>706 (6th ed. 1990) (citation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">In this case, the guardian ad litem was appointed in the initial proceeding brought by the Department of Social Services to have the children declared wards of the court. In my opinion, the guardian ad litem\u2019s authority extended only to that particular litigation. Accordingly, I would hold that the guardian ad litem did not have authority to institute the \u201cseparate proceeding\u201d required by Code \u00a7 16.1-283(a) for termination of the residual rights of the children\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Neither <em>Lemmon </em>v. <em>Herbert, </em>92 Va. 653, 24 S.E. 249 (1896), nor <em>Givens </em>v. <em>Clem, </em>107 Va. 435, 59 S.E. 413 (1907), cited by the majority, is contrary to my view of the matter. Each case involved action taken by a guardian ad litem in the specific litigation in which the appointment occurred and did not consist of anything remotely resembling the institution of a separate proceeding for the termination of residual parental rights.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-6\"> Code \u00a7 16.1-283(A) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">The residual parental rights of a parent or parents may be terminated by the court as hereinafter provided in a separate proceeding if the petition specifically requests such relief. No petition seeking termination of residual parental rights shall be accepted by the court prior to the filing of a foster care plan, pursuant to \u00a7 16.1-281, which documents termination of residual parental rights as being in the best interests of the child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b90-8\"> The Court of Appeals\u2019 reversal as to the one child was on the ground that the last-filed foster care plan did not recommend termination of Donna\u2019s rights to that child, as implicitly required by Code \u00a7 16.1-283, but instead recommended his continued physical custody with his maternal grandmother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\"> The \u201cdisposition of a child\u201d includes the court\u2019s power to terminate residual parental rights. Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-279(A)(5), -283.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
