The proceeds from the sale of the bonds are to be used by Fairfax County to complete the construction of the Fairfax County Parkway. On May 4, 1990, the Commission and Fairfax County, as a plaintiff intervenor, filed this bond validation proceeding pursuant to Code \u00a7 15.1-214 in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County. Osgood Tower, Marcia P. Dykes, along with other unnamed taxpayers and citizens of Fairfax County, opposed validation of the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">On July 12, after extended hearings and argument, the trial court validated the proposed bond issue. Tower and Dykes appealed. We consolidated the appeals and on April 19, 1991, this Court determined that the trial court erred in validating the bonds. The County and the Commission filed motions for rehearing, which were granted on June 4, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">Dykes and Tower argue that Art. VII, \u00a7 10(b) of the Virginia Constitution is applicable to the debt which will be incurred by issuing the bonds and, therefore, to be valid, the debt must either be approved by a vote of the people or qualify within the judicially-created \u201cspecial fund\u201d doctrine. They maintain that neither of these criteria is met in this instance and, therefore, the bonds are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>The threshold issue for consideration is whether Art. VII, \u00a7 10(b) is applicable to the debt in issue. That section states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-3\">No debt shall be contracted by or on behalf of any county or district thereof . . . except by authority conferred by the General Assembly by general law. The General Assembly shall not authorize any such debt . . . unless . . . provision be made for submission to the qualified voters of the county or district thereof ... for approval or rejection by a majority vote of the qualified voters voting in an election on the question of contracting such debt. Such approval shall be a prerequisite to contracting such debt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">1. Commission Debt</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Dykes argues that this section is applicable to bonds issued by the Commission because the Commission is a <em>\u201cdistrict </em>\u2018created\u2019 by one or more cities and counties . . . proposing to issue bonds \u2018by or on behalf of the County.\u201d This argument is unpersuasive. The use of the word \u201cdistrict\u201d in the name of the Commission is insufficient to extend application of the section to it. Furthermore, the Constitution speaks in terms of a \u201cdistrict thereof.\u201d The Commission was authorized and created by statute, and is comprised of the Cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, and Falls Church, and the Counties of Arlington and Loudoun, in addition to Fairfax. Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-342, <em>et seq.; </em>Acts 1964, c. 630. \u201cIt remain [ed] in a dormant state until brought into action by the local governing body.\u201d <em>Mumpower </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>176 Va. 426, 446, 11 S.E.2d 732, 739 (1940). The Commission clearly was not \u201ccreated\u201d by Fairfax County, and is not a \u201cdistrict thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The Commission is an independent political subdivision in the same manner as are housing authorities, water and sewer authorities, and industrial development authorities. The enabling legislation, like that of these other authorities vested with the power to incur bonded indebtedness, affirms that debt so incurred is that of the entity, not of the Commonwealth or of any other political subdivision. Code \u00a7 15.1-1358.2(a)(2). This statement is repeated in the bonds themselves, as well as in other documents constituting the financing proposal. We have repeatedly held that the debt incurred by legislatively created, independent political subdivisions, whatever their title, is not the debt of the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>wealth or of any other governmental unit, and we affirm that holding here. <em>Button </em>v. <em>Day, </em>204 Va. 270, 272-74, 130 S.E.2d 459, 461-62 (1963); <em>Farquhar </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, </em>196 Va. 54, 61, 82 S.E.2d 577, 582 (1954); <em>Mumpower, </em>176 Va. at 451, 11 S.E.2d at 742. Therefore, the debt which will be incurred by the Commission in issuing the bonds is not subject to the provisions of Art. VII, \u00a7 10(b) of the Virginia Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\">2. County Debt</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Dykes and Tower next argue that the financing proposal underlying the issuance of the bonds creates a debt incurred by the County which is subject to the constitutional limitation of Art. VII, \u00a7 10(b). The financing proposal consists of a contract between the County and the Commission which has been approved but not yet executed, and a proposed trust agreement providing for the transfer of the Commission\u2019s interest in the payments received from the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The contract provides that the Commission will issue the bonds and that the County in turn will fund the annual principal and interest payments and other listed expenses of the bond issue. The repayment funds will come from the County\u2019s general revenues, including the Business, Professional, and Occupational License Tax \u201cor any other revenue appropriated\u201d by the County. Under the terms of the contract, however, the County\u2019s obligation to make the payments to the Commission \u201cis subject to and contingent upon the annual appropriation by the County of moneys for such purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Neither Tower nor Dykes seriously argues that the terms of the financing documents impose a <em>legally </em>enforceable obligation on the County to appropriate the funds or to repay the bonds. Indeed, the contract, the trust agreement, and the bonds, \u00a7 4.05, \u00a7 7.01, and \u00b6 3, respectively, each specifically states that the County is not obligated to appropriate funds or levy taxes for the payment of the bonds and that the financing proposals do not constitute a pledge of the full faith and credit of the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Rather, Dykes and Tower invite us to define \u201cdebt\u201d as used in Art. VII, \u00a7 10(b) as something other than a legally enforceable obligation to pay. Dykes says constitutional debt exists because the financing proposal creates obligations which the \u201cCounty cannot avoid.\u201d Tower argues that \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d financing constitutes a pledge of the County\u2019s full faith and credit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>thereby establishing constitutional debt. Both rely on factors such as the understandings and expectations of bondholders, county officials, and bond rating agencies as creating obligations on the County. While these indicia may be significant in other contexts, such as whether the financing scheme is good or wise policy, or in determination of the investment grade or credit worthiness of the bonds, here we are only concerned with the limited question whether these indicia, or any other, establish a \u201cdebt\u201d of the County subject to Art. VII, \u00a7 10(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">We have described the attributes of \u201cdebt\u201d for constitutional purposes in various ways. \u201c[I]f the political entity is made generally liable, then an indebtedness is created within the debt limitations of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Terry </em>v. Mazur, 234 Va. 442, 450, 362 S.E.2d 904, 909 (1987) (quoting <em>Farquhar, </em>196 Va. at 61, 82 S.E.2d at 582). Obligations which \u201care not secured by the general credit of the State or the issuing agency\u201d do not constitute a debt within the constitutional limitation. <em>Button, </em>204 Va. at 272, 130 S.E.2d at 461. And we have held that, for purposes of Art. X, \u00a7 9,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">we have one criterion for determining the existence of unconstitutional debt: Is the full faith and credit of the Commonwealth pledged or committed? If not, no unconstitutional debt is created.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\"><em>Baliles </em>v. <em>Mazur, </em>224 Va. 462, 471, 297 S.E.2d 695, 699 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">We have specifically rejected the proposition that \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d financing in which the legislative body is not legally obligated to make the appropriation creates state debt for constitutional purposes, <em>Almond </em>v. <em>Gilmer, </em>188 Va. 822, 842-43, 51 S.E.2d 272, 280 (1949), and have reaffirmed that holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">[T]here was no constitutionally prohibited debt even though the \u201cexpectation\u201d of these continued appropriations was an essential ingredient in the negotiations .... This did not in any way contractually obligate the state to make these appropriations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-9\"><em>Baliles, </em>224 Va. at 469, 297 S.E.2d at 698-99 (referencing <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Day, </em>202 Va. 967, 121 S.E.2d 615 (1961)).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">These cases, whether involving debt incurred by the state or by a county, share a single rationale. No debt is created for constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>tional purposes if the state or county \u201cincurred no legal liability to underwrite the project.\u201d <em>Miller, Att. Gen. </em>v. <em>Watts, Treas., </em>215 Va. 836, 845, 214 S.E.2d 165, 171 (1975). The debt created must involve a \u201cbinding and direct commitment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 845, 214 S.E.2d at 172, a commitment which can be enforced against the maker. There must be a <em>legal </em>obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\">\u201cSubject to appropriation\u201d financing does not create constitutionally cognizable debt because it does not impose any enforceable duty or liability on the County. Expectations of bondholders, County officials, or bond rating agencies do not create County \u201cdebt\u201d any more than the expectations of the railway for continued appropriations by the state created state debt in <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Day, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Under the financing proposal at issue, neither the County nor its general revenues is liable for repayment of the debt incurred by the bond issue. In the absence of a legal obligation, the County has not incurred a debt cognizable under Art. VII, \u00a7 10(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">In summary, we hold that Art. VII, \u00a7 10(b) is not applicable here because no constitutional debt was incurred by the County, and the debt of the Commission is not subject to that constitutional provision. In light of this holding, it is unnecessary to consider application of the special fund doctrine. We have also considered Dykes\u2019s other arguments and find them without merit.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Record Nos. 901033 and 901037 - <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">JUSTICE WHITING, with whom JUSTICE STEPHENSON and SENIOR JUSTICE POFF join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">A rehearing of this case has produced no arguments which were not made and considered when a majority of this Court decided that the proposed bond issue was invalid.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> No matter how the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>new majority phrases it, the present decision is simply an approval of an end run around the constitutional requirement of voter approval before a county can be saddled with long-term indebtedness. Accordingly, for the reasons expressed in the former majority opinion and in the dissent now filed by Justice Stephenson, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">JUSTICE STEPHENSON, with whom JUSTICE WHITING and SENIOR JUSTICE POFF join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">I join Justice Whiting\u2019s dissent. I write separately, however, to express additional reasons to support my position.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Never before has this Court validated a bond issue like the one in question. I find the scheme employed by the County to be a shocking, patent attempt to circumvent and nullify the requirement of voter approval contained in \u00a7 10(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">By the proposed contract with the Commission, the County would agree to make annual payments sufficient to pay the debt service on the bonds. The funds for these payments are derived solely from, and are contingent upon, annual appropriations from the County\u2019s general revenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The County contends, and the majority holds, that \u201cno constitutional debt was incurred by the County\u201d because the payments are contingent upon the annual appropriations. Although the County states that the bondholders can expect it to make continuous, annual appropriations, it relies upon its right and power not to do so, i.e., to default without fault, as making the scheme constitutional. We should not validate such a scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">More importantly, no government should employ such a scheme. Indeed, \u201cgovernment is, or ought to be, instituted for the common benefit, protection, and security of the people,\u201d Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 3, and the preservation of a free government requires \u201ca firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue,\u201d Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 15. These quotations are not merely abstract terms; they are found in the Bill of Rights and have been part of our basic law since the Commonwealth was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Is anyone so naive that they truly believe that the County, in reality, is not compelled to make annual appropriations until the bonds are retired? What are some of the consequences if the County ceases to make the appropriations? Obviously, the bondholders would have no recourse, and their bonds would be worthless. Quite obviously, also, the County\u2019s credit would be seriously impaired, if not destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\">The \u00a7 10(b) requirement of voter approval of long-term county debt has existed for more than six decades. The requirement was not deleted when our Constitution was revised in 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">More recently, the General Assembly proposed an amendment to \u00a7 10 that would have allowed counties to issue bonds, without voter approval, \u201cfor transportation purposes, the principal and interest on which [would have been] payable exclusively from the pledge of the revenues and receipts of any local taxes . . . .\u201d Acts 1989, c. 670; Acts 1990, cc. 736, 881. On November 6, 1990, however, this proposal was rejected overwhelmingly by the Commonwealth\u2019s voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Today, the majority, in effect, has sanctioned what the voters rejected. Consequently, by employing the approved scheme, counties now are at liberty to create bond indebtedness, payable from their general revenues, without submitting the matter to their voters. For all practical purposes, the \u00a7 10(b) debt proscription has been nullified by judicial fiat.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-9\"> Tower\u2019s other assignments of error are not separately addressed. His arguments relating to maladministration by the County in violation of the Virginia Constitution parallel those of Dykes and those arguments, like Dykes\u2019s, are found to be without merit. Tower waived his remaining assignments of error at oral argument on rehearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b403-10\"> Amicus Curiae have filed briefs on rehearing asking, <em>inter alia, </em>that the original decision be made prospective only.
