Grier Radcliff </em>and <em>T.oadvin &amp; Bell </em>on the briefs), for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-6\">We contend that there is a distinction between a charitable use or <em>public </em>trust, as it' is sometimes called, and a private or ordinary trust for the benefit of specific individuals, and that the rules relating to <em>uncertainty and perpetuity </em>are not applied alike to both classes of trusts, in that, ist. The rule against perpetuities has no application to charitable trusts. 2nd. The strict rule of definiteness required in private trusts is not the rule of measurement required for ascertaining the beneficiaries of a public trust. We do not contend for the doctrine of <em>cy pres, </em>as the .doctrine of the States of the country in any enlarged sense, though some of the States seem to be more liberal than 'others in applying the rule of uncertainty. And we submit that since the year 1884, beginning with the case of <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>Mayor, &amp;c., of Balto., </em>62 Md. 275-292, and continuing through <em>Eutaw Place Bapt. Church </em>v. <em>Shiveley, </em>67 Md. 493; <em>Halsey </em>v. <em>P. E. Ch., </em>75 Md. 275; <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Little Strs., </em>79 Md. 434; <em>Reilly </em>v. <em>Union Prot. Inf., </em>87 Md. 664, and the late case of <em>Pratt et al. </em>v. <em>Trustees Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital, </em>88 Md. 610, our own Court of Appeals has .shown a commendable spirit of liberality in sustaining wills containing charitable bequests. Now we submit that there is such a thing as a charitable use <em>independent </em>of 43 <em>Elizabeth, </em>and \u2022that a Court of Chancery has inherent jurisdiction to enforce the trust; that the report of the Record Commission in England and all the later cases sustain this position. It has been repeatedly said that the statute of 43 <em>Elizabeth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>created no new law, but only a new and ancillary jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-5\">In the case before the Court we have : 1st. Trustees capable of holding the estate. 2nd. Every beneficiary incorporated and capable of taking the equitable use.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-7\">The rule against perpetuities is \u201c one of the land-marks of the lawbut it must be admitted that its application has been productive of much confusion and uncertainty, and nowhere more than in Maryland, since the <em>Barnum Case, </em>26 Md. 119. In the very able notes to that case in <em>Per-kin's Edition, the </em>learned annotator declares that the \u201cstatement of the rule in this form is not supported by authority or principle.\u201d We beg to refer to the notes as a very succinct and able analysis of the Maryland cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-8\">The Court below says : \u201cIf this trust requires in its execution a longer time than that prescribed by the rule against perpetuties, which renders the property devised to the trustees inalienable during that time, then the law denounces the devise in trust as a perpetuity and declares it void.\u201d If we clearly apprehend the authorities in Maryland, in applying this rule to the trust-estates, the estate which the Court refers to is not the <em>legal estate </em>in the trustees, but the equitable estate in the <em>cestui que trust. </em>The policy of the law being to promote a speedy or early vesting of the estate, it was not allowable for a testator or grantor to circumvent the law by a gift to his descendants through the medium of a trust. <em>In re Stickney's Will, </em>83 Md. 83, the learned Judge below rested his decision on the <em>Barnum's case, 26 </em>Md. 119, and yet the Court of Appeals made no reference thereto in rendering its decision. These cases, with the notes to <em>Barnum\u2019s case, </em>will illustrate the confusion into which able counsel and judges have been thrown by the application of the principle in that case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-9\">It is plain'that the trustees have a vested interest, but the crucial question is not what is their interest or estate, but what are the conditions or limitations that make the equitable interests void. It begs the whole question to say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>\u201c there is no power of sale given to the trustees ; \u201d that \u201cthe trust is of indefinite duration and that \u201c no period is fixed when the trust shall terminate.\u201d These assumptions ignore the real question ; where is the limitation that renders the vesting of the equitable estate too remote and void. Lewis speaks of it as \u201ca <em>future </em>limitation, etc., which is not to vest until after the period.\u201d <em>Lewis on Perpetuities, </em>164. He defines it as follows: \u201c A perpetuity may be defined to be a future limitation restraining the owner of the estate from aliening the fee-simple of the property, discharged of such future use or estate before the event is determined or period is arrived, when such future use or estate is to arise. If that event or period be within the time prescribed by law it is not a perpetuity.\u201d <em>Lewis on Perpetuities, </em>689.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-5\">If we were to treat this as a devise directly to religious corporations it would not violate the perpetuity rule, however obnoxious it might be to the mortmain feature of the Constitution. No advantage can be taken of this until an opportunity is had to obtain the sanction of the Legislature. <em>England </em>v. <em>Vestry, etc., </em>53 Md. <em>466; Church Extension </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>56 Md. 389. In <em>Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, </em>vol. 18, p. 362, under the caption \u201c Charitable Trusts \u201d it is said: \u201cThe rule has to do with the time of vesting of an estate and in no wise affects its continuance after it has once vested. A striking characteristic of charitable trusts is that they continue forever. They are perpetuities, using the word in its natural sense. \u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-7\">In <em>Perrin </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>24 Howard, 465, there was an inhibition of sale, but the Court ruled that it \u201cmade no perpetuity in the sense forbidden by law and equity in cases of charitable trusts.\u201d We venture to say there is no case in Maryland where the rule has been applied to charitable trusts. It is a misapplication of the case of <em>Attorney-Genl. </em>v. <em>Dashiell, </em>6 H. &amp; J. 1, to speak of it as so deciding. The decisions in the leading cases of <em>Attorney-General </em>v. <em>Dashiell </em>are based on two reasons : 1st. Because it was for \u201c the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>benefit of the poor children, etc.,\u201d who were too uncertain ; and 2nd. Because being for their successors, \u201c who not being a body corporate were incapable of taking in succession.\u201d The first were too \u201c indefinite and vague,\u201d and the latter had no legal being. If the beneficiaries had been incorporated, there is a clear inference that the bequest would not have been void as they could have taken both immediately and in succession.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-4\"><em>John Prentiss Poe </em>and <em>Robert P. Graham, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-5\">The entire fifth clause of the will is void because it creates a trust to which there is no limit of time. No power of sale or investment is given to the trustees, nor is the trust to terminate upon the death of the last survivor of the three named trustees ; but by the seventh item of the will the testatrix provides that in the event of death or refusal to serve of any or all of the trustees, the Circuit Court for Wicomico County shall appoint another trustee in the place of the one or more so dying or refusing to serve. The intention of the testatrix is thus made plain that this trust shall continue forever. There is no difficulty, therefore, as to the construction of the will; it plainly creates an indefinite trust, and such was the actual intent of the testatrix. Hence the rule against perpetuities palpably applies to such case and absolutely avoids the trust and the devise. The Maryland cases upon the subject are too clear to admit of doubt. The later cases of <em>Collins </em>v. Foley,63 Md. 162 \u2014 3; <em>Albert </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>68 Md. 352; <em>Dulany </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>72 Md. 76 \u2014 77; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Gregg, </em>76 Md. 169, reaffirm the principle so clearly stated in <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>Barnum, </em>26 Md. 171; <em>Deford </em>v. <em>Deford, </em>36 Md. 168, and <em>Goldsborough </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>41 Md. 501.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-6\">In the present case the estate is devised to the trustees, and they are charged with the duty of renting the property and collecting the rent and paying it over for a period absolutely without limit. No power is given to them to put an end to the trust, and if the intention of the testatrix <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>can be carried out, the trust must continue forever. No life in being here enters into the measure of time, but in such cases the rule is well settled that the time is limited to twenty-one years. The authorities on this point are perfectly clear. Thus, in <em>Lewis on </em>Perpetuities, chapter 14, section 6: \u201c It is to be observed that whenever lives in being do not form part of the time of suspension or postponement, the only period allowable under the rule against perpetuities is twenty-one years absolutely.\u201d So in <em>Jarman on </em>Wills, page (247), 216: <em>\u201c </em>Where the vesting of a gift to unborn persons is postponed for a fixed term exceeding twenty-one years, the gift is unquestionably void, although not preceded by a life. <em>For the fact that the testator not having availed himself of the allowance of a life does not enable him to take a longer term of years.\u201d Palmer </em>v. <em>Halford, </em>4 Russ. 403 \u2014 407: The testator left the property to- trustees to divide among the children of his son who should be living at the end of the twenty-eight years from the testator\u2019s death. No lives in the measure. The Court held that the devise was void for remoteness and the gift over, void. O.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-5\"><em>Speakman </em>v. <em>Speakman, </em>8 Hare, 180: Devise for support of testator\u2019s children for. fifty years, then to be divided. No measure of lives at all; simply fifty years. Devise held void as transgressing the rule against perpetuities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-6\"><em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>53 Me. 272: Devise of forty thousand dollars to be kept invested for twenty-five years after testator\u2019s death. The Court say: \u201c Whenever lives in being do not form part of the time of suspension or postponement, the only period under the rule against perpetuities is twenty-one years absolutely.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-7\">To the same effect is the case of the <em>Commissioners of Donation </em>v. <em>DeClifford, </em>1 Drury and Warren, 254, where the Court say: That \u201climitations over to a charity do not differ from any other, but to be effective must be confined within the usual period.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-8\">Decisions may perhaps be cited from the Courts of some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>of our sister States indicating that in such States the trust here under examination might be maintained, but it is a sufficient answer to all such decisions to say that they are founded upon a public policy with reference to religious and charitable uses which does not prevail in Maryland.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b165-4\">Fowler, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AKG\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The question presented by these appeals arises on the construction of the will of the late Willie F. Hooper, of Wicomico County. Mrs. Margaret A. Humphreys, by her husband, filed a bill in'the Circuit Court for that county in which she alleged that the third, fourth and fifth clauses of her sister\u2019s will are void. The defendants were duly summoned and answered. The case was heard by the Court below on the bill, answers and testimony, and after argument a decree was passed declaring that the third and fourth clauses are valid, so far as they relate to the provision therein respectively in favor of the preacher who may be from time to time in charge of said churches respectively; but void so far as the same made provisions for the benevolent boards and the keeping in good condition of the \u201c Hooper Burial Lot.\u201d The decree further declared that the fifth paragraph of the will is void, and that title to the house and lot therein devised to trustees in trust, to rent the same and pay the net rent as therein directed, vested in the plaintiff as sole heir and residuary devisee upon the death of the testatrix. From this decree the trustees named by the testatrix in the fifth item of her will have appealed; and several of the beneficiaries of the trust have also appealed ; but both appeals present the same questions. The appellants made no objection in this Court to that portion of the decree which relates to the third and fourth paragraphs ; hence the sole question left for our consideration relates to the validity of the devise contained in the fifth paragraph of the will. It is as follows : \u201c I give, devise and bequeath <em>my </em>house and lot * * * to F. Marion Slemons, Thomas H. Williams and E. Stanley Toadvin <em>in trust, </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>hold the said property, and to rent out the same, and collect the incomes and rents therefrom. \u201d The testatrix directs her trustees, after the payment of her debts and funeral expenses, to pay the net rent from year to year to a number of incorporated bodies and boards for charitable purposes in certain proportions designated by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The contention of the appellee, and this contention was sustained by the Court below, is that the devise in the fifth paragraph is void because it creates a trust to which there is no limit of time. Upon an examination of the will itself we not only fail to find an express limitation to the duration of the trust, but the testatrix makes express provision for its indefinite continuance in the seventh paragraph of her will by providing for the appointment of trustees to succeed those she had named in case of the death, resignation or refusal of the latter to serve. We think there can be no doubt as to the intention of the testatrix. She intended by the creation of this <em>trust </em>to make a perpetual provision for the objects of her bounty. Can we, under the well and long-established law of this State, effectuate that intention ? We certainly cannot if we adhere to the well-considered decisions of this Court from the case of <em>Barnum v. </em>Barnum, 26 Md. 119, down to the present time. In the case just cited it is said that \u201cThe first and very important question which arises on this statement of the contents of the will * * * is whether the period described in the will, through which the leasing by the trustees is to run, transgresses the rule against perpetuities. \u2019 \u2019 It was held that the period of leasing so designated by the testator did plainly violate the rule, and in disposing of the question this Court said : \u201c If an estate be so limited as by possibility to extend beyond a life or lives in being at the time of its commencement, and twenty-one years and fraction of a year (* * *) after-wards, during which time the property would be withdrawn from the market, or the <em>power over the fee suspended, </em>it is a perpetuity. * * * * The question whether an estate is a perpetuity, generally arises in cases in which a future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>contingent estate or executory devise is limited upon a fee, and if the contingency upon which the executory estate is to vest, is not necessarily to happen within the time fixed by the rule as the legal boundary, then the precedent estate or estates are denominated a perpetuity, and the executory estate or devise fails for want of a legal estate to support it. * * * The object of the rule is to prevent the tying up of property, real or personal, and rendering it inalienable longer than the period designated by it. For that time the power over the <em>inheritance </em>or <em>absolute interest </em>of property may be suspended, but no longer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u201c In the case now under consideration no question is presented as to the future vesting of an executory estate in order to determine the validity of the preceding one, but simply whether <em>the trusts of the will </em>require in their execution a longer period than that prescribed by the rule against perpetuities, and therefore render <em>the property devised to the trustees inalienable during that time. If so, the law denounces the devise in trust as a perpetuity </em>and declares it void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">In <em>Deford </em>v. <em>Deford, </em>36 Md. 178, (C. J. Bartol being the only Judge who sat in that case and also in <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>Barnum), </em>Miller, J., in delivering the opinion of the Court said, referring to <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>Barnum: </em>\u201c All the reasoning in that case applies here, and we regard it as binding and conclusive authority which must, notwithstanding the very able argument of counsel to the contrary, control our judgment in the present case. The Courts in prescribing and settling the rule against perpetuities have founded it in true wisdom. They have thereby limited the indulgence of the natural inclinations of men to fix control over their property after death * * * by a careful consideration and regard for those larger principles of public policy which are essential to the welfare of communities and States. \u201d \u201c The decision in <em>Barnum\u2019s case\u2019,\u2019 </em>continued the Court, \u201c is a fair and just application of the rule.\u201d And <em>Perry on Trusts, </em>sections 382 and 383, is cited where it is said : \u201cA per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>petuity will no more be tolerated when it is covered by a trust than when it displays itself undisguised in the settlement of a legal estate.\u201d In <em>Goldsborough </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>41 Md. 501, it is said, that \u201c the rule against perpetuities is one of the established landmarks of the law ; \u201d and the rule as applied to trusts in <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>Barnum </em>and <em>Deford\u2019s case, supra, </em>is approved and reaffirmed. 'We quote from <em>Deford\u2019s case, </em>the following language which is peculiarly appropriate to the case now before us: \u201c Power is given to the trustee to appoint some one to succeed her in the trust after her death, and this of itself would render possible the continuance of the trust far beyond the prescribed limit. But, besides this, if the trust were valid, and the testator\u2019s intention could be carried into effect, a Court of Equity would be bound to supply a trustee to execute the trust * * * to remote generations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">It was suggested that a power to raise money out of rents and profits includes a power to sell and mortgage for the purposes of the trust, and that the trustees under Miss Hooper\u2019s will being required to pay taxes and debts, they <em>may </em>be required to sell the trust property \u2014 but, whether this be so or not, we will not stop to enquire, for even if the testatrix had given power to her trustees to sell the trust property the difficulty would not have been removed. In <em>Deford\u2019s case, </em>it is said: \u201cThe fact that the testator, in another clause of his will, empowers his trustees to change the investments and reinvest as often as may be deemed proper, by <em>making sales </em>or otherwise, does not change the nature of the trust, which <em>may </em>extend beyond the time limited, and does not therefore extricate the case from the operation of the rule; the <em>possibility </em>of such continuance the law regards as decisive in determining the question of perpetuity or not.\u201d The rule of perpetuities as applied to trusts in- <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>Barnum </em>has been approved also in <em>Stannard </em>v. <em>Barnum, </em>51 Md. 449; <em>Heald </em>v. <em>Heald, </em>56 Md. 309; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>63 Md. 162; <em>Albert </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>68 Md. 372; <em>Dulaney </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>72 Md. 78; and <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Gregg, </em>76 Md. 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>But the contention, on the part of the appellants, is that this settled rule, this \u201c landmark of the law,\u201d has no application to charitable trusts, and counsel ventured to assert that there is no case in Maryland in which it has been so applied. There are, however, at least two cases where the rule has been directly applied to such trusts. In the old and leading and very familiar case of <em>Dashiell </em>v. <em>The Attorney-General, </em>5 H. &amp; J. 392, the devise was for \u201cpoor children belonging to the congregation of St. Peter\u2019s Church, &amp;c.\u201d The devise was held void because the trust was indefinite and because it created a perpetuity. The decision just cited was so construed in the case of <em>Needles </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>33 Md. 618, where the devise for a charitable purpose was also held to be void because it was too vague as well as because it was a perpetuity. But ever since the case of <em>Dashiell and The Attorney-General </em>it has been held in Maryland that the Statute of 43 <em>Eliz. </em>has never been in force in this State, and therefore there is no distinction here, as in many other States and in England, between a bequest to charitable uses and other objects. <em>Dashiell </em>v. <em>Attorney-General, supra ; The Provost, etc., </em>v. <em>Abercrombie, </em>46 Md. 173; <em>Yingling </em>v. <em>Miller et al., </em>77 Md. 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Hence it will be seen that in spite of the criticism of \u201c the learned annotator \u201d whose notes to <em>Barnum v. Barnum </em>are published in <em>Perkins' Edition, </em>26 Md. 119, and were so much relied on at the hearing, we feel constrained to adhere to the law as announced in that case. It is apparent, however, that this course must tend to benefit rather than injure the prospects of charitable trusts in this State in the future, because testators like all others will be required to know and act upon' the well-settled law of the State, and they will therefore give <em>directly </em>and absolutely to charitable trusts what they have to give for such purposes, and they will not appear to give freely with one hand while they hold on to their gifts with the other, and by means of trustees attempt to control property which they have parted with. In the recent case of <em>Pratt's Will, </em>88 Md. 615, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>evident that the testator was well advised by counsel, and, as we held, avoided the error of creating a trust. He gave directly to the corporation itself. In the case just cited, in this Court\u2019s opinion, recently delivered by the present Chief Judge, it was shown very clearly by reason and authority that no trust was or was intended to be created.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AVK\">(Decided April 6th, 1900.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">But if the contention of the appellant be correct, such a course was altogether unnecessary, for, as suggested by counsel for appellee, if the perpetuity rule does not apply to devises and bequests to religious and charitable uses, this Court, in the case of Mr. Pratt\u2019s will, could have decided the question very easily by holding that whether there was a trust or not was immaterial, because if there was no trust the rule confessedly did not apply, and if there was a trust it did not apply because the Revise was in favor of a charitable institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">It follows from what we have said that we entirely agree with the view taken of this case by the learned Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
