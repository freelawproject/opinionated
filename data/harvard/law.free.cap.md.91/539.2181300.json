Hart's Execzztoi's, </em>4 Wheat. 1, decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1819. In this case the Court decided that the jurisdiction of chancery to enforce trusts for charitable uses, when the persons to be benefited were not designated with that certainty which is necessary to support a private trust, which jurisdiction had long been exercised in Plngland, was dependent upon the Statute of Elizabeth, commonly known as the statute of charitable uses; and that this statute was not in force in Virginia (from which State the case arose), and that hence the beneficiaries of such a trust must be named or designated with the same certainty that is requisite in a private trust, in order that the trust may be enforceable, or a gift for such purpose be valid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>This principle was followed in this country by nearly all the Courts in which the question arose, though there was some dissent, until the celebrated <em>Girard will case (Vidal </em>v. <em>Girard's Ex., </em>2 Howard, 127), was-decided in 1844. In this case, which arose from Pennsylvania, the question was more thoroughly discussed and considered, and it was shown, and so decided by the Court, that the equitable jurisdiction'to enforce trusts of the nature under consideration was not dependent upon the Statute of Elizabeth, but had in fact been exercised in many cases before that statute. In the words of the Supreme Court in <em>Ould </em>v. <em>Wash. Hospital, </em>95 U. S. 303, \u201c the former idea was exploded \u201d (i. <em>e., </em>by the <em>Girard will case), </em>\u201c and has since nearly disappeared from the jurisprudence of this country. On reading the Statute (of Eliz.) one cannot but feel surprised,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-5\">Some of the States, however, refused to follow <em>Vidal </em>v. <em>Girard's Ex., </em>and reverse the prior decisions. Thus, in 1879 the U.'S. Supreme Court reaffirmed <em>Baptist Assoc. </em>v. <em>Hart </em>as the law of Virginia, saying: \u201c It is believed that such <em>(i. e., </em>the contrary doctrine) is the accepted rule in all of the States of the Union, except Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina. <em>Kain </em>v. <em>Gibboney, </em>101 U. S. 362.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-6\">After a long series of cases reaffirming the earlier decisions, the Virginia Supreme Court has lately reversed all its precedents and adopted the more liberal rule. <em>P. E. Soc. </em>v. <em>Churchman's Rep., </em>80 Va. 718. Reaffirmed in <em>Trustees </em>v. <em>Guthrie, </em>86 Va. 125. And North Carolina appears to be in line with the other States. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>63 N. Car. 537.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-7\">In the leading case of <em>Dashiell </em>v. <em>Atty.-Genl., </em>5 H. &amp; J. 392, and 6 H. &amp; J. 1, the Maryland Court of Appeals adopted the doctrine laid down in <em>Baptist Assoc. v. Harf's Ex.; </em>and these cases have been followed in a number of subsequent cases, which are doubtless cited on the brief for the next of kin. Simultaneously, however, with the growth of this principle in Maryland, a class of cases has been recognized in which the validity of gifts for charitable pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>poses does not depend upon the existence of definite <em>cestuis que </em>trustent, who could sue in equity to enforce the use declared for their benefit. This class of cases includes all gifts for charitable or religious purposes <em>to a corporation, </em>when the trusts expressed \u201c are within the scope of the corporate functions and work \u201d <em>(Eutaw Church </em>v. <em>Shively, </em>67 Md. 493), and the objects of the trusts are sufficiently defined to be enforceable. It is apparent that the property of any corporation is, in a general sense, a trust fund. It is dedicated to the corporate purposes, and any attempted misapplication of corporate property can be restrained by a Court of Equity upon the application of any member of the corporation, and sometimes upon the application of other parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-5\">There never was a corporation whose purposes were of so definite a character as to relate only to the benefit of one or more definite individuals. On the contrary, the purposes of all corporations, and especially of all eleemosynary corporations, are necessarily of an indefinite character, if we regard this (definite beneficiaries) as a test of definiteness. Thus, we have, for instance, in Baltimore City, the Association for the Improvement of the Condition of the Poor of Baltimore City, whose objects are described in its name. These objects are precisely such as, in the case of a number of gifts to individuals, have been held of so indefinite a character as to invalidate the gift, and yet there cannot possibly be any doubt but that all the property of this corporation (the Poor Association) is impressed with a \u201c trust \u201d of precisely this nature, that is to say, the corporation is formed to apply it to these very purposes, and there is ample jurisdiction in a Court of Equity to restrain any misappropriation to other than these purposes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b569-6\">It is evident, therefore, that a Court of Plquity has ample jurisdiction to enforce the proper application of funds held generally by a corporation, no matter of how \u201cindefinite\u201d a nature the corporate purposes may be. From the existence of this jurisdiction has been derived the validity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>gifts to a corporation to be applied to some one or more of its corporate purposes, or to be held in trust for some one or more of its corporate purposes. The same jurisdiction that suffices to restrain the misappropriation of general corporate funds is available to restrain the misappropriation of a specific fund, held by a corporation for some one or more of its corporate purposes, as distinguished from its general corporate purposes. It is further to be noted with respect to gifts of this character that, for the same reasons, the rule against perpetuities has no application, although the uses or purposes may be so expressed as to continue beyond the period fixed by that rule. See <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>M. &amp; C. C. of Baltimore, </em>62 Md. 291-297; <em>Crisp </em>v. <em>Crisp, </em>65 Md. 422; <em>Eutaw Place Church </em>v. <em>Shively, </em>67 Md. 495; <em>Peter </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>70 Md. 139; <em>Halsey </em>v. <em>Convention, </em>75 Md. 281; <em>Dom. &amp; For. Miss. Socy. </em>v. <em>Gaither, </em>62 Fed. Rep. 422; <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Little Sisters of the Poor, </em>79 Md. 434.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-5\">Now, if we apply the principles enunciated in these cases to that portion of the present legacy, which is now under consideration, it is clearly good. (1.) We have a corporate trustee, competent to take and hold the fund, (2) the purposes expressed are within the scope of its corporate functions and customary work ; and (3) the method of applying the fund is expressed with sufficient definiteness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b570-6\">In considering what uses and purposes are within the scope of the corporate functions of a church, or are an integral part of its work, we need not expect much assistance from its charter. The Code, in authorizing the incorporation of religious bodies (Art. 23, sec. 205, &amp;c.), does not, as in the case of other corporations, enumerate what the objects of such an organization shall be; it assumes a knowledge of the usual objects and methods of the various bodies which constitute the different branches of the Christian Church; and so likewise does the instrument of incorporation. Such knowledge is derived partly from the judicial notice of the beliefs and methods common to all churches, which the Court is entitled to take as a part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>the Christian religion <em>(Wharton on Evidence, </em>sec. 284), and from the evidence in the cause (as was done in the case of <em>Eutaw Church </em>v. <em>Shively, &amp;c.) </em>That the propagation of Christianity among the heathen by\u2018the instrumentality of, foreign missions is an important branch of the work of every Christian church, requires therefore no evidence to establish. Its importance as a branch of the work of the M. E. Church,, South, and of Trinity Church, abundantly appears from the testimony in the cause, especially from the book of church discipline. If then this work is within the scope of the legitimate functions of Trinity Church, the only question remaining is whether the testatrix has designated with sufficient certainty and definiteness the manner in which it shall be administered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-4\">In the case of <em>Church Extension Society </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>56 Md, 362, relied on by counsel for the next of kin, the testator devised the residue of his estate to an individual in trust to be sold, and out of the proceeds to pay a certain sum over to the Church Extension of the Methodist Episcopal Church (a corporation), to be used as a perpetual loan fund, to be used in aiding \u201c necessitous \u201d churches. The Court seems to have treated this as a gift to an individual for an indefinite purpose, regarded in which light it was void for lack of a. definite <em>cestui que trust. </em>The use or trust in question was,, however, in that case incident to a gift to a corporation, and the proper inquiry should have been whether or not the special purpose to which it was directed to be dedicated was. within the charter purposes of the corporation. In the-charter of the Church Extension Society its corporate purposes were expressed as follows: \u201c Section 4. That this, society (denominated the Church Extension Society of the-Methodist Episcopal Church) shall be organized for the purpose of assisting the several annual conferences of theM. E. Church to extend and establish the institution of Christianity throughout the United States and Territories by aiding, whenever necessary, to secure suitable houses of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>worship .and such other church property as may promote the general design.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-5\">If, therefore, in that case, the fund was dedicated to one of the charter purposes of the corporation, the case is in conflict with the other cases which we have cited, in which the purposes expressed were no more definite. If the uses .expressed were not within the charter purposes, then the case is not in conflict with these other cases, nor is it applicable to the present case. Moreover, the latter cases in which <em>Church Extension </em>v. <em>Smith </em>is cited, restrict the decision in that case to the sole ground that no one could define which churches were or are \u201c necessitous.\u201d Now there is no such uncertainty in the present case. On the contrary the directions are elaborately minute. The course the income is to take is precisely and accurately defined until it is finally lodged with the Women\u2019s Foreign Missionary Society, a corporation, as an unqualified gift for its general corporate purposes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-6\">This portion of the legacy in the present case is, moreover, sustainable upon other grounds. It is made for the benefit of a definite <em>cestui que trust, </em>the Women\u2019s Foreign \u25a0Missionary Society, for its general corporate purposes. \u2022Even, therefore, if we regard the purpose as not within the proper scope of the corporate purposes of Trinity Church, and reject the intermediate agencies which the testatrix has designated, the case would come within the general principle that equity will not permit a trust to fail for want of a trustee. <em>Perry on Trusts, </em>secs. 38, 45, 240, 248.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-7\">\u201c <em>As to five hundred dollars thereof, to be paid towards the support of the superammated preachers, their tvidows and orphans, of the Baltimore Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.\u201d </em>In the discipline of the M. E. Church, South, the \u201csuperannuated preachers\u201d constitute a distinct class. They are supported, not by the respective churches of which they have been pastors, which under the itinerant system used in the M. E. Church would be impracticable, but each conference is charged with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>support of its own superannuates. \u201c Baltimore Conference \u201d of the M. E. Church, South, is one of the fifty or more geographical divisions of the M. E. Church, South, and comprises the greater part of the State of Maryland and some adjacent territory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-5\">In opposition to the validity of this portion of the legacy, it is urged that the decision in <em>Church Extension </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>that a bequest of a sum to a corporation to be used as a loan fund, to be loaned out to necessitous M. E. Churches, was void for indefiniteness, is precisely analagous to the disposition directed in the present case. If we read the opinion in that case without considering the doctrines therein stated as having been greatly modified by the subsequent decisions cited above, it would indeed be difficult not only to reconcile the validity of the disposition now in question with that case, but to reconcile the validity of any of the numerous gifts which have since been upheld, with the decision in that case. But we are already confronted with the difficulty of either treating this case as overruled, or else distinguishing it from a gift to a corporation to establish a chair in an educational institution for teaching the mechanic arts <em>(Barnum </em>v. <em>M. &amp; C. Cl), </em>for the promotion of the worship of God according to the forms and ceremonies of the Presbyterian Church <em>(Crisp </em>v. <em>Crisp), </em>to be applied to the Sunday-school belonging to a church <em>(Eutaw Church </em>v. <em>Shively), </em>to constitute a perpetual fund for education <em>(Peter </em>v. <em>Carter), </em>to be held as a place for a church school for boys, with an endowment fund for the same purpose ; for the support of a rector and for repair of a chapel <em>(Halsey </em>v. <em>Convention), </em>to be applied to the maintenance of a parish school <em>(Hanson </em>v. <em>Little Sisters.) </em>And we must also give due effect to the language which the Court has used in the opinions filed in these later cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b573-6\">If, therefore, we are not to regard <em>Church Extension v. Smith </em>as overruled, we must distinguish it from these cases. In <em>Crisp </em>v. <em>Crisp </em>the distinction drawn is that as no one can define what a necessitous church is, the object specified was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>too vague and indefinite to be valid. But the present case no more resembles <em>Church Extension </em>v. <em>Smith </em>in this respect than any of the above. Superannuated preachers, that is preachers who have been relieved of their active work and retired by the church, constitute a perfectly definite class. Without doubt a census could be taken of the precise number of persons occupying this <em>status </em>in the bounds of Baltimore Conference, as well as of their widows and orphans. But who could take with any accuracy a census of the \u201c necessitous churches \u201d within the same limits ? What churches are not \u201c necessitous?\u201d The distinction can better be appreciated, perhaps, if we consider the bequest in the present case as having been made in favor of the \u201cnecessitous preachers \u201d within the same district. Then we would have a trust for the benefit of an unascertained and unascertainable class, and the authority of <em>Church Extension </em>v. <em>Smith </em>would be precisely in line.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b574-5\"><em>As to the bequest to be given to the infant class of the Sunday-school. </em>We have already considered the question whether to contribute to foreign missions, and to do so through the agency of the Women\u2019s Foreign Missionary Society is an integral part of the work of Trinity Church. The propriety of so doing through the agency of the Sunday-school is established, it is submitted, by the custom prevailing in the entire church, of organizing every Sunday-school, as far as practicable, into a missionary society; a custom justified by two considerations : first, that the missionary work of giving a Christian education to children in heathen countries is Essentially Sunday-school work; and secondly, that to teach the children belonging to the Sunday-school the habit of contributing to foreign missions is part of their Christian education. With respect to the charge of indefiniteness, it is based, it is submitted, upon an erroneous view of the rule as to vagueness which should govern in the case of gifts to corporations to be applied to some one of their corporate objects. In such cases the rule of defined <em>cestui que trust, </em>who could sue to enforce the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>carrying out of the uses, is supplanted by the sole test of purposes within the scope of the corporation, expressed with sufficient definiteness. It would be, of course, impossible that there should be in the present case a \u201c little girl \u201d who could sue to enforce the uses here expressed, but just as much was it impossible for any body of students or any member of the McDonogh faculty to sue the city of Baltimore to enforce the establishment and maintenance of the \u201cchair\u201d directed to be founded in the <em>Barnum will case. </em>In fact, the direction in the present cases resembles a bequest to establish a scholarship, as to the validity of which, under the cases in this State, there could be, it is submitted, no question.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b575-5\"><em>E. J. D. Cross </em>and <em>John Phelps, </em>for the Trustees of the Randolph-Macon College, E. B. Prettyman <em>et al., </em>trustees, and other appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-6\"><em>As to the legacies to the Randolph-Macon College and the Woman's College. </em>The first question which arises in construing these clauses is : Whether the gifts to the charitable corporations mentioned are given to them absolutely, or whether under the conditions presented the Court can find an implied trust for the purposes mentioned ? At the outset we see that the testatrix has not expressly created any trust or fiduciary relation in these clauses. Whether or not such was her intention is the first consideration. In order to defeat the operation of these clauses by reason of uncertainty of object or other reason, it is incumbent upon the objector to establish the fact that the trusts exist and were contemplated by the testatrix. It has been seen that the testatrix was a person of no little knowledge of her own affairs, and she was aided by legal advice in drawing her will. If she had intended to create a trust it naturally suggests itself \u2014 would she not have expressed herself? In other parts of the will where she evidently intended to create trusts she expressed that intention in formal and appropriate terms. It will not be held that a will creates a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>trust unless it clearly appears that such was the intention of the testator. <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Sheppard, etc., Hospital, </em>88 Md. 624; <em>Meredith </em>v. <em>Hemage, </em>1 Sim. 542. The Court below upheld these two legacies, saying that even though they should be held to be trusts, yet even then the gifts would be valid upon the known rule that the trustee, being a corporation and capable of taking, the purpose declared in the will is. the furtherance in part of one of the specific purposes for which the corporation was chartered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-5\"><em>As to the devise of the land called Friendsbury to E. B. Prettyman et al., trustees. </em>This clause, as interpreted by the Court below, vitiates the gift upon the authority of <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Stouffer, </em>56 Md. 236, and <em>Rizer </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>58 Md. 117. The argument upon which this is founded, briefly, is : The trustees take a fee-simple upon trust to convey; they dispose, not of the fee, but a fee coupled with conditions subsequent ; upon failure of condition the gift cannot revert to the trustees, for they cease in that capacity upon transferring title; therefore, the trust is one to a definite trustee for a specific purpose and designated beneficiary, but beyond the control of a Court of Equity, hence, the trust fails.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b576-6\">We respectfully-submit that the learned Court erred in its interpretation of this clause. We think it unquestionable that by this clause the testator did devise an estate in fee of the character known as a fee upon limitation ; of which the trustees are the mere instruments or conduits of conveyance, transferring neither more nor less than they get; that a possibility of reverter remains in the heirs of the testatrix, and upon the use by the society of the property in violation of the condition the estate reverts to the heirs of the testatrix; that the expression \u201c so long as said society shall continue to use said property for said purpose \u201d is a valid and usual limitation upon the fee; that the provision <em>\u201c </em>without power to sell or alienate said land or any part thereof,\u201d should upon reason and authority be held a valid restraint as upon a charitable corporation, but that, if void, will merely be stricken out without affecting the gift or interfering with the intention of the testatrix.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>An estate in fee upon limitation is a species of estate upon\u2019 condition subsequent which, having vested, continues until the happening of a specified event upon which it reverts to the grantor and his heirs. It differs from an ordinary estate upon <em>condition </em>subsequent chiefly in that in the latter the grantor must do some overt act to take advantage of the broken condition, while in the former, the estate ends <em>ipso facto </em>upon the contingency specified, and vests by operation of law in the grantor and his heirs. 2 <em>Bla.

While it is a matter of interpretation whether the restriction is a condition or a limitation, the expression \u201cso long as, etc.,\u201d is one of the usual formulae for creating a limitation.\u201d 2 <em>Washb., Real Prop., </em>*458; <em>Tiedeman, Real Prop., </em>sec. 281.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b577-5\">A grant in trust for certain purposes, \u201c and to and for no-other use, intent or purpose whatever,\u201d is good, and a violation of the conditions, by putting the property to other uses, terminates the gift, and the estate reverts to the grantor\u2019s heirs. <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Stouffer, </em>56 Md. 236, 254; <em>Newbold </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>67 Md. 492; <em>Second Univ.

In these cases the conditions imposed by the grantor or devisor were all recognized by the Court of Appeals as valid conditions, upon breach of which the estate reverted to the grantor. And in all these cases, the reverter to the heirs of the grantor was not interrupted by the fact that the property had been given through trustees. In <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Baltimore, </em>4 Gill, 394, 405, the point was directly decided that the trustees, Dolan, etc., had no interest in the reversion upon breach of the condition, and had no standing in a Court of Equity to enforce the forfeiture, but the heirs alone could claim reversion. There was there an express reversion to the heirs, it is true, but the principle applies to all the cases cited. They all hold that the right of reversion, whether expressed or not, belongs always <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>alone to the grantor <em>imposing the condition, </em>or his heirs, who alone have' the right to forfeit the estate upon condition broken or re-enter upon the limitations of the estate. 2 <em>Washb., Real Prop., </em>secs. 14, 15; <em>Kelso </em>v. <em>Stigar, </em>75 Md. 389; 4 <em>Kent, Com. </em>127. And not even an Act of Legislature could so defeat the reversionary right of the grantor and his heirs, that the grantee could give a good title in breach of the condition. <em>Kelso </em>v. <em>Stigar, </em>75 Md. 376; <em>Second Univ. Soc. v. Dugan, </em>65 Md. 460. Indeed, it is suggested that upon failure of heirs the reversion would escheat to the estate, rather than to any intermediate grantor. <em>Kelso </em>v. <em>Stigar, </em>75 Md. 389; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Stouffer, </em>56 Md. 253. And this is consonant with the fundamental principles of the law of conditional estates, <em>i. e., </em>that the benefit of a condition in a grant can be reserved only for the grantor and his heirs, and not a stranger; nor can it be alienated or assigned, or pass by grant of the reversion at common law. 2 <em>Washb., Real Prop., </em>sec. 14, 15.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b578-5\">\u2022 The reservation need not be expressly reserved to the grantor and his heirs, (as in <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Baltimore, </em>4 Gill, 394); it is reserved in him as a matter of course. Indeed, the usual rule both at common law and in Maryland is that the reservation cannot be for a stranger. <em>Venable, Real Property, </em>107. But equity will enforce in favor of the beneficial reversioner when the condition is reserved in a trustee. <em>West </em>v. <em>Briscoe, 6 </em>H. &amp; J. 460; 2 <em>Washb., Real Property, </em>sec. 14, 15. It is a present vested right in the nature of a reversion, and it is not subject to the rule against the remote vesting of estates, <em>i. e., </em>rule against perpetuities. 2 <em>Washb., Real Prop., </em>sec. 26; see especially <em>First Univ.

It anticipates merely a <em>non-user </em>of the property by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>the society for certain purposes.

There is no doubt that a condition annexed to a gift to a charity, restraining absolutely the alienability of the estate, is a good one, and outside the ordinary rule, both in England and in the Federal and State Courts (except where forbidden by statute, as under the New York Code.) This, however, as seen by <em>Peter </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>70 Md. 139, does not, in fact, operate as an absolute bar to the alienation of the estate, if such would be beneficial, as, for instance, if the proceeds of a sale could be invested to better advantage. But the Court of Equity will nevertheless maintain the <em>fund perpetual </em>if so provided by the donor. The reason always given is that it is in the peculiar nature of a charity to be perpetual, and it is for the benefit of the charity that such a condition be imposed. The apparent violence which this exception does to the rule against alienation as a rule of public policy, is wholly nullified by the equally reasonable corollary, namely, that a Court of Equity, if it is shown to be advantageous for the interests of the charity, will direct a sale of the property, still maintaining the <em>pro</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number><em>ceeds </em>as a perpetual fund. <em>Peter </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>70 Md. 139; <em>Gray on Perpetuities, </em>sec. 589, etc.; <em>Lewis on Perpetuities, </em>684, 688; <em>Bisphams' Princ. of Eq., </em>page 201; <em>Duke on Charitable Uses, </em>80, 81, 361, 377; <em>Tiedeman on Real Property, </em>sec. 275; <em>Perin </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>24 How. 465, 495; <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Colt, </em>5 Wall. 119; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Habbersham, </em>3 Woods, 445; <em>Habbersham </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>(appeal) 107 U.

It is applicable only to valid trusts over which a Court of Equity has complete jurisdiction, and is applicable more especially to gifts which are not in trust at all, being founded in a wholly different principle. As when the beneficiaries of a charitable trust, and its objects are sufficiently certain, equity in Maryland has the same jurisdiction over them as over any other trust.' <em>Halsey </em>v. <em>Convention, </em>75 Md. 281. This was apparently-the view of this Court in the recent case of <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Baltimore Humane Impartial Society, etc., 91 </em>Md. 10, where the charitable gift was objected to on the ground of its being a perpetuity. The Court held that there being in that case no trust, there was <em>no perpetuity which the law condemns. </em>We are aware of the recent decision of this Court in <em>Missionary Society </em>v. <em>Humphreys et al., </em>91 Md. 131, but think that the present case is embraced in a plain distinction made there, as in the <em>Bennett case, </em>that there is no attempt to create here a charitable trust in perpetuity. Plere the trustees are merely a medium of conveyance, and the gift is to the corporation absolutely for its purposes, as in the <em>Pratt case. </em>(88 Md. 615.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b580-6\">This is not a charitable trust in the sense in which that term is used in the Maryland law; this is an absolute gift to a corporation within the scope of its objects, done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>through the conveyancing medium of trustees. The trustee\u2019s title is to <em>convey. </em>The societies\u2019 title is to use for <em>certain </em>purposes.

One of the main differences between a condition precedent and one subsequent is that when a condition precedent is invalid, illegal or impossible of performance the estate fails ; but when the condition is subsequent, the failure, illegality, impossibility or invalidity of the condition does not affect the validity of the gift, but leaves the gift free of the condition. In other words, the condition only falls to the ground, leaving the estate an absolute one. This principle is so fundamental as to require no argument. In the case cited, where the gift was to A \u201cso long as he shall <em>hold </em>and till the farm,\u201d the Court struck down the <em>condition </em>as void as it attempted restraint upon alienation, leaving the <em>gift </em>an absolute fee. <em>Stansbury </em>v. <em>Hubner, </em>73 Md. 228.

Her evident intent was that the society named as devisee should take the property and use it for a definite charitable purpose, and for that alone, and some obligation should be placed upon the society to insure its perpetual use of the property for such purposes. This is amply covered by the clause \u201cso long as said society shall continue to use said property for said purposes.\u201d This receives no greater nor less effect by the restraining clause withholding power of alienation. \u2022 It will, moreover, be noticed that the latter is not a condition, but a withholding of a power. This power, as has been seen, can, in spite of said clause, be exercised by the charitable devisee, if found bj' a Court of Equity to be advantageous for the purposes of the society, still maintaining the proceeds as a <em>perpetual </em>fund. <em>Peter </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>70 Md. 139.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b582-6\"><em>William A.

The charter of the claimant was granted by the State of Virginia by Acts of its Legislature, passed in 1830 and in 1870, for the establishment of a \u201c seminary of learning for the instruction of youth in the various branches of science and literature, the useful arts, agriculture and the learned and foreign languages.\u201d The Trustees of Randolph-Macon College conduct institutions at Ashland, Bedford City, Front Royal and Danville, Virginia, and this claimant also owns and conducts the Woman\u2019s College at Lynch-burg, which is unincorporated and was opened in 1893. The trustees are not specifically interested in mission work. The object of the Woman\u2019s College is educational, and its charges to full-pay students amount to as much as $250 per annum, but the trustees aid young women whom they consider to be deserving and promising by free scholarships and loans, and the trustees would consider a young woman preparing herself for foreign missionary work particularly deserving and promising, so far as the church work was concerned; and a young woman expecting to enter upon missionary work would be <em>ipso facto </em>free from any charges for tuition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-5\">In view of the facts it cannot be maintained that the testatrix intended to give the bequests absolutely to the claimant, even though it should be held that she did intend' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>the bequests for the Woman\u2019s College and not for the benefit of certain classes of <em>worthy girls and deserving and promising young women.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-5\">In many cases this Court has determined that by words, in some instances literally, and in others substantially identical, trusts were constituted. <em>Church Exten.

We contend that there was, therefore, as to both bequests an express and imperative trust, couched in language which the cases recognize as creating such a trust. We contend that the best evidence of that trust may be found in the language itself. In this case there can be no uncertainty as\u2019 to the intention to create a trust, but there is uncertainty in the objects (to wit, indefinite classes of one or more worthy girls and deserving and promising young women) to be benefited by that trust, and that uncertainty, under the authorities already cited, avoids both bequests, as a Court of Equity would be powerless to enforce them. <em>Bap.

This is the only conveyance which she gave the trustees the authority to make, and the question arises, whether, if by reason of the policy of the law, they cannot make a conveyance of this restricted nature, they have any authority to convey at all, and thus violate her declared purpose. If a power is given only to convey an estate, which, upon grounds o'f public policy, the law will not recognize, can the trustee convey at all, and, especially, can they convey an estate which the testatrix did not provide for or authorize; or, to present the actual state of the present case more closely, can they convey an estate which the testatrix has shown an unwillingness to give ? The general principle is, that every power the direct object of which is to create a perpetuity is void. <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>Barnum, </em>26 Md. 172; <em>Humphrey\u2019s case, ante, </em>p. 131. Let us suppose that the testatrix had in terms stated that if the law would recognize the validity of the restrictions which she imposed, then the trustees should convey; otherwise, they should make no conveyance. It is quite certain that under such conditions it would have been decided by the Courts that there was no power to convey at all, because she had no intention to make the gift unless she was able to accompany it with the restrictions, and the Courts would not make a will for her by requiring a conveyance against the scheme which she had devised. If the scheme was affected by objections upon grounds of public policy it would fail, and another could not be substituted for it. As a matter of fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Miss Baker could not have evinced more clearly than she has done, her intention that no power was given to convey except in the manner stated by her, not even if she had expressed her intention in the form suggested. She never intended to give the property if the society could alienate, or could make use of it for the erection of buildings or for uses other than those which she had described. Should the restraint on alienation be rejected as repugnant, and the estate held to be absolute, the result would be to vest in the claimant a' title which it was not the purpose of the testatrix to give, and to enable it, while taking under the will, to hold against it, and thus to frustrate the very design, and to defeat every motive and to repudiate every considera-' tion upon which that title in its final analysis must depend. <em>Corp.

The record shows that the testatrix died in March, 1899, leaving a considerable estate and a will with two codicils, in which she made a number of bequests and devises, many of which are free from doubt and have \u25a0created no difficulty in giving effect thereto in the course of .administration of the estate. Some of them, however, have given rise to doubts as to their proper construction and legal effect, and this case was instituted by the executors of the will for the purpose of having these construed and. to .have their trust administered under the direction of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The provisions of the will and codicils, which were adjudicated below, and about which question is made in this Court, read as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">IN THE ORIGINAL WILL :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\"><em>\u201cItem 18. </em>I give and bequeath to the Woman\u2019s College, located at the city of Lynchburg, in the State of Virginia, the sum of eight hundred dollars, for the education of one or more worthy girls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYA\"><em>\u201cItem 19. </em>I give and bequeath to George B.

Baker, in trust, to be applied by him under the provisions of the nineteenth item of my said will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">There can be but little difficulty in disposing of the questions of construction here arising, as respects some of the clauses which have been recited. By the provisions contained in the 19th item of the original will, and in the first codicil, together with the residuary disposition, in the 15th item of the second codicil, the testatrix manifestly intended to create a trust, and not to give the beneficial interest in the property, therein intended to be bequeathed to George B. Baker, the person named in these clauses. The beneficiaries of the trust are to be ascertained and pointed out by a memorandum to be left by the testatrix or at the discretion of the trustee, where, or in so far as the memorandum fails to dispose of the funds intended to be bequeathed. This brings these provisions directly within the effect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>decision of this Court, in regard to a similar testamentary-disposition, in the case of <em>Saylor </em>v. <em>Plaine, </em>31 Md.\" 158. In that case the trust was sought to be supported by the actual production of a memorandum left by the testator indicating the purposes to which the subject of the bequest was to be applied. Here the proof shows there was no memorandum in existence to direct the application of the property intended to be dedicated to the trust, nor are any beneficiaries thereof defined or ascertained in any way other than in the way of verbal suggestions to her trustee to guide his discretion; making the attempted disposition as contained in the items of the will and codicil here being considered more plainly ineffectual than was the case in the decision of this Court just referred to. These provisions we regard as too obviously void to require further allusion to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">On the other hand, the provision in the 10th item of the second codicil which contains the bequest to Trinity Church of thirty-five hundred dollars, which gives to the said church two thousand dollars of the said bequest for \u201cthe support of the pastor of said church,\u201d is plainly valid upon the authority of the cases of England, <em>Extr., </em>v. <em>Vestry of Prince George's Par. et al., </em>53 Md. 466, and <em>Halsey et al. </em>v. <em>The Convention of the Prot. Epis. Church et al., </em>75 Md. 275, in which bequests making substantially the same provision as that now being considered, and where the bequests were in terms and language very similar, were upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The proof shows that the church to which the bequest was made is an incorporated body engaged in religious work, and having a pastor as the principal directing agency in this work and an important factor in promoting the object of its corporate existence. Gifts in aid of so important a function of such an incorporated religious body fall within the scope and effect of other decisions of this Court, even if they were not directly supported by those just referred to. Of these the case of <em>Eutaw Place Baptist Church </em>v. <em>Shively, </em>67 Md. 493, is an example. This part of the bequest in the 10th item of the second codicil must, therefore, be held valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Before leaving this loth item we may as well examine the other provisions therein contained which are here brought in question. We may say here that as no point has been made as to the slight misnomer of this corporation in the bequest made to it, we need not advert to the misnomer as a matter for our consideration, although it was referred to in the brief of counsel who appeared on behalf of Trinity Church, further than to say that it sufficiently appears from the evidence that the corporation that is making the claim for the bequest contained in this item io is identical with the legatee therein named. Next, after the direction in this item io, that two thousand dollars of the thirty-five hundred dollars thereby bequeathed shall be appropriated to the support of the pastor of the church, occurs, as has been seen, the direction that six hundred dollars thereof shall be \u201cpaid to the Trinity Auxiliary of the Women\u2019s Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, to be included in the receipts of the said society and remitted to the Treasurer of the Baltimore Conference Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, for the general fund, including five dollars of the same for the conference contingent fund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Now it is evident this six hundred dollars is not given to Trinity Church absolutely, or for its general purposes. It is to take the fund for the use of others, and becomes, therefore, trustee of the fund. The immediate <em>cestui que trust </em>is the \u201cTrinity Auxiliary of the Women\u2019s Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South,\u201d and it has been argued on this appeal, as it was in the Court below, that this \u201cauxiliary\u201d is an \u201cintegral\u201d part of Trinity Church, the legatee; and that, therefore, the bequest is within the principle enunciated in the case of <em>Eutaw St. Baptist Church v. </em>Shively, <em>supra. </em>This, however, is not deducible from the evidence. From that it appears that it is not an incorporated body, and its organization and objects are described as follows: \u201cThe women of Trinity Church have organized an auxiliary of the Women\u2019s For<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>eign Missionary Society, and they raise a sum every year .which they remit to the Treasurer of the Baltimore Annual Conference, and that treasurer 'remits it to the General Women\u2019s Missionary Board at Nashville.\u201d It is apparent, therefore, that this \u201cAuxiliary\u201d is not an agency of the church corporation which, like the Sunday-school in the case last above referred to, was organized, controlled and directed in its work by the corporation, and existing by authority of the corporation ; but it is an independent, voluntary association called into existence by, the volition of the members composing it, and continuing its existence only at the volition and pleasure of its membership. As soon, therefore, as this money (the six hundred dollars in question) is paid over to the beneficiary named (The Trinity Auxiliary) the church corporation would lose control of,-and authority over, it; and there would be no one that a Court of Equity could call upon to give an account of it. Then the difficulty of enforcing the trust, or rather the impracticability of enforcing it through a Court of Equity is emphasized in this case because the duty of the \u201cAuxiliary\u201d is only to pay the money in question \u201cto the Treasurer of the Baltimore Conference Society of the Women\u2019s Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South,\u201d which, according to the evidence, is another unincorporated body over which a Court of Equity could have no control to compel an observance of the directions contained in the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">For the reasons assigned, the provision, in the bequest here under consideration which gives six hundred dollars to Trinity Church corporation for the purposes indicated must be held to be void. And the same must be held as to the two remaining provisions, the next of which is the one giving \u201c five hundred dollars \u201d \u201cto be paid towards the support of the superannuated preachers, their widows and orphans of the Baltimore Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.\u201d We agree entirely with the Court below that this provision is to be pronounced void if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>we are to respect the authority of the case of <em>Church Extension Society of the M. E. Church et al. </em>v. <em>Smith, &amp;c., </em>56 Md. 362. In that case this Court was treating of a bequest to the appellant church corporation of a sum of money \u201cto be used as a part of the 'Perpetual Loan Fund\u2019 of said society and it appearing from the facts agreed upon in the case that this loan fund was a fund \u201c set apart to be loaned to necessitous churches of the Methodist Episcopal Church erected from time to time within the limits of the United States and its territories, and the beneficiaries and recipients thereof, are such of said churches, as the committee in charge of said fund for the time being, may in their discretion select.\u201d The Court said at page 397: \u201c According to the uniform course of decisions in this State, a trust cannot be upheld unless it be of such a nature that the <em>cestuis que trustent </em>are defined and capable of enforcing its execution by proceedings in a Court of Chancery.\u201d Then after referring to cases that announce that doctrine, the Court goes on to say : \u201c Here the selection of the necessitous churches for whose benefit the bequest is given depends exclusively upon the will of the committee appointed by the corporation ; if the committee should at any time fail to exercise its discretion, or the corporation should fail to appoint a committee for the care and appropriation of the loan fund, it would be possible for the corporation to appropriate to other purposes the entire fund; and there are no parties who could maintain a suit to prevent such misappropriation or enforce the execution of the trust, declared in the will. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aqg\">Now, in the case at-bar, the church corporation is not given the five hundred dollars disposed of by the provision we are now considering, but, as in the case of the six hundred dollars given for the benefit of the \u201c Trinity Auxiliary,\u201d and, as in the case we have just cited from, the church corporation is made the trustee of the fund for the purpose indicated, the intended beneficiaries being \u201c the superannuated preachers, their widows and orphans of the Baltimore Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>South.\u201d From evidence in the case it appears that the mode of ascertaining these beneficiaries, is under the discipline of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, for what is denominated the Joint Board of Finance \u201c to receive all moneys collected, as conference collections or otherwise, and distribute the same to the superannuated preachers, and the widows and orphans of deceased members of the conference, according to their best judgment of their several necessities.\u201d The testimony of the pastor of the church, Rev. Charles M. Hawkins, on this point was as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQr\">Question. \u201c Please state the manner in which the fund for the superannuated preachers, their wives and orphans is managed after it has been collected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">Answer. \u201c The money thus collected is taken to the annual conference and there turned over to aboard called the Joint Board of Finance; this board examines the case of each superannuated preacher, and the widows and orphans of those preachers, and determines in what proportion to divide this fund, and it is then paid over to these beneficiaries.\u201d He then in answer to further questions testified that application is.made to the board by those claiming to be entitled to be beneficiaries and their cases are investigated and a decision given accordingly ; that the board first determines whether upon application made there is a proper case in which to allow a share in the fund at all; and that then the board aims \u201cto distribute the money on the basis of the need of those beneficiaries, some being in more destitute circumstances than others.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Thus it is seen that the allowance of aid to superannuated preachers and their widows and orphans, as ascertained and defined objects, is under the absolute control of the .Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, to the discipline of which the legatee here is subject, and what is denominated their board of finance, and depends upon their voluntary action. Should it be determined by the conference to withhold these allowances altogether and to devote the funds, collected in the manner described, to what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>might seem some more important or necessary church object, it could be done; and in any such contingency the church corporation, here claiming this bequest, would be unable to perform its trust, as directed, and a Court of Equity would be equally without power to enforce it; and the fund designed to be dedicated to the purpose named in the bequest could, upon failure of the conference to so appropriate it, be diverted to other purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The last of the provisions contained in this loth item of the second codicil is the one giving four hundred dollars of the thirty-five hundred, bequeathed to the church corporation therein named, to the church to be given to the infant class of the Sunday-school \u201c to be contributed by said class for the support of a little girl in one of schools under the care of the Women\u2019s Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.\u201d Here, again, the church corporation does not take the money bequeathed absolutely for its general purposes nor to be used in aid of the exercise of any of its corporate functions. The gift of the four hundred dollars is a gratuity. The church takes it upon a trust. The beneficiary, which is left wholly indefinite and uncertain, is to be selected and ascertained by the infant class of the Sunday-school. There is no way of compelling this selection and there is no defined and ascertained beneficiary to ask for an enforcement of the trust. Under the rule laid down, therefore, in the case of <em>Church Extension </em>Society, &amp;c., v. Smith, supra, and the numerous cases to which reference is therein made, this provision must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">We will proceed now to examine and construe the remaining provisions of the will and codicils in controversy, taking them up in the inverse order in which they have been recited. This brings us to the consideration of the 13th item of the second codicil, which involves necessarily the 14th, as well as the devise over in the one and the bequest over in the other. It is not for the Court to construct a will for the testatrix nor to reconstruct the one which she has seen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>fit to construct for herself. We must take the will which is put before us, ascertain frorp that the purposes and intention of the testatrix and then give effect to those purposes and her intention, unless we find that the law forbids their execution. Where we find that the rules of law will not permit the intention to be effectuated, our only duty is to simply so declare. In the clause of the will we are about to consider the testatrix expressed her wish and purpose with much care and particularity, and there can be but little doubt of what she intended by the provisions therein made. Her evident intention was to dedicate the specific property, which was the subject of the devise, to the specific use and purposes therein so particularly declared, and that it should forever remain <em>extra commercium </em>and beyond the power of alienation. She did not give the property to the corporation for the use for which it was designed, but gave it to trustees with express directions to exact all the conditions she named or with only the power to convey to the corporation upon and with the conditions annexed. She then provided that if the corporation, which she named to receive the conveyance from the trustees, should fail to comply with the conditions precedent, which she imposed, that they should then have power to appoint some other corporation, doing kindred work in the city of Baltimore, to receive said devise and should <em>\u201c </em>convey said property to them on the terms and conditions above set forth,\u201d thus always insisting that the conveyance to be made should be on the terms and conditions which she had prescribed in furtherance of her cherished purpose to have the property dedicated, beyond the power of diversion, to the specific objects expressed in this clause of her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">It was argued that the testatrix intended to give or did give a fee upon limitation with reverter to her heirs upon a cesser of the uses to which she dedicated the property devised. But the testatrix gave nothing; she created a trust to convey, and named trustees to whom she prescribed the conditions upon which they were to convey. Assuming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>without deciding that such an estate could have been authorized, if she had in mind the conveyance of the estate coupled with a condition of reverter upon a cesser of the declared use, why was such a condition omitted from among those so carefully prescribed and why was no alternative provision made to take effect upon such cesser? The answer would seem to be because the testatrix supposed she had provided against any such cesser in directing the trustees to convey an inalienable estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Again, it is said, if the restraint upon alienation will impose a condition which the law pronounces void the beneficial devisee will take the estate freed of the condition. The answer, again, is that the testatrix has not made a conveyance nor a direct devise of the property, but has only empowered trustees to make a conveyance. This direction to the trustees, therefore, to convey without power of alienation is at present, or as the case stands here, not a condition annexed to a devise or conveyance, but it is. a limitation on the power of the trustees to convey ; and who can say that they would have been authorized to convey at all if it had been known to the testatrix,, or in her mind at the time of making the devise, that this condition when introduced into the conveyance she authorized would prove ineffectual. It is further insisted that the restraint of alienation prescribed here would be valid because the beneficial devisee is a charitable corporation. So late as the last term of this Court in the case of <em>Missionary Society, </em>&amp;c., v. <em>Humphreys, ante </em>p. 131 a devise to trustees for certain charitable uses was held void, because it offended against the rule of law forbidding perpetuities. It is true that in that case the objects of the charity had only an equitable interest in the property devised, but what difference in reason or principle can it make whether, if a charity cannot have the benefit of an inalienable estate, the estate to be forbidden on that ground be an equitable estate or a legal estate. In the case of <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>Barnum, </em>26 Md. 119, the reason of the rule against perpetuities is stated to be that the property, which is limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>beyond the period allowed by that rule, is rendered inalienable and is <em>\u201cextra </em>commercinm.\u201d Obviously it would seem that reason would apply with as much force to an inalienable legal estate as to an inalienable equitable estate. If we had here a direct devise or a conveyance of the property in question it might be more a matter of legal construction which would control. What the testatrix herself might have done is one thing. What she has authorized her trustees to do is quite another thing. The question as presented here is rather one of extent of power, and we are to determine whether the power can be exercised within its limitations so as to effectuate the intention of the testatrix. That intention we have already seen as expressed in the trust created in the item of the will we are considering, was that the trustees therein named should convey to the beneficiary of the devise an inalienable estate in the property devised to them and this the law forbids to be done. <em>Gray on Restraint on Alienations, </em>secs. 13 and 23; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>10 Md. 186. Now in the case of <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; C. C. of Balto., </em>4 Gill, 394, we find the law governing trustees with respect to carrying out powers of the description we are dealing with here laid down as follows : \u201cTrustees have no power to alter or change the nature and object of the trust, or dispense with the <em>exact </em>performance of the conditions and it is further said, \u201ca Court of Chancery has no' such power.\u201d The trustees in question here, therefore, cannot dispense, in making a conveyance of the property, devised to them under the will of the testatrix, with the conditions imposed upon them by the terms of their trust and in attempting to make the conveyance with those conditions they will be attempting a legally impossible thing. And their act instead of effectuating would really defeat the express wish and intention of the testatrix. As a consequence of the views stated we are constrained to hold the devise in the 13th item of the second codicil and the devise over therein and the bequest in the 14th item, which is interwoven with and dependent upon the 13th item, and the bequest over in the said 14th item void.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>By the 9th item of this second codicil the testatrix bequeathed to the trustees of Randolph-Macon College a sum of money, \u201c to be applied to aid deserving and promising young women,\u201d etc., as has been recited. The Court below held this to be a good and valid bequest and we think rightly so. The legatee is an incorporated body having for its object the education of the young, and the proof shows that a part of its work is carried on through the agency of what is known as the Randolph-Macon Woman\u2019s College, of Lynchburg, which was organized and is operated by the parent corporation in carrying out the general objects of the corporation. The bequest is given directly to the corporation and it is declared that the receipt of its treasurer shall be a complete discharge to the executors of testatrix\u2019s will. It is not given as a trust, as has been contended, but it is dedicated by the testatrix to an object directly within the general scope of the objects and purposes of the corporation. That the testatrix indicated the particular use to which the fund is to be applied does not invalidate the gift. <em>Eutaw Baptist Church </em>v. <em>Shively, </em>67 Md. <em>supra; Peter v. Carter, </em>70 Md. 139; <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>M. &amp; C. C. of Balto. </em>62 Md. 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Lastly we are to consider the effect to be given to the 18th item of the original will, which has been recited, and which bequeaths the sum of eight hundred dollars to the \u201c Woman\u2019s College, located at the City of Lynchburg, in the State of Virginia,\u201d \u201c for the education of one or more worthy girls.\u201d In regard to this bequest the writer of this, is of the opinion that the clear intention of the testatrix, was to give the eight hundred dollars to the \u201c Woman\u2019s College,\u201d according to the reading of this item of her will and that the legatee named, being one not capable in law of taking, the bequest is void. The majority of the Court, however, are of the opinion which prevailed with the Court below, that the term \u201c Woman\u2019s College\u201d is a misnomer, and that the intention of the testatrix was to make the corporation, \u201cThe Trustees of the Randolph-Macon College\u201d the legatee under this item of her will, and that the bequest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>is a valid' one, for the reasons assigned in treating of the bequest to that corporation under the 9th item of the second codicil.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"A63d\">(Decided June 16th, 1900.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In the view we have taken of the questions which have been passed upon it has not become necessary to refer specifically to the numerous exceptions to testimony. It will be sufficient to say that in the opinion of a majority of the Court that offered to show the misnomer in respect to the 18th item of the original will was competent and properly introduced to establish the misnomer. The property here which has been named as the subject of the intended trusts that have been held invalid will enure to the benefit of the heirs of the testatrix as to the real estate, and of the next of kin as to the personalty. <em>Hill on </em>Trustees, 114 (marg. page.)</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">It follows from the foregoing views that the decree of the Circuit Court No. 2, of Baltimore City, will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.
