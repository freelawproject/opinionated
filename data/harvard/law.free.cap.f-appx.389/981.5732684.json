The district court sentenced Reyes-Miranda to 51 months imprisonment. He challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">\u201cWe review sentencing decisions only for abuse of discretion, and we use a two-step process.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u2014including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). If we find the sentence to be procedurally sound, the second step is to review the \u201csubstantive reasonableness\u201d of the sentence, taking into account the totality of the circumstances, \u201cincluding the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201cIf the district court\u2019s sentence is within the guidelines range, we expect that the sentence is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alfaro-Moncada, </em>607 F.3d 720, 734 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see also United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cAfter <em>Booker, </em>our ordinary expectation [of reasonableness] still has to be measured against the record, and the party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both that record and the facts in section 3553(a).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">Reyes-Miranda contends that the district court committed procedural error by failing to adequately explain its 51-month, within the guidelines, sentence. We disagree. The district court explained that it was imposing that sentence to promote respect for the law because Reyes-Miranda\u2019s had been deported numerous times in the past and continued to illegally enter the United States. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). The court further explained that it was imposing a 51-month sentence to discourage others from illegally entering this country. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B). The court also stated, \u201cAfter considering the advisory sentencing guidelines and all the factors identified in Title 18, United States Code Section 3553(a)(1) through 7, the Court finds that the sentence imposed is sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d The district court\u2019s explanation of its sentencing decision was sufficient. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">Reyes-Miranda also challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. He contends that his 51-month sentence is \u201cgreater than necessary,\u201d <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), to achieve the purposes of sentencing. It is his position that a sentence below or at the low-end of the advisory guidelines range would have afforded adequate deterrence. Given Reyes-Miranda\u2019s history of deportations, a 51-month, within the guidelines, sentence is not outside the range of reasonableness. <em>See Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1238. The district court\u2019s sentencing decision was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
