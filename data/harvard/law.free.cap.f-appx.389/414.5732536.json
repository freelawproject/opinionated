Plaintiffs-Appellants contend that the district court improvidently granted the summary judgment motions of Defendants-Appellees grounded in qualified immunity and dismissed this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">We have reviewed the record on appeal and the applicable law as revealed by the briefs of the parties and our independent research, as a result of which we are convinced that the rulings of the district court, based in large measure on the March 10, 2009 Report and Recommendation of the magistrate judge, correctly disposed of this action. Satisfied that the patient and exhaustive analysis of the case confected by the magistrate judge in his Report and Recommendation reached the correct result for the correct reasons, and thus supports the orders and judgment of the district court, we affirm all rulings from which Plaintiffs-Appellants have appealed, including the above-said judgments of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
