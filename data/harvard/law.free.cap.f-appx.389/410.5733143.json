The district court sentenced Aristondo to 54 months of imprisonment, which was within the guidelines imprisonment range of 46 to 57 months. Aristondo now appeals, arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>that his sentence, which includes a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) (2008) because he was previously deported following a crime of violence conviction, is unreasonably long and greater than necessary to satisfy the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a). He also argues that the Guidelines that govern illegal reentry offenses lack an empirical foundation and thus deprive his sentence of a presumption of reasonableness on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">In Aristondo\u2019s case, the district court made an individualized sentencing decision based on the facts of the case in light of the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court\u2019s conclusion that a within-guidelines sentence is appropriate is entitled to deference, and we presume that it is reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 597; <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008). The district court was in a superior position to find facts and assess their import under \u00a7 3553(a), <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50-53, 128 S.Ct. at 597-98, and we see no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s discretionary decision to impose a sentence within the guidelines range. Furthermore, as Aris-tondo concedes, his argument that the appellate presumption of reasonableness is inapplicable due to the lack of an empirical basis in the Guidelines governing illegal reentry offenses is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
