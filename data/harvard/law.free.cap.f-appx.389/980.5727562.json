Plaintiff had contended that the case should not have been removed to federal court because his complaint failed to state a claim within the district court\u2019s federal question jurisdiction. The district court disagreed, concluding that the complaint \u201cplainly assert[ed] claims relating to the violation of [plaintiffs] Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\u201d In the March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>31 order, the court imposed Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 sanctions against plaintiffs attorney because the claims the attorney alleged in plaintiffs claim were \u201cobjectively frivolous, in light of res.judica-ta principles.\u201d The court ordered defendants to provide supporting documentation for their reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in defending the action by April 17, 2009. Defendants complied, and the court then ordered plaintiffs attorney to respond by April 30, 2009. Plaintiffs attorney failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Instead, on April 15, 2009, plaintiff, represented by the same attorney, moved the court to reconsider its March 31 order. The court denied the motion for reconsideration on February 5, 2010. On February 8, 2010, the court entered an order granting defendants $17,592 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs against plaintiffs attorney. The next day, the clerk of the court entered a final judgment in conformance with the February 8 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">On March 6, 2010, plaintiff, still represented by the same attorney, filed a notice of appeal. The notice stated that plaintiff was appealing the March 31, 2009 and February 5, 2010 orders. This is the appeal before us now.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">We find no error in either of the appealed orders and therefore affirm them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
