On appeal, Hazel argues that the district court erred in applying a four-level enhancement, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), for possessing the firearm in connection with another felony offense. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b998-16\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), a defendant\u2019s base offense level is increased by four levels if \u201cthe defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense ...\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). \u201cAnother felony offense\u201d includes crimes that would be punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year under federal, state, or local law, \u201cregardless of whether a criminal charge was brought, or a conviction obtained.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n.14(C). The \u201cin connection with\u201d requirement is satisfied when \u201cthe firearm ... facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense.... \u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n.l4(A). The guidelines commentary clarifies that the four-level enhancement applies when the other felony offense is a \u201cdrag trafficking offense\u201d and the \u201cfirearm is found in close proximity to drugs ... because the presence of the firearm has the potential of facilitating another felony offense....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n.14(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-17\">Here, the district court properly applied \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)\u2019s four-level enhancement. The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSi\u201d) recounted these facts, which Hazel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>did not dispute and thus admitted. <em>See United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cIt is the law of this circuit that a failure to object to allegations of fact in a PSI admits those facts for sentencing purposes.\u201d) While conducting surveillance on a street-level drug dealer at an apartment complex, police officers saw Hazel arrive in a taxicab and purchase a small baggie of a white substance from the drug dealer. Because the taxicab did not wait, Hazel left the area on foot. An officer approached Hazel and told him, \u201cDon\u2019t get rid of the dope.\u201d The officer then saw Hazel throw the baggie of white powder into the grass in an abandoned lot. When Hazel began to reach into his right pocket, the officer grabbed him and placed plastic flex cuffs on his left hand. Hazel elbowed the officer in the chest and broke free, running approximately five feet before the officer tackled him to the ground.. During the struggle, Hazel continued to try to reach for his right pocket. After Hazel was subdued, officers found a.loaded .38 caliber revolver in his right front pants pocket. Officers were unable to find the baggie of white powder Hazel had thrown away.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">At the sentencing hearing, Detective Andy Valdes testified that on the morning of Hazel\u2019s arrest, he observed the drug dealer conduct five other drug transactions that resulted in arrests, after which officers recovered cocaine and marijuana. From a car parked approximately twenty to thirty feet away, Detective Valdes used binoculars to watch as Hazel exited the taxicab, walked up to the drug dealer and handed him U.S. currency. In exchange, the drug dealer gave Hazel a small plastic baggie of white powder. Detective Valdes described the baggie Hazel purchased as roughly one-half inch square.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Hazel does not dispute that his cocaine purchase is \u201canother felony offense\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(2)(a)(1) (providing that purchase of cocaine under Florida Statute \u00a7 893.03(2)(a)\u2014irrespective of quantity \u2014 is a second-degree felony). Instead, Hazel argues that, because he purchased only a small, personal-use amount,. he did not commit a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d However, application of \u00a7 2K2.1'(b)(6) is not limited to drug trafficking offenses. Rather, \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) applies to \u201canother felony offense,\u201d which includes a- felony drug offense that does not involve trafficking. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n.14(A). The commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) merely clarifies that, when the other felony offense is a drug trafficking offense, to satisfy the \u201cin connection with\u201d requirement, the drugs must be found in close proximity to the firearm. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n,14(B)(ii). Thus, whether Hazel\u2019s other felony is a drug trafficking offense is immaterial, so long as his possession of the firearm \u201cfacilitated, or had the potential of facilitating\u201d the other felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">Hazel\u2019s argument that \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) requires an affirmative finding that the gun actually facilitated the cocaine purchase is also meritless. The commentary to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) plainly states that for a firearm to be possessed \u201cin connection with another felony offense,\u201d it need only have the \u201cpotential of facilitating\u201d the other felony offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n.l4(A). This Court has concluded that possession of a single bag of cocaine is an offense for which \u201cmere possession of a firearm\u201d is sufficient to trigger the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>480 F.3d 1277, 1279-81 (11th Cir.2007) (concluding that district court properly applied \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement .where officer saw defendant, who was a passenger in a car, try to hide a bag of a white powdery substance in his sock and a firearm under his seat and, after car left the scene, officer found bul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>lets in defendant\u2019s pockets).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A reasonable fact-finder could readily infer from the factual circumstances of Hazel\u2019s possession of the firearm \u2014 a loaded gun in his front pocket where it was readily accessible while he purchased the cocaine and left on foot \u2014 that the firearm had the potential of facilitating Hazel\u2019s cocaine purchase. Thus, there was ample evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding that Hazel possessed the firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d his felony cocaine purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Accordingly, the district court did not ei'r in imposing the four-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(B)(6). We affirm Hazel\u2019s 100-7-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b998-12\">. We review a district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>480 F.3d 1277, 1278 (11th Cir. 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1000-14\">. Because we affirm the district court's finding that Hazel possessed the firearm in connection with his cocaine purchase, which was sufficient to support the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement, we do not address the district court\u2019s alternative basis for the enhancement \u2014 that Hazel also possessed the firearm in connection with his resisting arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
