Jackson argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-17\">Jackson argues that the Government failed to prove the \u201cpossession\u201d element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt because the Government proved only that he had \u201chandled\u201d a firearm and not that he had \u201cpossessed\u201d it.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-18\">This court reviews the denial of a motion for acquittal <em>de novo. United States v. Clayton, </em>506 F.3d 405, 412 (5th Cir.2007). In determining the sufficiency of the evidence, the court must review the evidence and the inferences arising therefrom in the light most favorable to the verdict and determine whether a rational jury could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe evidence need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt, and the jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-19\">To prove the felon in possession charge, the Government had to prove that Jackson had previously been convicted of a felony, that he had possession of a firearm, and that the firearm in question had traveled in and/or affected interstate commerce. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1); <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 515 (5th Cir.2001). The parties stipulated that Jackson has a prior felony conviction and that the firearm discovered in his apartment traveled in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-20\">Possession of a firearm may be actual or constructive and may be proved by circumstantial evidence. <em>United States v. McCowan, </em>469 F.3d 386, 390 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cActual possession means the defendant knowingly has direct physical control over a thing at a given time.\u201d <em>See United States v. Munoz, </em>150 F.3d 401, 416 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>The evidence introduced at trial was sufficient to show that Jackson had actual possession of a firearm. In particular, the Government presented testimony that Jackson was carrying a gun as he ran away from police officers; that he threw it under a bush; that officers recovered the gun from under the bush; and that his DNA was on the gun and the clip. This testimony establishes that Jackson had knowing, physical control over a firearm on the night of April 19th, 2009. <em>See Munoz, </em>150 F.3d at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Viewing the evidence as a whole and the credibility findings in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational jury could have reasonably concluded that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that Jackson was a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Jackson\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
