On appeal, Gadson argues: (1) the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress because Deputy Tolbert lacked probable cause to make an arrest, and (2) the imposition of consecutive mandatory minimum sentences for firearms offenses that resulted from the use of a single gun violates the except clause of 18 U-.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Upon, review of the record and the parties briefs, we find no error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">On appeal, Gadson argues the district court erred in crediting Tolbert\u2019s testimony that he was aware of Gadson\u2019s status as a felon at the time of the arrest. Gadson contends the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress because Tolbert lacked probable cause to arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">We accept a district court\u2019s credibility determinations unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. White, </em>593 F.3d 1199, 1202 (11th Cir.2010). A factfinder\u2019s choice between two permissible views of the evidence cannot be clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. McPhee, </em>336 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2003). Thus, a district court\u2019s choice-of whom to believe is entitled to deference unless the court credited exceedingly improbable testimony that is either \u201ccontrary to the laws of nature,\u201d or so \u201cinconsistent or improbable on it\u00e1 face that'no reasonable factfinder could accept it.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749-50 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-14\">Tolbert\u2019s testimony that he was aware Gadson was a felon and a member of the drug game in his small community is not contrary to the laws of nature or ordinary human experience. <em>Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d at 749-50. The district court did not clearly err in crediting this testimony, and its findings of fact are entitled to deference. <em>Id. </em>at 750. Accordingly, Gadson\u2019s arrest was based on probable cause under the totality of the circumstances, and the district court did not err in denying Gad-son\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>See United States v. Street, </em>472 F.3d 1298, 1305 (11th Cir.2006) (stating probable cause exists \u201cwhen the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge, of which he or she has reasonably trustworthy information, would cause a prudent person to believe, under the circumstances shown, that the suspect has committed ... an offense\u201d). Gadson\u2019s convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-16\">In relevant part, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-17\">Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>of law, any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime \u2014 (i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Section 924(c) further provides that, \u201c[n]ot withstanding any other provision of law \u2014 no term of imprisonment imposed on a person under this subsection shall run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment imposed. ...\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(D)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">At the time Gadson was sentenced, we had interpreted the except clause of \u00a7 924(c) only to hold that the clause requires consecutive sentences where the mandatory minimum sentence for a defendant\u2019s drug offense is greater than the mandatory minimum for the firearm offense. <em>United States v. Segarra, </em>582 F.3d 1269, 1272-73 (11th Cir.2009). After Gad-son was sentenced, however, the holding in <em>Segar\\~a </em>was extended to affirm a district court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences for each of a defendant\u2019s firearms convictions under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). <em>United States v. Tate, </em>586 F.3d 936, 946-47 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The district court did not err in imposing a consecutive sentence of 60 months for Gadson\u2019s \u00a7 924(c)(1) conviction. As Gadson recognizes, this Court is bound to apply <em>Segarra </em>and <em>Tate </em>because they have not been overruled by either this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>or the U.S. Supreme Court. <em>Cargill v. Turpin, </em>120 F.3d 1366, 1386 (11th Cir.1997). Accordingly, we affirm Gadsons\u2019s total sentence of 240 months.</p>\n<p id=\"A-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-12\">. We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact on a motion to suppress evidence for clear error, and the district court's application of the law to those facts <em>de novo. United States </em>v. <em>Tokars, </em>95 F.3d 1520, 1531 (11th Cir.1996). We review questions of statutory interpretation <em>de novo. United States v. Segarra, </em>582 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
