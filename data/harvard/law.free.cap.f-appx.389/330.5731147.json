Lewis filed suit against the director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice as well as several other prison officials. He also moves this court for injunctions pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">A dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted is reviewed under the same de novo standard as a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998). \u201cThe complaint must be liberally construed, with all reasonable inferences drawn in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Woodard v. Andrus, </em>419 F.3d 348, 351 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-17\">Prisoners have a constitutional right to access the courts. <em>Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 821, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977). However, <em>\u201cBounds </em>did not create an abstract, freestanding right to a law library or legal assistance.\u201d <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351-52, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). To prevail on a claim of denial of access to courts, a prisoner must show actual injury. <em>Id. at </em>349-52, 116 S.Ct. 2174. Lewis\u2019s claims that he was denied access to courts because prison officials denied him legal envelopes and also failed to send out his legal mail are without merit. Specifically, his failure to allege that he suffered an actual injury is fatal to his \u201cdenial of access to courts\u201d claim. <em>Id. </em>at 349-52, 116 S.Ct. 2174. Thus, the district court did not err by dismissing this claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-18\">Additionally, Lewis\u2019s claim that his First Amendment rights were violated because prison officials seized and destroyed a personal incoming letter is likewise without merit. In particular, because Lewis failed to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis regarding this claim, it is as if he had not appealed the judgment. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Lewis has not addressed the district court\u2019s determination that this claim should be dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>for failure to state a claim, he has abandoned this issue. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748; <em>Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Lewis has requested injunctions ordering prison officials to provide him with copies of \u201clegal papers\u201d and to provide him with access to courts. To obtain a preliminary injunction, movant must establish: (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a substantial threat that failure to grant the injunction will result in irreparable injury, (3) that the threatened injury outweighs any damage that the injunction may cause the opposing party, and (4) that the injunction will not serve the public interest. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 8; <em>United States v. Baylor University Med. Ctr., </em>711 F.2d 38, 39 (5th Cir.1983). Lewis fails to make the requisite showing; therefore, his motions for injunction pending appeal are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Finally, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Lewis\u2019s complaint counts as a strike for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Lewis previously accumulated two strikes in <em>Lewis v. Herod, </em>364 Fed.Appx. 75 (5th Cir.2010) (unpublished). Because Lewis has now accumulated three strikes, he is barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; MOTIONS DENIED; THREE-STRIKES BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-12\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
