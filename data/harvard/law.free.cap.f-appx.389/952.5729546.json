Fed. R. Civ. 59(a), 50(b). The Center complained that The Shutters Condominium Association and Mildred Miner had violated two provisions of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3604(a), 3604(c), but at trial the jury returned a verdict in favor of The Shutters Association and Miner. The district court denied the post-trial motions of the Center on the ground that the jury was entitled to discredit testimony that the Center had been damaged by the activities of The Shutters Association and Miner. Because the record supports the jury\u2019s verdict, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-14\">In November 2006, one of three employees at the Center, a non-profit organization working to eliminate discrimination in access to housing in the Greater Palm Beaches area of Florida, discovered on the \u201ccraigslist\u201d website an advertisement offering for rent a condominium in The Shutters complex. The advertisement included the statement, \u201cSorry no kids or pets.\u201d The Center later learned that Miner owned the condominium and the advertisement had been posted on the Internet on November 7, 2006, by Miner\u2019s daughter, Teresa Salter.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-15\">The Center obtained over the Internet copies of an amendment to the Declaration of Condominium recorded in 1986 by The Shutters Association that contained two provisions restricting residency by children. Section F of Article XI stated, \u201cAge limit of children permitted with parents as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>owners, 18 years of age.\u201d Section G of Article XI permitted the rental of \u201centire apartments\u201d to \u201cone family consisting of the father, mother and adult children, if any\u201d and also stated there could be \u201cno children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">The Center concluded that the advertisement and restrictions in the Declaration violated the Fair Housing Act, which was revised in 1988 to prohibit discrimination in access to housing based on \u201cfamilial status,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3602(k). The Center filed charges with Housing and Urban Development and the Palm Beach Office of Equal Opportunity about discrimination based on familial status by The Shutters Association, its president, Carol Ravantti Lalla, Miner, and Salter. The Center offered to settle the charges if, among other conditions, members of The Shutters Association would complete an education program that cost $5000 per participant, but the dispute was not resolved. On May 8, 2007, the Office of Equal Opportunity found reasonable grounds that the defendants had violated the Fair Housing Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">In August 2008, the Center filed an amended complaint that The Shutters Association, Ravantti Lalla, Miner, and Salter had violated the Fair Housing Act in four ways: making housing unavailable to potential lessees because of their familial status, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(a); discriminating in the sale or rental of housing because of potential lessees\u2019 familial status, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3604(b); advertising in a manner that discriminates against potential lessees based on their familial status, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3604(c); and interfering \u201cin the exercise or enjoyment of ... any right granted or protected by section ... 3604,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3617. The Center complained that it \u201c[had] and continue[d] to spend substantial time and resources concerning The Shutters Complaint which [had] impaired its mission to insure that the Greater Palm Beaches is free from discriminatory housing practices,\u201d and the Center listed four injuries it had suffered because of the defendants\u2019 alleged discrimination. Before trial, the district court dismissed without prejudice the complaint against Salter. The Shutters Association later amended its Declaration and removed all language about prohibiting the rental and sale of its condominium units to families with children.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">In July 2009, the Center, The Shutters Association, and Ravantti Lalla moved for summary judgment. The district court denied the motion of the Center, but granted in part the motion of The Shutters Association and Ravantti Lalla. The district court found that the Center had failed to \u201cput forth any evidence that The Shutters\u201d Association or Ravantti Lalla had \u201cdiscriminate[d] against any person\u201d about the \u201csale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of ... familial status,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(b), and dismissed that ground of the complaint. The district court rejected the argument that the Center lacked standing based, in part, on the declaration of the Vice President of the Center, Bobbie Fletcher, that \u201cas a result of The Shutters\u2019 alleged discrimination, [the Center] began to divert its resources from other activities in order to \u2018identify and counteract Defendants\u2019 unlawful housing practices.\u2019 \u201d The district court also found that there was a factual dispute about whether Miner had published her discriminatory advertisement because of the amended Declaration recorded by The Shutters Association in 1986. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3604(a), 3604(c), 3617.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">At trial, the Center presented testimony from Fletcher about the activities of the Center and its damages. The Center also called Miner to testify about the advertisement her daughter had posted on the craigslist website. After the Center rested its case, The Shutters Association and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>Ravantti Lalla moved for judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a). Miner also moved for judgment in her favor. The district court entered judgment in favor of Ravantti Lalla, but the district court denied the motions of The Shutters Association and Miner.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">A jury returned verdicts in favor of The Shutters Association and Miner, he jury found that neither defendant had made housing unavailable to potential lessees because of their familial status, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(a); advertised or caused the advertising of housing that indicated a limitation or discrimination based on familial status, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3604(c); or interfered \u201cin the exercise or enjoyment of ... any right granted or protected by section ... 3604,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3617. The district court entered judgment in favor of The Shutters Association and Miner.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">The Center moved for a new trial, Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(a), and for judgment as a matter of law, Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b), on the ground that the verdicts under sections 3604(a) and (c) were contrary to the weight of the evidence, but the district court denied the motions. The district court found that the jury was entitled to reject the testimony of Fletcher about the damages incurred by the Center:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-7\">The jury was entitled to reject the testimony of Bobby Ann Fletcher as to the existence of damages and as to any causal connection between the defendants\u2019 activities and the alleged damages. It was within the jury\u2019s province to weigh the credibility of witnesses, particularly those who were demanding high fees for lengthy \u201ceducational\u201d seminars as a condition of a settlement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">The district court also expressed its \u201cagree[ment] with the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d and ruled that, \u201ceven if [the Center] had made a Rule 50 motion, this Court would have exercised discretion and denied the request for judgment as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">Our scope of review in this appeal is narrow: We review the denial of a motion for a new trial to determine \u201cwhether there was an absolute absence of evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Attaway, </em>757 F.2d 1227, 1237 n. 3 (11th Cir.1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because we may not examine \u201c[t]he sufficiency of the evidence supporting a jury verdict\u201d in the absence of a timely motion for judgment as a matter of law by the Center, \u201cour inquiry is limited to whether there was any evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, irrespective of its sufficiency, or whether plain error was noted which, if not noticed, would result in a \u2018manifest miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1237. In our review, we may not disturb any possible findings of the jury about conflicts and inferences to be drawn from the evidence or the credibility of witnesses. <em>See Lipphardt v. Durango Steakhouse of Brandon, Inc., </em>267 F.3d 1183, 1186 (11th Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">The Center challenges one of the three verdicts rendered by the jury; the Center challenges the decision that it was not injured by the publication of an advertisement by Miner about rules of The Shutters Association that discriminated against potential lessees based on their familial status, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(c). The Center does not challenge the decision that neither defendant had made unavailable housing based on a person\u2019s familial status, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3604(a). \u201c[O]ur well established rule is that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned.\u201d <em>United States v. Ford, </em>270 F.3d 1346, 1347 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">We cannot conclude as a matter of law that there is no evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. The jury may have concluded that the Center failed to establish a causal connection between its alleged damages and the discriminatory advertising by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>Miner. <em>See Cent. Ala. Fair Hous. Ctr., Inc. v. Lowder Realty Co., </em>236 F.3d 629, 639 (11th Cir.2000). The Center complained about injuries it suffered as a result of the advertisement, but the Center offered scant evidence about its damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">Although the Center complained that the advertisement \u201cinterfered with [its] efforts and programs\u201d and resulted in the \u201cdevot[ion of] scarce resources to identify and counteract Defendants\u2019 unlawful housing practices and ... diversion of] those same resources from its education, counseling, and referral services,\u201d the testimony did not wholly support that complaint. Bobbie Fletcher testified that the Center incurred $15,000 in \u201cout-of-pocket expenses\u201d while \u201cmonitorfing] each month\u201d whether The Shutters Association had amended its Declaration, but Fletcher did not testify whether or how the purported expenditure interfered with or diverted resources from programs offered by the Center. Furthermore, the jury might not have found Fletcher\u2019s testimony credible. According to Fletcher, the Center monitored the Declaration over the Internet for about 20 months, and a jury reasonably could have found it incredible the monitoring cost $750 a month. Fletcher testified that the Center maintained \u201ca precise time report as to the time spent\u201d totaling the $15,000, but the Center did not introduce the report into evidence. Fletcher also gave inconsistent statements about when the Center incurred the expenses. Fletcher first testified that the Center incurred its expenses \u201cfrom the time [it] discovered\u201d the advertisement, but Fletcher later testified that \u201c[a]t the time [the Center] filed the complaint there was no money involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">The testimony also did not support the complaint of the Center that the discriminatory advertising \u201cinterfered with the rights of Plaintiff Fair Housing Center\u2019s constituents\u201d and \u201cfrustrated\u201d the Center\u2019s \u201cmission.\u201d Fletcher admitted that \u201cno one was turned away\u201d as a result of the advertisement nor was she aware that anyone had even \u201cshowed an interest in the apartment.\u201d Likewise, Miner testified that \u201c[n]ot one person\u201d responded to her advertisement about her condominium, even after she removed the \u201cno children\u201d language in the advertisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">We AFFIRM the denial of the Center\u2019s motion for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
