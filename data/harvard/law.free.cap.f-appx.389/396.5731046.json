We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">On November 3, 1997, AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company issued a disability income policy to Jason B. Rochon. Ro-chon submitted a claim on September 27, 1999, for a disabling mental illness, the onset of which began on October 1, 1998. AXA denied the claim on December 30, 1999 due to Rochon\u2019s failure to disclose a preexisting mental illness at the time of his application for the policy. Almost eight years later, on October 17, 2007, Rochon filed suit alleging a wrongful denial of . benefits. The district court granted summary judgment for AXA. Rochon\u2019s claims were held to be barred by the policy\u2019s three-year prescriptive period. The issues on appeal are legal ones, which are reviewed <em>de novo. Bradley v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>606 F.3d 215, 222 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In the district court and now on appeal, Rochon argues that AXA cannot simultaneously deny benefits under the policy on the basis that it was void <em>ab initio </em>and also assert his claims are time barred due to the prescriptive period in Section 10.4 of the policy. Rochon is mistaken. \u201cA party may set out 2 or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively or hypothetically\u201d and \u201cmay state as many separate claims or defenses as it has, regardless of consistency.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(d)(2) &amp; (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Rochon also argues that the prescriptive period in the policy should be voided because it is adhesionary. Instead, the ten-year prescriptive period in Louisiana Civil Code Article 3499 should apply. However,' the statutory prescription period applies \u201c[ujnless otherwise provided by legislation.\u201d La. Civ.Code art. 3499. Two statutes address the prescriptive periods for insurance policies. One provides that the insured must furnish proof of loss within ninety days after the end of the period for which he claims benefits, and no action shall be brought more than one year after the time the proof of loss is required. La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 22:975(A)(5), (11). The other provides that an insurance policy cannot limit the insured\u2019s time to file a first party claim to less than two years. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 22:868(B). This policy validly allowed three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">Rochon filed a claim on September 27, 1999 for the period October 1, 1998 to September 27, 1999. He therefore needed to provide a written proof of loss by December 26, 1999. He also needed to file his lawsuit by December 26, 2002. Rochon waited almost eight years to file suit. His claims are prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">Third, Rochon\u2019s claims that the policy is adhesionary similarly fail because the prescriptive period in the policy is required by Louisiana law and is actually more favorable than the two-year and one-year periods provided in Section 22:868. <em>See </em>La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 22:975(A) (setting forth provisions that are required in health and accident insurance policies). Further, the policy properly provided that Rochon consented to the policy upon delivery and payment of the first premium. No signature on the policy itself was required for consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">Finally, Rochon argues that his disability is an \u201congoing disability\u201d that precludes any finding that his claims for attorney\u2019s fees and penalties are not prescribed under this statutory provision: \u201cNo action for the recovery of penalties or attorney fees provided in this Section shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>brought after the expiration of one year after the date proofs of loss are required to be filed.\u201d La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 22:1821(E). Proof of loss in this case was required ninety days after the termination of the period for which Rochon claimed he was entitled to benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">We agree with the district court that by Rochon\u2019s analysis, the ninety-day period for which an insured is required to file a written proof of loss would continue indefinitely, regardless of the insured\u2019s inaction. Rochon failed to pursue his claim for almost eight years after AXA denied him disability benefits. His claim for attorney\u2019s fees and penalties are prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
