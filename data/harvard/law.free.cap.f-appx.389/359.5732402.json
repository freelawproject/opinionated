Dunlap also moves for the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">In order to obtain leave to proceed IFP, Dunlap must show that he is a pauper, and he must raise a nonfrivolous issue. <em>See Jackson v. Dallas Police Dep\u2019t, </em>811 F.2d 260, 261 (5th Cir.1986). Dunlap provides only his financial information and does not address whether his appeal will present a nonfrivolous issue. Dunlap does not even mention the denial of his \u00a7 3553(a) motion for lack of jurisdiction. Dunlap\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Accordingly, Dunlap\u2019s request for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED. His motion for appointment of counsel is also DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
