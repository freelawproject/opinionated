He contends that the district court erred by applying a 16-level enhancement for deportation following conviction for a crime of violence. Garcia also challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">In 2008 Garcia was convicted of the felony offense of lewd or lascivious exhibition in the presence of a victim under the age of 16, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(7).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court concluded that conviction qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines and applied a 16-level enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). Garcia contends that was error. \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>586 F.3d 1283, 1284 (11th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Ortiz-Delgado, </em>451 F.3d 752, 754 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">The Guidelines impose a 16-level enhancement if an alien \u201cwas deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after ... a conviction for a felony that is ... a crime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined by the Guidelines as any of the following offenses under federal, state, or local law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ate\">murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses (including where consent to the conduct is not given or is not legally valid, such as where consent to the conduct is involuntary, incompetent, or coerced), statutory rape, sexual abuse of a minor, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, burglary of a dwelling, or any other offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-13\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. (n.1(B)(iii)); <em>see also United States v. Ivory, </em>475 F.3d 1232, 1234 n. 2 (11th Cir.2007) (noting that \u201c[w]e treat the commentary in the sentencing guidelines as authoritative\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-14\">Garcia contends that his Florida felony conviction for lewd or lascivious exhibition in the presence of a victim under the age of 16 does not qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because it is a non-touching offense that does not involve physical force. He asserts that in order for an offense to be a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d it must have as element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another person. Garcia\u2019s argument is without merit. The definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is disjunctive. <em>See United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1325-26 (11th Cir.2010). \u201c[A] felony qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2 if either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>(1) the defendant was convicted of one of the enumerated offenses; or (2) the use,' attempted use, or threatened use of physical force was an element of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, if Garcia\u2019s conviction fits within an enumerated offense it qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d whether or not the use of physical force is an element of the exime. <em>See id., </em>606 F.3d at 1325-28; <em>see also id., </em>606 F.3d at *1330-32 (holding that the label a state attaches to an offense is not conclusive of whether a prior conviction qualifies as an enumerated offense under \u00a7 2L1.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">The district court concluded that Garcia\u2019s conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(7) constituted \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d which is one of the enumerated offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.1(B)(iii)). Garcia argues that in order for an offense to qualify as \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d the offense must involve physical contact with the victim. Because Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(7) does not require physical contact with the victim, Garcia asserts that a violation of that statute is not \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d In <em>United States v. Padilla-Reyes, </em>247 F.3d 1158 (11th Cir. 2001), however, we held that a violation of the 1987 version of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 was \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2 even though the statute encompassed acts involving no victim contact. <em>See id. </em>at 1162, 1164; <em>see also </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 (1987) (making it unlawful for \u201c[a]ny person [to] ... [k]nowingly commit[ ] any lewd or lascivious act in the presence of any child under the age of 16 years\u201d). In light of <em>Padilla-Reyes, </em>the district court did not err in concluding that Garcia\u2019s conviction constituted \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d and therefore qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">Garcia also challenges the reasonableness of his sentence. \u201cWe review sentencing decisions only for abuse of discretion, and we use a two-step process.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u2014including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). If we find the sentence to be procedurally sound, the second step is to review the \u201csubstantive reasonableness\u201d of the sentence, taking into account the totality of the circumstances, \u201cincluding the extent of any variance from the Guidelines ' range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. If the district court\u2019s sentence is within the guidelines range, we expect that the sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cAfter <em>Booker, </em>our ordinary expectation [of reasonableness] still has to be measured against the record, and the party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both that record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cAlthough we do not automatically presume a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, we \u2018ordinarily ... expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788)).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">As for procedural error, Garcia contends that the district court improperly calculated his Guidelines\u2019 range by applying the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) enhancement. He also argues that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>failed to adequately consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Both arguments lack merit. As we have already explained, the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 2L 1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) enhancement was proper. The district court also gave adequate consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Before imposing its sentence, the district court discussed several of them on the record and expressly acknowledged that it had considered them. The district court stated: \u201cThe Court ... has considered all the [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factors.\u201d That acknowledgment \u201calone is sufficient in post <em>-Booker </em>sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Garcia also challenges the substantive reasonableness of his 87-month sentence, which is within his Guidelines range of 70 to 87 months imprisonment. Garcia contends that a lesser sentence would have adequately deterred him from engaging in future criminal conduct because he did not serve much jail time for any of his earlier convictions. Garcia also argues that a lesser sentence was appropriate because he was born to a poor family in Mexico and suffers from alcoholism. Garcia has failed to carry his burden of showing that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. The fact that he received more lenient sentences in the past does not make his current sentence unreasonable. Given Garcia\u2019s significant criminal history, we cannot say that his within Guidelines sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b954-10\">.
