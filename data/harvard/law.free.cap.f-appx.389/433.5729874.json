Wayne Walker, the attorney appointed to represent Christopher Crayton, has renewed his motion for leave to withdraw and has filed a supplemental brief. Crayton has filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-18\">Counsel has yet to comply fully with this court\u2019s prior orders to file a brief in conformance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Despite this court\u2019s prior instruction, the <em>Anders </em>briefs offer scant legal analysis regarding the validity of the guilty plea and do not cite to the specific record volumes.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-23\">Nevertheless, because our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s briefs, and Crayton\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivo-lous issue for appeal, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Counsel, however, is CAUTIONED that failure to comply with any future order of this court could result in the imposition of sanctions, which may include denial of payment for services rendered and removal from the case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b459-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
