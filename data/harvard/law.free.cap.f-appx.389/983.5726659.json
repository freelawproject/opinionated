After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-22\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-23\">On 21 September 2007, Rogers, with the assistance of counsel, filed a complaint, which he later amended, against the defendants, alleging that they violated his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment when, on 17 February 2004, in the Polk County Jail, deputies Renney, Barrett, and Odoski illegally seized, beat, applied mace to, and tortured him while he was handcuffed behind his back, causing him permanent injury. R1-1; R1-19 at 3-6, 9-11, 14-16. Rogers also asserted state law claims of (1) assault, battery, and false imprisonment against the defendants, and (2) negligence against Judd in the hiring, training, disciplining, and supervising of deputies Renney, Barrett, and Odoski. R1-19 at 6-9, 11-14, 16-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">The defendants answered, denying the allegations and asserting various affirmative defenses, including that (1) Rogers\u2019s action was untimely because it was not brought within one year of the matter complained of, as required by Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(5)(g), and (2) the defendant deputies (a) held a reasonable belief that Rogers would injure them or others if not repelled by force, and (b) used a reasonable amount of force under the circumstances. R1-20, 23 at 9. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to Rogers\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims against Judd and as to all of Rogers\u2019 false imprisonment claims. R1-39 at 11-23; R1-48 at 9. Although the court denied summary judgment as to Rogers\u2019 assault, battery, and negligence claims, see R1^48 at 9-10, it subsequently dismissed these claims after finding that they were barred by Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(5)(g), which prescribes a one-year statute of limitations for \u201can action brought by or on behalf of a prisoner ... relating to the conditions of the prisoner\u2019s confinement,\u201d R3 at 13-14. The only claims remaining for the jury to consider were Rogers\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims against Renney, Barrett, and Odoski.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">Prior to trial, Rogers filed a motion in limine objecting to evidence, including photographs, of injuries sustained by Raymond Noble, a prison deputy, following a confrontation between Noble and Rogers that occurred just prior to the incident alleged in the complaint. See R1-58; R1-88 at 4. Rogers conceded that his altercation with Noble was relevant as to the general background of what happened on the day he alleges he was beaten, but argued that the photographs and \u201cspecifics [of][how]' bad [Rogers] beat [Noble] up\u201d were unduly prejudicial. R2 at 86-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">The district court overruled Rogers\u2019 objection, finding that the incident with Noble was \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the allegations in the complaint and that the injuries sustained by Noble, to the extent they were known to the defendant deputies, were \u201crelevant in terms [of the] use of force that they felt was appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89. With respect to the photographs, the court found that their probative value was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, and received them into evidence accordingly. <em>Id. </em>at 89, 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">Rogers also objected to the introduction of evidence that he had been involved in a physical altercation with another detention deputy, Larry Traylor, on 19 June 2002. See Rl-88 at 5; R2 at 99-100. He conceded that this incident, if known to the defendants, was relevant' to the defendants\u2019 state of mind on the day of the incident alleged in the complaint, but argued that the defendants were \u201ctrying to bring in more specifics of that act than would be necessary.\u201d R2 at 99-100. Rogers further argued that this incident, unlike the incident involving Noble, was not \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the events giving rise to the complaint because it occurred two years earlier. <em>Id. </em>at 100. The defendants countered that this evidence was significant because Barrett personally witnessed and was involved in the altercation between Traylor and Rogers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>and because the other defendant deputies had been briefed on the incident and had spoken to Traylor directly about it. <em>Id. </em>at 100-02. The evidence was therefore \u201crelevant ... as to [the defendants\u2019] perception [of] [the] threat\u201d Rogers posed. <em>Id. </em>at 102. The court agreed that evidence of the altercation between Traylor and Rogers, including photographs of Traylor following the altercation, was admissible. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">The parties next quarreled over the relevance of the fact that Rogers was serving a life sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 104. The defendants argued that Rogers\u2019 sentence was relevant \u201cto shed light on the state of mind of [the defendants] and their perception of [the] threat\u201d because \u201c[if] [they] were aware that [Rogers] had a life sentence, a serious sentence, then ... their perception [of] [the] threat would be more than [if] [they] knew he was just there for a parking ticket.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105. Rogers countered that a life sentence itself is not relevant because a person could be sentenced to life imprisonment for a child sex crime, which would not make him a threat to a deputy. <em>Id. </em>at 110. Furthermore, Rogers argued, even if evidence that he was serving a life sentence were relevant, it was a prior bad act under Federal Rule of Evidence 404 and was prejudicial, especially in light of the evidence regarding the Noble and Traylor incidents. <em>Id. </em>The court disagreed, finding that the evidence was both highly relevant and highly probative. <em>Id. </em>at 110-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">After ruling on the evidentiary issues, the district court heard the testimony of Rogers, Noble, and defendants Odoski, Barrett, and Renney. Rogers testified that on 17 February 2004, he left his cell to go see the prison chaplain. <em>Id. </em>at 224. When Noble saw Rogers, he told Rogers to return to his cell. <em>Id. </em>As Rogers was walking back' to his cell, he picked up a garbage can and threatened to throw trash at Noble. <em>Id. </em>Noble grabbed him from behind and a struggle ensued. <em>Id. </em>at 225. Deputy Supinger, who also was present, sprayed mace in Rogers\u2019 face, impairing his vision. <em>Id. </em>at 225-26. Rogers was subsequently handcuffed and escorted to the nurse\u2019s station. <em>Id. </em>at 226. Rogers testified that while he was standing in the corner of the nurse\u2019s station waiting to be treated, Odoski bent back his thumbs, slammed his head into the wall, and kicked him. <em>Id. </em>at 227-29. Rogers testified that Renney also participated in the incident at the nurse\u2019s station and that Sergeant Barrett was present but did not order Odoski and Renney to stop. <em>Id. </em>at 235-37, 250. After leaving the nurse\u2019s station, Odoski and Renney took Rogers to the isolation dorm. <em>Id. </em>at 236. Once there, either Odo-ski or Renney, he was not sure which deputy, tripped him, causing him to fall face-first onto the concrete floor. <em>Id. </em>Odo-ski began to choke him while Renney kneed or kicked him in the back. <em>Id. </em>Barrett was present during this incident, but did nothing to stop it. <em>Id. </em>at 236-37. Rogers testified that he suffered injuries to the left side of his face, which required him to have jaw surgery, and soft tissue damage in his wrist. <em>Id. </em>at 229-33, 239. Rogers testified that, from the time he was first handcuffed, he never once resisted. <em>Id. </em>at 237. He admitted, however, that earlier he had beaten Noble\u2019s face, had tried to gouge Noble\u2019s eye out with his fingernail, and had thrown Noble against the wall. <em>Id. </em>at 245\u201446.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">Noble testified that when he saw Rogers outside of his cell on 17 February 2004, he asked Rogers three to five times to return to his cell, but Rogers refused and threatened to throw a nearby garbage can at him. R4 at 85-92. Noble then kicked Rogers in the shin, got behind him, and wrapped his arms around Rogers\u2019 upper torso. <em>Id. </em>at 88. When Noble lost his grip, Rogers turned toward Noble, grabbed him by the waist, picked him up, and slammed him against the wall. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>Odoski, who had been alerted by radio that Noble needed assistance, came to Noble\u2019s aid. <em>Id. </em>at 89; R2 at 160, 200-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Odoski testified that when he reached Noble, he saw Rogers face down, on his stomach, with his arms underneath his body. R2 at 201. Noble was straddling Rogers, attempting to get Rogers\u2019 arms out from under him so that he could be handcuffed. <em>Id. </em>Another deputy, Deputy Supinger, was kneeling beside Rogers, directing Rogers to put his hands behind his back, but Rogers would not comply. <em>Id. </em>at 201-02. When Odoski knelt down on Rogers\u2019 left side, he noticed blood dripping from Noble\u2019s face onto Rogers\u2019 back. <em>Id. </em>at 202. According to Noble, there was so much blood on his face that he was unable to see. R4 at 89. Renney, who also was present, helped Noble up and escorted him to the nurse\u2019s station, while Odoski escorted Rogers. <em>Id.; </em>R2 at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">When they arrived at the nurse\u2019s station, Odoski had to hold Rogers, who was shuffling his feet, twisting his shoulders, and mumbling, against the wall by the back of Rogers\u2019 neck to keep him from turning around to see what was going on behind him. R2 at 168-74, 177, 204-07. After the nurse examined Rogers, Odoski, Renney, and Barrett took Rogers to an isolation cell. <em>Id. </em>at 188-89, 208. Once inside the isolation cell, Rogers freed himself from Odoski, faced him \u201cin a violent manner,\u201d and said, \u201cremember my face, MF\u2019er.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208. Odoski took Rogers\u2019 statement as a threat, believing that Rogers might kick or head-butt him, and \u201ctook him down to the floor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Odoski testified that he knew of Rogers\u2019 violent nature, considered him a very dangerous inmate, and tried to control Rogers as best as he could using the least amount of force necessary. <em>Id. </em>at 211. Odoski was aware of the fight between Rogers and Traylor that had occurred about a year and a half earlier, and that following the fight, Rogers was classified as a Code D inmate, which meant that he was a disciplinary problem and had to be kept in isolation. <em>Id. </em>at 212-13. Odoski recalled that Rogers\u2019 altercation with Noble occurred shortly after Rogers was released back into the general population. <em>Id. </em>at 213-14. Odoski further testified that he knew Rogers was serving a life sentence, and this fact, combined with his knowledge of what Rogers had done to Traylor and his having witnessed the injuries Rogers inflicted upon Noble, led him to perceive Rogers as an extreme threat. <em>Id. </em>at 214-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">Deputy Renney testified that when they were in the nurse\u2019s station on 17 February 2004, Rogers was constantly mumbling and making threats under his breath. R3 at 118, 125-26. Renney recalled that Odoski had his hand on the back of Rogers\u2019 neck or upper back and was trying to hold Rogers\u2019 face in the corner of the room. <em>Id. </em>at 129. When Rogers tried to turn his head, Odoski would push his face so that it was facing straight ahead. <em>Id. </em>at 131. Renney testified that he was aware of the incident that had taken place between Rogers and Traylor and had witnessed what Rogers had done to Noble. <em>Id. </em>at 139-40. Renney also knew that Rogers was serving a life sentence and that he had been a Code D inmate in the past. <em>Id. </em>at 140. Renney stated that, based on this knowledge, he was not going to take any chances with Rogers, whom he considered very dangerous. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">Sergeant Barrett testified that she was present when Odoski had Rogers against the wall in the nurse\u2019s station, but did not observe Odoski or Renney use any excessive force on Rogers, who kept making \u201ctaunting-type\u201d remarks over his shoulder. <em>Id. </em>at 71-73, 101-02. Barrett further testified that she had personally observed Rogers\u2019 attack on Traylor during which Rogers tried to \u201cpull [Traylor\u2019s] eyes out.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107. The defendants then intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>duced into evidence photographs of Tray-lor taken on the day of the altercation. <em>Id. </em>at 108. Barrett recalled that Traylor\u2019s injuries were actually worse than they appeared in the photographs. <em>Id. </em>Barrett testified that on the day in question, she had Rogers\u2019 history in mind when she ordered Odoski to keep Rogers restrained. <em>Id. </em>at 109. Barrett also confirmed that nobody kneed, punched, or beat Rogers in the isolation cell. <em>Id. </em>at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">During closing arguments, defense counsel remarked that the United States was a great country not because of men like Rogers, but in spite of them. R4 at 184. With respect to Rogers\u2019 fight with Noble that occurred after Rogers was released from Code D status into the general population, defense counsel remarked, \u201c[t]his is what happens to people when you give violent inmates an inch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188. Rogers did not object to these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">The jury returned verdicts in favor of the defendants Renney, Barrett, and Odo-ski, and Rogers appeals. R1-110.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">A. <em>Dismissal of Negligence, Assault, and Battery Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">Rogers argues that the district court erred in dismissing as time-barred his state law negligence, assault, and battery claims, contending that such claims were subject to a four-year, rather than a one-year, statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of state law <em>de novo. Price v. Time, </em>416 F.3d 1327, 1334 (11th Cir.2005). Under Florida law, a four-year limitation period applies generally to assault, battery, and negligence claims. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(3)(a), (o) (2002). \u201c[A]n action brought by or on behalf of a prisoner ... relating to the conditions of the prisoner\u2019s confinement\u201d must, however, be commenced within one year of when the cause of action accrued. <em>Id,. </em>\u00a7 95.11(5)(g). With respect to assault and battery, \u00a7 95.11(3)(o) provides that the four-year period applies <em>\u201cexcept </em>as provided in [\u00a7 95.11(5)(g) ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 95.11(3)(o) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-12\">In <em>Nicarry v. Eslinger, </em>990 So.2d 661, 664 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2008), the Fifth District Court of Appeal held that a prisoner\u2019s claim of negligence against the Sheriff of Seminole County, Florida, was an action relating to the conditions of his confinement and was therefore subject to the one-year limitation period under \u00a7 95.11(5)(g), rather than the four-year limitation period under \u00a7 95.11(3)(a). Rejecting Nicarry\u2019s argument that the \u201cfour-year statute of limitations for negligence claims applied because he was challenging a single instance of negligence\u201d rather than \u201ca continuous condition of his confinement,\u201d the court interpreted the phrase \u201cconditions of the prisoner\u2019s confinement\u201d as encompassing both ongoing and isolated prison conditions. <em>Id. </em>at 664-65.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is clear in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>case that, under Nicarry,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rogers\u2019 negligence claim against Judd was subject to the one-year limitation period in \u00a7 95.11(5)(g), rather than the four-year statute of limitation set forth in \u00a7 95.11(3)(a). Although <em>Nicarry </em>does not address assault and battery claims specifically, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(3)(o) explicitly states that the four-year statute of limitations for assault and battery applies \u201cexcept as provided in subsection[ ] ... (5),\u201d that is, except where, as here, the action is brought by a prisoner and \u201crelat[es] to the conditions of the prisoner\u2019s confinement,\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(5)(g). Because the action in this case \u201crelatfed] to the conditions of [Rogers\u2019] confinement,\u201d the four-year statute of limitations prescribed by \u00a7 95.11(3)(o) is inapplicable. The district court thus did not err in dismissing Rogers\u2019s assault, battery, and negligence claims, filed more than three years after the accrual thereof, as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">B. <em>Evidentiary Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">Rogers challenges the jury verdict on his \u00a7 1983 claims on the grounds that the district court improperly allowed the defense to introduce evidence related to his altercations with Noble and Traylor as well as evidence that he was serving a life sentence. He argues that the probative value of this evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>have been excluded. He contends additionally that defense counsel\u2019s statements during closing argument, to wit, \u201c[t]his is what happens when you give a violent inmate a[n] inch,\u201d and \u201cAmerica is a great country not because of men like Russell Rogers[,] [but] despite men like Russell Rogers,\u201d were prejudicial and inflammatory in nature, mandating reversal and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Cook v. Sheriff of Monroe County, </em>402 F.3d 1092, 1103 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we may not reverse the district court unless we find that it made a clear error of judgment or applied the wrong legal standard. <em>Id. </em>at 1104. <em>See also United States v. Merrill, </em>513 F.3d 1293, 1301 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cThe district court has broad discretion to determine the relevance and admissibility of any given piece of evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">\u201cRelevant evidence means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 401. The district court may exclude relevant evidence if it determines \u201cthat the probative value of the evidence \u2018is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Merrill, </em>513 F.3d at 1301 (quoting Fed.R.Evid. 403). <em>See also United States v. Church, </em>955 F.2d 688, 703 (11th Cir.1992) (recognizing \u201cRule 403\u2019s strong presumption in favor of admissibility\u201d). The district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the evidence to which Rogers objected was relevant and that its probative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">The Supreme Court has instructed that when determining whether security measures taken by prison officials violated a prisoner\u2019s Eighth Amendment rights, the relevant inquiry is \u201cwhether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\u201d <em>Whitley v. Albers, </em>475 U.S. 312, 320-21, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 1085, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Factors such as \u201cthe need for the application of force, the relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used, and the extent of injury inflicted, are relevant to that ultimate determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321, 106 S.Ct. at 1085 (quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[E]qually relevant are such factors as the extent of the threat to the safety of staff and inmates, as reasonably perceived by the responsible officials on the basis of the facts known to them, and any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we have noted that an officer\u2019s knowledge of an inmate\u2019s past violent confrontations with prison guards may be relevant to the assessment of the degree of force that a reasonable officer would have believed was necessary. <em>Skrtich v. Thornton, </em>280 F.3d 1295, 1301 n. 7 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">Rogers\u2019 past confrontations with Noble and Traylor, both of which the deputies either witnessed or had knowledge of, was clearly relevant to the issue of the reasonableness of the deputies\u2019 belief that the amount of force used was necessary. Further, we cannot conclude that the district court erred in determining that the probative value of this evidence, including photographs of the injuries sustained by Noble and Traylor, which demonstrated the severity of the harm that Rogers was capable of inflicting if not controlled, outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice. We also agree with the district court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>evidence of Rogers\u2019 life sentence was relevant to the deputies\u2019 perception of the threat he posed and that the probative value of this evidence was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Finally, we reject Rogers\u2019 argument that defense counsel\u2019s statements during closing argument were so prejudicial as to mandate reversal. \u201c[T]he trial judge is given considerable discretion to control the tone of counsels\u2019 arguments and, absent an abuse of discretion, the decision of the trial court, which has had the opportunity to hear the offensive remarks within the context of the argument and to view their effect on the jury, should not be disturbed.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. James, </em>845 F.2d 315, 318 (11th Cir.1988). On review, we look \u201cto the entire argument, the context of the remarks, the objection raised, and the curative instruction to determine whether the remarks were such as to impair gravely the calm and dispassionate consideration of the case by the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">Because Rogers did not raise a contemporaneous objection to defense counsel\u2019s closing statements, we review the admission of those statements for plain error only. <em>Brough v. Imperial Sterling Ltd., </em>297 F.3d 1172, 1179 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cFor there to be plain error, there must (1) be error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects the substantial rights of the party, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of a judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A] finding of plain error is seldom justified in reviewing argument of counsel in a civil case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">The district court did not plainly err in failing to strike defense counsel\u2019s closing remarks. First, counsel\u2019s remark that \u201c[t]his is what happens to people when you give violent inmates an inch\u201d was not improper given the context in which it was made. Counsel made this statement when referencing the injuries that Rogers inflicted on Noble after Rogers was removed from isolation and released into the general population. Furthermore, we cannot say that counsel\u2019s statement that this country is great despite men like Rogers, even if improper, affected Rogers\u2019s substantial rights or the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceeding. <em>See Brough, </em>297 F.3d at 1179-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgments in favor of the defendants and against Rogers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">. In reaching this conclusion, the <em>Nicany </em>court relied on two Supreme Court decisions, <em>McCarthy v. Bronson, </em>500 U.S. 136, 111 S.Ct. 1737, 114 L.Ed.2d 194 (1991) and <em>Porter v. Nussle, </em>534 U.S. 516, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002), both of which addressed, under the Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 631 <em>et seg., </em>and the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), respectively, whether a suit alleging a single instance of excessive force constitutes a challenge to a prisoner's conditions of confinement. In <em>McCarthy, </em>the Supreme Court held that a prisoner\u2019s complaint alleging that prison officials used excessive force when they transferred him from one cell to another was an action \"challenging conditions of confinement\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), which authorizes the \"nonconsensual referral to magistrates for a hearing and recommended findings of prisoner petitions challenging conditions of confinement.\u201d 500 U.S. at 137-38, 143-44, 111 S.Ct. at 1739, 1742. The Court rejected the prisoner's argument that \"[s]uits alleging that administrators acted unconstitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>tionally in an isolated incident ... are not properly classified as 'petitions challenging conditions of confinement,\u2019 \u201d reasoning, in part, that \"the distinction between cases challenging ongoing conditions and those challenging specific acts of alleged misconduct will often be difficult to identify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 111 S.Ct. at 1742. The Supreme Court subsequently held in <em>Porter </em>that the plaintiff-prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit alleging that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated when he was severely beaten by corrections officers was an action with respect to \"prison conditions\u201d under the PLRA and thus was subject to the PLRA's requirement that he first exhaust administrative remedies. 534 U.S. 516, 519-20, 532, 122 S.Ct. 983, 985, 992. The <em>Porter </em>court disagreed with the Second Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the term \"prison conditions\u201d as meaning \"circumstances affecting everyone in the area rather than single or momentary matters, such as beatings directed at particular individuals,\u201d noting that \"in the prison environment a specific incident may be symptomatic rather than aberrational.... An unwarranted assault by a corrections officer may be reflective of a systemic problem traceable to poor hiring practices, inadequate training, or insufficient supervision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522, 530, 122 S.Ct. at 987, 991 (quotation marks and citation omitted). The Court further reasoned that the \"single occurrence, prevailing circumstance dichotomy\u201d made \"scant sense,\u201d at least in the context of the PLRA, because such an interpretation would enable a prisoner to \"have immediate access to a court when a guard assaults him on one occasion, but not when beatings are widespread or routine!.]\u2019\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at. 531, 122 S.Ct. at 991-92. The Court thus concluded that the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement for suits \"with respect to prison conditions\u201d \"applies to all inmate suits about prison life, whether they involve general circumstances or particular episodes, and whether they allege excessive force or some other wrong.\u201d <em>Porter, </em>534 U.S. at 532, 122 S.Ct. at 992. We likewise have held that an inmate's claims of beatings by prison officials were claims related to prison conditions under the PLRA. <em>See Bryant v. Rich, </em>530 F.3d 1368, 1372 (11th Cir.2008) (stating that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) \"applies to all inmate suits alleging excessive force, whether the prisoner alleges an isolated episode of mistreatment or a prolonged and sustained pattern of harassment and intimidation by corrections officers\u201d) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">. Given the lack of any persuasive evidence that the Florida Supreme Court would arrive at a conclusion contrary to that reached by the <em>Nicarry </em>court, we are bound to follow <em>Nicarry </em>in deciding this appeal. <em>Bravo v. United States, </em>577 F.3d 1324, 1326 (11th Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (noting that when applying state law, we are bound to follow an intermediate state appellate court \"unless there is persuasive evidence that the highest state court would rule otherwise\u201d) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">. Rogers argues additionally that the district court erred in admitting evidence regarding his past criminal convictions. The defendants correctly point out, however, that this evidence was first introduced by Rogers. <em>See </em>R2 at 222-23. Rogers is therefore precluded from arguing on appeal that the court abused its discretion in admitting such evidence. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1216 (11th Cir.2005) (\"[I]t is a cardinal rule of appellate review that a party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
