Cantu. Guerra &amp; Moore argues that the state court\u2019s judgment \u2014 that Cantu tortiously interfered with its contract \u2014 establishes a \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d that, under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6), bars discharge of the judgment in Cantu\u2019s bankruptcy. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b983-15\">In May 2007, Guerra &amp; Moore, LTD., LLP, a law firm, filed a lawsuit against Marco A. Cantu, a rival lawyer, in Texas state court. Guerra &amp; Moore alleged that Cantu had, <em>inter alia, </em>tortiously interfered with both a contract and a prospective contract that Guerra &amp; Moore had with clients. <em>See Cantu v. Guerra &amp; Moore, LLP, </em>\u2014 S.W.3d -, -, 2009 WL 3460321 at **1-2 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2009, no pet.). Following trial, the jury made findings in favor of Guerra &amp; Moore and awarded $1.6 million in actual damages. <em>Id. </em>at *2. Specifically, the jury found that: (1) \u201cMark Cantu intentionally interfere[d] with Guerra &amp; Moore[\u2019]s contract with [a client]\u201d; (2) \u201cMark Cantu intentionally interfere[d] with the reasonable probability that Guerra &amp; Moore ... would have entered into a contractual relationship with [a client], by committing an unlawful act that was a substantial factor in preventing the relationship from occurring\u201d; and (3) an award of $1.6 million would \u201cfairly and reasonably compensate Guerra &amp; Moore ... for its damages ... proximately caused by [Cantu\u2019s] intereference.\u201d <em>See id. </em>However, the jury did not answer whether it \u201cf[ou]nd by clear and convincing evidence that the harm to Guerra &amp; Moore ... resulted from malice,\u201d where malice was defined to mean \u201ca specific intent by [ ] Cantu to cause substantial injury to Guerra &amp; Moore.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b983-18\">Before the state court could enter judgment, Cantu filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on May 6, 2008, in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. The bankruptcy court granted relief from the automatic stay to enable the state court to enter judgment in favor of Guerra <em>&amp; </em>Moore, which the state court did on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>August 4, 2008. The same day, Guerra &amp; Moore initiated an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court, contending that the state court judgment was excepted from discharge under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because it established a \u201cwillful and malicious injury.\u201d Guerra <em>&amp; </em>Moore moved for summary judgment, arguing that the jury\u2019s finding of intentional interference with its contract was sufficient to establish an exception to discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(6) and that collateral estoppel prevented Cantu from relitigating the jury\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">In a thoughtful opinion, the bankruptcy court considered Guerra <em>&amp; </em>Moore\u2019s arguments and denied summary judgment, concluding that the state court judgment did not, by itself, establish a \u201cwillful and malicious injury.\u201d Following this ruling, Guerra <em>&amp; </em>Moore stipulated that it would submit no further evidence of \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d beyond the state court judgment, and, given this stipulation, the bankruptcy court entered final judgment in favor of Cantu. Guerra &amp; Moore appealed to the District Court for the Southern District of Texas, which (also in a thoughtful opinion) similarly considered and rejected its contentions, entering final judgment in favor of Cantu. Guerra &amp; Moore now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">II. LEGAL STANDARDS</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">\u201cWe apply the same standard of review as the district court, reviewing the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law <em>de </em>novo.\u201d <em>Laughlin v. Nouveau Body &amp; Tan, LLC (In re Laughlin), </em>602 F.3d 417, 421 (5th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe debtor\u2019s entitlement to a discharge must be determined by federal, not state, law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe exceptions [to discharge] are construed strictly against the creditor and liberally in favor of the debtor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe ... review <em>de novo </em>a court\u2019s decision to give full faith and credit to a state court judgment.\u201d <em>Miller v. J.D. Abrams Inc. (In re </em>Miller), 156 F.3d 598, 601 (5th Cir.1998) (quotation marks omitted); <em>accord Raspanti v. Keaty (In re Keaty), </em>397 F.3d 264, 269 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cA bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to give preclusive effect to a state court judgment is [reviewed] de novo.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-13\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b984-14\">The parties disagree as to whether the state court judgment conclusively establishes the requisite elements to except discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(6). Specifically, Guerra <em>&amp; </em>Moore argues that \u201c[t]he injury in this case is the interference with the contract, not the money damages awarded to compensate for same\u201d and that this \u201cinjury,\u201d found by the jury to be intentional, \u201cestablishes that [Cantu]\u2019s conduct was willful and malicious.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-15\">A. Willful and Malicious Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b984-16\">\u201cSection 523(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code excepts from discharge any debt in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>curred for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity.\u201d <em>Keaty, </em>397 F.3d at 269. We have \u201caggregated \u2018willful and malicious\u2019 into a unitary concept\u201d and held that \u201c \u2018an injury is \u201cwillful and malicious\u201d where there is either an objective substantial certainty of harm or a subjective motive to cause harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270 (quoting <em>Miller, </em>156 F.3d at 606); <em>accord Williams v. IBEW Local 520 (In re Williams), </em>337 F.3d 504, 509 (5th Cir.2003) (discussing these standards). \u201cTo prevail under \u00a7 523(a)(6), a creditor must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the debt is not dischargeable.\u201d <em>Keaty, </em>397 F.3d at 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">\u201c[Pjarties may invoke collateral estoppel in certain circumstances to bar relitigation of issues relevant to dischargeability [and] collateral estoppel can provide an alternate basis to satisfy the elements of \u00a7 523(a)(6).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and alterations omitted). Here, because the judgment was rendered by a Texas state court, we apply Texas rules of issue preclusion. <em>See Miller, </em>156 F.3d at 601. \u201cUnder Texas law, collateral estoppel bars relitigation of any ultimate issue of fact actually litigated and essential to the judgment in a prior suit, regardless of whether the second suit is based upon the same cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">We first note that the fact that \u201ctortious interference with contract\u201d is an intentional tort is not dispositive of our \u00a7 523(a)(6) analysis. <em>See Williams, </em>337 F.3d at 509 (\u201cDespite similarities in the language used to describe an injury under Section 523(a)(6) and intentional torts, Section 523(a)(6) creates a narrower category of tortious conduct.\u201d). Indeed, we have noted that \u201c[m]erely because a tort is classified as intentional does not mean that any injury caused by the tortfeasor is willful.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>156 F.3d at 604. Illustrating this distinction, we recognized in <em>Miller </em>that, under Texas law, \u201cmisappropriation of proprietary information and misuse of trade secrets [we]re wrongful [acts] regardless of whether injury is substantially certain to occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, we declined to find that the wrongfulness of those intentional acts itself established the \u201cinjury\u201d required by \u00a7 523(a)(6). <em>See id. </em>(\u201cMisuse of trade secrets is not precisely like stealing funds from a till, because the tortfea-sor\u2019s gain is not inevitably a loss to the legal owner of the secret.\u201d). We have similarly declined to find the requisite \u201cinjury\u201d on the sole basis of a tortious act in other contexts, instead asking whether there was either an objective substantial certainty of harm or a subjective motive to cause harm that established a \u201cwillful and malicious injury.\u201d <em>See Texas v. Walker, </em>142 F.3d 813, 823-24 (5th Cir.1998) (negligence, breach of contract, and conversion torts do not necessarily involve an intentional injury); <em>accord Keaty, </em>397 F.3d at 274 (looking to the state court\u2019s specific findings to determine whether debtor\u2019s \u201cmotive in filing [a] frivolous claim was to injure [the creditor]\u201d in determining whether a court-ordered sanction was dis-chargeable); <em>see also Rain Bird Corp. v. Milton (In re </em>Milton), 355 B.R. 575, 581-82 (Bankr.N.D.Miss.2006) (relying on findings that debtor\u2019s actions were \u201cwillful, intentional, and malicious\u201d <em>and </em>\u201ccalculated to cause damage to [creditor\u2019s] business\u201d when assessing whether tortious interference with a contract under Mississippi law established a \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">We think that Cantu\u2019s tortious \u201cinterference\u201d with Guerra &amp; Moore\u2019s contract is not, by itself, a sufficient \u201cinjury\u201d for purposes of the \u00a7 523(a)(6) analysis. Thus, though the jury found that Cantu intentionally interfered with Guerra &amp; Moore\u2019s contract, that finding, standing alone, does not establish a \u201cwillful and malicious inju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>ry\u201d so as to except the state court judgment from discharge. Instead, we must look to \u201cthe particularized findings of the jury,\u201d in order to determine whether Guerra &amp; Moore has shown that Cantu\u2019s tor-tious interference with its contract entailed \u201ceither an objective substantial certainty of harm or a subjective motive to cause harm.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>156 F.3d at 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">\n<em>1. Objective Substantial Certainty of Harm</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">We first consider whether Cantu\u2019s \u201cacts were substantially certain to result in injury to [Guerra &amp; Moore].\u201d <em>See Miller, </em>156 F.3d at 604. Under Texas law, \u201cA party alleging tortious interference must prove four elements to sustain its claim: (1) that a contract subject to interference exists; (2) that the alleged act of interference was willful and intentional; (3) that the willful and intentional act proximately caused damage; and (4) that actual damage or loss occurred.\u201d <em>ACS Investors, Inc. v. McLaughlin, </em>943 S.W.2d 426, 430 (Tex.1997). \u201cIntentional interference does not require intent to injure, only that the actor desires to cause the consequences of his act, or that he believes that the consequences are substantially certain to result from it.\u201d <em>Sw. Bell Tel. Co. v. John Carlo Tex., Inc., </em>843 S.W.2d 470, 472 (Tex.1992) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cConsequence,\u201d in this context, refers to the \u201cinterference,\u201d not necessarily the injury. <em>See id. </em>(noting that \u201cjury did not find that [defendant] desired to <em>interfere </em>with [plaintiffs] contract or believed that <em>interference </em>was substantially certain to result from it\u201d (emphasis added)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">Here, the jury found that Cantu intentionally interfered with Guerra &amp; Moore\u2019s contractual relations and that this interference \u201cproximately caused\u201d damages of $1.6 million. However, the jury\u2019s determination that the \u201cwillful and intentional act proximately caused [Guerra <em>&amp; </em>Moore\u2019s] damages\u201d does not establish that the \u201cacts were substantially certain to result in injury to [Guerra &amp; Moore]\u201d for the purposes of the \u00a7 523(a)(6) analysis. <em>Miller, </em>156 F.3d at 604 (\u201c[The debtor\u2019s] conduct, however, could still be \u2018willful\u2019 under the objective standard, if his acts were substantially certain to result in injury to [the creditor]. The state court jury determined <em>only that injury was proximately caused </em>by [the debtor\u2019s] acts, a less demanding standard than \u2018substantial certainty.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added)). As such, Guerra &amp; Moore, by failing to produce evidence beyond the state court record of judgment, has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Cantu\u2019s conduct met the objective prong of the \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d inquiry. <em>See id. </em>at 606 (remanding for factfindings to determine whether \u201c[the debtor\u2019s] actions were at least substantially certain to result in injury to [the creditor],\u201d despite the state jury\u2019s findings that the debtor\u2019s actions proximately caused injury to the creditor).</p>\n<p id=\"pAJY5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>\n<em>2. Subjective Motive to Cause Harm</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"pAst\">Similarly, Guerra &amp; Moore has not established \u201cthat [Cantu] had the subjective motive to cause harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606. The state court jury declined to answer whether Cantu acted with \u201cmalice,\u201d defined to mean \u201ca specific intent by ... Cantu to cause substantial injury to Guerra &amp; Moore.\u201d As such, the state court judgment, by itself, does not establish that Guerra &amp; Moore acted with the \u201csubjective motive to cause harm.\u201d <em>Cf. id. </em>at 604 (\u201cIf the subjective standard alone were the standard, issue preclusion would give [the debtor] victory because the jury found that he did not act with \u2018malice.\u2019 \u201d). Because Guerra &amp; Moore stipulated that the record of the state court judgment was its sole evidence concerning \u201cwillful and malicious injury,\u201d we are compelled to conclude that Guerra &amp; Moore has not \u201cprove[n] by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d that Cantu\u2019s conduct met the subjective standard. <em>See Walker, </em>142 F.3d at 824 (remanding for a factfinding to determine whether debtor met the subjective standard when the state court judgment did not establish the fact).</p>\n<p id=\"pAn1\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"pAaM2\">Accordingly, given that the record of the state court judgment established neither the \u201cobjective\u201d nor the \u201csubjective\u201d prong of the \u201cwillful and malicious injury\u201d inquiry, Guerra &amp; Moore has not shown that its judgment against Cantu for tortious interference with contract should be excepted from discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(6).

Guerra &amp; Moore focuses its arguments on the state court\u2019s finding of tortious interference with its contract and not on the judgment for tortious interference with its prospective relationship, though it contends that the analysis is similar.
