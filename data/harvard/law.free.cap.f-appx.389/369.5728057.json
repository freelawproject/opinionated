He contends: the district court committed procedural error by failing to explain sufficiently its reasons for rejecting his request for a downward variance from the advisory Guideline sentencing range; and, his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-15\">Accordingly, pursuant to <em>Gall, </em>we engage in a bifurcated review of the sentence imposed by the district court. <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009). First, we consider whether the district court committed a \u201csignificant procedural error\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 752-53. If there is no such error, we then review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 751-53. \u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable\u201d. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-17\">\u201c[Wjhen a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation\u201d. <em>Rita v. United States, 551 </em>U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The requirement that the district court explain its sentence may be satisfied by the district court\u2019s listening to the parties\u2019 contentions and then indicating that a sentence within the Guidelines range is appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 357-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456. Here, the district court heard Roel\u2019s contentions, rejected them, and stated that a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range satisfied the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s explanation of the sentence, al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>though brief, was legally sufficient. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 358-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">For substantive reasonableness, as noted, \u201c[a] discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable\u201d. <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). That this court \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Roel has presented \u201cno reason to disturb\u201d the presumption of reasonableness in this case. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 616 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
