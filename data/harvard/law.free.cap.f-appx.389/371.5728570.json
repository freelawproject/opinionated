He argues, as he did in the district court, that the sentence, which exceeded his guideline range of fifteen to twenty-one months under the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s <em>Guidelines Manual </em>(Sentencing Guidelines or Guidelines), is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">We review sentences, whether inside or outside the Sentencing Guidelines range, under the abuse of discretion standard for procedural error and substantive reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Fuentes does not argue that the district court committed any procedural error, so we need only review the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>sentence is unreasonable if it (1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In reviewing a non-Guidelines sentence for substantive unreasonableness the review is for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall </em>at 597-98. We consider the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008). When determining whether or not the Section 3553(a) factors support the sentence, we give deference to a district court\u2019s determination that they support a non-Guidelines sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">Fuentes argues that his non-Guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable because the Sentencing Guidelines adequately accounted for his prior criminal history. However, in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court held that the Sentencing Guidelines were not mandatory. In doing so, it implicitly rejected the position that a sentencing court departing from the Guidelines under Section 3553(a) could give no additional weight to factors included in calculating the Guidelines range, since to do otherwise would essentially render the Guidelines mandatory. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 809 (5th Cir.2008). \u201c[T]he sentencing court is free to conclude that the applicable Guidelines range gives too much or too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>little weight to one or more factors, and may adjust the sentence accordingly under \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation and citation omitted). Therefore, we find that Fuentes\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The district court\u2019s oral and written reasons reflect that the court considered the Guidelines, the policy statements, and, the Section 3553(a) factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense of conviction, Fuentes\u2019s history and characteristics, and the need for the sentence to provide adequate deterrence and to protect the public from further criminal conduct by Fuentes. Specifically, the district court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">\u201cThe Court finds that the advisory guidelines are not adequate; that the defendant\u2019s true assaultive behavior that he has reflected in the criminal history is not properly considered, the seriousness of his characteristics, his history; therefore, making this not the particular application of the guidelines to this case, not taking into account the seriousness of the case, because one of them is the categorization of how we consider the prior convictions. The Court finds for that reason and the need to protect the public and to provide a just sentence that the guidelines are not adequate in this case. Even though all the criminal history convictions technically counted in points, they don\u2019t adequately reflect the seriousness of this defendant\u2019s characteristics.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">On this record, we see nothing to indicate that the court (1) did not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gave significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) made a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors. Although the court gave a non-Guidelines sentence, the extent by which the court varied from the Guidelines range was relatively minor. <em>Cf Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 348-50 (upholding a variance of more than 250% from the guideline range).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion. The sentence imposed \u201cwas reasonable under the totality of the relevant statutory factors\u201d. <em>Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 349 (internal quotation omitted). <em>See also Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d at 807 (upholding an non-Guidelines sentence based on the nature and characteristics of the defendant and his criminal history). We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
