In order to obtain IFP status, Martinez must show both that he is financially eligible and that he will present a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. <em>See Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-21\">Martinez is currently serving a 10-year sentence following his conviction for manslaughter which stemmed from a fatal automobile accident. He now argues that he is the victim of false arrest and malicious prosecution. The district court correctly concluded that Martinez\u2019s claims for damages based on a wrongful conviction may not be pursued until his conviction is overturned, expunged, or otherwise invalidated. <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); <em>Stephenson v. Reno, </em>28 F.3d 26, 27 (5th Cir.1994). Martinez does not address this aspect of the district court\u2019s ruling and has effectively abandoned it. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-22\">Martinez\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merit and we dismiss it as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Martinez\u2019s complaint and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous each count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>caution Martinez that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b473-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
