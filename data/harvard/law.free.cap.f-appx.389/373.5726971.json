Randall claims his trial counsel was ineffective because: at sentencing, counsel denied Randall was the drug transaction\u2019s financial source, despite Randall\u2019s admission in the factual basis, resulting in the loss of a three-level acceptance-of-responsibility reduction; and, counsel failed to investigate the facts of the case and erroneously advised Randall concerning the charges against him, causing his guilty plea to be unknowing and involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The record is insufficiently developed, however, to allow consideration now of Randall\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel; they generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when [they have] not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations\u201d. <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v.
