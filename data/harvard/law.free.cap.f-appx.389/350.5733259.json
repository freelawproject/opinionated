We denied the petition. The Supreme Court vacated our decision and remanded to this court for further consideration in light of its ruling in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>-U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Young, a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago, was admitted as a lawful permanent resident of the United States in March 1976. Removal proceedings were instituted. Young conceded removability based on his guilty plea in 1996 for unlawful possession of marijuana and third degree criminal possession of a firearm, and also on his guilty plea in 2006 for criminal possession of marijuana in the fifth degree. He applied for asylum, for withholding of removal and for relief under the Convention Against Torture. The Immigration Judge found Young ineligible for cancellation of removal because his second marijuana conviction qualified as an aggravated felony under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The BIA affirmed the order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">We denied Young\u2019s petition for review because his 2006 conviction qualified as an aggravated felony despite that he had not been prosecuted as a recidivist under New York law. <em>Young v. Holder, </em>344 Fed. Appx. 944 (5th Cir.2009). We relied on our holding in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263 (5th Cir.2009). The Supreme Court has now reversed <em>Cara-churi-Rosendo, </em>holding that \u201cwhen a defendant has been convicted of a simple possession offense that has not been enhanced based on the fact of a prior conviction, he has not been \u2018convicted\u2019 under [21 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1229b(a)(3) of a \u2018felony punishable\u2019 as such \u2018under the Controlled Substances Act,\u2019 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2).\u201d <em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2589. The defendant must have been <em>\u201cactually convicted </em>of a crime that is itself punishable as a felony under federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">Using this definition, Young was not \u201cactually convicted\u201d under the New York state recidivist statute. Consequently, the BIA\u2019s holding that he was, in reliance on our now reversed caselaw, was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">We VACATE and REMAND to allow Young to pursue cancellation of removal in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b377-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
