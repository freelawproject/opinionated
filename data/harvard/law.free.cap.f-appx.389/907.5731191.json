He argues that the district court clearly erred by applying a three-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(b), based on its finding that he was a manager or supervisor of an offense involving five or more participants. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-24\">A federal grand jury charged Zepeta with conspiring to possess with intent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812, 841(a)(1), and 846 (Count 3); and possessing with intent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812 and 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A) (Count 4). Zepeta pled guilty to Counts 3 and 4 pursuant to a written plea agreement. The district court accepted Zepe-ta\u2019s plea and adjudicated him guilty of those two counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), on October 31, 2006, Zepeta contacted a confidential source (\u201cCS\u201d), stating that he was in Mexico and needed the CS to deliver 55 kilograms of cocaine and pick up the proceeds of the sale at an Atlanta-area location. On November 14, 2006, Zepeta contacted the CS and gave him the telephone numbers of Michael Patterson and Randy Zepeta (\u201cRandy\u201d). The CS arranged a meeting with Patterson and Randy. At the meeting, Patterson and Randy transferred approximately 20 kilograms of cocaine into the CS\u2019s vehicle and left. Zepeta then contacted the CS and instructed him to deliver the cocaine to Alvarado-Mojica. Law enforcement officials replaced the cocaine with fake narcotics, which the CS delivered to Alvarado-Mojica. Agents also followed Patterson and Randy, who met with a woman named Cecilia Zuaso. Zuaso gave Patterson a small box believed to contain $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">According to paragraph 23 of the PSI, after his arrest, Patterson told law enforcement agents that he and Randy drove from Texas to Atlanta with 20 kilograms of cocaine hidden in Patterson\u2019s truck. He stated that Zepeta instructed him to meet with a man and deliver the cocaine. Paragraph 24 of the PSI stated that Patterson also told investigators that, in 2006, he had delivered cocaine from Texas to Atlanta for Zepeta on ten occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">The PSI set Zepeta\u2019s base offense level at 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l), stating that Zepeta could be held accountable for at least 220 kilograms of cocaine, based in part on Patterson\u2019s post-arrest statements regarding the additional cocaine deliveries he made for Zepeta. Zepeta\u2019s offense level was increased by four levels, pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), because Zepeta was an organizer or leader of the offense, which involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. Zepeta received a three-level reduction, pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), for acceptance of responsibility. Thus, Zepeta\u2019s total offense level was set at level 39. Zepe-ta\u2019s total offense level of 39 combined with his criminal history category of I to yield a guideline imprisonment range of 262 to 327 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">Zepeta filed objections to the PSI. First, Zepeta argued that, under his plea agreement, he could be held accountable for only 20 kilograms of cocaine. He specifically objected to paragraph 24 of the PSI, which set forth Patterson\u2019s statements about the additional cocaine deliveries he made for Zepeta. Zepeta also objected to the four-level aggravating role enhancement, arguing that \u201cthere [wa]s no evidence to suggest that [he] and the other co-conspirators were much more than a small courier group.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">At Zepeta\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district court sustained Zepeta\u2019s objection to the drug quantity, listed in the PSI and reduced Zepeta\u2019s base offense level to level 34. With respect to the four-level \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) aggravating role enhancement, Zepeta argued that the offense involved fewer than five participants, because Zua-so was merely a \u201cbuyer.\u201d He contended that the offense was \u201ca one-time drug deal,\u201d and that the \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) enhancement required the existence of a \u201cgenuine enterprise.\u201d Zepeta argued that Patterson\u2019s statement regarding prior narcotics deliveries was unreliable, because it was not made at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">The government responded that the four-level enhancement did not rely upon Patterson\u2019s post-arrest statements, and that evidence of the additional trips \u201cha[d] been and should be excluded.\u201d It asserted that the enhancement was based on the fact that the offense involved five or more participants \u2014 Zepeta, Patterson, Randy, Alvarado-Mojica, and Zuaso \u2014 and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>Zepeta instructed the CS to receive the cocaine delivery and transfer the cocaine to another individual. The court determined that the government had shown that Zepeta managed or supervised five or more individuals, but failed to show that he was an organizer or leader. Thus, it applied a three-level enhancement under \u00a7 3331.1(b), rather than a four-level enhancement under \u00a7 3131.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Based on its findings, the court determined that Zepeta was subject to a guideline range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. It sentenced Zepeta to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment on each of Counts 3 and 4, to be served concurrently, followed by a 5-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">\u201c[We] review[ ] a sentencing court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the crime for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Gupta, </em>463 F.3d 1182, 1197 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cA factual finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and' firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Robertson, </em>493 F.3d 1322, 1330 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">The Sentencing Guidelines instruct courts to increase a defendant\u2019s offense level by three levels \u201c[i]f the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) [of the offense] and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). In determining the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the district court should consider the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afnr\">[T]he exercise of decision making .authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4). \u201cThere is no requirement that all the considerations have to be present in any one case.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1356 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">The defendant need only manage or supervise one other participant for the enhancement to apply. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.2). \u201cA mere buyer/seller relationship is <em>not </em>a sufficient basis to assess a managerial enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Glinton, </em>154 F.3d 1245, 1260 (11th Cir.1998). A defendant\u2019s management of assets, standing alone, also is insufficient to support an enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1. <em>United States v. Glover, </em>179 F.3d 1300, 1302-03 (11th Cir.1999). We have held that the defendant exercised a supervisory or managerial role in the offense where he instructed a co-conspirator to deliver a vehicle containing cocaine to another co-conspirator in Baton Rouge, who would then drive the car to Atlanta, where the defendant sent someone to pick up the vehicle. . <em>United States v. Shazier, </em>179 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">In determining the number of participants in a criminal activity, the district court counts all individuals, including the defendant, who were. criminally responsible for the commission of the offense even though they might not have been convicted. <em>United States v. Holland, </em>22 F.3d 1040, 1045 (11th Cir.1994); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.l). \u201cA person who is not criminally responsible for the commission of the offense (e.g., an undercover law enforcement officer) is not a participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">Section 3Bl.l(b)\u2019s requirement that the offense of conviction involve five or more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>participants or be \u201cotherwise extensive\u201d is met in this case. Zepeta is correct that the CS cannot be considered a participant; however, Patterson, Randy, Alvarado-Mojica, Znaso, and Zepeta himself were all charged for their participation in the offense. <em>See Holland, </em>22 F.3d at 1045; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.1). Although Zepeta argues that Zuaso was merely a \u201cbuyer,\u201d she was still a participant, because she was criminally responsible for her involvement in the offense. <em>See Holland, </em>22 F.3d at 1045. Thus, \u00a7 3B1.1(b)\u2019s requirement that the offense involve five participants is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">The uncontested facts set forth in the PSI also show that Zepeta exercised managerial or supervisory control over Patterson. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n.2). Although Zepeta objected to Patterson\u2019s post-arrest statements set forth in paragraph 24 of the PST\u2014indicating that Patterson delivered cocaine for Zepeta on ten occasions \u2014 Zepeta did not object to paragraph 23 of the PSI, which stated that Patterson told law enforcement agents that he followed Zepeta\u2019s instruction to transport 20 kilograms of cocaine from Texas to Atlanta. There is no buyer/seller relationship between Zepeta and Patterson, but instead a supervisory relationship, as Patterson was following Zepeta\u2019s instructions to deliver the cocaine. The fact that Zepeta provided Patterson\u2019s telephone number to the CS so that Patterson could transfer the cocaine to the CS also indicates that Zepeta was coordinating the drug transaction and that Patterson was acting under Zepeta\u2019s supervision. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4) (instructing courts to consider the defendant\u2019s participation in planning or organizing the offense). Furthermore, Zepeta\u2019s telephone calls to the CS indicate that Zepeta organized not only the transfer of cocaine between Patterson and the CS, but also the transfer between the CS and Alvarado-Mojica. Even though the CS is not considered a participant, these calls indicate that Zepeta exercised significant decision-making authority by determining who would deliver and pick up the cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4). Based on these facts, the district court did not clearly err in applying the three-level \u00a7 3B 1.1(b) enhancement. <em>See Gupta, </em>463 F.3d at 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">Zepeta\u2019s argument that he does not qualify for an aggravating role enhancement because his offense consisted of a \u201cone-time drug transaction\u201d is meritless, because \u00a7 3B1.1 contains no requirement that the underlying offense occur over an extended period of time. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. Although \u00a7 3B1.1(b) in some instances requires the offense to be \u201cotherwise extensive,\u201d the government was not required to make such a showing in Zepe-ta\u2019s case, because Zepeta\u2019s drug trafficking offense \u201cinvolved five or more participants.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(b) (requiring that the offense \u201cinvolve[ ] five or more participants <em>or </em>[be] otherwise extensive\u201d (emphasis added)). Accordingly, based on the undisputed facts set forth in the PSI, the district court did not clearly err in applying the \u00a7 3B 1.1(b) enhancement and we affirm Zepeta\u2019s 151-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
