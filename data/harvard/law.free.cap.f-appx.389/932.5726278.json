Mejia makes three arguments on appeal. First, she challeng\u00e9s the sufficiency of the - evidence with respect to all of her convictions. Second, she argues that the prosecutor\u2019s statements during closing argument, which she did not object to at the time, were improper because they referred to her right to remain silent. Third, she challenges the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2M5.2(a)(l) to set her base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">I. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal on sufficiency of evidence grounds. <em>United States v. Browne, </em>505 F.3d 1229, 1253 (11th Cir.2007). In determining whether sufficient evidence supports a conviction, we \u201cmust view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and decide whether a reasonable fact finder could have reached a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Herrera, </em>931 F.2d 761, 762 (11th Cir.1991). Furthermore, a \u201cjury\u2019s verdict cannot be overturned if any reasonable construction of the evidence would have allowed the jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">To establish conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt \u201c(1) an agreement among two or more persons to achieve an unlawful objective;. (2) knowing and voluntary participation in the agreement; and (3) an overt act by a conspirator in furtherance of the agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Ellington, </em>348,F.3d 984, 989 (11th Cir. 2003). To prove participation in a conspiracy, the government must have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that a conspiracy existed and that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily joined the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Charles, </em>313 F.3d 1278, 1284 (11th Cir.2002). The government need not prove that the defendants knew all of the details or participated in every aspect of the conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>at 1284. Rather, the government must only prove that the defendants \u201cknew the essential nature of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">Whether Mejia knowingly volunteered to join the conspiracy may be proven by \u201cdirect or circumstantial evidence, including inferences from the conduct of the alleged participants or from circumstantial evidence of a scheme.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>405 F.3d 1260, 1270 (11th Cir.2005) (citation and quotations omitted). \u201cIndeed, because the crime of conspiracy is predominantly mental in composition, it is frequently necessary to resort to circumstantial evidence to prove its elements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-14\">In relevant part, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-15\">It shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to deliver or cause to be delivered to any common or contract carrier for transportation or shipment in interstate or foreign commerce, to persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>other than licensed importers, licensed manufacturers, licensed dealers, or licensed collectors, any package or other container in which there is any firearm or ammunition without written notice to the carrier that such firearm or ammunition is being ... shipped.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(e).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-5\">Section 554(a) provides that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-6\">Whoever fraudulently or knowingly exports or sends from the United States, or attempts to export or send from the United States, any merchandise, article, or object contrary to any law or regulation of the United States, or receives, conceals, buys, sells, or in any manner facilitates the transportation, concealment, or sale of such merchandise, article or object, prior to exportation, knowing the same to be intended for exportation contrary to any law or regulation of the United States, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 554(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">Here, the evidence supports the jury\u2019s guilty verdict with respect to all of the convicted counts. The evidence presented at trial showed that Mejia worked closely with others to purchase a number of firearms for export and to deliver several of the purchased firearms to a common carrier without notice to the common carrier that weapons were delivered, and that several of these firearms were actually exported by the common carrier. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we hold that a reasonable construction of the evidence would have allowed the jury to find the Defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Herrera, </em>931 F.2d at 762. We therefore reject Mejia\u2019s argument that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">II. PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">Mejia argues that the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing argument attempted to shift the burden of proof and constituted impermissible comment on Mejia\u2019s failure to testify. While we generally review a prosecutorial-misconduct claim <em>de novo, see United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 947 (11th Cir.2006), because Mejia did not object to the government\u2019s statements during trial, we will review her challenge only for plain error, <em>see United States v. Wilson, </em>149 F.3d 1298, 1302 n. 5 (11th Cir.1998). Under the plain error standard, \u201cthere must be (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>469 F.3d 963, 966 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cIf these three conditions are- met, we may notice the error only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">In reviewing claims of prosecutorial misconduct, we examine the context of the entire trial to determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s statements (1) were improper, and (2) prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the defendant. <em>Wilson, </em>149 F.3d at 1301. A direct reference to a defendant\u2019s failure to testify clearly violates the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, entitling her to a new trial, but an indirect reference to such failure is not reversible error <em>per se. United States v. Norton, </em>867 F.2d 1354, 1364 (11th Cir.1989) (citing <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 612-14, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 1232-33, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965) (prohibiting comments that suggest that a defendant\u2019s silence is \u201cevidence of guilt\u201d)). Instead, the impact of the statement must be assessed in terms of the context in which it was made. <em>Norton, </em>867 F.2d at 1364. A comment will not be deemed an impermissible reference to a defendant\u2019s silence un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>less \u201c(1) it was the prosecutor\u2019s manifest intention to refer to the defendant\u2019s silence or (2) the remark was of such a character that the jury would \u2018naturally and necessarily\u2019 take it to be a comment on the defendant\u2019s silence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Furthermore, it is not improper to comment on the failure of the defense, as opposed to the defendant, to counter or explain the evidence. <em>United States v. Chirinos, </em>112 F.3d 1089, 1100 (11th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">To meet the substantial prejudice prong, the improper comments must have \u201cso infect[ed] the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d <em>United States v. Eyster, </em>948 F.2d 1196, 1206 (11th Cir. 1991) (quotation omitted). We have stated that \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s substantial rights are prejudicially affected when a reasonable probability arises that, but for the remarks, the outcome of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d at 947. \u201cWhen the record contains sufficient independent evidence of guilt, any error is harmless.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Here, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks did not specifically reference Mejia\u2019s failure to testify, the statements do not show a \u201cmanifest intent\u201d to refer to her silence, and the statements could not be interpreted as such comments. Instead, the government implicitly commented on the failure of the defense, rather than the failure of the defendant, to counter or explain the evidence. As such, we discern no plain error in the prosecutor\u2019s comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">III. BASE OFFENSE LEVEL</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">Third, Mejia argues that application of \u00a7 2M5.2(a)(1), which set her base offense level at 26, was improper because only ten firearms were recovered from the sofa and television and therefore her base offense level should have been 14. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2M5.2(a)(1) (directing that the base offense level for exportation of arms, munitions, or military equipment or services without required validated export license shall be 26). We decline to address this argument because Mejia withdrew this objection before the district court and conceded that \u00a7 2M5.2(a)(1) applied, thereby inviting any error. <em>See United States v. Masters, </em>118 F.3d 1524, 1526 (11th Cir. 1997) (holding that where, as here, a defendant raises and then knowingly withdraws an objection to her sentence, the objection may be deemed waived and will not be reviewed on appeal); <em>United States v. Ross, </em>131 F.3d 970, 988 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cIt is a cardinal rule of appellate review that a party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party.\u201d). In any event, her sentencing challenge lacks merit because the record shows that her offense involved more than 10 firearms, and, in fact, involved more than 100, which she readily conceded at sentencing. Thus, she is not entitled to application of \u00a7 2M5.2(a)(2), which reduces the base offense level to 14 \u201cif the offense involved only non-fully automatic small arms (rifles, handguns, or shotguns), and the number of weapons did not exceed ten.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">Accordingly, we affirm Mejia\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-12\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b961-9\">.
