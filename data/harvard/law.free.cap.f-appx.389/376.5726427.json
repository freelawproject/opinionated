Autin Revocable Living Trust, Dora Boudreaux (\u201cBoudreaux\u201d), brought suit against U.S. Flood Control Corporation (\u201cU.S. Flood\u201d) in Louisiana state court, alleging trespass on land owned by the trust. Boudreaux alleged that U.S. Flood, through the actions of its local employee, Toby Champagne (\u201cChampagne\u201d), had, without consent, stored materials on the trust\u2019s land. U.S. Flood removed the suit to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-21\">Following removal, U.S. Flood moved for summary judgment, claiming that it could not be held vicariously liable for Champagne\u2019s actions because he was not acting within the course and scope of his employment. In response to this motion, Boudreaux sought leave to add Champagne as a defendant both in his capacity as an employee of U.S. Flood and in his individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-22\">The motions for leave to amend were referred to a magistrate judge who determined that Boudreaux had been unreasonably dilatory in seeking the amendments and denied the motions. Boudreaux appealed the ruling, arguing that she would be significantly injured if not permitted to add Champagne as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-23\">The district court agreed with Bou-dreaux, permitted amendment of her complaint, determined that the addition of Boudreaux defeated its subject matter jurisdiction, and remanded the suit to Louisiana state court. U.S. Flood appealed this order, noticing both the leave to amend and the remand orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-24\">\u201cBefore we can proceed to the merits of this appeal, we must examine whether we have jurisdiction to do so. We have jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Martin v. Halliburton, </em>601 F.3d 381, 386 (5th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Henry v. Lake Charles Am. Press, L.L.C., </em>566 F.3d 164, 169 (5th Cir.2009)). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(e), \u201c[i]f after removal the plaintiff seeks to join additional defendants whose joinder would destroy subject matter jurisdiction, the court may deny joinder, or permit joinder and remand the action to the State court.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(e). And under \u00a7 1447(d), \u201c[a]n order remand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>ing a case to the State court from which it was removed is not renewable on appeal or <em>otherwise.Id. </em>\u00a7 1447(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">We have construed \u00a7 1447 as prohibiting review of orders remanding cases for lack of subject matter jurisdiction where lack of jurisdiction resulted from joinder of non-diverse parties. <em>See Doleac ex rel. Doleac v. Michalson, </em>264 F.3d 470, 493 (5th Cir.2001) (dismissing appeal because \u201cthe amendment joining [nondiverse party] as a defendant was a separable order but did not come within the collateral order exception. .Therefore, \u00a7 1447(d) bars our review of the remand and also of the amendment itself. Such preclusion, based upon the dictates of \u00a7 1447(d), is not unconstitutional.\u201d). \u201cWe are bound by this precedent.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>601 F.3d at 390 (citing <em>United States v. Rose, </em>587 F.3d 695, 705 (5th Cir.2009) (per curiam)).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
