The magistrate issued an order scheduling the conference. In pertinent part, the scheduling order stated these things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-23\">The Settlement Conference <em>shall </em>be attended by all parties, corporate representatives, and their counsel of record. Each side shall have a party representative present with <em>full authority </em>to negotiate <em>and finalize </em>any settlement agreement reached. Failure of a party representative <em>with full and final authority </em>to make and accept offers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>settlement to attend' this conference, may result in the undersigned\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>recommendation that sanctions be entered against the offending party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">\n<em>SANCTIONS WILL BE IMPOSED FOB FAILURE TO FOLLOW ANY OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS ORDER.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Wassenberg arrived at the scheduled conference but Pinero did not. Wassenberg explained to the magistrate, that she did not think Pinero\u2019s personal presence was necessary given that he had executed a limited power of attorney which gave her full settlement authority. The magistrate noted that this arrangement was unacceptable and refused to allow Pinero to appear by phone or to reschedule the conference for later in the afternoon when Pinero could be present because it conflicted with other scheduled hearings. The magistrate imposed a $2500 sanction against Wassen-berg for her willful failure to have Pinero attend the conference. The district court affirmed the sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">On appeal, Wassenberg argues that the sanction was an abuse of discretion because the language of the scheduling order did not require Pinero\u2019s personal presence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review the imposition of sanctions for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Mroz, </em>65 F.3d 1567, 1571 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">The magistrate\u2019s scheduling order clearly did require Pinero\u2019s personal presence at the settlement conference: it stated that the conference <em>\u201cshall </em>be attended by all parties, corporate representatives, and their counsel of record.\u201d That the order provided in the next sentence that \u201c[e]ach side shall have a party representative present with full authority to negotiate and finalize any settlement agreement reached,\u201d did not negate the earlier sentence that required \u201call parties\u201d to attend. It was not inherently contradictory for the magistrate to order both the parties themselves and the parties\u2019 authorized representatives to appear. Any ambiguity in the order was clarified by the local rule, which requires the attendance of all parties at settlement conferences unless otherwise excused by the presiding judge. S.D.Fla.L.R. 16.2(e) (explaining that \u201c[fjailure to comply with the attendance or settlement authority requirements may subject a party to sanctions by the Court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">Wassenberg\u2019s next argument \u2014 that the limited power of attorney met the requirement that Pinero personally attend\u2014 challenges the magistrate\u2019s authority to require a represented party to attend a settlement conference in person even when that party has sent a representative with full settlement authority. We conclude that the court had both actual and inherent authority to order Pinero\u2019s personal presence. As noted, actual authority existed under Local Rule 16.2(e). We give \u201cgreat deference to a district court\u2019s interpretation of its local rules;\u201d we will not \u201csecond-guess\u201d the district court on such grounds. Clark v. <em>Hous. Auth. of. Alma, </em>971 F.2d 723, 727-28 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">\u2022 While Fed.R.Civ.P. 16<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cdoes not explicitly authorize [district courts] to issue orders directed at represented parties,\u201d we have concluded that \u201cto ensure that the goals of Rule 16 are not frustrated,\u201d district courts have the inherent authority \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>order any party ... retaining full settlement authority ... to produce an individual at the pretrial conference substantially prepared to discuss settlement options; this individual may be the party himself.\u201d <em>See In re Novak, </em>932 F.2d 1397, 1406-07 (11th Cir.1991); <em>see also Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 1389, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962) (noting that district courts have \u201c \u2018inherent power\u2019 not governed by rule or statute but by the control necessarily vested in courts to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Wassenberg also argues that the sanction was excessive. We review for an abuse of discretion \u201cthe district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions in a certain amount.\u201d <em>Martin v. Automobili Lamborghini Exclusive, Inc., </em>307 F.3d 1332, 1336 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(f)(1)(A), \u201cthe court may issue any just orders ... if a party or its attorney ... fails to appear at a scheduling or other pretrial conference.\u201d And under Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(f)(2), \u201c[ijnstead of or in addition to any other sanction, the court must order the party, its attorney, or both to pay the reasonable expenses \u2014 including attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 incurred because of any noncompliance with [Rule 16].\u201d The magistrate cited both of these provisions in its sanctions order.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">We cannot say that the $2500 sanction\u2014 either as a court penalty or Defendant\u2019s costs and attorney\u2019s fees or a mixture of both \u2014 constituted a \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d by the magistrate. <em>See Aldana v. Del Monte Fresh Produce N.A., Inc., </em>578 F.3d 1283, 1288 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that there is a range of choices for the district court and, under abuse-of-discretion review, we will not reverse as long as the court\u2019s decision does not amount to a clear error of judgment). The amount is not an unreasonable calculation of what it cost Defendant to have its lawyer prepare for and attend the settlement conference; nor is it exorbitant when considered as a court penalty imposed to vindicate the integrity of the court and deter future violations. And Wassenberg does not allege that she is financially unable to pay the sanction. <em>See, e.g., Martin, </em>307 F.3d at 1337 (\u201c[s]anction orders must not involve amounts that are so large that they seem to fly in the face of common sense, given the financial circumstances of the party being sanctioned\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b913-13\">.
