In addition to a challenge of the court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear Ana S. Ramirez\u2019s (wife\u2019s) appeal of the juvenile court order, this appeal presents the questions as to who has and what is the appropriate burden of proof in a dispute between a parent and a stepparent on a petition to modify or terminate a prior final custody and visitation decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-15\">The issue presented to us in this appeal is whether the trial court, in addressing a change of custody and visitation petition between the biological mother and the stepfather, must apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>the presumption as defined in <em>Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, </em>65, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 2060, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000), favoring the natural parent over a third-party or stepparent, or if the existence of a prior final decree of a court of competent jurisdiction requires that the court apply the \u201cmaterial change in circumstance and best interest of the child\u201d standard in modifying the prior order. Additionally, wife asserts the trial court erred by failing to award her attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">For reasons that follow, we agree with husband\u2019s contention that the circuit court applied the incorrect standard in deciding whether to terminate his custody and visitation. Accordingly, we reverse the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the mother, the prevailing party below, granting to her all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Bottoms v. Bottoms, </em>249 Va. 410, 414, 457 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1995). The child\u2019s natural father died before she was born. Husband and wife married on June 21, 1999, when the child was approximately three years old. Husband did not adopt the child but he is the only father figure that she has known. Throughout the marriage until the separation the husband and child had a close relationship. During the year after the parties married they had a son, whose custody is not an issue in this appeal. In June 2001, the parties separated, although they remain married. Following their separation, the juvenile and domestic relations district court entered a consent decree which provided that \u201c[t]he parties shall have joint legal and physical custody of the said children----\u201d Between June 2001 and May 2003 the parties shared legal and physical custody of both children pursuant to that decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">On May 14, 2003, wife filed a petition to modify custody, visitation, and support based in part on her having moved from Arlington to Bentonville, Virginia. Following a September 22, 2003 hearing, the juvenile and domestic relations district court denied the petition to change physical custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>but modified the visitation. Wife appealed that ruling to the circuit court. After a <em>de novo </em>hearing, the circuit court found father was a \u201cnon-parent\u201d and, thus, in determining custody the court-applied the \u201cactual harm\u201d standard articulated in <em>Griffin v. Griffin, </em>41 Va.App. 77, 581 S.E.2d 899 (2008). The court concluded that in a dispute between a parent and stepparent where \u201cthere has been no showing by clear and convincing evidence of actual harm to [child] ... [wife\u2019s] request for relief [for sole custody and no visitation] should be granted____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">\n<em>Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">Primarily, husband asserts the trial court lacked juris-' diction over the appeal from the juvenile court order because wife \u201cfailed to provide notice to [him] pursuant to Rule 1:12....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">Rule 8:20 governs the procedure for appealing from a judgment of the juvenile court, and provides as follows: \u201c[A]ll appeals shall be noted in writing. An appeal is noted only upon timely receipt in the clerk\u2019s office of the writing. An appeal may be noted by a party or by the attorney for such party.\u201d Wife timely filed her civil appeal notice, completing the provided form. The rule did not require her to serve husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">In pertinent part, Rule 1:12 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-10\">All pleadings, motions and other papers not required to be served otherwise ... shall be served by delivering, dispatching by commercial delivery service, transmitting by facsimile, delivering by electronic mail when consented in writing signed by the person to be served, or mailing, a copy to each counsel of record on or before the day of filing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-11\">At the foot of such pleadings and requests shall be appended either acceptance of service or a certificate of counsel that copies were served as this Rule requires, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>showing the date of delivery and method of service, dispatching, transmitting, or mailing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Husband asserts, without authority, \u201cthat the \u2018Civil Appeal Notice\u2019 is a pleading as contemplated by Rule 1:12 and was required to be served and required the attachment of a certificate of service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">In an appeal of right, the appeal is \u201cperfected\u201d by the timely filing of a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 8:20. Thus, the notice of appeal, when filed, effectively transfers jurisdiction <em>from </em>the juvenile court to the circuit court and places the named parties within the jurisdiction of the circuit court. <em>See Watkins v. Fairfax County, </em>42 Va.App. 760, 771-72, 595 S.E.2d 19, 25 (2004). The notice of appeal is a document filed with the juvenile court that notifies that court and the circuit court, as well as the parties, that there will be an appeal. Accordingly, it is a purely ministerial document. <em>See id. </em>Wife\u2019s notice of appeal comports with the \u201cpurpose behind rules governing a notice of appeal.\u201d <em>Carlton v. Paxton, </em>14 Va.App. 105, 110, 415 S.E.2d 600, 602 (1992). After the filing of the notice of appeal the juvenile court transferred the pleadings and other specified documents to the circuit court as required by Code \u00a7 16.1-112, whereupon the circuit court \u201cby <em>writing to be served </em>as provided\u201d by statute \u201cnotified] the appellee or his or her attorney that such an appeal ha[d] been docketed.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-112 (emphasis added). Husband does not contend that he never received notice that wife filed an appeal. He only claims he did not timely receive service of process. The appeal was perfected in accordance with the Rules of Court and statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Although husband asserts that mother\u2019s failure timely to notify him that she had appealed the juvenile court\u2019s order in the case regarding her daughter \u201crendered [him] unable to \u2018cross-appeal\u2019 the ruling with respect to [the parties\u2019 son] so that both children\u2019s interest might have been before the circuit court on a <em>de novo </em>hearing,\u201d husband was free to appeal that ruling at his discretion. The case involving the parties\u2019 son was separate and distinct from the case at issue here, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>husband\u2019s decision not to appeal the juvenile court\u2019s ruling in that case cannot reasonably be blamed on wife\u2019s failure to serve her notice of appeal on him. Indeed, had wife filed her notice of appeal with the juvenile court on the last day permitted, husband would not necessarily have received any service within the ten days allowed him to appeal the other case. Husband has failed to demonstrate any prejudice as a result of wife\u2019s failure to serve him a copy of the notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">\n<em>Custody</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">\u201cThe liberty interest at issue in this case \u2014 the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children\u2014 is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.\u201d <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 65,120 S.Ct. at 2060. \u201c[T]he Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66, 120 S.Ct. at 2060. In <em>Troxel, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that a \u201cbreathtakingly broad\u201d visitation statute which permitted \u201cany person\u201d \u201cat any time\u201d to petition the court for visitation rights \u201cunconstitutionally infringe[d] on that fundamental parental right\u201d by authorizing a court to \u201cdisregard and overturn any decision by a fit custodial parent concerning visitation whenever a third party affected by the decision files a visitation petition, based solely on the judge\u2019s determination of the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67, 120 S.Ct. at 2061.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Relying on <em>Troxel, </em>this Court has found that \u201cin a dispute between a fit parent and a non-parent ... the best-interests test should be applied only if the trial court first finds \u2018an actual harm to the child\u2019s health or welfare without such visitation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Griffin, </em>41 Va.App. at 83, 581 S.E.2d at 902 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">However, in cases involving the modification of an existing valid custody order, the party seeking the modification bears the burden of proving that a material change of circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>has occurred since the entry of the initial order and that a change in custody would be in the best interests of the child. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-108; <em>see also Fariss v. Tsapel, </em>3 Va.App. 439, 442, 350 S.E.2d 670, 672 (1986) (citing <em>Keel v. Keel, </em>225 Va. 606, 611-12, 303 S.E.2d 917, 921 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Unlike <em>Troxel, </em>this case involves not an initial \u201cvisitation petition\u201d filed by a \u201cthird party\u201d but an attempt on the part of a natural parent to terminate custody granted to a stepparent pursuant to a final valid consent decree. Similarly, unlike <em>Griffin, </em>this case involves not an initial custody determination, but an attempt to change the agreed upon, and judicially sanctioned, existing custody decision. Thus, this case calls for us to determine the effect or impact that a final prior decree of a court of competent jurisdiction has upon the court\u2019s standard of review in a custody modification hearing involving a fit parent and a non-parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Finding that <em>\u201cGriffin </em>governs,\u201d the trial court concluded husband had failed to demonstrate \u201cby clear and convincing evidence ... actual harm to\u201d the child\u2019s health or welfare by denying him visitation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">In this case, however, a court of competent jurisdiction had entered a consent order in which the parties agreed to \u201chave joint legal and physical custody of\u2019 the child, with the child\u2019s \u201ctime divided equally between them, week by week----\u201d That order was final and binding upon the parties and other courts and resolved the issues of custody and visitation with the child, subject, of course, to any material change of circumstance which would justify a court modifying the prior holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">\u201cA consent decree is a contract or agreement between the parties to the suit, entered of record in the cause with the consent of the court, and is binding unless secured by fraud or mistake.\u201d <em>Orlandi v. Orlandi </em>23 Va.App. 21, 26, 473 S.E.2d 716, 719 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">\u201cDivorcing parents may and, indeed, are encouraged under Virginia public policy, to reach agreement respecting the care and support of their minor children.\u201d <em>Shoup v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number><em>Shoup, 37 </em>Va.App. 240, 248, 556 S.E.2d 783, 787 (2001). \u201c[P]ublic policy favors prompt resolution of disputes concerning the maintenance and care of minor children and the property rights of the parties. Voluntary, court-approved agreements promote that policy and should be encouraged.\u201d <em>Morris v. Morris, </em>216 Va. 457, 459, 219 S.E.2d 864, 867 (1975).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApD\">A party must obey an existing custody order until a modification order supersedes it. \u201c[T]he custody decree is conclusive as to all issues of law and fact decided and as to the custody determination made unless and until that determination is modified pursuant to law.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-135.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-5\"><em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>26 Va.App. 135, 146, 493 S.E.2d 668, 673 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Because the matter on appeal from the circuit court was not an initial custody and visitation determination, wife, as the party seeking to modify the prior custody and visitation consent order, bore the burden of proving that a material change of circumstances had occurred since the entry of the consent order and that a change in visitation would be in the best interests of the child. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-108. By placing the burdens of proof and of going forward with the evidence upon husband to demonstrate that \u201cactual harm\u201d to the child would result by his not being granted custody or visitation rights, the court placed the burdens of proof and production of evidence on the wrong party and applied an incorrect standard. \u201c[WJhere the unchallenged order of a juvenile court remains in effect ... the burden is on a parent who seeks to change the custody to show that circumstances have so changed that the best interests of the child require the transfer.\u201d <em>Harper v. Harper, </em>217 Va. 477, 479, 229 S.E.2d 875, 876 (1976) (citing <em>Dyer v. Howell, </em>212 Va. 453, 456, 184 S.E.2d 789, 792 (1971)). Although the husband is a non-parent, the juvenile court had held in the consent decree that as a stepparent he was entitled to joint legal and physical custody of the child with the child\u2019s time divided equally between them, week by week. The stepfather and child had been exercising the custody and visitation rights for two years. The entry of the consent decree altered husband\u2019s position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>from that of simply a \u201cnon-parent\u201d or third party to that of a judicially approved custodian of the child. The parties had previously agreed that husband was fit to share custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">\u201cCode \u00a7 20-108 gives the divorce court continuing jurisdiction to change or modify its decree concerning the custody and maintenance of minor children, and a contract between husband and wife cannot prevent the court from exercising this power.\u201d <em>Featherstone v. Brooks, </em>220 Va. 443, 446, 258 S.E.2d 513, 515 (1979) (citation omitted). Here the agreement, rather than being merely a custody contract between husband and wife, had been presented and scrutinized and judicially sanctioned by the entrance of the final consent decree. To allow a natural parent to unilaterally rescind a judicially sanctioned consent decree establishing the custodial rights of the parties involved would render all such custody decrees void and unenforceable. Such decrees are daily entered in the courts throughout this Commonwealth and are not violative of the principles established in <em>Troxel </em>or <em>Griffin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Because of the existence of the judicially sanctioned consent decree establishing the custodial rights of the parties, the trial court was required to apply the material change of circumstance and best interests analysis. Requiring the party seeking a modification of a valid custody or visitation decree to prove a material change of circumstances justifying the modification is not inconsistent with or anathema to a parent\u2019s constitutional rights as enunciated in <em>Troxel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we find the circuit court improperly applied the \u201cactual harm\u201d analysis to this modification case. Thus, we remand the case to the trial court for reconsideration in order to apply the proper standard for modification of a custody and visitation decree and to make the necessary findings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>\n<em>Attorney\u2019s Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Wife asserts the trial court erred by failing to award her attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">We are guided by the principle that \u201c[a]n award of attorney\u2019s fees is a matter submitted to the trial court\u2019s sound discretion and is reviewable on appeal only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Graves v. Graves, </em>4 Va.App. 326, 333, 357 S.E.2d 554, 558 (1987). On this record, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in denying wife\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Both parties ask for costs and attorney\u2019s fees for matters relating to this appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-7\">The rationale for the appellate court being the proper forum to determine the propriety of an award of attorney\u2019s fees for efforts expended on appeal is clear. The appellate court has the opportunity to view the record in its entirety and determine whether the appeal is frivolous or whether other reasons exist for requiring additional payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-8\"><em>O\u2019Loughlin v. O\u2019Loughlin, </em>23 Va.App. 690, 695, 479 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1996). Upon consideration of the record in this case, we hold that each party shall bear the appellate costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s decision and remand the case for the court to reconsider the modification petition in proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b857-8\">.
