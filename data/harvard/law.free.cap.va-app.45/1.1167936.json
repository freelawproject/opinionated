BENTON, JR., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">The trial judge found that the Circuit Court of Greensville County previously had decided appeals under the State Grievance Procedure statutes concerning David A. Garraghty\u2019s grievances about retirement benefits and eligibility for the Virginia Law Officers Retirement System. The trial judge ruled, therefore, that Garraghty could not continue to appeal these grievance issues under the Administrative Process Act. Garraghty contends the trial judge erred in dismissing his petitions for appeal. We disagree and affirm the orders dismissing the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">The record in this appeal is sparse and lacks an agency record that normally accompanies an appeal under the Administrative Process Act. We will endeavor to construct the procedural posture of this case by reference to the pleadings filed in the trial court and the exhibits attached to those pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">According to the pleadings, David A. Garraghty began his career at the Department of Corrections as a correctional officer in 1973. In 1992, Garraghty was promoted to chief warden of the Greensville Correctional Center, where he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>remained until his retirement on January 1, 2008. The pleadings further indicate that in preparation for his retirement, Garraghty made inquiries regarding his retirement compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">In April 2002, Garraghty filed a grievance with the Department of Corrections under the State Grievance Procedure (Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.2-3000 to 2.2-3008), asserting that his position as chief warden made him eligible for the Virginia Law Officers Retirement System (VaLORS) and alleging that \u201c[t]he decision to not include his position in the VaLORS program was arbitrary and capricious.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In reply to the grievance, the regional director wrote that \u201cWardens are not identified in ... Code [\u00a7 51.1-212] as being members of VaLORS.\u201d On Garraghty\u2019s appeal of that finding, the Department of Corrections ruled that when VaLORS was first implemented wardens \u201cwere not listed as covered,\u201d that Garraghty was \u201caware since July 15, 1999 that [his] position was not included in this program,\u201d and that Garraghty\u2019s grievance was untimely because it was not filed within thirty days of July 15, 1999. On Garraghty\u2019s next appeal, the Department of Employment Dispute Resolution ruled that although the Department of Corrections determined in 1999 which employees were covered by VaLORS, Garraghty was not then \u201cdirectly and personally\u201d impacted by that determination. The Department of Employment Dispute Resolution further ruled that (i) Garraghty\u2019s grievance was not time barred; (ii) \u201cChief Wardens do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>meet the definition of \u2018correctional officer\u2019 because their \u2018normal duties\u2019 do not entail the \u2018immediate control, supervision and custody of prisoners\u2019 ... [but, rather,] primarily include the \u2018manage[ment] and direction] of the activities of the most complex prisons\u2019 and (iii) Garraghty\u2019s \u201cgrievance does not quality for hearing because [Garraghty] has not presented sufficient evidence that the [Department of Corrections] misapplied state policy by excluding him, as Chief Warden, from the VaLORS Program.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>The pleadings also indicate that during this same time period Garraghty filed another grievance with the Department of Corrections concerning his creditable compensation for retirement. The record does not contain a copy of this grievance or the initial response from the Department of Corrections. The record does contain, however, a ruling by the Department of Employment Dispute Resolution, which indicates that Garraghty believed this grievance qualified for a hearing under Code \u00a7 2.2-8004 and that Garraghty \u201cclaims that [the Department of Corrections] has failed to comply with state and federal law by refusing to provide his full creditable compensation to the Virginia Retirement System ... for the purpose of computing his retirement pay.\u201d The Department of Employment Dispute Resolution made findings and conclusions, including the following: (i) although Garraghty contends his final compensation should include a factor for fringe benefits he received (for example housing, utilities, insurance and meals), the Retirement System has determined as a matter of policy that \u201conly compensation in the form of salary is eligible for inclusion as part of the reportable compensation for retirement\u201d; (ii) no policy or procedure required the Department of Corrections or any employing agency to provide the Retirement System information about perquisites for purposes of computing retirement benefits; and (iii) \u201cthis grievance cannot be qualified for hearing on the basis of an alleged misapplication or unfair application of state or agency policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">Garraghty appealed the rulings on both grievances to the Circuit Court of Greensville County as permitted by Code \u00a7 2.2-3004(E). A judge of that court determined that only questions of law were presented by the petitions for appeal and found \u201cin neither of the above referenced grievances did the Department of Corrections misapply or unfairly apply any personnel policy procedure rule or regulation.\u201d The judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>affirmed the rulings in both grievances by an order entered February 3, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Two months later, the Retirement System sent a letter, dated April 4, 2003, to Garraghty\u2019s attorney acknowledging receipt of a letter \u201cin which [Garraghty\u2019s attorney] requested information\u201d about Garraghty\u2019s retirement benefit. The letter informed Garraghty\u2019s attorney that the Retirement System has a \u201clongstanding policy to place no value on perquisites for the purpose of determining a member\u2019s creditable compensation,\u201d that its \u201ccalculation of ... Garraghty\u2019s retirement benefit reflects the zero value of the perquisites noted in ... Garraghty\u2019s letter of December 10, 2002,\u201d and further noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">Additionally, because the [Retirement System] does not maintain positions for every category of member, it relies on the participating employers to define an employee\u2019s eligibility to participate in the retirement system. In the specific case of correctional officers, the [Department of Corrections] has determined that only uniformed officers up to the rank of major are eligible for coverage under VaLORS. Eligibility for coverage under VaLORS is not determined by the [Retirement System],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The record does not contain either a copy of the letter from Garraghty\u2019s attorney that resulted in this response or a copy of Garraghty\u2019s letter dated December 10, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">On April 7, 2003, Garraghty\u2019s attorney sent a letter to the Department of Corrections detailing the status of Garraghty\u2019s grievance concerning the VaLORS program. Alleging that the Department of Corrections\u2019 ruling that the grievance was time barred had been reversed on appeal, Garraghty\u2019s attorney \u201crequested] a review of this issue and written explanation and/or a final agency decision ... on ... Garraghty\u2019s eligibility for VaLORS.\u201d On April 24, 2003, the Department of Corrections responded, in pertinent part, that during the grievance process its \u201cthird step response to ... Garraghty\u2019s grievance dated 6/7/02 stated, \u2018the Code of Virginia defines what positions are covered under the VaLORS program and I have no authority to place your position in this program.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Based on these letters of April 4, 2003 and April 24, 2003 from the two agencies, Garraghty filed petitions in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, alleging that these appeals arose under the Administrative Process Act. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 2.2-4000 to 2.2-4033. The Department of Corrections and the Retirement System sought dismissal of the petitions, alleging that the court lacked \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d to hear the appeals and that the principle of res judicata compelled dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">The trial judge dismissed both appeals. He ruled that a judge of the Circuit Court of Greensville County had previously affirmed the rulings of the Department of Employment Dispute Resolution and that the order affirming these rulings \u201cis final and cannot be appealed pursuant to Virginia Code Section 2.2-3004(E).\u201d The judge also ruled that \u201cthe issue[s] Garraghty raised in his grievance[s] and that [were] addressed by [those rulings] ... and the Greensville County Circuit Court cannot be pursued again in this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Garraghty contends the trial judge erred in dismissing his petitions. He argues that the Retirement System\u2019s letter of April 4, 2003 and the Department of Corrections\u2019 letter of April 24, 2003 meet the definition of \u201ccase decisions\u201d under the Administrative Process Act. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The Act defines a \u201ccase decision\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">[Ajny agency proceeding or determination that, under laws or regulations at the time, a named party as a matter of past or present fact, or of threatened or contemplated private action, either is, is not, or may or may not be (i) in violation of such law or regulation or (ii) in compliance with any existing requirement for obtaining or retaining a license or other right or benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Code \u00a7 2.2-4001.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">By the statute\u2019s plain meaning, a case decision is the resolution of an agency \u201cproceeding,\u201d (a \u201cregular and orderly progression of a lawsuit\u201d), or an agency\u2019s \u201cdetermination,\u201d (\u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>final decision by a court or administrative agency\u201d). <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1221, 460 (7th ed. 1999). Accordingly, the \u201cheart\u201d of a case decision is a \u201cfact determination respecting compliance with the law,\u201d <em>Kenley v. Newport News Gen. &amp; Non-Sectarian Hosp. Ass\u2019n, </em>227 Va. 39, 45, 314 S.E.2d 52, 55 (1984), and one that involves \u201can application of the law to the facts of [a] particular case.\u201d <em>Strawbridge v. County of Chesterfield, </em>23 Va.App. 493, 499, 477 S.E.2d 789, 792 (1996); <em>see also Virginia Bd. of Med. v. Virginia Physical Therapy Ass\u2019n, </em>13 Va.App. 458, 468, 413 S.E.2d 59, 65 (1991) (holding that \u201c[ajbsent a case decision as defined by the [Administrative Process Act], the [petitioner] could not and cannot bring a suit against [an agency] to challenge the alleged unlawful de facto rule or position of the [agency]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">As a threshold issue, we note that the communications Garraghty received from these agencies are not excluded from the Act\u2019s definition of \u201ccase decision\u201d merely because they are in the form of letters addressed to his attorney. <em>Greenwald Cassell Ass\u2019n v. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, </em>15 Va.App. 236, 239, 421 S.E.2d 903, 905-06 (1992) (holding that a cease and desist letter was the Department\u2019s determination that the defendant was in violation of law, and as such was a \u201ccase decision\u201d). In this case, however, neither letter involves the application of facts to law in an agency proceeding \u2014 the essence of the definition of a case decision. Rather, both letters respond to Garraghty\u2019s request for \u201cinformation\u201d and reference decisions made in past proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The April 7, 2003 letter from Garraghty\u2019s attorney was unmistakably a request for a clarification of the Department of Corrections\u2019 position concerning the grievance matter. The letter related the steps Garraghty had taken during the grievance process and asserted that during the process the Department of Corrections had incorrectly rejected his grievance on a procedural basis and \u201chas never formally stated its position and/or reasoning as to ... Garraghty being eligible or not for VaLORS.\u201d The letter \u201crequested] a review of this issue and written explanation and/or final agency decision of the ... position on ... Garraghty\u2019s eligibility for VaLORS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>In response, the Department of Corrections\u2019 letter of April 24 did no more than explain that it had indeed responded to the merits during the grievance process and that both the Department of Employment Resolution and the Greensville Circuit Court had affirmed the denial of a grievance hearing for that precise reason. This letter fails the Act\u2019s definition of \u201ccase decision\u201d because it simply re-informed Garraghty of the decisions that already had been made through the grievance procedure. The letter provided a written explanation of the reasoning denying the grievance, explaining that the \u201cresponse to ... Garraghty\u2019s grievance ... stated \u2018the Code of Virginia defines what positions are covered under the VaL-ORS program and I have no authority to place your position in the program.\u2019 \u201d In further response to Garraghty\u2019s request for an \u201cexplanation,\u201d the letter closed with the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-4\">The Department of Employee Dispute Resolution ruled that Mr. Garraghty\u2019s grievance was not qualified for a hearing and why. This was consistent with Mr. Angelone\u2019s third step response. It was this decision that the grievance was not qualified for a hearing that the Greensville Circuit Court affirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Thus, the letter expressly references the Department of Corrections\u2019 earlier determination of Garraghty\u2019s claim made in the grievance procedure, and it further referenced the Greens-ville Circuit Court\u2019s affirmance of this determination. The letter simply referred to the agency\u2019s past decisions and, thus, cannot be considered an agency\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d or \u201ccase decision\u201d under the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">As we earlier noted, the record does not contain the letter from Garraghty\u2019s attorney that generated the Retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>System\u2019s April 4, 2003 letter. Thus, the trial judge and we are informed of its tenor only by the Retirement System\u2019s response, which states that the attorney \u201crequested information regarding the retirement benefit for ... Garraghty.\u201d The record contains no indication that the attorney\u2019s letter had the effect of filing a claim for retirement benefits or sought from the Retirement System a \u201cfact determination respecting compliance with the law.\u201d <em>Kenley, </em>227 Va. at 45, 314 S.E.2d at 55.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">As the Attorney General aptly notes, \u201cfor reasons known only to him, Garraghty pursued [the State Grievance Procedure] avenue on the VaLORS issue and the creditable compensation issue.\u201d Indeed, by filing petitions for appeal from responses to his letters seeking an \u201cexplanation\u201d from the Department of Corrections and \u201cinformation\u201d from the Retirement System about the bases underlying the adverse rulings on his grievances, Garraghty merely resurrected the grievance issues and sought to ascribe to these explanatory responses new and independent agency actions. In the absence of a case decision, however, Garraghty had no jurisdictional basis to invoke any provision of the Administrative Process Act. He merely sought to continue the grievance process in an unorthodox manner not sanctioned by any statute or case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">The Attorney General argues that \u201cGarraghty has exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to these two issues, and that he cannot take \u2018another bite at the apple\u2019 by commencing separate, additional appeals under the [Adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>trative Process Act] to re-litigate the same issues.\u201d We need not, and do not, decide whether Garraghty\u2019s claim that he is entitled to VaLORS benefits and creditable compensation for perquisites under retirement programs administered by the Retirement System must be pursued exclusively under either the State Grievance Procedure or the Administrative Process Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We hold, based upon the issue fairly presented by this appeal, only that the two letters at issue in this appeal are not case decisions. They were responses to Garraghty\u2019s requests for information, not to an application or claim for benefits. Thus, Garraghty\u2019s petitions for appeal were nothing more than an attempt to relitigate the grievance procedure issues that had been finally decided in the Circuit Court of Greensville County.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">For these reasons, we affirm the orders dismissing the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-5\">. In 1999, the General Assembly passed legislation establishing the Virginia Law Officers Retirement System, which is administered by the Virginia Retirement System. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 51.1-211 to 51.1-220. Under VaLORS an \u201c \u2018[e]mployee' means ... correctional officer as that term is defined in [Code] \u00a7 53.1-1.\u201d Code \u00a7 51.1-212. Thus, by incorporating this statutory reference, \" 'Correctional officer\u2019 means a duly sworn employee of the Department of Corrections whose normal duties relate to maintaining immediate control, supervision and custody of prisoners confined in any state correctional facility.\u201d Code \u00a7 53.1-1. Documents in the record indicate that under certain conditions, a covered employee with twenty-five years of service retiring on or after October 1, 1999 is eligible for early unreduced retirement at age 50. VaLORS also supplements retirement pensions until the age of 65 for those employees hired after July 1, 1974 who have served 20 years of hazardous duly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b52-4\">.
