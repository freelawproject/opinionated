On appeal, Blackman argues the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment rights under the Confrontation Clause by not granting a mistrial after a witness testified to statements made by Ryan Sullivan, a codefendant, that allegedly incrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>nated Blackman. We affirm Blackman\u2019s conviction, finding no error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to declare a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">One afternoon in September 1999, Timothy Puckett drove to a shopping center in Chesapeake to meet a friend, John Jordan, at NAPA Auto Parts. Aso located in the shopping center was the Village Grill, where Ryan Sullivan (Blackman\u2019s cousin) and Randy Nurse (Blackman\u2019s brother) both worked. As Puckett was pulling into the parking lot, a gray Toyota car cut him off. A fight broke out between Puckett and the two occupants of the Toyota. Jordan arrived and tried to break up the fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">One of the occupants of the Toyota fired a gun, and Puckett fell to the ground. The men began kicking Puckett in the head and ribs as he lay on the ground. The men then \u201cwalked back to the car like they had done nothing\u201d and drove away in the Toyota. Puckett later died from his gunshot wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Five witnesses, including Jordan, identified Blackman at trial as the man who shot Puckett. The two men in the Toyota, witnesses testified, were Blackman and Sullivan. Ballistics testing showed that a bullet found at the crime scene had been fired from a weapon with the \u201csame general rifling class characteristics\u201d as a handgun recovered from Sullivan\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">A grand jury indicted both Blackman and Sullivan. The case proceeded to a joint trial against both codefendants. At trial, Blackman took the stand and claimed he was in Pennsylvania on the day of the shooting. He had nothing to do with the murder, Blackman testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">Sullivan likewise took the stand in his own defense. He corroborated Blackman\u2019s alibi. Sullivan also denied any involvement in the murder, saying he drove up to the crime scene only after the shooting had taken place. During his examination, Sullivan was asked if he had made any statements to an inmate, Anthony Wilson, while in jail awaiting trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Prosecutor: Now, sir, I would like to call your attention to a period of time between October 8 through November 15, 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">Sullivan: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">Prosecutor: And I would like to ask you that during that time, do you remember talking to an individual by the name of Anthony Wilson and telling him that you had been involved in a murder at the Village Grill, that you had left, that you had come back to make it look like you weren\u2019t involved. Do you remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">Sullivan: No, sir. I never told \u2014 never had that discussion with anyone, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">Prosecutor: Do you also remember telling him during this period of time that the police had come by your house numerous times? Do you remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-9\">Sullivan: I never had no such discussion with anyone, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">Blackman\u2019s counsel then cross-examined Sullivan. During a break in this examination, Blackman\u2019s counsel sought leave to ask questions seeking to bolster Sullivan\u2019s testimony, particularly since the prosecution had \u201cchallenged him with a statement from Mr. Anthony Wilson.\u201d The trial judge permitted some, but not all, of Blackman\u2019s questions. During the remainder of cross-examination, Blackman\u2019s counsel asked no specific questions about any statement to Wilson. Counsel did confirm, however, that Sullivan was incarcerated during the time frame of the statement he denied making.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-11\">Counsel: Were you incarcerated as a result of that offense from October 8 to November 15, awaiting pretrial proceedings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-12\">Sullivan: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">Sullivan was then questioned on redirect by his own counsel and then again on recross by Blackman\u2019s counsel. Neither inquired further about the alleged statement Sullivan made to Wilson in jail. After Sullivan left the stand, Blackman\u2019s counsel asked for leave to recall Sullivan for further questioning. The trial judge allowed Blackman\u2019s counsel to recall Sullivan \u201cas your witness.\u201d Sullivan\u2019s counsel raised no objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>tion. Blackman\u2019s counsel questioned Sullivan again, but did not ask about the statement Sullivan had previously denied making.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">After the defense rested, the Commonwealth called Anthony Wilson in its rebuttal case against Sullivan. At Blackman\u2019s request, the trial judge questioned Wilson outside the presence of the jury. Wilson said that, while in jail, Sullivan admitted he \u201cwas involved in a murder\u201d and then left the scene of the crime to take \u201chis cousin somewhere.\u201d Because Sullivan and Blackman were cousins, the trial judge asked Wilson if Sullivan said anything more specific about his cousin. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get into his cousin,\u201d Wilson answered. The prosecutor again noted to the court that he offered this testimony only against Sullivan. To avoid any conflict with Blackman, the prosecutor asked that Wilson be instructed not to make any reference to Sullivan\u2019s cousin.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Blackman\u2019s counsel objected to any testimony from Wilson, claiming that Wilson\u2019s testimony raised \u201ca serious problem\u201d with Blackman\u2019s confrontation rights. After further argument, Blackman\u2019s counsel continued to press a hearsay objection but said he was \u201cgiving up the 6th Amendment issue\u201d in light of the prosecutor\u2019s agreement to bar Wilson from making any indirect reference to Blackman.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">At the joint request of all parties, the trial judge instructed Wilson not to mention anything about Sullivan\u2019s cousin. The judge also gave a cautionary instruction directing the jurors not to consider Wilson\u2019s testimony in the case against Black-man:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">The Court instructs the jury that the testimony of the next witness, Anthony Wilson, is being offered for your consideration in the case against Ryan Sullivan. You are specifically instructed that you cannot consider his testimony in any way in the case against Gordon Blackman.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">During his testimony, Wilson stated that Sullivan admitted being \u201cinvolved in a murder out in front of his club.\u201d After the murder, Wilson recalled, Sullivan said he \u201cleft, him and his cousin. He took his cousin somewhere, and he came back, you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>know like he wasn\u2019t involved.\u201d Sullivan\u2019s counsel objected, and the trial judge sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Blackman\u2019s trial counsel then moved for a mistrial, arguing that the \u201cjury has now been tainted by evidence that it never should have heard. It\u2019s created a full-blown constitutional problem, and the only remedy is a mistrial.\u201d The prosecutor disagreed, arguing that the problem could be \u201ceasily cured with a curative instruction.\u201d The trial judge agreed, holding that the initial cautionary instruction coupled with any curative instruction Blackman wished to offer would suffice as a remedy. The judge invited Blackman\u2019s counsel to proffer a curative instruction. Blackman\u2019s counsel offered none, explaining there \u201cis nothing you can say in my professional judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">After cross-examining Wilson, Blackman\u2019s counsel asked for leave to present surrebuttal evidence seeking to challenge Wilson\u2019s credibility by contradicting testimony he gave about his criminal record. The trial judge allowed the surrebuttal evidence. At no time did Blackman seek to recall Sullivan to the stand during surrebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The jury found Blackman guilty of first-degree murder and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. Sullivan was convicted of malicious wounding. On appeal, Blackman argues that Wilson\u2019s testimony violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. Nothing short of a mistrial, Blackman contends, could have cured this \u201creversible constitutional error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right of a criminal defendant \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const. Amend. VI, cl. 3. On appeal, Blackman primarily relies on two cases in support of his argument that Wilson\u2019s testimony violated the Confrontation Clause: <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), and <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). In our opinion, neither case supports Blackman\u2019s argument.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">A. <em>The Bruton Doctrine &amp; The Testifying Declarant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Bruton </em>held that at a joint trial, the admission into evidence of a <em>nontestifying </em>codefendant\u2019s out-of-court confession violates the Confrontation Clause if the confession incriminates the other defendant. A trial court cannot remedy the constitutional violation of this magnitude with a curative instruction, <em>Bruton </em>found, because the instruction cannot be viewed \u201cas an adequate substitute\u201d for the loss of the opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. <em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 137, 88 S.Ct. at 1628; <em>see also Cruz v. New York, </em>481 U.S. 186, 193-94, 107 S.Ct. 1714, 1719-20, 95 L.Ed.2d 162 (1987); <em>United States v. Truslow, </em>530 F.2d 257, 260 (4th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">The <em>Bruton </em>principle, however, applies only when the codefendant does not testify at trial. <em>See Nelson v. O\u2019Neil, </em>402 U.S. 622, 628, 91 S.Ct. 1723, 1726, 29 L.Ed.2d 222 (1971) (explaining that the \u201cspecific holding\u201d of <em>Bruton </em>was limited to situations where the codefendant could not be cross-examined because he \u201cdid not take the stand\u201d); <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 158, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 1935, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970). Thus, when \u201ca codefendant takes the stand in his own defense, denies making an alleged out-of-court statement implicating the defendant, and proceeds to testify favorably to the defendant concerning the underlying facts, the defendant has been denied no rights protected by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>402 U.S. at 629-30, 91 S.Ct. at 1727; <em>see also Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 206, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 1707, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987) (noting that \u201cthe pretrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>confession of one cannot be admitted against the other unless the confessing defendant takes the stand\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">That is- precisely what happened here. Sullivan took the stand in his own defense. He denied making the statement to Wilson and testified he \u201cnever had that discussion with anyone.\u201d Sullivan also testified favorably to Blackman and confirmed his alibi. Blackman\u2019s counsel questioned Wilson on cross and again on recross. After Wilson was excused, Blackman recalled Sullivan to the stand for further questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Sullivan was not merely <em>available </em>to take the stand as a witness. He was a witness. He was examined not once, but three times, by Blackman\u2019s counsel. Blackman\u2019s assertion that <em>Bruton </em>involved \u201calmost the identical facts as here\u201d overlooks this dispositive dissimilarity between the two cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In short, the fact that Sullivan \u201cwas on the witness stand and subject to cross-examination made <em>Bruton\u2019s </em>exclusionary rule inapplicable.\u201d <em>United States v. Bodden, </em>736 F.2d 142, 144 n. 1 (4th Cir.1984); <em>see also Paden v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 595, 596-97, 529 S.E.2d 792, 793 (2000) (rejecting claim of unavailability when the witness was \u201cpresent at trial\u201d but had not expressly invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>We similarly reject Blackman\u2019s assertion that the Fifth Amendment precluded him, had he chosen to do so, from recalling Sullivan to the stand after Wilson\u2019s testimony. \u201cTaking the stand to testify on the merits in a criminal proceeding is a once-and-for-all waiver of the privilege.\u201d John L. Costello, <em>Virginia Criminal Law &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 43.7-3, at 588 (3d ed.2002). In other words, a \u201ctestifying accused waives his privilege against self-incrimination <em>\u2018absolutely and in all respects.\u201d\u2019 Wells v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 775, 785-86, 531 S.E.2d 16, 21 (2000) (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Thaniel v. Commonwealth, </em>132 Va. 795, 806, 111 S.E. 259, 262 (1922)); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-268 (providing that an \u201caccused may be sworn and examined in his own behalf, and if so sworn and examined, he shall be deemed to have waived his privilege of not giving evidence against himself, and shall be subject to cross-examination as any other witness\u201d). Settled principles of subject-matter waiver explain why:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">It is well established that a witness, in a single proceeding, may not testify voluntarily about a subject and then invoke the privilege against self-incrimination when questioned about the details. The privilege is waived for the matters to which the witness testifies, and the scope of the waiver is determined by the scope of relevant cross-examination. The witness himself, certainly if he is a party, determines the area of disclosure and therefore of inquiry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-6\"><em>Mitchell v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 314, 321, 119 S.Ct. 1307, 1311-12, 143 L.Ed.2d 424 (1999) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law Of Evidence In Virginia </em>\u00a7 7-7(b)(1)(3), at 269 (6th ed.2003) (noting that the scope of subject-matter waiver includes \u201call relevant matters\u201d arising out of the accused\u2019s testimony on direct examination).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Perhaps so, Blackman responds, but in this case the trial judge made an \u201cimplied\u201d holding of unavailability binding on appeal as the \u201claw of the case.\u201d In addition, Blackman contends, we must apply the <em>Bruton </em>doctrine even to a testifying declarant (no matter what the law says on the subject) because the prosecutor never raised this point at trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>and thus waived it on appeal. We find neither assertion persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">First, nothing in the record suggests the trial judge implicitly held that Sullivan was unavailable as a witness \u2014 a counter-intuitive conclusion, at best, given that Sullivan had already been a witness on his own behalf, had separately appeared as a witness for Blackman, and was present in the courtroom throughout the joint trial. It is entirely more likely the judge merely accepted the self-imposed limitations placed on Wilson\u2019s testimony that the party offering it, the Commonwealth, imposed upon itself. By denying Blackman\u2019s mistrial motion and relying instead on a curative instruction (a wholly insufficient remedy under <em>Bruton,) </em>the trial judge did the opposite of what his supposed implicit holding would have legally dictated.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Second, as to the prosecutor\u2019s alleged waiver, the procedural default principles of Rule 5A:18 apply only to grounds asserted as a \u201cbasis for reversal\u201d of the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 670, 675, 576 S.E.2d 228, 231 (2003) <em>(en banc). </em>An appellate court cannot vacate a criminal conviction that violates no recognizable legal principle simply on the ground that the prosecutor (or, for that matter, the trial judge) did not articulate the proper legal basis for it. Thus, an appellee may argue for the first time on appeal any legal ground in support of a judgment so long as it does not require new factual determinations, <em>see id. </em>at 676, 576 S.E.2d at 231, or involve an affirmative defense that must be \u201casserted in the pleadings,\u201d <em>Eason v. Eason, </em>204 Va. 347, 352, 131 S.E.2d 280, 283 (1963), or serve as a subterfuge for a constitutionally prohibited cross-appeal in a criminal case, <em>Hart v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 283, 290, 269 S.E.2d 806, 811 (1980).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>This disparity in treatment under Rule 5A:18 between appellants and appellees stems from the presumption of correctness of trial court rulings<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the corresponding burden on appellants to rebut that presumption.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">B. <em>Crawford &amp; Testimonial Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Blackman argues that <em>Crawford </em>\u201cessentially gutted the older constructs\u201d and instead \u201ckeyed Sixth Amendment jurisprudence principally to whether the statement being offered is testimonial or not.\u201d From there, Blackman reasons that Sullivan\u2019s statement in the jail to Wilson was testimonial under <em>Crawford. </em>Sullivan\u2019s availability or unavailability to take the stand, Blackman then concludes, no longer matters under <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">To begin with, we question whether an inmate-to-inmate conversation (wholly unconnected to <em>any </em>police inquiry) could be fairly characterized as testimonial. <em>Crawford </em>identifies the \u201ccore class\u201d of testimonial evidence to include such things as <em>ex parte </em>testimony, custodial interrogations, affidavits, confessions to police, depositions, prior testimony before a grand jury or at a preliminary hearing, or \u201csimilar pretrial statements that <em>declarants </em>would reasonably expect to be used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>prosecutorially.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is hardly likely Sullivan expected his confession to Wilson would be \u201cused prosecutorially\u2019 at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">In this case, however, we need not stake out the exact boundaries of testimonial evidence under <em>Crawford. </em>Underlying Blackman\u2019s argument is an unacknowledged, but logically necessary, assumption that <em>Crawford </em>somehow changed the settled view that the Confrontation Clause is not violated when the codefendant declarant <em>actually testifies </em>at trial. <em>See Nelson, </em>402 U.S. at 628, 91 S.Ct. at 1726-27; <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. at 158, 90 S.Ct. at 1935; <em>Howard, </em>590 F.2d at 569; <em>Joyner, </em>547 F.2d at 1201.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For all its novelty, on the issue in contest here, <em>Crawford </em>confirms the traditional view that the Confrontation Clause \u201cdoes not bar admission of a statement so long as the declarant is present at trial to defend or explain it.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 59 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. at 1369, n. 9. Seeking to emphasize the point, the majority in <em>Crawford </em>said, \u201cwe reiterate that, when the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause places no constraints <em>at all </em>on the use of his prior testimonial statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. at 162, 90 S.Ct. at 1937) (emphasis added); <em>see People v. Martinez, </em>348 Ill.App.3d 521, 284 Ill.Dec. 546, 810 N.E.2d 199, 212 (2004) (holding no <em>Crawford </em>violation occurs where the declarant was \u201cavailable in court and on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>witness stand\u201d)- For this reason, <em>Crawford </em>supports the trial judge\u2019s decision not to declare a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Because no Confrontation Clause violation took place as a matter of law, there was no infirmity of constitutional magnitude requiring the remedy of a mistrial. We thus affirm Blackman\u2019s conviction for first-degree murder and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-8\">.

Before us, the Commonwealth argues that \"this case goes further than <em>Paden </em>[where no evidence suggested the declarant would take the Fifth and refuse to testify] since the co-defendant in the case at bar had actually testified. Sullivan had been available for cross-examination before; if he was suddenly unavailable, the record should have been made to reflect this fact. Since the defendant failed to show that Sullivan was \u2018unavailable\u2019 \u2014 a prerequisite to a finding of a Confrontation violation \u2014 his Confrontation argument fails.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 20-21. In its harmless error analysis, the Commonwealth continues; \"In the present case, Sullivan not only testified, he specifically denied making the statement attributed to him by Wilson. Furthermore, Blackman had the opportunity to cross-examine Sullivan. Although this cross-examination occurred before Wilson actually testified, nothing prevented the defendant from questioning Sullivan concerning the statement he made to Wilson.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b692-6\">. This description would not directly affect <em>Bruton </em>because the codefendant in that case gave an in-custody confession to law enforcement officers. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 57, 124 S.Ct. at 1367 (citing <em>Bruton </em>as an example of properly suppressed testimonial evidence). The same can be said of <em>Lilly v. Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 134, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 1899, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (1999) (plurality opinion), <em>rev\u2019g </em>255 Va. 558, 499 S.E.2d 522 (1998), which involved a codefendant\u2019s confession in response to police interrogation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b692-7\">. For similar reasons, we do not address whether <em>Crawford </em>ejects from Blackman\u2019s argument any claim of any constitutional magnitude\u2014 leaving him with a mere hearsay objection under Virginia evidentiary law which (unlike a <em>Bruton </em>violation) could have been cured with a cautionary instruction. Cf. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370 (recognizing that its analysis \"casts doubt\u201d on any further application of the Confrontation Clause to nontestimonial evidence).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
