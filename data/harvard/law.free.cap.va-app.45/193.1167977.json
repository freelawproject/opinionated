ELDER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">Edward Thomas Wilson (appellant) appeals from his bench trial conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. On appeal, he contends the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress was error. He argues the off-duty law enforcement officer from another jurisdiction, who observed his driving, acted improperly under color of office to effect a seizure and conduct the investigation that led to appellant\u2019s conviction. He also contends the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to procure or permit him to obtain a blood test amounted to a violation of his due process rights under the United States and Virginia Constitutions. We hold the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, established the off-duty officer did no more than a citizen would have been entitled to do under similar circumstances and, thus, that the \u201ccolor of office\u201d doctrine was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>implicated. We also hold that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to permit or provide a breath or blood alcohol concentration test did not violate appellant\u2019s due process rights under the facts of this case. Thus, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">At about 12:30 a.m. on September 9, 2003, Reed Partlow, an off-duty deputy sheriff from Loudoun County, was passing through Culpeper County with his wife and daughter on the way home from a vacation. While Partlow was traveling in his personal vehicle on a curving, two-lane portion of Route 3 that was marked with a \u201cdouble yellow line for no passing,\u201d a convertible Rolls Royce traveling in the opposite direction \u201calmost collided with [Partlow\u2019s] vehicle head-on\u201d and \u201cactually ran [Partlow\u2019s vehicle completely] off the road.\u201d Partlow was able to turn his van around without losing sight of the convertible and began to follow it. While they followed the convertible through Culpeper, Orange and Spotsylvania Counties, Partlow\u2019s wife contacted authorities in the various counties in an effort to get someone to intercept the convertible.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The convertible\u2019s top was down, and Partlow saw only one person in the car, appellant. When Route 3 \u201cchange[d] into four lane[s] a little further down the road,\u201d Partlow flashed his headlights a few times, \u201ctrying to get [appellant\u2019s] attention and hoping he would pull over,\u201d but \u201c[i]t didn\u2019t appear that [appellant] even noticed.\u201d After additional unsuccessful attempts to get appellant to pull over, Partlow ceased trying to get appellant\u2019s attention and simply continued to follow him.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">When the convertible entered Spotsylvania County, it \u201ccontinued weaving from side to side,\u201d \u201ccrossing the center line several times\u201d \u201cas [two cars] were passing by [it]\u201d in the opposite direction. At one point, the convertible\u2019s right wheels \u201cactually left the roadway\u201d and were \u201con the dirt,\u201d and the convertible \u201cswerved, just barely missing several mailboxes ... and paper boxes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Some distance later, the convertible made \u201ca relatively sharp turn\u201d into the parking lot of a Fasmart convenience store. The convertible then came to a stop directly \u201cin front of the store[, taking] up two spots.\u201d Partlow had followed appellant\u2019s vehicle a total of about ten miles from the point where appellant\u2019s driving had forced Partlow\u2019s van off the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Partlow parked his van about thirty feet away from appellant\u2019s vehicle \u201cso that [he] would be completely away in case [appellant] threw it up in reverse and started to back up.\u201d Partlow was in civilian clothing but put his badge and his holstered service weapon on his belt \u201cbecause [he] wasn\u2019t sure what [he] was getting into at that point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">As Partlow approached the convertible on foot, appellant was stepping out of the driver\u2019s seat, and appellant placed one foot on the ground \u201cbefore [Partlow] even said anything.\u201d When Partlow \u201cgot closer\u201d to the convertible and appellant had placed.one foot on the ground, Partlow</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">identified himself as a deputy sheriff from Loudoun County and advised [appellant] that ... [he] was not from this jurisdiction, that [he] suspected [appellant] was driving under the influence and that [he] had called Spotsylvania County and that they were sending a deputy sheriff and that they would be looking into that situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Although appellant was already in the process of getting out, Partlow asked him to step out of the vehicle. Partlow made no physical contact with appellant at that time. Appellant \u201cfinished stepping out of the car and just stood there\u201d with \u201cboth hands, one on the door and one on the side of the car, as if he was balancing himself.\u201d He told Partlow he had stopped there to get milk on his way home. Appellant asked to see Partlow\u2019s badge, and Partlow showed it to him. Partlow \u201ccould smell the odor of alcohol about [appellant\u2019s] person,\u201d observing that it \u201cseemed to be most notable when he would speak,\u201d and Partlow repeated that he suspected appellant was driving under the influence. Appellant responded that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u201ctrying to get to Culpeper and must have taken a wrong turn,\u201d and he asked Partlow how to get to Culpeper.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Partlow noticed appellant\u2019s eyes \u201chad a glassy appearance,\u201d his speech was \u201cslightly slurred,\u201d and he \u201chad an unsteady gait\u201d that was very different from the gait Partlow saw appellant display later \u201cwhen he came to court the first time.\u201d Partlow asked appellant \u201cif [he] could pat [appellant] down for [Partlow\u2019s] safety, to make sure he didn\u2019t have any weapons on him.\u201d Appellant agreed, and Partlow \u201cpatted him down lightly.\u201d Partlow then asked appellant to walk to the back of the convertible, and while doing so, appellant \u201cgrabbed the vehicle ... three times ... as if to keep him[self] from falling over.\u201d When appellant got to the rear of the vehicle, \u201che couldn\u2019t stand without wavering back and forth,\u201d and Partlow \u201casked him just to put his hands on the trunk of the vehicle to keep from falling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Partlow and appellant stood at the back of the car for about five minutes before the Spotsylvania County authorities arrived. During that time, appellant asked at least three more times to see Partlow\u2019s badge and sheriffs department identification. Appellant also \u201cappeared to be somewhat confused as to where he was\u201d and \u201chad some periods of [what] appeared to be memory lapse[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">While waiting for someone to arrive from the Spotsylvania County Sheriffs Office, Partlow inquired whether appellant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao0\">remembered almost hitting a vehicle head-on near Stevensburg and [appellant] stated, no, no, I don\u2019t remember any of that. And then [Partlow] asked him, ... do you remember running off the road and almost hitting some mailboxes. And [appellant] said, no, I don\u2019t, but ... it may have happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Partlow asked appellant if he had had anything to drink that night, and appellant responded that he had. Partlow then asked \u201cwhen was the last time that [appellant] had had something to drink,\u201d and he responded \u201cabout an hour ago.\u201d When Partlow asked appellant \u201cwhere did he have his last drink,\u201d appellant responded simply that he \u201cwas trying to get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>to Culpeper.\u201d When Partlow asked appellant how much he had had to drink, appellant \u201csaid, well, I\u2019d rather not answer that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">At that point, appellant \u201cappeared to be getting a little bit antsy\u201d about remaining at the scene, so Partlow \u201c[tried] to initiate something that would voluntarily keep him there.\u201d Appellant \u201cnever attempted to leave,\u201d and Partlow \u201cnever actually asked him to stay there\u201d or said \u201cyou\u2019re detained, you can\u2019t leave.\u201d Partlow did, however, tell appellant something like, \u201c[I\u2019m] going to give [you] some field tests for sobriety.\u201d Partlow inquired whether appellant had any physical or health problems that would prevent him from taking the tests, and appellant responded that he did not. Partlow then asked appellant \u201cwhat his education level was.\u201d Appellant \u201cnever really said,\u201d so Partlow inquired whether he could \u201csay [his] ABCs,\u201d and appellant responded that he could. Partlow then \u201cexplained again to him that Spotsylvania was sending a deputy there and that, as soon as they got there, that they were going to take over everything that was transpiring, that everything that was said, I would tell them and they would go from there.\u201d Partlow then said, \u201c[C]an you say your ABCs from A to L?\u201d Appellant responded, \u201cA, and then it was, uh, uh, well, I don\u2019t understand why I have to do this.\u201d At that point, Spotsylvania County Sheriffs Deputy K.C. Butler arrived on the scene, and Partlow had no additional direct contact with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Partlow gave Deputy Butler the keys to appellant\u2019s vehicle, which Partlow had obtained from appellant \u201cat some point\u201d dining the encounter. Partlow may or may not also have given Deputy Butler appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license. Partlow knew he did not ask appellant for his driver\u2019s license but testified \u201che may have asked [appellant] ... <em>if </em>he had a driver\u2019s license.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Deputy Butler, who had been a sheriff\u2019s deputy for only five or six months at that time, responded to the scene as a call about a reckless driver. When Deputy Butler arrived, Part-low suggested to Deputy Butler that appellant should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>charged with driving under the influence. Deputy Butler observed appellant\u2019s behavior, asked him some questions, and informed appellant he suspected appellant of being drunk in public. Deputy Butler did not indicate an intent to arrest appellant for driving under the influence and testified that he believed he could not do so because he did not personally observe appellant\u2019s driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Deputy Butler contacted another officer, Deputy Pittman, to bring a preliminary breath test device to the scene. Deputy Butler advised appellant \u201cof his rights with respect to th[e] preliminary breath test\u201d and the implied consent law by reading from the beige card issued by the sheriffs department even though he did not plan to charge appellant with DUI. Deputy Butler said he gave appellant the implied consent advice even though he was not planning to charge him with DUI because it was \u201cjust a procedure [he did] with everybody.\u201d Deputy Butler also administered three other field sobriety tests. After receiving the results of those tests, Deputy Butler arrested appellant for being drunk in public and transported him to the magistrate\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">When Partlow learned that Deputy Butler planned to charge appellant only with being drunk in public and not with driving under the influence, Partlow followed Deputy Butler and appellant to the magistrate\u2019s office in an effort to obtain a warrant charging appellant with the driving offense. The magistrate would not allow Partlow to charge appellant with DUI, and \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t give a reason.\u201d The magistrate issued a warrant charging appellant with being drunk in public, and appellant was transported to the regional jail, where he was held overnight without bond. Deputy Butler did not offer appellant \u201ca more formal [alcohol concentration] test like the one that\u2019s at the Sheriffs Department on a machine that\u2019s calibrated regularly by the forensic bureau.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The following morning, Partlow contacted the magistrates\u2019 office again and spoke to a different magistrate. He \u201cexplained what had happened, explained what [he] wanted to do and asked [the magistrate] if there was any reason that [he] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>couldn\u2019t [obtain a warrant charging appellant with DUI] and [the magistrate] said, no, absolutely not.\u201d Partlow then drove back to the magistrates\u2019 office and swore out a criminal complaint, and at 11:00 a.m., the magistrate issued a warrant against appellant for DUI. The warrant was served on appellant at 1:24 p.m. that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Prior to appellant\u2019s trial for DUI, he moved to suppress evidence on dual grounds. He contended that because Part-low was out of his jurisdiction, he had the authority to make only a citizen\u2019s arrest and that any evidence obtained after Partlow exceeded the scope of that authority was inadmissible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also contended that Partlow\u2019s actions constituted an arrest for DUI \u2014 even though Deputy Butler obtained a warrant only for being drunk in <em>public </em>\u2014 triggering <em>his </em>rights under the implied consent law to a blood or breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The trial court denied the motion on both grounds, ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">I don\u2019t think ... Partlow ... acted under color of his office. He explained who he was and he explained the presence of the gun, to protect himself, for heaven\u2019s sake. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s getting into with this guy who ... a while ago ran him off the road and has done other erratic driving behavior. But he explained very clearly that he had no jurisdiction, ... wasn\u2019t his bailiwick, he was from somewhere else. So, he didn\u2019t use his position to detain [appellant],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">[W]hat he did in the so-called investigation was to use a ruse. He did what a citizen might do. He said, you know, the police are coming and they\u2019re going to give you this test and he ... used a ruse, if you will, to try to get [appellant], voluntarily, to stay and that [appellant] didn\u2019t take it as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>police officer is pretty well shown by [appellant\u2019s] reaction to it. He starts to do it and then he says, why do I have to do this. He wasn\u2019t ... fooled by the police officer or made to think that he was acting under color of law and under color of office and I don\u2019t think Partlow was. I don\u2019t find that Partlow arrested [appellant] at the scene. He simply took steps to try to get him to stay until the real police officers with the jurisdiction could get there. There was no arrest by Partlow there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">And I don\u2019t think the implied consent law applies at all....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The parties then agreed to offer no additional evidence on the merits of the charge, and the court convicted appellant on the evidence already presented, noting appellant\u2019s case was \u201cone of the strongest cases of DUI without the chemical test\u201d that the court had seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Appellant noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">Appellant makes no \u201ccomplaint\u201d regarding \u201cthe initial arrest or approach by Deputy Partlow\u201d but contends that the encounter became an \u201cinvestigation\u201d and that the information Partlow obtained during that investigation constituted a \u201ccollection of evidence under the color of law\u201d in violation of his constitutional rights because the investigation \u201c[went] far beyond\u201d what \u201ca citizen could or would [have] achieve[d] in the context of a citizen\u2019s arrest.\u201d We disagree. We hold further that the Commonwealth\u2019s actions in failing to procure a blood or breath alcohol concentration test for appellant did not constitute a violation of due process under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">An appellant\u2019s claim that evidence was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment \u201cpresents a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo </em>on appeal. In making such a determination, we give deference to the factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>findings of the trial court and independently determine whether the manner in which the evidence was obtained [violated] the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 568, 573, 570 S.E.2d 836, 838 (2002) (citations omitted); <em>see also Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 691, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1659, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). An appellant has the burden to show that, when the evidence is considered in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress constituted reversible error. <em>Murphy, </em>264 Va. at 573, 570 S.E.2d at 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u201cCOLOR OF OFFICE\u201d DOCTRINE</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The Virginia Supreme Court recognized the \u201c \u2018under color of office\u2019 doctrine\u201d in <em>Hudson v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 371, 377, 585 S.E.2d 583, 586 (2003), describing it as \u201c \u2018prohibiting] a law enforcement officer from using the indicia of his or her official position to collect evidence that a private citizen would be unable [to] gather,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Gustke, </em>205 W.Va. 72, 516 S.E.2d 283, 293 (1999)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">[T]he language of the case law indicates that the \u201cunder color of office\u201d doctrine limits the power to arrest. But this doctrine does not prevent officers from making an otherwise valid citizen\u2019s arrest just because they happen to be in uniform or otherwise clothed with the indicia of their position when making the arrest. When officers outside their jurisdiction have sufficient grounds to make a valid citizen\u2019s arrest, the law should not require them to discard the indicia of their position before chasing and arresting a fleeing felon. Any suggestion that officers could not make a valid citizen\u2019s arrest merely because they happened to be in uniform or happened to be in a police car at the time they inadvertently witnessed a felony outside their jurisdiction would be ridiculous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-9\"><em>Gustke, </em>516 S.E.2d at 293 (quoting <em>State v. Phoenix, </em>428 So.2d 262, 266 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1982) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>In <em>Gustke, </em>the West Virginia Supreme Court interpreted these principles as permitting uniformed officers to make a valid citizen\u2019s arrest for an offense that \u201cwas a misdemeanor that amounted to a breach of the peace and was committed in [the officers\u2019] presence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court approved a citizen\u2019s arrest by an off-duty police officer outside his jurisdiction who \u201cobserved a vehicle that was being driven erratically and was weaving from lane to lane.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286. The officer acting as \u201ccitizen\u201d was still in uniform and driving his marked police vehicle when he made the arrest, which he accomplished by \u201cengaging] the siren and lights on his cruiser.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The officer asked to see the arrestee\u2019s identification and requested that he await the arrival of a deputy sheriff from the appropriate jurisdiction, but he did not collect any \u201cevidence regarding [the arrestee\u2019s] sobriety, or lack thereof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298. The West Virginia Supreme Court held that \u201c[b]ecause [the officer] did not use the indicia of his official position as a law enforcement officer to gather evidence against [the arrestee], we need not decide today whether to adopt the \u2018under color of office\u2019 doctrine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It concluded only that a uniformed officer\u2019s use of his marked vehicle\u2019s emergency lights and siren to effect a traffic stop of an erratic driver, accompanied by a request for identification from that driver, did not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the West Virginia Supreme Court had no occasion to consider the parameters of a citizen\u2019s ability to gather admissible evidence in the course of a citizen\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, <em>Hudson </em>does not require the suppression of <em>any </em>evidence obtained by a police officer effecting a citizen\u2019s arrest. At most, it supports the suppression of \u201cevidence that a private citizen would be unable [to] gather\u201d if the method the officer used to gather that evidence amounted to a constitutional violation. <em>Hudson, </em>266 Va. at 377, 585 S.E.2d at 586 (quoting <em>Gustke, </em>516 S.E.2d at 293). Further, in <em>Hudson, </em>like in <em>Gustke, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court had no occasion to consider the parameters of a citizen\u2019s ability to gather admissible evidence because the officer \u201cmade no attempt of any type to gather evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>against Hudson\u201d and \u201cmerely detained him until a duly authorized police officer arrived.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>266 Va. at 378, 585 S.E.2d at 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The District Court of Appeal of Florida has held that officers acting as citizens \u201cmay investigate and gather evidence only through the use of their own senses and through the voluntary cooperation of citizens; they may not employ the power or color of their office either expressly or by implication in order to gather evidence or ferret out criminal activity not otherwise observable.\u201d <em>Phoenix, </em>428 So.2d at 266 <em>&amp; </em>n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Here, Partlow clearly did not use the color of his office to observe appellant\u2019s erratic driving or to stop appellant\u2019s vehicle after following it for about ten miles. Although Partlow made numerous attempts to signal appellant to stop, Partlow was driving his personal vehicle at the time and was not displaying any visible indicia of his authority as a law enforcement officer when he did so. Only after appellant had already parked his convertible and placed one foot on the ground as he began to exit the vehicle did Partlow approach, wearing his badge and service revolver, and identify himself as a law enforcement officer. Further, Partlow testified that when he told appellant he was a deputy sheriff, he also clearly indicated he was outside his jurisdiction and that he had notified the proper authorities because he believed appellant had been driving while under the influence of alcohol. Appellant provided no evidence to contradict Partlow\u2019s testimony, and the trial court found that testimony credible. Further, although appellant concedes that, per <em>Hudson, </em>Partlow would have been justified in making a citizen\u2019s arrest for DUI, the trial court found that no arrest occurred, and the evidence supports a finding that Partlow\u2019s actions amounted, at most, to a detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Finally, Partlow\u2019s testimony concerning his observations of appellant and appellant\u2019s behavior at the scene of the encounter \u2014 including that appellant smelled of alcohol, had difficulty standing, seemed confused while talking, and claimed not to remember almost running Partlow\u2019s vehicle off the road but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>admitting that \u201cit could have happened\u201d \u2014 constituted evidence that could have been gathered by any citizen engaging appellant in conversation while attempting to detain him until a law enforcement officer from that jurisdiction could arrive. Although appellant argues Partlow\u2019s request to him to perform a field sobriety alphabet test exceeded the scope of a citizen\u2019s authority, appellant refused Partlow\u2019s request to perform such a test. Thus, assuming without deciding that the administration of field sobriety tests is the sort of investigation that would implicate the \u201ccolor of office\u201d doctrine and would amount to a constitutional violation requiring suppression, no evidence resulted from Partlow\u2019s attempts, and there was nothing to suppress. Further, by refusing Partlow\u2019s request to perform that field sobriety test and declining to answer Partlow\u2019s question about how much he had had to drink, appellant indicated an awareness of Partlow\u2019s lack of official authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The trial court expressly found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">[W]hat [Partlow] did in the so-called investigation was to use a ruse. He did what a citizen might do. He said, you know, the police are coming and they\u2019re going to give you this test and he ... used a ruse, if you will, to try to get [appellant], voluntarily, to stay and that [appellant] didn\u2019t take it as a police officer is pretty well shown by [appellant\u2019s] reaction to it. He starts to do it and then he says, why do I have to do this. He wasn\u2019t ... fooled by the police officer or made to think that he was acting under color of law and under color of office and I don\u2019t think Partlow was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, supports those findings and conclusions. Thus, we hold the trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">DUE PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">Appellant contends his due process rights were violated because the implied consent law required the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>wealth to procure or permit him to obtain blood or breath testing to determine his level of intoxication. We hold the implied consent law did not come into play because the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant was not arrested for DUI in the Fasmart parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">A. Any person, whether licensed by Virginia or not, who operates a motor vehicle upon a highway, as defined in \u00a7 46.2-100, in this Commonwealth shall be deemed thereby, as a condition of such operation, to have consented to have samples of his blood, breath, or both blood and breath taken for a chemical test to determine the alcohol, drug, or both alcohol and drug content of his blood, if he is arrested for violation of \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-266, 18.2-266.1 or \u00a7 18.2-272 or of a similar ordinance within three hours of the alleged offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">B. Any person so arrested ... shall submit to a breath test. If the breath test is unavailable or the person is physically unable to submit to the breath test, a blood test shall be given....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Here, the trial court found Partlow did not arrest appellant in the Fasmart parking lot. We held above that the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding and indicates that Partlow\u2019s actions constituted, at most, a detention rather than an arrest. Further, when Deputy Butler arrived on the scene shortly before 1:00 a.m., he arrested appellant for public intoxication rather than driving under the influence. Thus, although Deputy Butler advised appellant of the implied consent law, the Commonwealth had no duty to provide appellant with an opportunity for a blood or breath test based on an arrest for public intoxication. Although appellant was subsequently arrested on a warrant alleging he drove under the influence, that arrest occurred about twelve hours later, at 1:24 p.m. Thus, his DUI arrest did not occur \u201cwithin three hours of the alleged offense,\u201d as required to bring the implied consent and testing provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2 into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">For these reasons, we hold the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, established the off-duty officer did no more than a citizen would have been entitled to do under similar circumstances and, thus, that the \u201ccolor of office\u201d doctrine was not implicated. We also hold that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to permit or provide a breath or blood alcohol concentration test did not violate appellant\u2019s due process rights under the facts of this case. Thus, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-9\">. In his written motion, appellant alleged Partlow \"illegally detained and ... arrested [appellant] while acting under color of law ... in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\" At the hearing on his motion, appellant conceded that <em>Hudson v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 371, 585 S.E.2d 583 (2003), permitted Partlow, acting as a private citizen, to detain and arrest appellant. He argued only that Partlow\u2019s investigation exceeded the scope of that in which a citizen was authorized to engage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
