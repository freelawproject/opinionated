On appeal, he contends the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction because (1) his allegedly perjurious statement was not material and (2) the Commonwealth did not satisfy the \u201ctwo witness\u201d rule. Finding no error, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">\u201cUnder familiar principles of appellate review, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party that prevailed below.\u201d <em>Banks v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 539, 543, 586 S.E.2d 876, 877 (2003). So viewed, the evidence presented at trial established that, in February 2003, Detective Steve Shillingford of the Fairfax County Police Department contacted appellant, who was a suspect in a homicide investigation, and had several conversa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>tions with him. During one conversation, appellant told Shillingford that he \u201chad just received a letter from [Nick] Halteh,\u201d a friend of his, who was also a suspect in the homicide investigation. At the time, Halteh was being held without bond pending trial on charges of robbery and malicious wounding. Appellant and Halteh had grown up together in the same neighborhood and were both members of the \u201cYorkville Crew.\u201d Appellant told Shillingford that \u201cthe letter indicated that [Halteh] wanted him to either find the victim of the robbery and pay him off, or to find out where the person lived so [Halteh] could take care of [him].\u201d In response to the detective\u2019s inquiry, appellant told Shillingford that he did not have the envelope the letter came in. Shillingford then went to appellant\u2019s house and appellant gave him the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The letter read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">Dear Josh,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">What up nigga? aint shit here just chillin, tryin to figure out a way to clean this shit up. I talked to my lawyer &amp; he said I\u2019m gonna get my ass railroaded when I get to court, my only chance is if dude don\u2019t show up \u2014 other than that I\u2019m short, they won\u2019t give me a bond, so there aint no way I can clean up my case. Anyway I\u2019ll give you a call, tell everyone I said what up. Nun, tom-tom, Ahmad ... everyone in Da\u2019 Yorkville Crew.

Oh yea I still haven\u2019t put your name on the visit list But I put in a request form.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">Detective Shillingford gave the letter to the detective who was working Halteh\u2019s case, who in turn gave it to Assistant Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Jay Nanavati, the prosecuting attorney in Halteh\u2019s trial. Believing the letter \u201cshowed ... Halteh\u2019s consciousness of guilt in the case,\u201d Nanavati planned to call appellant as a witness at Halteh\u2019s trial to authenticate the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">Nanavati and Shillingford met with appellant on August 11, 2003, the day before Halteh\u2019s trial on the charges of robbery, malicious wounding, and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. In response to Nanavati\u2019s inquiry whether \u201che still planned on testifying the next day that he had indeed gotten that letter from Nick Halteh,\u201d appellant said he would not testify against Halteh, stating, \u201cHe\u2019s my friend. We grew up together. I\u2019m not testifying against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">Nanavati then issued a Commonwealth\u2019s Subpoena commanding appellant to testify at Halteh\u2019s trial. The next day, appellant was sworn in at Halteh\u2019s trial and testified that he had grown up with Halteh and knew him well. He further testified that he did not receive the letter addressed to \u201cJosh\u201d from \u201cNick\u201d that Nanavati showed him and had \u201cnever seen it before.\u201d When told by Nanavati that he was under oath and subject to penalties for perjury, appellant stated, \u201cI really don\u2019t care. Hold me in contempt of court. Do what you\u2019ve got to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">Nanavati was later able to authenticate the letter using circumstantial evidence, and the letter was admitted into evidence to show Halteh\u2019s consciousness of guilt. It was further adduced through stipulation, that appellant had given Detective Shillingford the letter. Halteh testified in his defense on cross-examination that he wrote the letter and sent it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>to appellant. Halteh explained on redirect examination that the letter was an expression of his belief that the witnesses against him were \u201ctrying to lock [him] up for something [he] didn\u2019t do.\u201d Halteh was subsequently acquitted of the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">On September 15, 2003, appellant was indicted for perjury in connection with his testimony at Halteh\u2019s trial. He was tried by a jury in January 2004. After hearing the evidence, the jury found appellant guilty of perjury and recommended a sentence of nine months in jail and a fine of $2,500. By final order entered February 18, 2004, the trial court imposed the recommended sentence, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Appellant contends, on appeal, that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for perjury because the Commonwealth failed to (1) prove the materiality of the testimony in question and (2) satisfy the \u201ctwo witness\u201d rule. We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">\u201cWhen considering the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal of a criminal conviction, we must view all the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and accord to the evidence all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. The jury\u2019s verdict will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-9\"><em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 406, 409-10, 517 S.E.2d 260, 261 (1999) (quoting <em>Traverso v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 172, 176, 366 S.E.2d 719, 721 (1988) (citations omitted)). \u201c \u2018The credibility of the witnesses and the weight accorded the evidence are matters solely for the fact finder who has the opportunity to see and hear that evidence as it is presented.\u2019 \u201d <em>Donati v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 575, 578-79, 560 S.E.2d 455, 456 (2002) (quoting <em>Sandoval v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 133, 138, 455 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>A. Materiality</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Appellant argues the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to convict him of perjury because the allegedly perjurious statement he made at Halteh\u2019s trial was not material to a proper matter of inquiry in Halteh\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-434 provides that, \u201c[i]f any person to whom an oath is lawfully administered on any occasion -willfully swear falsely on such occasion <em>touching any material matter or thing, </em>... he shall be guilty of perjury, punishable as a Class 5 felony.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, \u201c[i]n order to sustain a perjury conviction under this statute, the Commonwealth [has] the burden of proving: (1) that an oath was lawfully administered; (2) that the defendant wilfully swore falsely; and (3) that the facts to which he falsely swore were <em>material to a proper matter of inquiry.\u201d Mendez v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 97, 102, 255 S.E.2d 533, 535 (1979). (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u201cTestimony is material if it is relevant to a main or collateral issue on trial.\u201d <em>Sheard v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 227, 232, 403 S.E.2d 178, 180 (1991). \u201cEvidence is relevant if it has any logical tendency, <em>however slight, </em>to establish a fact at issue in the case.\u201d <em>Ragland v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 913, 918, 434 S.E.2d 675, 678 (1993) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The ultimate issue in Halteh\u2019s criminal trial was whether Halteh was the criminal actor. Any evidence that tended to prove or disprove Halteh\u2019s guilt was relevant and admissible unless determined to be unduly prejudicial. \u201cEvidence that a defendant \u2018procured, or attempted to procure, the absence of a witness, or to bribe or suppress testimony against him, is admissible, as it tends to show the unrighteousness of the defendant\u2019s cause and a consciousness of guilt.\u2019\u201d <em>Ragland, </em>16 Va.App. at 920, 434 S.E.2d at 679 (quoting <em>McMillan v. Commonwealth, </em>188 Va. 429, 432-33, 50 S.E.2d 428, 430 (1948)). The contents of the letter from \u201cNick\u201d to \u201cJosh\u201d demonstrated a desire by its author to effect the absence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>witness by some means available to the letter\u2019s recipient. Therefore, the letter was inculpatory because it tended to show a consciousness of guilt on the part of the one who wrote and sent it. Hence, evidence establishing the letter\u2019s authenticity and showing that Halteh authored the letter while awaiting his trial would be relevant at Halteh\u2019s trial to prove he was attempting to procure the absence of a witness who could testify as to his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Prior to Halteh\u2019s trial, appellant told Detective Shillingford he \u201chad just received\u201d the \u201cJosh\u201d-to-\u201cNick\u201d letter from Halteh and gave the letter to the detective. At Halteh\u2019s trial, however, appellant testified under oath that he had \u201cnever seen [the letter] before.\u201d Thus, appellant\u2019s failure to testify in accordance with his prior account prevented the Commonwealth from using relevant evidence that tended to prove the authenticity of the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Because appellant\u2019s prior account, if believed, would have authenticated the letter, we hold that appellant\u2019s testimony was material to a proper matter of inquiry in Halteh\u2019s trial. Specifically, appellant\u2019s testimony was relevant to prove that Halteh authored the incriminating letter and was, thus, material to prove Halteh\u2019s guilt. <em>See Carfagno v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 718, 726, 576 S.E.2d 765, 769 (2003). Accordingly, appellant\u2019s assertion and arguments to the contrary notwithstanding, appellant\u2019s testimony at Halteh\u2019s trial \u201ctouch[ed][a] material matter or thing.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-434; <em>see Ganzie v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 422, 429-30, 482 S.E.2d 863, 867 (1997) (holding that, because the witness\u2019 statements were relevant to the issues under consideration at the time the statements were made, \u201cthe statements were material to the issues on trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">B. The \u201cTwo Witness\u201d Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Appellant also argues the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to convict him of perjury because two witnesses did not prove the testimony he gave at Halteh\u2019s criminal trial was false, as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>\u201cWhile the Code has never expressly required corroboration to sustain a perjury conviction, from an early date, our courts have imposed a corroboration requirement.\u201d <em>Keffer v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 545, 547, 404 S.E.2d 745, 746 (1991). Indeed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">\u201c[n]o rule is perhaps better settled than that to authorize a conviction of perjury there must be two witnesses testifying to the falsity of the statement, or one witness with strong corroborating circumstances of such a character as clearly to turn the scale and overcome the oath of the party and the legal presumption of his innocence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 548, 404 S.E.2d at 746 (quoting <em>Schwartz v. Commonwealth, </em>68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 1025, 1027 (1876)). \u201cThis rule is founded upon the idea that it is unsafe to convict in any case where the oath of one man merely is to be weighed against that of another.\u201d <em>Schwartz, </em>68 Va. (27 Gratt.) at 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Thus, \u201ca perjury conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-434 requires proof of falsity from the testimony of at least two witnesses <em>or </em>other corroborating evidence of falsity in the event the case is supported by the testimony of only one witness.\u201d <em>Keffer, </em>12 Va.App. at 549, 404 S.E.2d at 747 (emphasis added); <em>accord Stewart v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 117, 120-22, 468 S.E.2d 126, 127-28 (1996). <em>Compare Donati, </em>37 Va.App. at 578-79, 560 S.E.2d at 456-57 (holding that corroboration is unnecessary where the falsity of the testimony at issue is proven by \u201ccompetent, authenticated, real evidence,\u201d such as a video recording, which \u201cspeaks for itself,\u201d therefore obviating the need for the fact finder to weigh \u201coath against oath\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">[A]lthough the corroborating evidence \u201cmust be of a strong character, and not merely corroborative in slight particulars,\u201d <em>Schwartz, </em>68 Va. [ (27 Gratt.) ] at 1027, it need not be equal in weight to the testimony of a second witness. Rather, the corroborating evidence must confirm the single witness\u2019 testimony in a manner strong enough \u201c \u2018to turn the scale and overcome the oath of the [defendant] and the legal presumption of his innocence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Keffer, </em>12 Va.App. at 548, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>404 S.E.2d at 746[] (quoting <em>Schwartz, </em>68 Va. [(27 Gratt.)] at 1027).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\"><em>Stewart, </em>22 Va.App. at 120, 468 S.E.2d at 127 (third alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Here, when shown the letter from \u201cNick\u201d to \u201cJosh\u201d at Halteh\u2019s trial and asked by the prosecutor if he had previously seen it, appellant testified under oath that he had \u201cnever seen it before.\u201d Conversely, Detective Shillingford testified under oath at appellant\u2019s trial that appellant had personally given him the letter and had described its contents to him. No other witness testified directly that appellant had seen the letter before. \u201cTherefore, unless other evidence corroborates [Shillingford\u2019s] testimony that [appellant] testified falsely about [not having previously seen the letter], appellant\u2019s perjury conviction must be set aside.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Upon our review of the record, we hold that the Commonwealth presented sufficient corroborating evidence to overcome appellant\u2019s oath and the presumption of his innocence. First, the contents of the letter itself tend to corroborate Detective Shillingford\u2019s testimony. The letter is from \u201cNick,\u201d which is Halteh\u2019s first name, and is addressed to \u201cJosh,\u201d which is appellant\u2019s first name. Additionally, the letter refers by name to acquaintances of both men whom appellant could contact. Second, and more importantly, Halteh\u2019s testimony corroborates Detective Shillingford\u2019s testimony that appellant perjured himself. Halteh testified at his own trial that he wrote appellant the letter. The jury could reasonably infer from this admission that appellant, the intended recipient, actually received Halteh\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Taken together, this corroborating evidence \u201c \u2018 \u201cturn[s] the scale\u201d \u2019 in favor of [Detective Shillingford] and overcome[s] the force of [appellant\u2019s] oath.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>22 Va.App. at 121, 468 S.E.2d at 127 (quoting <em>Keffer, </em>12 Va.App. at 548, 404 S.E.2d at 746 (quoting <em>Schwartz, </em>68 Va. (27 Gratt.) at 1027)).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">C. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">Having found that appellant\u2019s perjured testimony was material to an issue properly before the court in Halteh\u2019s criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>trial and that the Commonwealth presented sufficient corroborating evidence at appellant\u2019s trial to satisfy the \u201ctwo witness\u201d rule, we hold that the evidence presented at trial in this case was sufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s perjury conviction. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court and appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
