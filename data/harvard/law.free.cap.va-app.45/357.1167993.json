ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Kenneth Samuel Moses challenges his conviction on two counts of making an obscene display or exposure in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-387. Finding no error in the trial court\u2019s application of the statute to this case, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). That principle requires us to \u201c \u2018discard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and <em>all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis in original and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">On August 8, 2001, Moses walked up to a 10-year-old girl at a Kmart. While he masturbated in front of the child, he told her she was \u201cvery beautiful.\u201d The child saw his hand \u201cthrough his pants\u201d exercising his penis. Pale with fright, the child later told her mother what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">On December 4, 2001, Moses stalked an 11-year-old girl at a Wal-Mart. He made eye-contact with the child and passed her in the aisle several times. As he did so, Moses masturbated with a hand down his pants while looking directly at her. During a brief moment while the child\u2019s mother spoke with a friend, Moses approached the girl. He told her she was a \u201cpretty girl\u201d and asked her how her \u201cbutt felt.\u201d The child ran to her mother confused and upset.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>After his arrest, Moses admitted both incidents. According to him, he used a similar <em>modus operandi </em>about 40 to 50 times with young girls. It \u201ckinda became a habit.\u201d Moses said he would frequent Wal-Mart and Kmart because \u201c[t]hat\u2019s where the crowd is and where you can wander around and look at people.\u201d \u201cIt became a method of letting off steam,\u201d he explained, \u201cbecause I had no other sexual outlet.\u201d His underlying motive, Moses said, was the \u201cneed to fulfill my sex drive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">After reviewing a sex offender evaluation of Moses, the trial judge found him to be a sexual \u201cpredator\u201d and concluded \u201cthe least I can do in this case is to try to prevent you from committing these crimes again by incarcerating you.\u201d Convicted of two counts of obscene display or exposure under Code \u00a7 18.2-387, Moses appeals both convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">At trial, Moses argued that his conduct did not violate Code \u00a7 18.2-387 as a matter of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such behavior can only offend the statute, he reasoned, if it takes place at least partly in the nude. A divided panel of our Court agreed with this reasoning and vacated Moses\u2019s convictions under Code \u00a7 18.2-387. <em>Moses v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 565, 600 S.E.2d 162 (2004). Having reconsidered this case <em>en banc, </em>we now affirm. We come to this conclusion based upon the common law history of this offense and the literal text of the statute codifying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">A. <em>The Common Law Antecedents of Code \u00a7 18.2-387</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">The common law recognized any \u201copen and notorious lewdness\u201d as an indictable offense. 4 William Blackstone, <em>Commentaries on the Law of England </em>*64 (1769). The offense included any \u201cgrossly scandalous and public indecency.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>Id. </em>Virginia adopted this common law restatement. <em>See </em>William W. Hening, <em>The Virginia Justice </em>431 (4th ed. 1825) (stating that \u201cin general, all open lewdness, grossly scandalous, is punishable upon indictment at common law\u201d); James M. Matthews, <em>Virginia Criminal Laws </em>123 (2d ed. 1878) (recognizing crime of \u201copen and gross lewdness and lasciviousness\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">At common law, nudity or near nudity was never the all-important referent. The lewd nature of the <em>conduct </em>itself, if open and notorious, was the main characteristic of the offense. When state legislatures began codifying various subsets of this common law crime, they did not abandon its \u201copen and notorious\u201d characteristic. The history of these codification efforts</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">leads to one of two possible conclusions about the framers\u2019 intentions with respect to the regulation of sexual intercourse and masturbation. On the one hand, it could be inferred that, because the framers so relentlessly prohibited even as little as public nudity, it necessarily follows that public intercourse and masturbation would have been regarded as even more odious and even more obviously subject to state regulation. On the other hand, it could be inferred that, although the framers understood that public nudity could be regulated, they apparently understood that public nudity while engaged in intercourse or masturbation could not (or that both were permissible as long as the offenders kept their clothes on). Frankly, given the evidence that we have described about antebellum public mor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>als, statutes, and case law, we find the latter possibility to be remote, to say the least.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-6\"><em>State v. Ciancanelli, </em>181 Or.App. 1, 45 P.3d 451, 459 <em>(en banc), </em>petition for review allowed, 335 Or. 90, 58 P.3d 821 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">It follows that masturbation in a public place, in a manner obvious to all, falls squarely within reach of the common law. <em>See generally Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 25, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 2615, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973) (noting that patently offensive \u201crepresentations or descriptions of masturbation\u201d are \u201cobscene\u201d); <em>State v. Maunsell, </em>170 Vt. 543, 743 A.2d 580, 582-83 (1999) (upholding conviction for \u201copen and gross lewdness\u201d where defendant \u201cmassag[ed] his genitals through his pants\u201d in a public place); <em>see also United States v. Statler, </em>121 F.Supp.2d 925, 927 (E.D.Va.2000) (observing that \u201cthere is little doubt that masturbation in a public bathroom, if proven, fits well within the federal regulation proscribing \u2018a display or act that is obscene\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">B. <em>Obscene \u201cDisplay Or Exposure\u201d Under Code \u00a7 18.2-387</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Consistent with the common law, Virginia codified a particular type of lewdness offense in Code \u00a7 18.2-387. Leaving little doubt as to its intentions, the General Assembly criminalized the \u201cobscene display <em>or </em>exposure\u201d of one\u2019s person or private parts in a public place. Code \u00a7 18.2-387 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">Moses argues the word \u201cexposure\u201d means nudity and \u201cdisplay\u201d means nothing more, making the disjunctive no more than a redundant conjunctive. We find this reasoning inconsistent with first principles of statutory construction. As has been often said: \u2018Words in a statute should be interpreted, if possible, to avoid rendering words superfluous.\u201d <em>Cook v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 111, 114, 597 S.E.2d 84, 86 (2004); <em>Zhou v. Zhou, </em>38 Va.App. 126, 136, 562 S.E.2d 336, 340 (2002) (observing that \u201cbasic canons of statutory construction\u201d exclude interpretations rendering statutory language \u201csuperfluous\u201d). \u201cIt is the duty of the courts to give effect, if possible, to every word of the written law.\u201d <em>Hodges v. Commonwealth, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>45 Va.App. 118, 126, 609 S.E.2d 61, 65 (2005) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Unless the word \u201cdisplay\u201d is superfluous, it must mean something different from \u201cexposure.\u201d If \u201cexposure\u201d can only mean some degree of nudity, then \u201cdisplay\u201d necessarily means something different. And so it does. Among the definitions of \u201cdisplay\u201d in ordinary speech (particularly where, as here, it is used as a noun rather than a verb) is the \u201cdemonstration or manifestation of something.\u201d <em>American Heritage Dictionary </em>407 (2d coll. ed. 1985).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is just that definition we give to the word \u201cdisplay\u201d when used in other provisions of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">For example, Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 criminalizes the \u201cdisplay\u201d of a firearm while committing a felony. A robber can effectively \u201cdisplay\u201d a firearm in his pocket even though completely hidden from view. <em>Cromite v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 64, 66-67, 348 S.E.2d 38, 39-40 (1986). The word \u201cdisplay\u201d means \u201cnot only the notion of spreading before view or exhibiting to the sight, but also that which is manifested to any of a victim\u2019s senses____\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Smallwood, 346 A.2d </em>164, 167 (Del.1975)). \u201cThus a weapon may be manifested to a victim even though he may not see it\u201d because the ability to otherwise discern the weapon\u2019s presence is itself a manifestation \u201cjust as effective, for the statutory purpose, as putting a gun in plain view.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Deshields v. State, </em>706 A.2d 502, 507 (Del.1998) (finding that robber \u201cdisplays\u201d a weapon by putting his hand in his pocket and then handling the weapon); <em>People v. Butts, </em>181 A.D.2d 432, 580 N.Y.S.2d 758, 758 (1992) (holding that robber displays a weapon by putting his hand inside his jacket and asking victim if it would \u201cmake a difference\u201d if he had a gun).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Moses argues that this understanding of display has been foreclosed by prior Virginia cases. The cases he relies upon, however, do not once mention or discuss the word display as used in Code \u00a7 18.2-387. <em>See, e.g., Wicks v. Charlottesville, </em>215 Va. 274, 274-75, 208 S.E.2d 752, 753-54 (1974) (interpreting local ordinance stating that no \u201cperson shall <em>expose </em>himself\u2019); <em>Noblett v. Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 241, 72 S.E.2d 241 (1952) (affirming a conviction on an indictment alleging that the defendant <em>exposed </em>himself); <em>Siquina v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 694, 697-99, 508 S.E.2d 350, 352-53 (1998) (interpreting the indecent liberties statute, which forbids <em>exposing </em>one\u2019s sexual or genital parts to a child). They instead focus entirely on the meaning of \u201cexpose.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Properly understood, every visible exposure of one\u2019s genitals necessarily involves a display of one\u2019s genitals. But that does not prove the reverse: that every display necessarily includes an exposure. Hence, a robber can still display a handgun in his pocket while not exposing it to sight. So too a man masturbating in public can still display his \u201cperson\u201d or \u201cprivate parts\u201d while not exposing his penis to sight. We thus reject Moses\u2019s claim that the display-or-exposure formulation in Code \u00a7 18.2-387 codifies a mere semantic redundancy, a pairing of interchangeable synonyms.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The trial court found Moses\u2019s public masturbation to be an obscene \u201cdisplay\u201d of his \u201cperson, or the private parts thereof\u2019 in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-387. This conclusion cannot be set aside simply because Moses made this display while fully clothed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-10\">. As he concedes on appeal, Moses never challenged the obscene nature of his conduct. Rule 5A:18 precludes him from asserting this challenge for the first time on appeal. No basis exists in this case for invoking the \"good cause\u201d or \"ends of justice\u201d exceptions to Rule 5A:18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\">. The \"best construction\u201d of a statute codifying common law principles is the one \"most near to the reason of the common law, and by the course which that observes in cases of its own.\u201d <em>Chichester v. Vass, </em>5 Va. (1 Call) 83, 102 (1797), quoted in part in <em>Wicks v. Charlottesville, </em>215 Va. 274, 276, 208 S.E.2d 752, 755 (1974). \"The reason is that the Legislature is presumed to have known and to have had the common law in mind in the enactment of a statute. The statute must therefore be read along with the provisions of the common law, and the latter will be read into the statute unless it clearly appears from express language or by necessary implication that the purpose of the statute was to change the common law.\u201d <em>Wicks, </em>215 Va. at 276, 208 S.E.2d at 755.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\">. This point demonstrates the irrelevance of cases like <em>State v. Jaime, </em>4 Conn.Cir.Ct. 530, 236 A.2d 474, 475 (1967), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Wymore, </em>98 Idaho 197, 560 P.2d 868, 869-70 (1977). The indecency laws in those cases only make it unlawful to \u201cexpose\u201d the person or private parts\u2014 but do not go further and criminalize the \u201cdisplay\" of the person or private parts, as does Code \u00a7 18.2-387.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b412-9\">.

J., and ELDER, J., join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The sole issue in this case is whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offenses charged in the arrest warrant: that on two occasions Kenneth Samuel Moses \u201cdid unlawfully in violation of [Code \u00a7 ] 18.2-387 ... intentionally make an obscene display of [his] person or private parts in a public place or in a place where a child under the age of 18 years and others were present.\u201d Because I believe that Code \u00a7 18.2-387 codified the common law\u2019s understanding of \u201cexpose\u201d and \u201cdisplay\u201d to mean without clothes, I do not believe Moses\u2019s behavior falls within the purview of the statute. I would, therefore, reverse the misdemeanor convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">This issue, whether Moses\u2019s conduct fell within the purview of the statute, was clouded in this case from the beginning. At the bench trial, the prosecutor informed the judge as follows in his opening statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">[W]e must tell the Court that <em>the only issue before the Court from the Commonwealth\u2019s perspective is does the defendant\u2019s conduct constitute indecent exposure of his person </em>as opposed to his private parts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">Judge, that issue is not decided in the Commonwealth, what does it mean to expose your person. The Commonwealth does have a case from Iowa in 1977. That\u2019s the only jurisdiction that we found that provides some insight. I will tell you that that case is contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s position. Iowa said if you don\u2019t expose the actual skin itself, there is no indecent exposure. This issue is not decided in the Commonwealth of Virginia. We\u2019re going to ask the Court to basically make some law today. And I believe [Moses\u2019s attorney] will argue that point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">Moses\u2019s attorney responded, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-12\">Judge, if you\u2019re going to make law today, I would submit to you it\u2019s going to be bad law. Because what [the prosecutor] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>is saying is if someone goes up, a male usually, in most cases it\u2019s going to be a male, goes up and just scratches at his crotch area because he has an itch to scratch or something like that, that could possibly be considered to be exhibiting something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">And I would submit to the Court that can\u2019t be the case. It would just be too easy for too many people to say I saw him grab his genital area. Without \u2014 our position is that without exposure of actual flesh, that that\u2019s \u2014 there is no conviction. Just rubbing parts of your clothing should not be a crime. You know, you can\u2019t protect people from \u2014 we would submit you can\u2019t protect people from everything bad that\u2019s going to happen. While this event shouldn\u2019t have been done, it wasn\u2019t in good taste, it obviously shouldn\u2019t have been done, we don\u2019t think it meets the meaning of a crime under the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">At trial, a ten-year-old girl testified that when Moses began a conversation with her in a store he had his hands in his pants as he talked to her. She saw \u201chis hand through his pants\u201d and said his hand was rubbing his penis. She also testified that she did not see the \u201cshape of his penis under his clothes.\u201d The eleven-year-old girl testified she saw Moses in another store on another occasion behind a display rack. He was looking at her and \u201crubbing himself ... [i]n his private area.\u201d She described it as the place \u201caround his waist.\u201d She told her mother \u201cthat ... man was adjusting himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the prosecutor argued several points, including the assertion \u201cthat the statute is contemplating types of displays or exposures where private parts of an individual are not seen. And that\u2019s why the statute has person or private parts.\u201d Moses\u2019s attorney argued that if the statute \u201ctaken to mean an obscene display, there certainly are no standards for deciding what a display is[, and in] our opinion \u2014 we would argue in this case that a display is not something you can decide.\u201d He also argued that the statute required proof that the defendant \u201cactually exposed some skin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>In pertinent part, the trial judge found the evidence regarding the misdemeanor charges to prove the following conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqW\">And this fact finder is going to find that the conduct of Mr. Moses was not acceptable in our community and that it violates the standards of sexual candor. It\u2019s clear that he was grabbing his parts when he approached these two young girls in Wal-Mart and Kmart. And that one girl testified he had his hand in his pants as if he were manipulating himself or masturbating himself. And the other girl testified he was grabbing his parts and looking at her. And that\u2019s not the same as if you see a baseball player or football player or somebody else sometimes may grab their parts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-387 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">Every person who intentionally makes an obscene display or exposure of his person, or the private parts thereof, in any public place, or in any place where others are present, or procures another to so expose himself, shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. No person shall be deemed to be in violation of this section for breastfeeding a child in any public place or any place where others are present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">The evidence failed to prove the conduct charged in the warrant: that Moses displayed his private parts. He outwardly exhibited nothing, not even a visible outline of his private parts. The testimony of both children establishes that they did not see his private parts. Although one child testified that Moses rubbed his penis, she expressly testified that she saw no objective physical manifestation of his penis. She saw his \u201chands through his pants.\u201d The other child was less specific, testifying only he was \u201crubbing himself ... [i]n his private area.\u201d Addressing Moses\u2019s conduct, the trial judge only found that he was \u201cgrabbing his parts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">Although, in both instances, the testimony established movement of Moses\u2019s hand in his \u201cprivate area,\u201d this evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>failed to prove either \u201can obscene <em>display </em>... of his person, or the private parts thereof.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-387 (emphasis added). Absent proof that either of the girls saw or was reasonably likely to have seen Moses\u2019s genitals, at least partially uncovered, the evidence failed to prove Moses\u2019s behavior came within the conduct charged by the warrant, regardless of the intent with which Moses acted.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Furthermore, my review of the language of the statute itself and the common law of indecent exposure compels the conclusion that the words \u201cdisplay\u201d and \u201cexposure\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 18.2-387 codify the common law and that the statute applies only when the body part in question was exposed without clothing and likely to be seen. <em>See also </em>1960 Va. Acts, ch. 233 (first enacting Code \u00a7 18.1-236, the predecessor statute, which proscribed the same behavior, \u201cobscene display or exposure,\u201d as Code \u00a7 18.2-387).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The structure of the statute itself establishes that the legislature intended the term \u201cdisplay\u201d to be synonymous with the term \u201cexposure.\u201d The legislature used the terms \u201cdisplay or exposure\u201d in the first part of the statute to proscribe the behavior in which an individual may not himself or herself engage, but it used only the term \u201cexposure\u201d in the second half of the statute to set out the behavior in which an individual may not \u201cprocure\u201d another to engage. It would be anomalous under the language of this statute to hold that the legislature intended to punish a defendant for engaging in either of two types of behavior himself but to punish him for enticing someone else to engage in only one of those two types of behavior. A court must construe the challenged statute \u201cfrom its four corners and not by singling out particular words or phrases.\u201d <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 109, 113, 379 S.E.2d 374, 376 (1989). \u201cIf the several provisions of a statute suggest a potential for conflict or inconsistency, we construe those provisions so as to reconcile them and to give full effect to the expressed legislative intent.\u201d <em>Mejia v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 173, 176-77, 474 S.E.2d 866, 868 (1996) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number><em>(en banc). </em>Furthermore, the rule of lenity requires that penal statutes \u201cmust be strictly construed against the state and limited in application to cases falling clearly within the language of the statute.\u201d <em>Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 456, 459, 309 S.E.2d 337, 338 (1983); <em>see also Richardson v.

Thus, absent a clear legislative intent to the contrary, principles of statutory construction compel a conclusion that the legislature intended a \u201cdisplay\u201d in violation of the statute also requires an \u201cexposure.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-387 is a codification of the common law, continuing the ban against indecent exposure.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>used by the legislature in enacting the successive code sections that have proscribed indecent exposure fail to support the conclusion that the legislature intended to change the common law when it used the word \u201cdisplay\u201d in its enactment of Code \u00a7 18.2-387. Here, the legislature adopted the common law\u2019s \u201cprecise, well defined meaning\u201d of indecent exposure. <em>Wicks v. City of Charlottesville, </em>215 Va. 274, 276, 208 S.E.2d 752, 755 (1974) (interpreting a local ordinance containing the term \u201cindecently expose\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">\u201c[T]he best construction of [a] statute is[ ] to construe it as near to the reason of the common law as may be\u201d The reason is that the Legislature is presumed to have known and to have had the common law in mind in the enactment of a statute. The statute must therefore be read along with the provisions of the common law, and the latter will be read into the statute unless it clearly appears from express language or by necessary implication that the purpose of the statute was to change the common law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Chichester v. </em>Lass, 5 Va. (1 Call) 83, 102 (1797)). Thus, where the statute has not expressly or by necessary implication changed the common law, we must assume the common law definitions apply. <em>See People v. Massicot, </em>97 Cal.App.4th 920, 118 Cal.Rptr.2d 705, 711 (2002) (holding that the common law targeted genital exposure, therefore, in the \u201cabsence of express definitions, ... we may construe the statute to encompass indecent exposure as it was defined at common law\u201d) (citing 2A J.G. Sutherland, <em>Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 50.03, at 435 (Norman J. Singer ed., 4th ed. 1984)). Further, penal statutes \u201cmust be strictly construed against the state and limited in application to cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>falling clearly within the language of the statute.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>226 Va. at 459, 309 S.E.2d at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">At common law, a conviction for indecent exposure required proof that the accused intentionally exposed private parts in a manner that they could reasonably have been seen by members of the public. <em>Noblett v. Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 241, 244-46, 72 S.E.2d 241, 24344 (1952) (citing definitions indicating the offense is committed where the \u201c \u2018act is seen or is likely to be seen\u2019 \u201d) (quoting 67 C.J.S. <em>Obscenity </em>\u00a7 5, at 25 (1950)). Indecent exposure statutes from other states \u201chave generally adopted the common law requirements of the offense of indecent exposure; to convict someone of indecent exposure, there must be shown a wilful and intentional exposure of the private parts of the body.\u201d 50 Am. Jur.2d <em>Lewdness, Indecency, and Obscenity </em>\u00a7 17, at 291-92 (1995). Thus, courts typically have held that \u201c[i]ndecent exposure at common law consists of exposure in public of the entire person or of parts that should not be exhibited.\u201d <em>State v. Chiles, </em>53 Wash.App. 452, 767 P.2d 597, 599 (1989); <em>see also Massicot, </em>118 Cal.Rptr.2d at 713. Significantly, the Supreme Court of Virginia has recognized a definition of common law \u201cindecent exposure\u201d that requires \u201c \u2018[ejxposure <em>to sight.\u2019 \u201d Wicks, </em>215 Va. at 276, 208 S.E.2d at 754 (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>909 (4th ed. 1951) (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\"><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>which is referenced in <em>Wicks, </em>treats the terms \u201cexposure\u201d and \u201cdisplay\u201d as synonymous, defining \u201cindecent <em>exposure\u201d </em>as \u201c[a]n offensive <em>display </em>of one\u2019s body in public, esp. of the genitals. Cf. Lewdness.... \u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>773 (7th ed. 1999) (emphases added); <em>see also Noblett, </em>194 Va. at 245, 72 S.E.2d at 24344 (referring to exposure as an \u201cexhibition\u201d); <em>Black\u2019s, supra, </em>at 595 (defining \u201cexhibitionism\u201d as an \u201cindecent <em>display </em>of one\u2019s body\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Massicot, </em>118 Cal.Rptr.2d at 712 (noting that conduct sought to be prohibited by common -law indecent exposure was \u201cexhibitionism,\u201d which it defined as \u201cthe <em>display </em>of the male genital organs for sexual gratification\u201d (emphasis added)). The Oregon Court affirmed a conviction in <em>State v. Ciancanelli, </em>181 Or.App. 1, 45 P.3d 451 (2002), involving an act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>of masturbation- that exposed the person\u2019s genitalia. It was in this context that the court discussed the framers\u2019 intentions and noted \u201cthat eighteenth-and nineteenth-century statutes and case law reflect the widespread \u2014 if not universal \u2014 regulation of public exposure of the genitals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Moreover, our adoption of just such a definition of \u201cexpose\u201d in <em>Siquina v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 694, 697-99, 508 S.E.2d 350, 352-53 (1998) (construing the portion of Code \u00a7 18.2-370 that proscribed \u201cknowingly and intentionally \u2018ex-posting] [one\u2019s] sexual or genital parts to any child\u2019 \u201d), underscores the conclusion that the General Assembly codified the common law requirement. Noting that the dispositive issue was whether the indecent liberties statute required that the child actually see the perpetrator\u2019s genitals, we held, based on analogy to the common law and the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of it in <em>Noblett </em>and <em>Wicks, </em>that actual viewing was not required, but that the evidence had to prove the genitals were \u201cseen or likely to be seen.\u201d <em>Siquina, </em>28 Va.App. at 698-99, 508 S.E.2d at 352-53.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In doing so, we conducted an extended analysis of the \u201corigin and contemporary definition of the verb \u2018expose\u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">\u201cExpose\u201d originated as an adaptation of the Latin verb \u201cexponere,\u201d which includes the following definitions: 1) to put or bring out into the open, or 2) to put on show or <em>display. </em>5 <em>The Oxford English Dictionary </em>578 (2d ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>1989); <em>Oxford Latin Dictionary </em>651 (1982). Today, the definition has remained true to its roots. <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>802 (1981), defines \u201cexpose\u201d as \u201cto lay open to view.\u201d In <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>579 (6th ed. 1990), \u201cexpose\u201d is defined as: \u201cTo show publicly; <em>to display; </em>to offer to the public view....\u201d <em>Black\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cindecent exposure\u201d is also instructive: \u201cThis term refers to exhibition of those private parts which ... human decency ... require[s] shall be kept covered in [the] presence of others. Exposure ... becomes indecent when it occurs at such time and place where [a] reasonable person knows or should know his act [may be viewed by] others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 768.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A01\"><em>Siquina, </em>28 Va.App. at 697-98, 508 S.E.2d at 352 (emphases added); <em>see also Brooker v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 609, 616, 587 S.E.2d 732, 735 (2003) (adopting <em>Siquina\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cexpose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Thus, I would hold that the statutory language and the common law history require that an accused actually render visible or cause to be seen or likely to be seen the body or the proscribed part. The statute requires proof of some degree of nudity of the body or the private parts of the body under circumstances denoting obscenity and satisfying the other statutory requirements. <em>Cf. Copeland v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 512, 515-16, 525 S.E.2d 9, 10-11 (2000) (holding that evidence of defendant\u2019s exposing his genitals and being visibly aroused in a woman\u2019s backyard was sufficient to support conviction for indecent exposure); <em>Morales v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 541, 543, 525 S.E.2d 23, 24 (2000) (holding evidence of defendant\u2019s exposing his erect penis and masturbating outside a lighted window sufficient to convict for indecent exposure).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The statute is not a general bar to a person\u2019s conducting himself or herself in an indecent or offensive manner. Thus, for example, the statute obviously does not purport to proscribe tight pants or sweaters or other garments that opaquely clothe the body but leave some portion of the population <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>offended due to sensitivity about the tightness of the garment. It does not, by its terms, bar hand gestures that might be considered offensive. Indeed, nothing in the statutory words, when given their meanings in ordinary parlance, bars a person from the mere act of rubbing or \u201cgrabbing\u201d himself or herself without proof of more. The statute does not bar indecent conduct that does not expose parts of the body. <em>See, e.g., State v. Jaime, </em>4 Conn.Cir.Ct. 530, 236 A.2d 474, 475 (1967) (holding that defendant\u2019s \u201cshaking his hand in his pelvic region\u201d and exposing white underpants was insufficient to support a conviction for violating statute prohibiting \u201cwantonly and indecently exposing] his person\u201d); <em>State v. Wymore, </em>98 Idaho 197, 560 P.2d 868, 869-70 (1977) (holding that a statute barring a person from \u201cpublicly exposing] his person or his genitals\u201d does not reach obscene gestures and comments where the accused did not expose his private parts).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Moses is serving a ten-year sentence, with four years suspended on various conditions, for the felony of taking indecent liberties with a child pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-370. Further, the prosecutor obviously selected among the various other statutes under which Moses could have been prosecuted in deciding how to proceed. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3 (proscribing aggravated sexual battery); Code \u00a7 18.2-67.4 (proscribing sexual battery); Code \u00a7 18.2-370(1) (proscribing indecent liberties with children); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-26 (proscribing <em>attempts </em>to commit noncapital felonies). <em>See also Jaime, </em>236 A.2d at 475-76 (holding defendant\u2019s \u201cshaking his hand in his pelvic region\u201d and exposing white underpants did not violate indecent exposure statute but might amount to disorderly conduct). If any gaps exist in the types of behavior the various statutes proscribe, it is the job of the legislature, not the courts, to fill those gaps. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Statler, </em>121 F.Supp.2d 925, 927 <em>&amp; </em>n. 6 (E.D.Va.2000) (holding \u201cthere is little doubt that masturbation in a public bathroom, if proven, fits well within <em>the federal regulation </em>proscribing \u2018a display or act that is obscene\u2019 \u201d but emphasizing that the federal regulation is <em>\u201cbroader </em>than ... the Virginia indecent exposure statute\u201d because the Virginia statute \u201crequires a display or exposure of parts of one\u2019s body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>[whereas the federal regulation] does not\u201d (emphases added)); <em>see also </em>Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 2907.09 (2004) (proscribing public indecency, which it defines to include \u201crecklessly\u201d \u201c(1) [e]xpos[ing] his or her private parts, or engag[ing] in masturbation; (2) [e]ngag[ing] in sexual conduct; [or] (3) [e]ngaging in conduct that to an ordinary observer would appear to be sexual conduct or masturbation\u201d); <em>Duvallon v. District of Columbia, </em>515 A.2d 724, 725 n. 1 (D.C.1986) (analyzing conviction for indecent exposure under statute making it unlawful \u201cfor any person or persons to make any obscene or indecent exposure of his or her person, <em>or </em>to make any other lewd, obscene, or indecent sexual proposal, <em>or </em>to commit any other lewd, obscene, or indecent act\u201d (emphases added)); <em>State v. Ovitt, </em>148 Vt. 398, 535 A.2d 1272, 1275-76 (1986) (under statute proscribing \u201copen and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior\u201d without further defining that offense, holding evidence sufficient to support conviction where defendant masturbated publicly through clothing but did not expose his genitals).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The dispositive issue in this case is whether Moses\u2019s behavior constituted a \u201cdisplay or exposure of his person, or the private parts thereof,\u201d analogizing to the common law definition of that offense. I would hold it did not, and I would reverse both misdemeanor convictions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b417-6\">. An analogy between the use of the term \"display\u201d in the indecent exposure statute and Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, which proscribes \"display[ing]\u201d a firearm in a threatening manner during the commission of certain felonies, is inapt for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">First, the Virginia cases construing the firearms statute to hold a weapon was displayed to a victim through a sense other than actual sight involved the sense of touch. <em>See, e.g., Cromite v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 64, 67-68, 348 S.E.2d 38, 40 (1986) (involving a robber who approached the victim with his hand in his pocket and \"stuck something [\u2018hard\u2019] in his stomach ... that \u2018felt ... like a pistol\u2019 \u201d). Here, Moses\u2019s conduct did not involve tactile experiences. Rather, they involved only sight of hand movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Second, the evils at which the two statutes are directed are entirely different. The presence of a firearm as an aid to a felony may be just as effective even where the firearm is not displayed visually; one need not see a firearm in order to be motivated by fear of the potential harm it represents. <em>See id. </em>In the case of indecent exposure, however, the core of the offense is just that \u2014 the exposure itself, coupled with the related shock and embarrassment, <em>People v. Massicot, </em>97 Cal.App.4th 920, 118 Cal.Rptr.2d 705, 711-12 (2002), rather than the fear that it represents some intent to do physical harm to the victim. Other statutes criminalize sexual behavior that threatens direct physical contact or harm. As a result, what it means to display a firearm during the commission of a felony has little or no relevance to determining what types of displays violate the indecent exposure statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b417-9\">. Indeed, Code \u00a7 18.2-387 is titled \"Indecent exposure.\u201d Although the title of a statute is for \"informative convenience,\u201d <em>Good v. Commonwealth, </em>155 Va. 996, 999-1000, 154 S.E. 477, 478 (1930), it is of use for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>interpretative purposes if it \"shed[s] light on some ambiguous word or phrase.\u201d <em>Trainmen v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co., </em>331 U.S. 519, 528-29, 67 S.Ct. 1387, 1392, 91 L.Ed. 1646 (1947). <em>See also Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 234, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1226, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (\"not[ing] that 'the title of a statute and the heading of a section\u2019 are 'tools available for the resolution of a doubt\u2019 about the meaning of a statute\u201d). As noted earlier in this opinion, the statutory language suggests a potential for inconsistency that must be reconciled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b420-7\">. <em>Wicks </em>and <em>Siquina </em>suggest that we need to have an actual display of a person\u2019s genitalia in order to find conduct sufficient to convict for indecent exposure under Code \u00a7 18.2-387. The facts in <em>Wicks </em>showed that while the police officer \"could not be certain that he had actually seen the defendant\u2019s organ because his hand was covering it,\u201d the officer did testify that he saw the defendant \"holding his hand in front of his trousers and ... urinating\u201d as he walked. 215 Va. at 275 n. 1, 208 S.E.2d at 754 n. 1. Thus, the defendant\u2019s conduct supported an inference beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s genitalia was actually exposed. Furthermore, in <em>Siquina, </em>while the child did not see the defendant\u2019s genitalia, the child\u2019s mother saw the defendant in the bathroom with her child and saw the defendant\u2019s erect penis. 28 Va.App. at 697, 508 S.E.2d at 352. Although <em>Siquina </em>dealt with Code \u00a7 18.2-370, taking indecent liberties with a child, the facts also showed that actual exposure of genitalia did occur.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
