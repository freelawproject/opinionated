Robinson and Elisa K. Robinson (collectively, \u201cthe Robinsons\u201d) appeal their convictions for contributing to the delinquency of a minor, a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-371. The Robinsons argue on appeal that the trial court erred in denying their motions to suppress, contending that, because the investigating police officer was located in the curtilage of their home when he witnessed the illicit activity, the resulting search violated their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. For the following reasons, we disagree and affirm their convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">In accord with our usual standard of review, on the appeal of a denial of a motion to suppress, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences flowing from the evidence in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below. <em>Garcia v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 184, 189, 578 S.E.2d 97, 99 (2003); <em>Sabo v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 63, 69, 561 S.E.2d 761, 764 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">On August 16, 2002, the Albemarle County Police Department received three separate telephone calls reporting an alleged underage drinking party at the Robinsons\u2019 home. Corporal Scott Cox was dispatched to investigate these allegations, and he arrived at the Robinsons\u2019 home at approximately 11:00 p.m. From the state road in front of the house, Cox could see ten to twenty cars parked on the state road, as well as two to three parked cars on the left-hand side of the driveway. From that position, Cox could also see the house, the front porch, the front door, and the front yard, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>he could not see the backyard or the entire driveway. The floodlights above the front door were turned on, and the lights along the sidewalk leading to the front door were also turned on.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Cox, who was driving a marked police car with its headlights on, turned into the driveway and started to drive towards the house. While proceeding up the driveway, Cox saw several additional parked vehicles near the right side of the driveway, as well as \u201cseveral parked vehicles near the side of the house\u201d straight in front of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Cox continued up the driveway in his police car. From his position inside the police car, he began to see some \u201cactivity\u201d in the backyard. Before reaching the point where the walkway to the front door intersects with the Robinsons\u2019 driveway, Cox saw two individuals holding clear beer bottles. The individuals, both of whom appeared to be underage, were standing by a pine tree about seven or eight yards away from Cox\u2019s police car. The two juveniles \u201clooked at [Cox], looked at the house, yelled \u2018cops,\u2019 dropped the beer bottles, and ran down a fence line toward the woods.\u201d Cox pulled his police car behind one of the parked cars and looked to his left. From that vantage point, \u201c[h]e saw juveniles running toward the woods.\u201d Also, \u201c[h]e could see a patio table covered with beer bottles and noticed beer bottles strewn about the backyard.\u201d Cox then got out of his car, \u201cyelled for people to stop running, and radioed other officers who were waiting off the property that kids were running east into the woods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The Robinsons were arrested and charged with nineteen counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Both parties filed a motion to suppress, contending that Cox was unlawfully present on their property when he viewed the illicit activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">At the suppression hearing, several photographs were introduced depicting the layout of the Robinsons\u2019 premises. According to the photographs, the driveway originates from the state road in front of the house. The driveway then splits into two paths. Both paths continue towards the house, and they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>both bend towards the right. The two branches of the driveway merge back into a single driveway near the front, right-hand corner of the house. The house is positioned entirely to the left of the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Also, a lighted sidewalk leads from the driveway to the front door of the Robinsons\u2019 home. This sidewalk intersects with the driveway just past the area where the two branches of the driveway reunite. A large bush has been planted in front of the sidewalk at the point where the sidewalk intersects with the driveway, shielding a portion of the sidewalk from view. Other than walking across the grass in the front yard, the driveway and connecting sidewalk serve as the only means of apparent pedestrian access to the front door of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Where the driveway paths are divergent, the area between the two branches forms an \u201cisland\u201d containing numerous trees. These trees, along with the general rightward bend of the driveway, shield the garage, backyard, and a large portion of the driveway from public view. The portion of the driveway shielded from public view includes the bush and the area where the front sidewalk intersects with the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">At the suppression hearing, Cox testified that his police car was next to the bush in the driveway when he \u201cclearly\u201d saw \u201ctwo male juveniles standing on the other side of the tree holding beer bottles.\u201d To clarify the position in the driveway from which the officer observed the juveniles, the trial court asked Cox, \u201cSo you were at the bush when you saw the two individuals?\u201d Cox responded, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Cox was asked repeatedly on cross-examination whether he entered the driveway for the purpose of knocking on the front door to speak with an occupant of the house. Each time Cox was asked the question, he responded that he entered the property to \u201cinvestigate.\u201d Cox further responded in the affirmative to the following question: \u201cIsn\u2019t it correct that you have described the situation you were hoping to observe as the effect when you flick on a light in a dark kitchen, and the cockroaches scatter?\u201d Cox was also asked, \u201cSo you were looking for a reaction of people scattering to confirm your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>suspicion that you had an underage drinking party?\u201d Cox responded, \u201cRight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A8Ej\">By letter opinion dated August 4, 2003, the trial court denied the Robinsons\u2019 motions to suppress. In its written opinion, the trial court observed that Cox \u201cplanned to enter the property to investigate the allegations of underage consumption of alcohol.\u201d The trial court also observed that, \u201c[a]s Cox went down the driveway, he could not see the backyard or the garage,\u201d but that \u201c[h]e could see the house, the front yard, and the front porch.\u201d Additionally, the trial court found that \u201c[t]here were no signs posted\u201d \u2014 such as a \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign \u2014 at the entrance to the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Based on this evidence, the trial court found that the Robinsons\u2019 driveway was not part of the curtilage of the house and, therefore, concluded that \u201cCox\u2019s presence there [did] not implicate the Fourth Amendment.\u201d The court additionally found that Cox\u2019s presence in the Robinsons\u2019 driveway was justified by the officer\u2019s right to conduct a \u201cknock and talk,\u201d that is, to approach a home and knock on the front door to speak with an occupant. Under either of the preceding rationales, the trial court concluded that \u201cCox was in a lawful place in the driveway\u201d when he observed the two juveniles drinking beer, and his observations were therefore admissible pursuant to the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. Accordingly, the trial court denied the Robinsons\u2019 motions to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The Robinsons were subsequently convicted of nine counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and the trial court sentenced each defendant to six months in jail, three months suspended, on each count. The trial court ordered the sentences to run consecutively, resulting in active jail time of twenty-seven months for each defendant. The Robinsons appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Although \u201c \u2018[w]e are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>dence to support them,\u2019 ... we review de novo the trial court\u2019s application of legal standards ... to the particular facts of the case.\u201d <em>McCracken v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 254, 258, 572 S.E.2d 493, 495 (2002) (en banc) (quoting <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) (en banc)) (citing <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)). Further, \u201c[i]n reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u2018the burden is upon [the appellant] to show that the ruling ... constituted reversible error.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGee, 25 </em>Va.App. at 197, 487 S.E.2d at 261 (quoting <em>Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Whether a defendant has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the item seized or the place searched is a mixed question of law and fact. That is, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s underlying findings of fact, but we review <em>de novo </em>the ultimate determination of whether the Fourth Amendment applies under the circumstances of this case. <em>See Sharpe v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 448, 454, 605 S.E.2d 346, 349 (2004) (\u201c[W]e review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of defined legal standards such as whether a defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy sufficient to permit him to raise a Fourth Amendment challenge to a search.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">A. <em>Cox Was On the Curtilage When He Observed the Juveniles Drinking Beer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The Robinsons contend that Cox conducted an unconstitutional search because the place from which Cox observed the juveniles drinking beer was a part of the curtilage of their home. Although we agree that Cox observed the juveniles drinking beer from within the curtilage of the Robinsons\u2019 home and the trial court erred in concluding otherwise, that determination will not end our inquiry. <em>See </em>Part II.B, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Because homeowners possess a reasonable expectation of privacy in the curtilage surrounding their homes, <em>Oliver v. United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 180, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 1742, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984), \u201cthe curtilage ... warrants the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Fourth Amendment protections that attach to the home.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Jefferson v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 1, 15, 497 S.E.2d 474, 481 (1998) (\u201cConsistent with the common law understanding of the extent of the \u2018home,\u2019 the Supreme Court has held that the Fourth Amendment protections that apply to the house also apply to the \u2018curtilage\u2019 of the house.\u201d). Because the Fourth Amendment protects the curtilage to the same extent as the home, a police officer may not enter the curtilage without a warrant, exigent circumstances, or pursuant to an express or implied invitation from the occupant. <em>See Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 589-90, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 1381-82, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980) (\u201cTo be arrested in the home involves not only the invasion attendant to all arrests but also an invasion of the sanctity of the home. This is simply too substantial an invasion to allow without a warrant, at least in the absence of exigent circumstances ----\u201d (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Generally, the curtilage of a home is the \u201carea around the home to which the activity of home life extends.\u201d <em>Oliver, </em>466 U.S. at 180, 104 S.Ct. at 1742; <em>see also Wellford v. Commonwealth, 227 </em>Va. 297, 301, 315 S.E.2d 235, 238 (1984) (defining \u201ccurtilage\u201d as the \u201cspace necessary and convenient, habitually used for family purposes and the carrying on of domestic employment; the yard, garden or field which is near to and used in connection with the dwelling\u201d). \u201c[W]hether a particular place is within the curtilage of the home is determined on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Jefferson, 27 </em>Va.App. at 16, 497 S.E.2d at 481 (citing <em>United States v. Dunn, </em>480 U.S. 294, 301 n. 4, 107 S.Ct. 1134, 1140 n. 4, 94 L.Ed.2d 326 (1987)). In determining whether the area in question constitutes curtilage, \u201cparticular reference\u201d to the following four factors is helpful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">the proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home, [2] whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home, [3] the nature of the uses to which the area is put, and [4] the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number><em>Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 301, 107 S.Ct. at 1140; <em>Jefferson, </em>27 Va.App. at 16, 497 S.E.2d at 481. \u201c[TJhese factors are useful analytical tools only to the degree that, in any given case, they bear upon the centrally relevant consideration \u2014 -whether the area in question is so intimately tied to the home itself that it should be placed under the home\u2019s \u2018umbrella\u2019 of Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d <em>Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 301, 107 S.Ct. at 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Applying the <em>Dunn </em>factors to this case, we conclude that the portion of the driveway from which Cox observed the juveniles drinking beer \u2014 the area next to the bush \u2014 falls within the curtilage of the Robinsons\u2019 home. First, the area next to the bush is within a few feet of the home itself. Second, the Robinsons testified that they used the area for washing cars and unloading groceries, home-related activities that evidence the \u201cnature of the uses to which the area is put.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Third, although the area next to the bush is not \u201cincluded within an enclosure surrounding the home,\u201d <em>see id., </em>the area is protected from public observation. Specifically, although the Robinsons did not erect a fence or post any no-trespassing signs, the trees and layout of the driveway obscure the area from public view. It is evident, therefore, that the area next to the bush is \u201cprotect[ed] ... from observation by people passing by.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given that three out of the four <em>Dunn </em>factors are satisfied, we are compelled to conclude that the area next to the bush is \u201cintimately tied to the home itself\u201d and, thus, falls within the curtilage of the Robinsons\u2019 home. <em>See Jefferson, </em>27 Va.App. at 17, 497 S.E.2d at 482 (finding that place of defendant\u2019s arrest constituted curtilage because \u201cthe proximity of the place where Officer Harpster arrested appellant <em>was extremely dose </em>to appellant\u2019s house and <em>could not be viewed by pedestrians and drivers passing in front of the house </em>\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see also United States v. Jenkins, </em>124 F.3d 768, 773 (6th Cir.1997) (finding that defendant\u2019s backyard is curtilage because it was \u201cwell shielded from the view of people passing by on the only public thoroughfare near defendant\u2019s property\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in holding that the area of the driveway next to the bush was not a part of the curtilage of the house. However, in light of our holding that the Robinsons did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their driveway, <em>see </em>Part II.B, <em>infra, </em>this error is harmless. <em>See Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 912 (1991) <em>(en </em>banc) (noting that an error is harmless \u201cif a reviewing court can conclude, without usurping the ... fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the [result] would have been the same\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">B. <em>Whether the Robinsons Had A Reasonable Expectation of Privacy in the Area of the Driveway by the Front Sidewalk</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Although Cox was positioned within the curtilage when he made his observations, that determination does not end our inquiry. It is well established that \u201c \u2018[w]hat a person knowingly exposes to the public ... is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection,\u2019 \u201d <em>California v. Ciraolo, </em>476 U.S. 207, 213, 106 S.Ct. 1809, 1813, 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986) (quoting <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 351, 88 S.Ct. 507, 511, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967)), because there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in items or places that are open to public observation. <em>See California v. Greenwood, </em>486 U.S. 35, 41, 108 S.Ct. 1625, 1629, 100 L.Ed.2d 30 (1988). The question we must answer, therefore, is whether the Robinsons knowingly exposed to the public the area of their driveway next to the bush, the place from which Cox viewed the criminal activity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>The Commonwealth argues that the Robinsons knowingly-exposed to the public the area by the front sidewalk because: (1) the Robinsons\u2019 driveway is viewable from the state road, and (2) visitors exercising an implied invitation to the Robin-sons\u2019 home would use that area to access the house and front door. Although we disagree with the former contention, we conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the Robin-sons impliedly invited members of the public onto their driveway on the night in question. Accordingly, because the Robinsons relinquished any reasonable expectation of privacy in this portion of their driveway, the Fourth Amendment does not apply to that area of the curtilage, and we therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the motions to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">1. <em>Whether the Driveway is Visible From the Public Road</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The Commonwealth argues that the Robinsons have no reasonable expectation of privacy in their driveway because a segment of the driveway is visible from the state road. We disagree with this contention. We note that each of the cases relied upon by the Commonwealth is distinguishable because, in those cases, the driveway was viewable in its <em>entirety </em>from a public thoroughfare. <em>See Shaver v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va. App. 789, 793, 797, 520 S.E.2d 393, 395, 397 (1999) (upholding the police search of an ATV parked in defendant\u2019s driveway because the ATV was \u201cvisible from the road\u201d and because \u201cdefendants made no attempt to restrict or shield the driveway from public view\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Roccio, </em>981 F.2d 587, 591 (1st Cir.1992) (finding no reasonable expectation of privacy in car and driveway where the car \u201cwas clearly visible from the street on an unobstructed driveway\u201d); <em>Maisano v. Welcher, </em>940 F.2d 499, 503 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201c \u2018The expectation of privacy which a possessor of land may reasonably have while carrying on activities on his driveway will generally depend upon the nature of the activities and <em>the degree of visibility from the street.\u2019\u201d </em>(emphasis added) (quoting <em>United States v. Magana, </em>512 F.2d 1169, 1171 (9th Cir.1975))); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>783 F.2d 648, 650 (6th Cir.1986) (finding no reasonable expectation of privacy in defendant\u2019s driveway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>where \u201cthere were no obstructions between the [public] road and the house\u201d); <em>United States v. Humphries, </em>636 F.2d 1172, 1179 (9th Cir.1980) (finding police entry into driveway to view a vehicle license plate violated no reasonable expectation of privacy where \u201cthe auto was visible from the street\u201d and where \u201cthe driveway was [not] enclosed by a fence, shrubbery or other barrier\u201d); <em>cf. State v. Kelly, </em>119 S.W.3d 587, 593-94 (Mo.Ct.App.2003) (finding no reasonable expectation of privacy in the area around stairs leading to a front porch because \u201cthe area was not enclosed or protected from observation by passersby in any way and was entirely visible from the public street\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Here, only a portion of the driveway was viewable from the state road, and the area in the driveway from which Cox conducted his observations was shielded from public view by the trees and the bend of the driveway. Indeed, the trial court specifically found that Cox could not see the backyard or the garage due to the trees located between the branches of the driveway, and it is evident that he could not see the two juveniles drinking beer until he reached the area next to the bush, which, as discussed above, was not viewable from the state road. Because the area from which Cox observed the criminal activity was not viewable to members of the public traveling on the state road, the Robinsons legitimately retained a reasonable expectation of privacy in that area of the driveway unless they extended to the public an express or implied invitation to enter the property. <em>See State v. Carter, </em>54 Or.App. 852, 636 P.2d 460, 462 (1981) (finding that defendant had reasonable expectation of privacy in a portion of his property beyond an inner gate because that area was not viewable from beyond an outer metal gate).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">2. <em>Implied Invitation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The Commonwealth also argues that the Robinsons had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the area by the front sidewalk because, on the night of the party, the Robinsons extended an implied invitation to anyone, including a police officer, to approach the front door and knock. The Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>wealth\u2019s argument is that, in approaching the front door, a visitor would necessarily have to enter and walk up the driveway and then cross the area next to the bush in order to access the walkway to the front door. Because the Robinsons should expect visitors, including a police officer, to enter the same area that Cox entered, the Commonwealth reasons that the Robinsons knowingly exposed that area to the public. The Commonwealth concludes that the Robinsons therefore cannot have a reasonable expectation of privacy in that particular area and, as a result, Cox\u2019s presence in that area did not offend the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Considering the totality of the circumstances of this case, we agree with the Commonwealth and conclude that the Robinsons extended an implied invitation to the public\u2014 including law enforcement officers \u2014 to use their driveway and front sidewalk when attempting to contact the owners or occupants of the property. We also conclude that, taking, as we must, the historical facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, Cox\u2019s conduct did not fall outside the scope of this implied invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">a. <em>Whether the Robinsons Extended an Implied Invitation to Enter the Premises</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">It is generally recognized that, unless they affirmatively warn or discourage trespassers, owners or possessors of private property implicitly invite the public to intrude upon certain, limited areas of their property. As we have noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUQ\">\u201cPeople commonly have different expectations, whether considered or not, for the access areas of their premises than they do for more secluded areas. Thus, we do not place things of a private nature on our front porches that we may very well entrust to the seclusion of a backyard, patio or deck. In the course of urban life, we have come to expect various members of the public to enter upon such a driveway, e.g., brush salesmen, newspaper boys, postmen, Girl Scout cookie sellers, distressed motorists, neighbors, friends. Any one of them may be reasonably expected to report observations of criminal activity to the police.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number><em>Shaver, </em>30 Va.App. at 796, 520 S.E.2d at 397 (quoting <em>State v.

Here, then, we must consider whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the Robinsons affirmatively intended to exclude members of the public from their premises. <em>See generally State v. Wyatt, </em>131 Idaho 562, 961 P.2d 653, 656 (Ct.App.1998) (\u201cThe determination whether a particular citizen had a legitimate expectation of privacy depends upon the unique facts of each case.

There were no gates, fences, wires, or highway cones indicating that members of the public were not welcome to use the Robinsons\u2019 driveway and front sidewalk in an effort to speak with the occupants of the premises. Nor did they post any signs indicating that the general public was not welcome to enter upon their property to approach their front door. Considering the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the Robinsons extended to the public an implied invitation to enter the driveway and front sidewalk of their premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">b. <em>Whether Cox Exceeded the Scope of the Implied Invitation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Although we hold that the Robinsons extended an implied invitation to the public to enter their property and approach the front door, we must also consider whether Cox\u2019s conduct on the night of the party exceeded the scope of that implied invitation. Ultimately, whether the officer exceeded the scope of the implied invitation \u201ccannot be determined by a fixed formula,\u201d but must instead \u201cbe based on the facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>People v. Thompson, </em>221 Cal.

These visitors \u201care also expected to leave by the same route after knocking on the front door and receiving no response,\u201d unless the \u201cnature of the circumstances surrounding the visit\u201d indicates that the visitor \u201ccould reasonably be expected to seek out residents through areas other than the front door.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Generally, \u201ca substantial and unreasonable departure from the normal access route will exceed the scope of the implied invitation and intrude upon a constitutionally protected privacy interest.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>859 P.2d at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Also, an implied invitation to approach the front door of a private residence is limited in scope to those persons who are on the property for a \u201clegitimate social or business purpose.\u201d <em>State v. Cloutier, </em>544 A.2d 1277, 1280 (Me.1988). In the context of law enforcement officers, officers who are located on the curtilage for the purpose of approaching the front door and questioning the residents of the house are deemed to be pursuing a \u201clegitimate purpose.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Shaver, </em>30 Va.App. at 793, 794, 520 S.E.2d at 395, 396 (noting that \u201cinvestigators intended to speak with the defendants\u201d and that the investigators first \u201cknocked on the front door of the residence but no one answered\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Although the implied invitation does permit officers to seek out the occupants of a residence in order to \u201cinvestigate,\u201d the scope of this invitation does not encompass the right to conduct a general search of the premises. <em>See, e.g., United, States v. Bradshaw, </em>490 F.2d 1097, 1100 (4th Cir.1974) (noting that the officer must have a legitimate purpose other than conducting \u201ca search of such premises directed against the accused\u201d); <em>see also Rogers v.

As noted by the Fourth Circuit,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">the right to \u201cknock and talk,\u201d that is, to knock on a residence\u2019s door or otherwise approach the residence seeking to speak to the inhabitants, [is] not the right to make a general investigation in the curtilage based on reasonable suspicion. A contrary rule would eviscerate the principle of <em>Oliver </em>and <em>Dunn </em>that the curtilage is entitled to the same level of Fourth Amendment protection as the home itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqP\"><em>Rogers, </em>249 F.3d at 289. A police officer exceeds the legitimate scope of an implied invitation if he seeks to \u201cconvert[ ] this limited license to do what any citizen may do \u2014 approach the house and speak to the inhabitant or owner \u2014 into a license to search for \u2018evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 294. Thus, if a law enforcement officer, in an attempt to uncover illicit activity, strays from the \u201cpath\u201d that is impliedly open to the public, he has exceeded the scope of the implied invitation and, as a result, violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Similarly, entering the property late at night, especially if accompanied by the use of subterfuge, may exceed the scope of the implied invitation. As noted by one court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">Furtive intrusion late at night or in the predawn hours is not conduct that is expected from ordinary visitors. Indeed, if observed by a resident of the premises, it could be a cause for great alarm. As compared to open daytime approaches, surreptitious searches under the cover of darkness create a greater risk of armed response \u2014 with potentially tragic results \u2014 from fearful residents who may mistake the police officers for criminal intruders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number><em>Cada, </em>923 P.2d at 478; <em>see also Griffin v.

Cox entered the driveway, began to drive toward the residence, and, <em>before </em>he reached the area of the driveway where the front walk intersects with the driveway, he saw the minors drinking in the Robinsons\u2019 backyard. At that point, Cox had gone no further than any member of the public would have gone in an attempt to contact the owners of the property. He did not stray from the \u201cpath\u201d leading directly from the road to the front door (i.e., the driveway and the front sidewalk), nor did he attempt to conduct a general search of the premises through use of an overly intrusive means of investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Also, although Cox entered the curtilage of the Robin-sons\u2019 home at 11:00 p.m., a late hour of the evening, this entry did not necessarily exceed the scope of the implied invitation. \u201cUnder some circumstances, the mere fact that the intrusion was made late at night may be a factor suggesting that the police conduct was unduly intrusive.\u201d <em>State v. Morris, </em>131 Idaho 562, 961 P.2d 653, 657 n. 3 (Ct.App.1998). Here, however, the lights along the Robinsons\u2019 front sidewalk and the lights on the front porch were still turned on. Also, multiple cars were parked along the driveway and on the public road in front of the house. These factors give rise to a reasonable inference that the implied invitation to approach the front door of the residence had not yet been rescinded for the night.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Also, we note that Cox drove up the driveway with his headlights turned on \u2014 the same way that any member of the general public would presumably have approached the house \u2014 rather than using subterfuge or the \u201ccover of darkness\u201d in an attempt to disguise his approach. <em>Compare Cada, </em>923 P.2d at 478 (officers exceeded scope of implied invitation where they engaged in a \u201cclandestine intrusion ... under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>cover of darkness in the dead of night\u201d), <em>with Clark, </em>859 P.2d at 346 (officers did not exceed scope of implied invitation where the officers went to the fi-ont door of the residence at 10:00 p.m. to investigate a neighbor\u2019s complaint about a loud party).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Considering the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that, on the night in question, the implied invitation to enter the Robinsons\u2019 premises was still open even at this late hour, and Cox did not exceed the scope of this implied invitation when he drove up the Robinsons\u2019 driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Moreover, Cox entered the curtilage of the Robin-sons\u2019 home with the purpose of investigating reports of underage drinking at the residence. \u201c[T]he investigation of an anonymous tip is clearly legitimate police activity so long as the investigation does not violate applicable constitutional provisions.\u201d <em>Divello v. State, </em>782 N.E.2d 433, 437-38 (Ind.Ct. App.2003). Because Cox entered the premises to \u201cinvestigate,\u201d he had a legitimate purpose for being present on the Robinsons\u2019 driveway at the time he viewed the illicit activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Also, we do not accept the Robinsons\u2019 argument that Cox\u2019s subjective intent indicates that the entry exceeded the scope of the implied invitation. Generally, the determination of whether a Fourth Amendment violation has occurred is based on \u201c \u2018an objective assessment of the officer\u2019s actions ... and not on the officer\u2019s state of mind at the time the challenged action was taken.\u2019 \u201d <em>Limonja v. Commonwealth, 8 </em>Va.App. 532, 538, 383 S.E.2d 476, 480 (1989) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Maryland v. Macon, </em>472 U.S. 463, 470-71, 105 S.Ct. 2778, 2782-83, 86 L.Ed.2d 370 (1985)). Although cases from other jurisdictions have inquired into the officer\u2019s subjective intent, we note that, in each of those cases, the officer\u2019s intent only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>became relevant if the officer exceeded the ordinary scope of the implied invitation by, for example, invading other areas of the curtilage <em>after </em>attempting a \u201cknock and talk.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Estate of Smith v. Marasco, </em>318 F.3d 497, 520-21 (3d. Cir. 2003) (remanding qualified immunity case for further factual determinations where the officers knocked on the front door, the defendant failed to answer, and the officers then entered the backyard of the residence); <em>Alvarez, </em>147 F.3d at 357 (inquiring into officer\u2019s subjective purpose for entering the backyard where the officers, who were investigating an underage drinking party, approached the front door, noticed a sign that said \u201cParty in Back,\u201d and then went to the backyard to \u201cspeak with the party\u2019s host\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Without expressly adopting or rejecting the rationale of these cases, we note that they are distinguishable because, here, Cox had not yet performed a \u201cknock and talk,\u201d nor had he invaded any area of the curtilage beyond the \u201cpath\u201d to the front door. Rather, when Cox viewed the illicit activity, he had not yet finished driving up the driveway. Under the circumstances of this case, then, there is no additional intrusion into the curtilage that would necessitate an inquiry into Cox\u2019s subjective intent. <em>Cf. McIntyre, </em>860 P.2d at 302 (holding that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s reliance on the officers\u2019 investigative purpose was misplaced\u201d because <em>\u201c </em>\u2018[cjriminal investigation is as legitimate a societal purpose as is census taking or mail delivery\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Corbett, </em>516 P.2d at 490) (second alteration in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Considering the totality of the circumstances, we therefore conclude that the Robinsons extended an implied invitation to the public to enter their driveway on the night of the party. We further conclude that, when Cox entered the curtilage with the purpose of \u201cinvestigating\u201d the allegations of underage drinking, he did not exceed the scope of this implied invitation because, at the point in time when he viewed the illicit activity, he had gone no further than an ordinary member of the public would have gone in an attempt to contact the occupants of the property. Accordingly, because the Robinsons extended an implied invitation to enter the property, and because Cox did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>not exceed the scope of that invitation, the Robinsons had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the area of the driveway by the bush, and Cox\u2019s actions neither implicated nor violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">C. <em>Because the Fourth Amendment Does Not Apply, The Evidence Is Admissible</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The Robinsons submit that the trial court erred in its legal conclusion that Cox\u2019s observations were admissible pursuant to the plain view exception to the warrant requirement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, we need not reach the issue of whether the plain view <em>exception </em>applies because Cox\u2019s presence in the Robinsons\u2019 driveway did not implicate the Fourth Amendment. Rather, because the illicit conduct was clearly visible from an area in which the Robinsons had no reasonable expectation of privacy, the plain view <em>doctrine </em>applies, and the observations are admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">That is, because the Robinsons had extended an implied invitation to the public to use the driveway to access the front door of their home, they had no reasonable expectation of privacy in that area. <em>See Clark, </em>859 P.2d at 349 (\u201cThere is an implied invitation for the public to use access routes to the house ... and there can be no reasonable expectation of privacy as to observations which can be made from such areas.\u201d); <em>Divello, </em>782 N.E.2d at 437 (\u201c[A]n individual does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to things or activities within a residence that may be observed by persons using their natural senses from places impliedly open to a visitor\u2019s entry.\u201d). And, because the Robinsons had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the illicit activities that were clearly visible from their driveway, the Fourth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>ment does not apply to any observations made by a police officer who was present in the driveway and complying with the terms of that implied invitation. <em>See Illinois v. Andreas, </em>463 U.S. 765, 771, 103 S.Ct. 3319, 3324, 77 L.Ed.2d 1003 (1983) (\u201cIf the inspection by police does not intrude upon a legitimate expectation of privacy, there is no \u2018search\u2019 subject to the Warrant Clause.\u201d); <em>see also Clark, </em>859 P.2d at 348 (\u201c[A] policeman\u2019s mere observation from a vantage point that does not infringe upon a privacy interest, of something open to public view, normally implicates no Fourth Amendment constraints because observation of items readily visible to the public is not a \u2018search.\u2019 \u201d); <em>State v. Harris, </em>919 S.W.2d 619, 624 (Tenn.Crim.App.1995) (\u201cWhat an officer sees from a vantage point along the walkway between the public road and the front door is not protected by [] the Fourth Amendment. ...\u201d). Because the Fourth Amendment does not apply, no warrant is required and, therefore, no exception to the warrant requirement is needed. <em>See generally Commonwealth v. Carelli, </em>377 Pa.Super. 117, 546 A.2d 1185 (1988) (\u201cBecause there is no search, there is no need for an <em>exception </em>to permit admission of testimony relating to the observation.\u201d (emphasis in original)). Because Cox\u2019s observations do not implicate the Fourth Amendment, those observations are admissible in their entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">We hold that, under the facts of this case, the area of the driveway next to the bush is part of the curtilage of the Robinsons\u2019 home. We further hold, however, that the area was not protected by the Fourth Amendment because the Robinsons had no reasonable expectation of privacy in that area of the curtilage. Rather, because the Robinsons extended an implied invitation to members of the public to enter the portion of driveway before the walkway to the front door, Cox\u2019s presence on the driveway did not implicate the Fourth Amendment and, therefore, did not constitute an illegal search. Because Cox\u2019s observations did not implicate the Fourth Amendment, the trial court properly denied the Robin-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>sons\u2019 motions to suppress. Accordingly, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-7\">.

I write separately, however, because I do not agree that the search can be found constitutionally proper on the theory that the Robinsons had impliedly invited Officer Cox\u2019s entry, thereby extinguishing any reasonable expectation of privacy they had in the curtilage. Cox\u2019s sole and undisputed purpose for entering the curtilage was to search for criminal activity. Consistent with the guarantees of the United States Constitution, it cannot be said that citizens impliedly extend an invitation to the police to enter their home or curtilage to conduct a search. On that ground, I would hold that Cox violated the Robinsons\u2019 rights under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">\u201cCurtilage\u201d is defined as the \u201cspace necessary and convenient, habitually used for family purposes and the carrying on of domestic employment; the yard, garden or field which is near to and used in connection with the dwelling.\u201d <em>Wellford v.

The home is fundamentally a sanctuary, where personal concepts of self and family are forged, where relationships are nurtured and where people normally feel free to express themselves in intimate ways. The potent individual privacy interests that inhere in living within a home expand into the areas that enclose the home as well. The backyard and area immediately surrounding the home are really extensions of the dwelling itself. This is not true simply in a mechanical sense because the areas are geographically proximate. It is true because people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>have both actual and reasonable expectations that many of the private experiences of home life often occur outside the house. Personal interactions, daily routines and intimate relationships revolve around the entire home place.

Corbett, </em>15 Or.App. 470, 516 P.2d 487, 490 (1973)). The implied invitation theory permitting entry into the curtilage of a home has been discussed and applied, either expressly or impliedly, in case law from several other jurisdictions. <em>See, e.g., In re Gregory S., </em>112 Cal.App.3d 764, 169 Cal.Rptr. 540, 546 (1980) (noting that resident has minimal, if any, expectation of privacy in area where public has been implicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>invited); <em>State v. Cada, </em>129 Idaho 224, 923 P.2d 469, 477 (Ct.App.1996) (noting that \u201cthe direct access routes to the house, including parking areas, driveways and pathways to the entry, are areas to which the public is impliedly invited, and that police officers restricting their activity to such areas are permitted the same intrusion and the same level of observation as would be expected from a \u2018reasonably respectful citizen\u2019\u201d); <em>State v. Cloutier, </em>544 A.2d 1277, 1280 (Me.1988) (noting that \u201cthe owner impliedly invites to intrude upon his or her property only those with a legitimate social or business purpose\u201d); <em>People v.

Therefore, an officer of the law does not violate the Fourth Amendment if, in entering private property, the officer does nothing more than what a reasonably respectful citizen would do. <em>See State v. Dyreson, </em>104 Wash.App. 703, 17 P.3d 668, 672 (2001); Mei Fung So, Annotation, <em>Search and Seizure: Reasonable Expectation of Privacy in Driveways, </em>60 A.L.R. 5th 1 \u00a7 2a (1998 and Supp.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">It follows that, where the evidence establishes the police have entered the curtilage of a home without a warrant for the purpose of speaking to an occupant of the home, the entry is generally upheld. <em>See, e.g., Shaver, </em>30 Va.App. at 793-94, 520 S.E.2d at 395 (noting that \u201cinvestigators intended to speak with the defendants\u201d); <em>Alvarez v.

United States, </em>327 F.2d 301, 303 (9th Cir.1964))).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">That said, this case is manifestly not one that comes within the umbrella of implied invitation decisions. Cox made no attempt whatsoever to approach or knock on the front door of the Robinsons\u2019 home and speak to the occupants, nor did he testify to any such intent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Indeed, as discussed below, his testimony established that he was there to conduct a search. Thus, the theory of implied invitation upon which the majority relies for its rationale remains just that: a theoretical proposition of what Cox could have done, but not what he, in fact, did. The judicial decisions that invoke the implied invitation exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement that a search be conducted pursuant to a warrant do not turn on such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>abstract or hypothetical application of principles, wholly unmoored from the facts of the case. Absent an examination of the evidence showing the purpose underlying the police intrusion into constitutionally protected property, a court cannot determine whether the entry complied with constitutional mandates. As noted in <em>Rogers v. Pendleton, </em>249 F.3d 279, 289 (4th Cir.2001), police officers have no right to enter upon curtilage to make an investigation based on reasonable suspicion. Instead, the right police officers have is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqG\">the right to \u201cknock and talk,\u201d that is, to knock on a residence\u2019s door or otherwise approach the residence seeking to speak to the inhabitants, not the right to make a general investigation in the curtilage based on reasonable suspicion. A contrary rule would eviscerate the principle of <em>Oliver </em>and <em>Dunn </em>that the curtilage is entitled to the same level of Fourth Amendment protection as the home itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-5\"><em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Fourth Circuit underscored the same principle in <em>Bradshaw, </em>490 F.2d at 1100, noting, after considering all the evidence bearing on the question, that an incursion into the curtilage of a rural home to speak to the occupants was lawful when <em>\u201cunconnected with a search </em>of such premises <em>directed against the accused.\u201d Id. </em>at 1104 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>These cases demonstrate the importance of distinguishing between a police officer's right by implied invitation to \u201cknock and talk,\u201d that is, to knock on a residence\u2019s door or otherwise approach the residence by implied invitation seeking to speak to the inhabitants, and a police officer\u2019s attempt to make a general investigation in the curtilage based on reasonable suspicion. Failing to make the distinction, as the <em>Rogers </em>court warned, would unconstitutionally \u201cconvert[] this limited license to do what any citizen may do \u2014 approach the house and speak to the inhabitant or owner \u2014 into a license to search for \u2018evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rogers, </em>249 F.3d at 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">An officer\u2019s purpose in entering the curtilage is thus a critical factor in determining whether police intrusion on private property falls within the property owner\u2019s implied invitation to the public. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 289; <em>Alvarez, </em>147 F.3d at 358; <em>Bradshaw, </em>490 F.2d at 1100; <em>see also Estate of Smith v.

While the principle is sound, it has no applicability in cases involving a homeowner\u2019s implied invitation to enter constitutionally protected property to contact the occupants of the home and, it appears, the principle has not been applied in such cases. Indeed, the very colloquialism used to refer to the exception, viz., \u201cknock and talk,\u201d signifies subjective purpose as the effective analytical principle. Entry into the curtilage without a warrant to search is wholly incompatible with Fourth Amendment jurisprudence,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>judicial validation of such a result under the aegis of an implied invitation rationale, applied in the abstract as suggested by the majority, \u201ceviscerate[s] the principle of <em>Oliver </em>and <em>Dunn </em>that the curtilage is entitled to the same level of Fourth Amendment protection as the home itself.\u201d <em>Rogers, 249 F.3d </em>at 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">In the instant case, not only is there no evidence that Cox was in the Robinsons\u2019 curtilage in order to go to their front door and speak to the occupants of the house, Cox\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>makes clear that he entered the Robinsons\u2019 property in order to find evidence of a crime, viz., to surprise juveniles in the incriminating act of drinking beer and confirm his suspicion that the Robinsons were hosting an underage drinking party.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Under the facts of this case, it cannot be said that Cox\u2019s purpose was \u201cunconnected with a search.\u201d <em>See Alvarez, </em>147 F.3d at 358; <em>Bradshaw, </em>490 F.2d at 1100. I would therefore hold that Cox\u2019s entry into the curtilage violated the Robinsons\u2019 reasonable expectation of privacy and their rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">I would further hold that Cox\u2019s observations of criminal activity from his vantage point in the curtilage were not admissible pursuant to the plain view doctrine because, as discussed above, Cox\u2019s entry into the curtilage of the Robin-sons\u2019 home was not lawful. <em>See Hamlin v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 494, 502, 534 S.E.2d 363, 367 (2000) (finding that in order for a search to come within the plain view exception, two requirements must be met: \u201c \u2018(a) the officer must be lawfully in a position to view and seize the item, [and] (b) it must be immediately apparent to the officer that the item is evidence of a crime, contraband, or otherwise subject to seizure\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted)), <em>aff'd en banc, </em>35 Va.App. 375 545 S.E.2d 556 (2001). Cox was not lawfully in a position to view the minors consuming alcohol. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, the trial court\u2019s admission of Cox\u2019s observations of juveniles drinking beer, which he made as a result of his illegal entry, cannot be affirmed on the ground that the evidence was in plain view.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">For the reasons stated, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b671-9\">. The testimonial and photographic evidence reveal that a large bush, when viewed from the street, stands immediately in front of the walkway to the front door that intersects the driveway. The bush and walkway are but a few feet in front of the garage. Cox testified repeatedly that he was next to this bush in the driveway when he first saw the juveniles on the other side of the tree. Closer scrutiny of Cox\u2019s testimony reveals that, after driving his vehicle into the driveway, he continued moving down the driveway up to and past the bush that shielded the garage doors and the sidewalk leading to the front door from public view. According to his testimony, Cox was continuing his investigation into the curtilage as the nature of his observations and their implications of criminal activity became clearer.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">At one point in his testimony, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Q: And as you proceeded up the driveway further and further, the first thing you saw was [sic] persons who appeared to you to be young.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWQ\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-k\">Q: Strike that.

Such conduct goes beyond the implied invitation that any citizen has to enter the driveway and approach the front door.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b673-8\">. The majority reasons that the police had an implied invitation to approach the Robinsons\u2019 front door because, in order to gain access to the door, they, like any visitor, would have to enter the curtilage and cross the area from which Cox observed individuals he believed to be juveniles drinking beer. Therefore, according to the majority, no Fourth Amendment violation occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b675-6\">. When asked repeatedly if he entered the Robinsons\u2019 driveway with the intent to speak to an occupant of the house, the following exchange ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">Q: Officer Cox, isn\u2019t it true that it was not your intent to walk to the front door and knock on it, as you proceeded up that driveway that night?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-8\">A: My intent when I drove up the driveway was to establish probable cause, to investigate the scene further.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Furthermore, the evidence establishes that, consistent with his intent to \"investigate the scene,\u201d Cox drove directly up the driveway until he came to a point where he could observe what he expected to find: juveniles in the act of drinking beer. <em>See </em>discussion <em>supra </em>note 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b676-6\">. In <em>Rogers, </em>the officer encountered the defendant homeowner in the front yard of his house. 249 F.3d at 284. The officer testified that after speaking with the defendant, who asked him to leave, the officer wanted to speak with someone \"who was sober.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The officer then informed the defendant that he intended to conduct a search of the premises. <em>Id. </em>The court found these facts sufficient to show that the officer's intention was to search for evidence rather than to contact another homeowner. <em>Id. </em>at 287-90. Thus, any intrusion into the curtilage violated the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protections. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b676-7\">. In <em>Bradshaw, </em>the court held that the officer subsequently exceeded the \"legitimate reason\u201d for his visit when, without legally sufficient justification, he searched a vehicle near the residence. <em>Id. </em>at 1101. The court found that the officer\u2019s intent to conduct a search was evidenced by the fact that while en route to the back door to speak with the occupant of the house, the officer strayed from his path to peer into the crack between the closed doors of a nearby parked vehicle. <em>Id. </em>This detour made clear that the officer\u2019s intent was no longer to seek to speak with the defendant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b678-6\">. The majority cites only two cases in support of its contention that an examination of the purpose underlying a police officer\u2019s entry onto the curtilage of private property is improper: <em>Marasco, </em>318 F.3d 497, and <em>Alvarez, </em>147 F.3d 354. A close reading of these cases establishes that neither supports the majority's conclusions. To the contrary, both decisions are rooted in an examination of the evidence establishing the police officer\u2019s subjective intent in entering the curtilage.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The court in <em>Marasco </em>found that where the police officers approached and knocked on the defendant\u2019s front door, and then telephoned his residence from the front door in an attempt to contact him, it was clear that the officers' purpose was to speak to the occupants in response to a complaint the police had received. <em>Marasco, </em>318 F.3d at 520. Noting the lawfulness of that purpose, the Third Circuit then addressed whether, having received no answer to the knock at the front door, it was reasonable for the police to proceed to the backyard of the house and enter the garage. In reversing the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, the Third Circuit determined that \"there remain questions of fact as to whether the officers' intrusion into the curtilage was reasonable <em>in light of their asserted purpose in making their entry into Smith\u2019s property which was not to make a search.\" Id. </em>at 521 (emphasis added). The court emphasized that, to be lawful, the police objective must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>\"unconnected to any search for the fruits and instrumentalities of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. at </em>520.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa8\">Similarly, in <em>Alvarez, </em>the Fourth Circuit emphasized that the officers entered the Alvarezes\u2019 property <em>\"simply </em>to notify the homeowner or the party\u2019s host about the complaint and to ask that no one drive while intoxicated.\u201d <em>Alvarez, </em>147 F.3d at 358-59 (emphasis added). In reaching its decision, the court cited, with approval, other cases standing for the proposition that the purpose for which an officer enters the curtilage is a paramount consideration. <em>Id. </em>That consideration persists whether the court must determine the propriety of the initial intrusion by implied invitation or whether it must determine the lawfulness of intrusions beyond the front door of the house. The latter analysis is likewise predicated on the reasonableness of the intrusions beyond the front door, examined in <em>light of the officer\u2019s original purpose, viz, to interview the occupants.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AnW\">In short, both cases stand for the proposition that entry into curtilage must be independent from any intent or purpose on the part of the police to conduct a general search for evidence of criminal conduct. Logically, whether the purpose of an intrusion into curtilage is unconnected to a search for evidence necessarily involves an examination of the officer\u2019s subjective intent, as established by the testimony or the evidence of police conduct presented. <em>See supra </em>notes 11-12 (demonstrating that courts determine the purpose of an intrusion into curtilage by examining evidence of officers\u2019 subjective intent).</p>\n<p id=\"AT5\">Consistent with the theory that an officer\u2019s purpose, or subjective intent, is a determinative factor in assessing reasonableness is the requirement applied by other Circuit Courts of Appeals that an officer act in \"good faith\u201d before moving from the front door to contact an occupant of a house. <em>See, e.g., Hammett, </em>236 F.3d at 1060 (\"[A police officer] may, in good faith, move away from the front door when seeking to contact the occupants.\u201d); <em>United States v. Raines, </em>243 F.3d 419, 421 (8th Cir.2001) (holding that sheriff did not interfere with defendant\u2019s \"privacy interest when he, in good faith, went unimpeded to the [rear of the home] to contact the occupants\u201d). \"Good faith\u201d is defined, <em>inter alia, </em>as \"[a] state of mind consisting in ... honesty in belief or purpose.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>713 (8th ed.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Thus, the case law clearly recognizes and requires an inquiry into an officer\u2019s subjective purpose for being on the curtilage of a home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b680-8\">. Cox testified that he \"planned to enter the property to investigate the allegations of underage consumption of alcohol.\u201d In addition, when asked if he was \"looking for a reaction of people scattering to confirm [his] suspicion that [he] had an underage drinking party,\u201d Cox responded affirmatively.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
