On appeal, appellant contends the trial court erred in (1) finding that her statutory right to a speedy trial was not violated, (2) submitting the charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder to the jury although essential elements of those charges were not alleged with particularity in the indictment, (3) concluding that the double jeopardy doctrine did not bar her conviction for both murder and conspiracy to commit murder under the circumstances of this case, (4) determining that Wharton\u2019s Rule did not bar her conviction for both murder and conspiracy to commit murder under the circumstances of this case, and (5) excluding the testimony of Dr. Michael L. Deem regarding the mental health of Kyle Hul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>bert, the principal in the first degree in the murder, and quashing appellant\u2019s subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>seeking certain of Dr. Deem\u2019s interview notes and Loudoun County Mental Health Center\u2019s treatment notes. Finding no error, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment and appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The facts pertinent to this appeal are not in dispute. In accordance with familiar principles of appellate review, \u201c[w]e consider those facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth,\u201d the party that prevailed below. <em>Rose v. Commonwealth, </em>265 Va. 430, 432, 578 S.E.2d 758, 759 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Appellant was the youngest child of the victim, Dr. Robert Schwartz. During her senior year in high school, appellant became friends with Katherine Inglis. Appellant told Inglis that her father was \u201ccontinually doing stuff to her like try[ing] to poison her.\u201d During the summer and fall of 2001, appellant told Inglis that her father was \u201cpoisoning meat she would eat,\u201d \u201chitting her on occasion,\u201d and \u201cpulling her under the water in their pool.\u201d She also told Inglis that \u201cshe wished he was dead\u201d and that \u201cshe would inherit a third of a million dollars from her father\u201d when he died. Inglis never saw any bruises or other evidence of physical abuse by appellant\u2019s father during the time she knew appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">In August 2001, appellant, who attended James Madison University (JMU), began dating Patrick House. Appellant complained to House that her father had attempted to molest and kill her. Appellant also made statements to House about her desire for her father\u2019s death and requested that he kill him. She gave House a book that contained information about poisoning and told him that she wanted her father\u2019s killing to \u201clook natural\u201d so it would \u201cnot be able to be traced back to her.\u201d She also told House that she would inherit money from her father when he died but \u201cwas concerned [he] was trying to cut her out of [his] will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">In September 2001, appellant went out to dinner with House and Inglis. During the meal, appellant said that her steak <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>had been poisoned and speculated that her father had \u201cgotten in touch with the cook.\u201d Later, appellant asked House \u201cwhen [he] planned on killing her father,\u201d to which House responded, \u201cWhen the time was right, it would happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Later in September 2001, appellant met Kyle Hulbert at a Renaissance Fair in Maryland. Hulbert quickly became close friends with appellant, Inglis, and Inglis\u2019s boyfriend, Michael Pfohl. Appellant told Hulbert that \u201cshe had been suffering from mental and emotional abuse from her father,\u201d her father made \u201cdeath threats\u201d to her, and her father \u201chad poisoned her [food] on several occasions.\u201d Appellant told Hulbert that appellant and her father \u201cwere going to the Virgin Islands for Christmas vacation\u201d and that her father \u201cwas planning on making sure she did not come back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In November 2001, Hulbert, Inglis, and Pfohl drove to James Madison University to spend the weekend with appellant. Appellant complained to Hulbert about \u201chow her father had abused her and poisoned her\u201d and showed him \u201csome of her journals\u201d in which she had documented those events. At the end of the weekend, appellant said to Inglis, \u201cMaybe Kyle can help me with my father.\u201d She also told Inglis that she would be able to take a semester off \u201cif her father died while she was in college.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">After the weekend, appellant and Hulbert began to exchange instant messages and speak by telephone almost daily. During one instant message session, Hulbert responded to appellant\u2019s claim that her father had tried to kill her by saying appellant\u2019s father was lucky Hulbert did not know where he lived. Hulbert then asked appellant for permission to kill her father. Appellant told him to wait, saying they would talk more about it in person. Appellant further informed Hulbert that House also wanted to kill her father and that, if Hulbert did it, he should ensure it could not be traced back to her. Appellant then gave Hulbert general directions to her father\u2019s house, which was located in a rural area of Loudoun County.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">On Thanksgiving weekend, appellant arranged for Hulbert to camp clandestinely in the woods near her father\u2019s house. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Inglis and Pfohl dropped Hulbert off after dark. The next day, Hulbert went to the house to see appellant. During the brief visit, he met appellant\u2019s father and older sister and showed them a sword he had with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Soon thereafter, Hulbert asked appellant to send him money for gas so Pfohl could drive him and for gloves and a \u201cdo-rag\u201d to \u201cprevent him from leaving hairs at the scene\u201d when he killed her father. On December 6, 2001, appellant wrote Hulbert a check for $60 and sent it to him via overnight mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">On the evening of December 8, 2001, Inglis and Pfohl dropped Hulbert off near appellant\u2019s father\u2019s property. Hulbert, who had his sword strapped to his side, proceeded on foot to appellant\u2019s father\u2019s house. When appellant\u2019s father answered the door, Hulbert entered the house and killed him, stabbing him over thirty times with the sword. The next day, Hulbert told appellant on the telephone that he had killed her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">A neighbor, learning appellant\u2019s father had not reported to work, discovered his body on December 10, 2001. Loudoun County Investigator Greg Locke traveled to James Madison University to inform appellant of her father\u2019s death. When asked about her friends, appellant provided information to the investigator about Hulbert, House, Pfohl, and Inglis, among others. Hulbert was arrested the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">After initially saying she thought Hulbert was only \u201cventing\u201d or \u201ckidding\u201d when he said he was going to kill her father, appellant told Investigator Locke, \u201cI want to go straight. In my heart of hearts, I knew that [Hulbert] was going there to kill [my father].\u201d Appellant was arrested on February 1, 2002, for the murder of her father and held continuously in custody thereafter. After being taken to jail, appellant told her cellmate that the plan was for Hulbert to kill her father \u201cbecause if anything came up he would take the blame because he had mental issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">After a preliminary hearing on March 21, 2002, the juvenile and domestic relations district court found probable cause and certified appellant\u2019s murder charge to the circuit court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>consideration by a grand jury. On March 29, 2002, the grand jury returned a four-count indictment charging appellant with murder, conspiracy to commit a felony, and two counts of solicitation to commit a felony. Specifically, count one of the indictment alleged that, \u201c[o]n or about the 8th day of December, 2001, in the County of Loudoun [appellant] ... did feloniously, willfully and deliberately, and with premeditation, kill and murder [her father] ... in violation of [Code \u00a7 ] 18.2-32.\u201d Count two alleged that, \u201cduring the period from on or about November 2001 to on or about December 2001, [appellant] did feloniously and unlawfully conspire, confederate or combine with ... Kyle Hulbert, et. al [sic] ... to commit a felony within this Commonwealth, in violation of [Code \u00a7 ] 18.2-22.\u201d Count three alleged that, \u201cduring the period of November 2001 [appellant] did feloniously and unlawfully command, entreat, or otherwise attempt to persuade another person to commit a felony, in violation of [Code \u00a7 ] 18.2-29.\u201d Finally, the fourth count alleged that, \u201cduring the period from on or about June 2001 to on or about November 2001, [appellant] did feloniously and unlawfully command, entreat, or otherwise attempt to persuade another person to commit a felony, in violation of [Code \u00a7 ] 18.2-29.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">By order entered April 5, 2002, the trial court set the case for trial by jury commencing August 5, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">On June 14, 2002, appellant filed a motion seeking a bill of particulars as to counts two, three, and four of the indictment. With respect to count two, appellant sought to have the Commonwealth identify \u201cthe person(s), if any, referenced by the phrase \u2018et. al [sic]\u2019\u201d and \u201cwhere and when the alleged agreement took place.\u201d With respect to counts three and four, appellant sought to have the Commonwealth identify the date and location of the alleged solicitation, \u201cthe person who was the object of the alleged solicitation,\u201d and \u201cthe felony which was the subject of the alleged solicitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">In response, the Commonwealth identified Hulbert and House as the recipients of the respective solicitations in counts three and four and identified murder and conspiracy to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>mit murder as the object felonies of both of those counts. The Commonwealth argued that further particularization of counts two, three, and four was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The trial court agreed that most of the other requested particularizations were not required, but directed the Commonwealth to particularize the persons identified in count two by the phrase \u201cet. a! [sic].\u201d Count two was subsequently amended to reflect that the conspiracy was with Hulbert alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">On July 3, 2002, Investigator Locke underwent medically necessary, major back surgery. On July 24, 2002, the Commonwealth moved for a continuance of the trial based on Locke\u2019s failure to recover from his surgery as quickly as expected. The parties stipulated that Locke was a material witness. The trial court initially denied the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for lack of evidence \u201cfrom an expert\u201d and continued the matter pending examination of Locke\u2019s medical records by a board-certified neurosurgeon to ascertain whether Locke would be \u201cphysically unable from a medical standpoint to testify\u201d at the scheduled trial. The trial court required that the selected expert be made available to confer with counsel by telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">In an affidavit dated July 30, 2002, Dr. Michael G. Radley, a board-certified neurosurgeon and fellow of the American College of Surgeons, reported that, having reviewed the medical records relating to Locke\u2019s surgery and follow-up treatment, it was his opinion that Locke\u2019s condition did not allow him to sit in court longer than twenty to thirty minutes \u201cwithout the potential for significant increasing back pain.\u201d Dr. Radley further opined that it was \u201chighly likely that if that time in court [was] greater than one day, [Locke\u2019s] increasing pain [would potentially] not allow him to continue through the entire proceedings.\u201d Dr. Radley advised that Locke not \u201cbe required to sit for prolonged periods of time\u201d for another six to eight weeks. After submitting the affidavit, Dr. Radley was made available to counsel for both parties for telephonic consultation.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Based on Dr. Radley\u2019s affidavit, the trial court, over appellant\u2019s objection, granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for a continuance and set the trial for October 7, 2002. Appellant subsequently moved for dismissal of the charges against her on speedy trial grounds, noting that the rescheduled trial exceeded the five-month limitation set forth in Code \u00a7 19.2-243 by more than six weeks. In denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the trial court recited Dr. Radley\u2019s opinions and explained that the court, \u201crespecting the rights of the parties in this case, set [the trial date] at the minimum that it could [be] set within what the doctor had testified to [as] the [time] frame ... within which [Locke] would be able to testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Following his arrest, Hulbert was charged in the circuit court with the first-degree murder of appellant\u2019s father. The court directed Loudoun County Mental Health Center to perform a mental evaluation to determine Hulbert\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense, pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5, and to assist Hulbert\u2019s counsel in his criminal defense, including providing treatment to Hulbert if necessary. Dr. Deem, a clinical psychologist with Loudoun County Mental Health Center, performed the ordered mental evaluation, and other personnel at Loudoun County Mental Health Center provided treatment to Hulbert.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">On September 17, 2002, appellant requested the issuance of a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>to Dr. Deem for production of certain \u201cdocuments relied upon by Loudoun County Mental Health Center in the formation of opinions or reports regarding the mental health of Kyle Hulbert.\u201d Specifically, appellant sought the notes prepared by Dr. Deem of his interviews with third parties regarding Hulbert\u2019s mental health, \u201c[d]oeuments prepared by third parties subsequent to December 8, 2001, and forwarded to Dr. Deem to assist in his evaluation,\u201d and Loudoun County Mental Health Center\u2019s treatment notes concerning Hulbert.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Hulbert\u2019s and Loudoun County Mental Health Center\u2019s respective attorneys filed motions to quash the requested subpoena. Hulbert\u2019s counsel acknowledged, at the October 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>2002 hearing on the motions to quash, that the \u201c[d]ocuments prepared by third parties subsequent to December 8, 2001, and forwarded to Dr. Deem to assist in his evaluation\u201d were not privileged or otherwise protected. He argued, however, that Dr. Deem\u2019s third-party-interview notes in preparation of the Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5 report and Loudoun County Mental Health Center\u2019s treatment notes were protected by the attorney-client privilege set forth in Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5(E), which Hulbert had not waived, and the work product doctrine. Hulbert\u2019s counsel, whom the court had directed to review the relevant documents in order to particularize his objections, further argued that the treatment notes were \u201cindispensable to his defense\u201d of, Hulbert because \u201c90 percent of the content [of] those ... notes [were] statements of the facts from Kyle Hulbert.\u201d \\</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Finding that Dr. Deein\u2019s notes of his interviews with third parties and the Loudoun County Mental Health Center\u2019s treatment notes were protected under the attorney-client privilege because \u201cDr. Deem was an indispensable agent of [Hulbert\u2019s] attorney,\u201d the trial court granted the motions to quash with respect to those documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Appellant\u2019s trial commenced on October 7, 2002. During the trial, appellant adduced evidence that Hulbert had demonstrated antisocial and unstable behaviors in the past and had a history of mental problems. When appellant called Dr. Deem to testify regarding Hulbert\u2019s mental state, Hulbert\u2019s attorney objected to the admission of such testimony on the ground that Dr. Deem was his agent and Dr. Deem\u2019s testimony regarding Hulbert\u2019s mental state was protected by the attorney-client privilege. The trial court sustained the objection, noting that Dr. Deem had prepared the court-ordered Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Following the presentation of evidence, the trial court refused appellant\u2019s instruction on manslaughter and instructed the jury, over the appellant\u2019s objection, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The defendant is charged with the crime of first degree murder. The Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following elements of that crime:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">1. That Kyle Hulbert killed Dr. Robert Schwartz; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">2. That the killing was malicious; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">3. That the killing was willful, deliberate and premeditated; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">4. That the defendant acted as an accessory before the fact or conspired with Kyle Hulbert in the commission of the killing of Dr. Robert Schwartz as those terms are defined in other instructions by the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Appellant contended the homicide charge submitted to the jury could \u201cbe no more than a voluntary manslaughter\u201d because count one of the indictment did not allege the element of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">The trial court also instructed the jury (1) that, on the murder charge, the Commonwealth had to prove appellant, \u201cas an accessory before the fact, shared the criminal intent of ... Hulbert,\u201d (2) that \u201c[a]n accessory before the fact is liable for the same punishment as the person who actually committed the crime,\u201d and (3) that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">[a]n accessory before the fact is one who is not present at the time of the commission of the crime, but who, before the commission of the crime, in some way planned, advised or assisted in the commission of the crime, knowing or having reason to know of the intent of the principal to commit the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">The trial court further instructed the jury, over the appellant\u2019s objection, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-13\">The defendant is charged with the crime of conspiracy. The Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following elements of that crime:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-14\">1. That the defendant entered into an agreement with Kyle Hulbert; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-15\">2. That the agreement was to commit murder; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>3. That both the defendant and Kyle Hulbert intended to commit murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Appellant contended the Commonwealth was \u201cnot entitled to the word \u2018murder\u2019 in [the] instruction\u201d because count two of the indictment charged her only with conspiracy to \u201ccommit a felony\u201d without specifying the object felony. In rejecting appellant\u2019s argument, the trial court reasoned that no \u201cother felony [was] suggested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The jury found appellant guilty of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and two counts of solicitation to commit murder. The jury recommended a sentence of thirty years for the murder, eight years for the conspiracy, and five years for each of the solicitations, for a total sentence of forty-eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Following trial, appellant filed a motion to set aside the murder and conspiracy convictions on the ground that the jury should not have been instructed she was charged with first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder because count one of the indictment did not allege malice and accomplice liability and count two did not allege the object felony. Appellant also moved to have the conspiracy conviction set aside and the charge dismissed (1) on double jeopardy grounds because, as submitted to the jury, count two was a lesser-included offense of count one and (2) for violation of Wharton\u2019s Rule. After denying appellant\u2019s post-trial motions, the trial court imposed the recommended forty-eight-year sentence in a final order entered February 19,2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">II. RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">On appeal, appellant contends the trial court erred in refusing to grant her motion to dismiss the charges against her on the ground that she was denied her right to a speedy trial because the trial court improperly continued the commencement of her trial beyond the deadline established by Code \u00a7 19.2-243. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Code \u00a7 19.2-243 constitutes Virginia\u2019s \u201cstatutory embodiment of the constitutional right to a speedy trial.\u201d <em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 3, 5, 353 S.E.2d 790, 791 (1987). The statute protects the accused from lengthy incarceration prior to trial by mandating the dismissal of charges where more than five months elapse from the indictment or finding of probable cause by the district court to the commencement of trial. Code \u00a7 19.2-243. The application of the statute may be tolled, however, for any of several enumerated conditions, including when a prosecution witness is \u201cprevented from attending [the trial] by sickness or accident.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-243(2); <em>see Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 148, 152-53, 502 S.E.2d 704, 706 (1998) (\u201cStrict adherence to the statutory time requirement is tempered by the provisions setting forth specific circumstances excusing the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to bring an accused to trial within the prescribed time.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In this case, the juvenile and domestic relations district court found probable cause and certified the murder charge on March 21, 2002, and the grand jury indicted appellant on the three other related charges on March 29, 2002. The trial court originally set the trial to commence within the five-month limitation period prescribed by Code \u00a7 19.2-243, on August 5, 2002. Subsequently, however, applying the \u201csickness\u201d exception of Code \u00a7 19.2-243(2), the trial court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for a continuance to allow for Investigator Locke\u2019s recovery from his medically necessary back surgery and set the trial for October 7, 2002, which, as appellant points out, was beyond the statutory limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">At issue, therefore, is whether Locke\u2019s medically necessary back surgery properly implicated the \u201csickness\u201d exception set forth in Code \u00a7 19.2-243(2). Because this is a question of law involving statutory interpretation, we review the trial court\u2019s judgment <em>de novo. See Sink v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 655, 658, 507 S.E.2d 670, 671 (1998) (\u201cAlthough the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact are binding on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>unless plainly wrong, we review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Appellant argues that the word \u201csickness\u201d has a plain and unambiguous meaning that places Locke\u2019s surgery and his recovery from that surgery outside the scope of the exception. In support of her position, appellant points to the definition of \u201csickness\u201d propounded in <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary: </em>\u201cIllness; disease. An ailment of such a character as to affect the general soundness and health; not a mere temporary indisposition, which does not tend to undermine and weaken the constitution.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1380 (6th ed.1990).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Locke\u2019s surgery, appellant argues, \u201cwas not an illness or a disease\u201d and, thus, \u201cwas not \u2018sickness\u2019 within the meaning of Code \u00a7 19.2-243(2).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">We find no merit in appellant\u2019s argument. It is well established that, \u201c[w]hen, as here, a statute contains no express definition of a term, the general rule of statutory construction is to infer the legislature\u2019s intent from the plain meaning of the language used,\u201d in light of the context in which the term at issue is used. <em>Hubbard v. Henrico Ltd. Partnership, 255 </em>Va. 335, 340, 497 S.E.2d 335, 338 (1998). We will not \u201capply \u2018an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute\u2019 that would subvert the legislative intent expressed therein.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 581, 562 S.E.2d 139, 144 (2002) (quoting <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 761, 250 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1979)); <em>see also Commonwealth v. Zamani, </em>256 Va. 391, 395, 507 S.E.2d 608, 609 (1998) (noting that the \u201cplain, obvious, and rational meaning\u201d of the statute should prevail \u201cover any curious, narrow, or strained construction\u201d). In the present context, the plain meaning of the term \u201csickness\u201d includes \u201cthe condition of being ill,\u201d \u201ca disordered, weakened or unsound condition,\u201d and \u201ca form of disease.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2111 (1993). Here, it is clear from the record that, as a result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>of major back surgery, Investigator Locke was in \u201ca disordered, weakened or unsound condition\u201d that, as the trial court implicitly found, made him \u201cphysically unable from a medical standpoint to testify\u201d at trial within the time limit prescribed by Code \u00a7 19.2-243. We cannot say, therefore, that Locke\u2019s condition during his recuperation from surgery was not \u201csickness\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 19.2-243(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Indeed, this interpretation is also compelled by the definition of \u201csickness\u201d espoused by appellant. Although arguably not an \u201cillness\u201d or \u201cdisease,\u201d the debilitative effect of Locke\u2019s surgery plainly constituted \u201c[a]n ailment of such a character as to affect [his] general soundness and health ... [and] undermine and weaken [his] constitution.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra, </em>at 1380.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Moreover, the interpretation urged by appellant would lead to an absurdity, since it would permit the tolling of Code \u00a7 19.2-243\u2019s strictures as long as a witness suffered from an illness or disease that prevented him or her from appearing at trial but require resumption of the running of the limitation period if the witness has surgery to treat the illness or disease, no matter how debilitating the surgery\u2019s effect. This result would eviscerate the statute of its purpose, which is to provide for speedy trial exceptions in circumstances \u201cbeyond the control of the trial judge and the parties,\u201d when delays are warranted to \u201censure a fair trial to both the accused and the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Baity v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 497, 502, 431 S.E.2d 891, 894 (1993). We will not interpret a statute \u201cso that it leads to absurd results.\u201d <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">We hold, therefore, that the trial court properly continued the commencement of appellant\u2019s trial beyond the five-month deadline set forth in Code \u00a7 19.2-243 due to Investigator Locke\u2019s inability to attend trial because of \u201csickness.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>III. PARTICULARITY OF THE INDICTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Appellant further contends the trial court erred in instructing the jury that she was charged with first-degree murder as an \u201caccessory before the fact or co-conspirator\u201d and conspiracy to commit murder because the Commonwealth did not allege essential elements of those offenses. In light of such omissions, she argues, the submission of the murder and conspiracy charges to the jury violated her due process and notice rights under the United States and Virginia Constitutions and Code \u00a7 19.2-220. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u201cBoth the United States and Virginia Constitutions recognize that a criminal defendant enjoys the right to be advised of the cause and nature of the accusation lodged against [her].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Simpson v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 109, 114, 267 S.E.2d 134, 138 (1980). \u201cThe important concerns evident in these provisions are fully honored by Virginia Code \u00a7 [ ] 19.2-220, [which] ... requires that an indictment name the accused, describe the offense charged, identify the location of the alleged commission, and designate a date for the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn indictment, to be sufficient, must give an accused notice of the nature and character of the charged offense so the accused can make his defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Dalton, </em>259 Va. 249, 253, 524 S.E.2d 860, 862 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\u2018When considering on appeal whether an indictment charged a particular offense, we limit our scrutiny to the face of the document.\u201d <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 192, 198, 497 S.E.2d 908, 910 (1998). However, since it is the function of the bill of particulars to supply additional information to the defendant concerning an accusation, \u201cthe bill of particulars and the indictment must be read together.\u201d <em>Livingston v. Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 830, 837, 36 S.E.2d 561, 565 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>(1946). We also consider as \u201cincorporated by reference\u201d the statutes cited in the indictment. <em>Reed v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 665, 667, 353 S.E.2d 166, 167-68 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">A. Murder Charge</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Count one of the indictment, on which appellant was prosecuted for murder, alleged, in pertinent part, that appellant \u201cdid feloniously, willfully and deliberately, and with premeditation, kill and murder [her father] ... in violation of [Code \u00a7 ] 18.2-32.\u201d At trial, the court refused appellant\u2019s manslaughter instruction and instructed the jury that appellant was charged with first-degree murder. The court further instructed the jury that, to sustain the murder conviction, the Commonwealth had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Hulbert killed appellant\u2019s father, \u201cthe killing was malicious ... willful, deliberate and premeditated,\u201d and appellant \u201cacted as an accessory before the fact or conspired with ... Hulbert in the commission of the killing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Appellant first submits that she could not properly be convicted of or punished for a homicide offense greater than voluntary manslaughter because count one of the indictment failed to allege malice, a necessary element of the crime of murder. <em>See Rhodes v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 480, 485, 384 S.E.2d 95, 98 (1989) (\u201cMalice, an essential element of all grades of murder, distinguishes murder from manslaughter.\u201d). That defect, she argues, unlawfully denied her notice of the nature and character of the first-degree-murder charge submitted to the jury. Appellant acknowledges that count one of the indictment complied with the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-221<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that \u201cthe Supreme Court of Virginia has repeatedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>upheld Code \u00a7 19.2-221 against constitutional challenges\u201d in the past. <em>See, e.g., Simpson v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 109, 115, 267 S.E.2d 134, 139 (1980); <em>Barber v. Commonwealth, </em>206 Va. 241, 246-47, 142 S.E.2d 484, 489 (1965). She asserts, however, that the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), rendered those Virginia Supreme Court cases \u201cobsolete\u201d and Code \u00a7 19.2-221\u2019s provisions permitting the use of a short-form indictment for murder unconstitutional. Thus, she concludes, the submission of the charge of first-degree murder to the jury violated her constitutional and statutory rights to due process and notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">This Court recently addressed the same issue in <em>Walshaw v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 103, 603 S.E.2d 633 (2004), <em>appeal filed, </em>No. 042542 (November 12, 2004). Thus, our decision in that case, which was issued during the pendency of this appeal, controls the disposition of the present issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">As in this case, the appellant in <em>Walshaw </em>challenged the indictment as not setting forth with sufficient particularity the elements necessary to convict and punish him on the charge of first-degree murder. <em>Id. </em>at 107, 603 S.E.2d at 634. There, as here, the short-form indictment complied with Code \u00a7 19.2-221, referenced Code \u00a7 18.2-32, and did not allege malice, and the appellant argued that the jury should only have been instructed on voluntary manslaughter. <em>Id. </em>at 107-08, 110, 603 S.E.2d at 635-36. The defective indictment, he contended, \u201cdenied him adequate notice of the charge against him as required by the United States Constitution and ... <em>Apprendi.\u201d Id. </em>at 108-09, 603 S.E.2d at 635. After concluding that the issue before the United States Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi </em>\u2014 \u201cwhether the sentencing judge could impose a sentence in excess of the maximum for the offense of which the defendant had been indicted and convicted under New Jersey law\u201d \u2014 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>wholly inapposite to the resolution of the issue before this Court, we held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">that the short form statutory indictment on which appellant was convicted fully informed him of the nature and cause of the accusation against him as required by the United States and Virginia Constitutions. The absence of the word[ ] \u201cmalice\u201d ... in the indictment did not render it defective to charge first-degree murder. It was sufficient that it alleged that appellant \u201cmurdered\u201d [the victim] and that it referred to Code \u00a7 18.2-32. Finding no constitutional defect in appellant\u2019s indictment, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 112-15, 603 S.E.2d at 637-39 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Accordingly, we hold that <em>Apprendi </em>is inapposite to the instant issue, since, as in <em>Walshaw, </em>\u201cappellant did not face an enhanced punishment imposed by a judge beyond the statutory maximum for the crime of which [she] was convicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114, 603 S.E.2d at 638. We further hold that, even though it did not allege malice, count one of the indictment informed appellant of the nature and character of the murder charge on which she was convicted and gave her adequate notice of the offense to make her defense. Thus, the submission of the charge of first-degree murder to the jury did not violate her constitutional and statutory rights to due process and notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Appellant also maintains that she could not lawfully be convicted of or punished for murder as \u201can accessory before the fact or co-conspirator,\u201d the theory on which her conviction for murder rested, because count one of the indictment failed to allege any fact supporting a theory of accomplice liability. As a result, she asserts, she had no notice that she would need to defend herself from prosecution by the Commonwealth under such a theory. Thus, she argues, the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AufX\">situation here is analogous to that in <em>Commonwealth v. Dalton, </em>259 Va. 249, 524 S.E.2d 860 (2000). In <em>Dalton, </em>the Supreme Court of Virginia held that the United States and Virginia Constitutions, as well as Code \u00a7 19.2-220, bar a defendant\u2019s conviction for accessory after the fact on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>indictment as a principal.... Likewise, the same constitutional authorities bar the Commonwealth from convicting appellant on an accessory [before the fact] or co-conspirator theory on an indictment as a principal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Accordingly, appellant concludes, the trial court erred in submitting the murder charge to the jury based on the theory of accomplice liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Dalton </em>is misplaced. Indeed, <em>Dalton </em>supports the trial court\u2019s action here.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">In <em>Dalton, </em>our Supreme Court addressed the issue whether a defendant who was tried on an indictment charging murder was entitled to an accessory-after-the-fact jury instruction. In analyzing that issue, the Supreme Court first noted that, pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-220 and the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Virginia Constitutions, the indictment must give the accused \u201cnotice of the nature and character of the charged offense so the accused can make his defense.\u201d <em>Dalton, </em>259 Va. at 253, 524 S.E.2d at 862. Citing the common-law principle that \u201can accused cannot be convicted of a crime that has not been charged, unless the crime is a lesser-included offense of the crime charged,\u201d the Supreme Court then articulated the rule that \u201cneither the Commonwealth nor an accused is entitled to a jury instruction on an offense not charged, unless the offense is a lesser-included offense of the charged offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court then proceeded to determine that \u201cthe crime of being an accessory after the fact is not a lesser-included offense of the crime of murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253-54, 524 S.E.2d at 862-63. The Court\u2019s analysis did not conclude at that point, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Instead, the Supreme Court went on to consider whether Code \u00a7 19.2-286 \u2014 which provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[o]n an indictment for felony the jury may find the accused not guilty of the felony but guilty of ... being an accessory thereto\u201d \u2014 creates a statutory exception permitting the giving of an accessory-after-the fact instruction on a felony indictment against the defendant as a principal. Examining the legislative history of the statute, the Court noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Code \u00a7 19.2-286 was formerly Code \u00a7 19.1-254. Former Code \u00a7 19.1-254, as it existed prior to its repeal in 1975, provided that \u201con an indictment for felony the jury may find the accused not guilty of the felony but guilty of an attempt to commit such felony, <em>or of being an accessory after the fact.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In 1975, when Title 19.2 of the Code replaced Title 19.1, the statute was changed by substituting the term \u201caccessory thereto\u201d for the term \u201caccessory after the fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">In deleting the modifier, \u201cafter the fact,\u201d the General Assembly indicated its intention to eliminate accessories after the fact from the application of Code \u00a7 19.2-286. <em>By limiting the statute\u2019s application to accessories before the fact, any conflict between the statute and the notification requirements of due process was avoided.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 254, 524 S.E.2d at 863 (second emphasis added). Having thus found that the exception established in Code \u00a7 19.2-286 was intended to apply only to accessories before the fact, the Court held that, \u201cbefore a defendant can be tried and convicted of being an accessory after the fact, he must be charged with that offense\u201d and that, \u201c[ujnless such a charge is specifically made, neither the Commonwealth nor an accused is entitled to an accessory-after-the-fact instruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255, 524 S.E.2d at 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Notwithstanding appellant\u2019s claim that the ambit of the Supreme Court\u2019s ultimate holding in <em>Dalton </em>extends analogically to the circumstances of the present case, it is clear from the above-quoted portion of the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Dalton </em>and the plain language of Code \u00a7 19.2-286 that a defendant may be convicted of being an accessory before the fact on a felony indictment charging the defendant as a principal and that such a conviction does not violate \u201cthe notification requirements of due process.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It follows, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>fore, that the Commonwealth is entitled, under Code \u00a7 19.2-286, to an accessory-before-the-fact instruction on a felony indictment even when the defendant is not charged in the indictment with being an accessory before the fact to the felony. This conclusion is also compelled by the plain language of Code \u00a7 18.2-18, which provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cevery accessory before the fact may be indicted, tried, convicted and punished <em>in all respects </em>as if a principal in the first degree.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) <em>See Hyman v. Commonwealth, </em>206 Va. 891, 892-98, 147 S.E.2d 156, 157 (1966) (holding that, pursuant to the same, \u201cperfectly plain\u201d language of the statutory predecessor of Code \u00a7 18.2-18, the defendant could properly be convicted as an accessory before the fact on an indictment charging statutory burglary); <em>Sutton v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 654, 668-69, 324 S.E.2d 665, 673 (1985) (Poff, J., concurring) (noting that, \u201c[a]t common law, an accessory before the fact to a felony could not be convicted under an indictment charging him as a principal\u201d and that Code \u00a7 18.2-18 \u201cabolish[es] the common law distinction\u201d between an accessory before the fact and a principal); <em>id. </em>at 670 n. *, 324 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>S.E.2d at 674 n. * (Stephenson, J., dissenting) (noting that, \u201c[h]ad [the defendant] been indicted as a principal in the first degree, she could have been convicted as an accessory before the fact\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-18).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Here, appellant was charged in the indictment with first-degree murder. Consequently, the Commonwealth was entitled to an accessory-before-the-fact jury instruction on that offense. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in submitting the murder charge to the jury based on the theory that appellant was \u201can accessory before the fact or co-conspirator\u201d in the commission of the charged murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">B. Conspiracy Charge</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">As amended, count two of the indictment alleged, in pertinent part, that appellant \u201cdid feloniously and unlawfully conspire, confederate or combine with ... Kyle Hulbert, ... to commit a felony ..., in violation of [Code \u00a7 ] 18.2-22.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At trial, the court instructed the jury that appellant was charged with conspiracy and that the Commonwealth had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant \u201centered into an agreement with Kyle Hulbert,\u201d that \u201cthe agreement was to commit murder,\u201d and that appellant and Hulbert both \u201cintend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>ed to commit murder.\u201d After the jury found appellant guilty of conspiracy, the trial court gave the jury an instruction setting out the range of punishment that could be imposed for a Class 5 felony. The jury recommended a term of imprisonment of eight years for the conspiracy, which the court subsequently imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Appellant contends on appeal, as she did below, that the Commonwealth was not entitled to have the object felony of the charged conspiracy identified in the instruction as murder because count two of the indictment did not identify the object felony as murder. She claims that, if the Commonwealth intended to seek her conviction of and punishment for a Class 5 felony offense of conspiracy under Code \u00a7 18.2-22(a)(2), as opposed to the less severe offense of conspiracy set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-22(a)(3), count two should have specifically identified the object felony of the conspiracy as murder or, at least, identified it as an offense that was punishable by five or more years\u2019 incarceration. Since count two failed to identify the object felony, she was not, she argues, properly notified of the conspiracy-to-commit-murder charge. Relying on the rule stated by this Court in <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 350, 381 S.E.2d 512 (1989), that, in order to convict a defendant under a statute that contains multiple offenses carrying different punishments, \u201cthe indictment must contain an assertion of the facts essential to the punishment sought to be imposed,\u201d appellant further argues that, because count two identified no specific felony as the object of the charged conspiracy and alleged no fact authorizing any but the minimum punishment set forth in the Code \u00a7 18.2-22(a), the indictment could only support conviction for the least serious offense contemplated by the statute, since she \u201ccannot be expected to have assumed that [she] was charged with [a greater offense] unless it was expressly charged in the indictment.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>8 Va.App. at 352, 381 S.E.2d at 513. Thus, she concludes, the trial court violated her rights to due process and notice by submitting the charge of conspiracy to commit murder to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Hall </em>in this case is misplaced. Code \u00a7 18.2-300, the statute under which the appellant in <em>Hall </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>convicted, \u201cdefines two separate crimes,\u201d one each in its two subsections, A and B.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 351, 381 S.E.2d at 512. In <em>Hall, </em>the appellant was specifically \u201cindicted for the use of a \u2018sawed-off shotgun\u2019 in the commission of a \u2018crime,\u2019 \u201d a Class 4 felony in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-300(B). <em>Id. </em>However, the trial court instructed the jury that the appellant was charged with the more serious crime of \u201cusing a \u2018sawed-off shotgun in the commission of a crime \u2018of violence,\u201d\u2019 a Class 2 felony in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-300(A). <em>Id. </em>at 351, 381 S.E.2d at 512-13. \u201cThe jury was also instructed that the range of punishment was that of a Class 2, not a Class 4, felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351-52, 381 S.E.2d at 513. Since the indictment failed to give the appellant notice of the crime of which he was convicted and, in fact, advised him that he was charged with the other, less serious crime set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-300, we reversed his conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 352, 381 S.E.2d at 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Here, however, appellant was correctly informed in count two of the indictment that she was charged with conspiracy to commit a felony in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-22. Appellant nevertheless argues that she could not be convicted of and punished for a Class 5 felony offense of conspiracy because the indictment failed to allege an object felony. At the heart of appellant\u2019s argument is the implicit assertion that subsections 1, 2, and 3 of Code \u00a7 18.2-22(a) each contain a distinct conspiracy offense carrying its own punishment range based on the gravity of the object felony. Appellant, however, is mistaken about the nature of the statute under which she was convicted. Rather than setting out three distinct offenses, Code \u00a7 18.2-22(a) defines only a single offense \u2014 conspiracy to commit a felony. That offense, consisting of the \u201cproscribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>conduct [and] the attendant elements, is clearly defined in the initial sentence of the statute.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 748, 754, 561 S.E.2d 56, 59 (2002) (examining, in consideration of a similar issue, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-22. The punishment for the offense is then set out in subsequent subsections based on the gravity of the object felony, ranging from a fine \u201cnot exceeding $500\u201d up to a prison term of twenty years and a fine of $100,000. Code \u00a7 18.2-22(a); Code \u00a7 18.2-10. It is clear, therefore, from the statutory scheme set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-22(a), that, contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, the subsections of Code \u00a7 18.2-22(a) contain gradations of punishment, not separate and distinct offenses comprised of their own discrete elements. Indeed, as we observed relative to the statute at issue in <em>Thomas, </em>\u201csuch disparate penalties do not spawn gradations of the offense. The crime is not defined by the penalty.\u201d 37 Va.App. at 754, 561 S.E.2d at 59. Accordingly, this is not a case like <em>Hall, </em>in which the trial court allowed \u201cthe Commonwealth [to] ... effectively ambush the accused with an instruction that would effectively permit the jury to convict an accused for a separate crime not charged in the indictment.\u201d <em>Dalton, </em>259 Va. at 256, 524 S.E.2d at 864 (Koontz, J., dissenting). Hence, <em>Hall </em>is inapposite, and appellant\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Because count two fully informed appellant that she was charged with conspiring to commit a felony, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-22, and because conspiracy to commit a felony is the only crime set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-22, we hold that count two was sufficient to advise appellant \u201cof the cause and nature of the accusation lodged against [her],\u201d as required by the United States and Virginia Constitutions. <em>Simpson, </em>221 Va. at 114, 267 S.E.2d at 138. \u201cTo the extent appellant required additional particulars of the charge to [more ably] defend [herself, she] could have requested [such particulars in her motion for] a bill of particulars.\u201d <em>Walshaw, </em>44 Va.App. at 115 n. 6, 603 S.E.2d at 639 n. 6. Although appellant requested particulars regarding the object felonies of the solicitation charges in counts three and four of the indictment and particulars regarding the phrase \u201cet. al [sic]\u201d in count two, she did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>not seek particulars regarding the object felony of the conspiracy alleged in count two. Likewise, appellant does not assert, and the record does not show, that she suffered any prejudice because count two of the indictment did not identify the object felony as murder. As the trial court effectively found, no \u201cother [object] felony [was] suggested\u201d by the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">We hold, therefore, that, in the context of this case, the trial court did not err in submitting the charge of conspiracy to commit murder to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">IV. DOUBLE JEOPARDY</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">As previously noted, the Commonwealth\u2019s prosecution of appellant for first-degree murder was based on the theory that appellant participated in the commission of the charged murder as an accessory before the fact and was, therefore, subject, under Code \u00a7 18.2-18, to conviction and punishment for the murder as if she were the principal in the first degree. At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court gave, without objection by the Commonwealth, a finding instruction that informed the jury that, to prove the murder charge lodged against appellant in count one of the indictment, the Commonwealth had to prove, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellant \u201cacted as an accessory before the fact or conspired with ... Hulbert in the commission of the killing.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The same instruction effectively incorporated by reference the definition of \u201can accessory before the fact\u201d set forth in another instruction and the elements of conspiracy-to-commit-murder contained in the finding instruction subsequently given by the court for the conspiracy charge lodged against appellant in count two of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">On appeal, appellant acknowledges the general principle that a conspiracy to commit a crime and the substantive crime that is the object of the conspiracy are separate and distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>offenses and conviction and punishment may be had for each offense. <em>See </em>Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 6.5(h), at 612 (3d ed.2000) (stating that, at common law, \u201cit is now possible for a defendant to be convicted and punished for both the conspiracy and the substantive offense\u201d); <em>Pereira v. United States, </em>347 U.S. 1, 11, 74 S.Ct. 358, 364, 98 L.Ed. 435 (1954) (\u201cIt is settled law in this country that the commission of a substantive offense and a conspiracy to commit it are separate and distinct crimes, and a plea of double jeopardy is no defense to a conviction for both.\u201d); <em>Boyd v. Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 346, 351, 374 S.E.2d 301, 303 (1988) (holding that, notwithstanding Code \u00a7 18.2-23.1\u2019s application to successive trials, \u201cconviction of both the completed substantive offense and the underlying conspiracy\u201d are permitted in Virginia \u201cprovided the convictions occurred, as here, in a single trial\u201d). Appellant contends, nonetheless, that, because the trial court instructed the jury that the charged conspiracy was an element of the charged murder, the prohibition against double jeopardy protects her from being sentenced to consecutive terms for those crimes. Specifically, appellant claims that, because the Commonwealth did not object to the finding instruction for murder given to the jury in this case, the elements set forth therein constitute the law of the case. Hence, appellant reasons, the inclusion in that instruction of conspiracy as an element of murder and the incorporation of the elements listed in the eonspiraey-to-commit-murder finding instruction had the effect, for purposes of this case, of making every element of the conspiracy charged in count two of the indictment an element of the murder charged in count one of the indictment. Consequently, appellant argues, under the test stated in <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), the charged murder offense and the lesser-included charged conspiracy offense are not distinct offenses for double jeopardy purposes. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s argument continues, the imposition of consecutive sentences for those two crimes constitutes multiple punishments for the same offense, in violation of her right to be free from double jeopardy under the United States and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Virginia Constitutions. Thus, she concludes, the trial court erred in failing to set aside the jury\u2019s conspiracy verdict and dismiss the conspiracy charge. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">As relevant here, the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution \u201cguarantees protection ... against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 196, 199, 539 S.E.2d 732, 733 (2001) (citing <em>Illinois v. Vitale, </em>447 U.S. 410, 415, 100 S.Ct. 2260, 2264, 65 L.Ed.2d 228 (1980)). \u2018Virginia\u2019s constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy affords a defendant the same guarantees as the federal Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d <em>Stephens v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 58, 62, 557 S.E.2d 227, 230 (2002). Thus, subjecting a defendant to cumulative punishments for the \u201csame offense\u201d violates both state and federal constitutional protections against double jeopardy. <em>Cf. Hudgins v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 219, 241, 597 S.E.2d 221, 232 (2004) (en banc) (holding that the defendant\u2019s prosecution for larceny of the victim\u2019s bicycle from his person following his acquittal for robbery of the same bicycle from the same victim violated Virginia and federal constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">In a single-trial setting, the double jeopardy doctrine does not bar the imposition of consecutive sentences for two crimes arising out of the same criminal act \u201cunless ... the two punishments are ... for the same crime or one punishment is for a crime which is a lesser[-]included offense of the other.\u201d <em>Coleman, </em>261 Va. at 200, 539 S.E.2d at 734; <em>see also Brown v.

The test to be applied to determine whether the consecutive sentences are for the same or a lesser-included offense is \u201c \u2018whether each [charged offense] <em>requires </em>proof of a fact which the other does not.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coleman, </em>261 Va. at 200, 539 S.E.2d at 734 (emphasis added) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. at 304, 52 S.Ct. at 182); <em>see Brown, </em>432 U.S. at 166, 97 S.Ct. at 2225 (\u201cThe established test for determining whether two offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>are sufficiently distinguishable to permit the imposition of cumulative punishment was stated in Blockburger----\u201d); <em>cf.

For purposes of this analysis, we will assume, -without deciding, that the finding instruction for first-degree murder given in this case constitutes the law of the case and, thus, sets forth the elements of the charged offense of murder, as appellant claims. Looking at the legal elements of the charged offenses without regard to the facts of the case, it is clear that the charged offense of first-degree murder requires proof of a fact that the charged offense of conspiracy to commit murder does not. The murder offense requires proof that the victim was killed. <em>See Ramsey v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 265, 271-72, 343 S.E.2d 465, 470 (1986) (\u201cIn order to find a person guilty as an accessory ... to a felony, the Commonwealth must prove the commission of the felony.\u201d). The conspiracy offense does not. <em>See id. </em>at 272, 343 S.E.2d at 470 (\u201cProof of the commission of a felony is not a necessary element of the crime of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>conspiracy to commit a felony----\u201d). The crucial question remains, however, whether the charged offense of conspiracy to commit murder requires proof of a fact that the charged offense of first-degree murder does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">As previously noted, appellant maintains that the effective incorporation of the charged conspiracy-to-commit-murder offense into the finding instruction for murder renders the charged conspiracy a lesser-included offense of the charged murder. Thus, appellant concludes, the two crimes are the \u201csame offense\u201d for double jeopardy purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">In making this argument, however, appellant focuses solely on the fact that the finding instruction for murder permits the jury to find appellant guilty of first-degree murder if the Commonwealth proves appellant \u201cconspired with ... Hulbert in the commission of the killing.\u201d In doing so, appellant ignores the other language in the same prong of the finding instruction, which plainly indicates that proof by the Commonwealth of a conspiracy between appellant and Hulbert to commit murder is but one of two alternative means of establishing appellant\u2019s guilt with respect to the charged murder. Indeed, in view of the finding instruction\u2019s provision that the Commonwealth must prove that appellant either \u201cacted as an accessory before the fact <em>or </em>conspired with ... Hulbert in the commission of the killing\u201d (emphasis added), it is clear that proof of the referenced conspiracy is not the sole basis upon which appellant\u2019s liability as an accomplice in the murder could rest. Proof that appellant participated in the murder as an accessory before the fact would also suffice to establish appellant\u2019s guilt. Hence, we cannot say, viewing the applicable legal elements of murder in the abstract, that proof of the referenced conspiracy is \u201crequired\u201d in this context to prove the charged murder. <em>See Coleman, </em>261 Va. at 200, 539 S.E.2d at 734 (holding that, in the context of a <em>Bloekburger </em>double jeopardy analysis, \u201cproof of the specific intent to kill\u201d is not \u201crequired\u201d in a malicious wounding case because Code \u00a7 18.2-51 \u2014 which requires proof that the accused had \u201cthe intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or MU\u201d \u2014 uses the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d in its description of the required intent for that offense); <em>cf. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number><em>Taylor, </em>11 Va.App. at 653, 400 S.E.2d at 796 (\u201cEven if one offense is committed in [some] cases of the commission of another offense, it is not a necessarily included lesser offense of the other one.\u201d). Thus, although incorporated into the finding instruction for murder, the charged offense of conspiracy to commit murder is not an element that must be proven to sustain the murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">It follows, therefore, that the charged conspiracy offense requires proof of a fact the charged murder offense does not. \u201c[C]onspiracy to commit murder requires proof of an agreement.\u201d <em>Stevens v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 238, 242, 415 S.E.2d 881, 884 (1992). Conversely, to be convicted as an accessory before the fact, one must \u201cineite[ ], advise[ ], or abet[ ] others in the commission of the crime\u201d -without being \u201cpresent at the commission of the offense.\u201d <em>Tolley v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 341, 348, 218 S.E.2d 550, 555 (1975). Plainly, it is possible to incite, advise, or abet in the commission of a crime without at the same time having agreed to commit such crime. As the United States Supreme Court has stated, \u201c[a]iding, abetting, and counseling are not terms which presuppose the existence of an agreement. Those terms have a broader application, making the defendant a principal when he consciously shares in a criminal act, regardless of the existence of a conspiracy.\u201d <em>Pereira, </em>347 U.S. at 11, 74 S.Ct. at 364. Thus, murder, even when committed as an accessory before the fact, does not require proof of an agreement. <em>See also Ramsey, </em>2 Va.App. at 272, 343 S.E.2d at 470 (holding that \u201cproof of an \u2018agreement\u2019 to commit a felony is not a necessary element in a conviction for the commission of the felony\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Because the charged murder and conspiracy offenses each require proof of a fact that the other does not, the <em>Blockburger </em>test is satisfied. Consequently, the charged offenses do not constitute the \u201csame offense\u201d for purposes of double jeopardy, and the imposition of consecutive sentences for appellant\u2019s convictions of those offenses does not violate the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>V. WHARTON\u2019S RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Appellant also contends that Wharton\u2019s Rule operates to bar her conviction and punishment under Code \u00a7 18.2-22 for conspiracy to commit murder. Thus, she concludes, the trial court erred in denying her motion to have the conspiracy conviction set aside and the charge dismissed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Wharton\u2019s Rule is a judicially created \u201cdoctrine of criminal law enunciating an exception to the general principle that a conspiracy and the substantive offense that is its immediate end are discrete crimes for which separate sanctions may be imposed.\u201d <em>Iannelli, </em>420 U.S. at 771, 95 S.Ct. at 1287. <em>See generally Boyd, </em>236 Va. at 351, 374 S.E.2d at 303 (articulating the current law in Virginia that convictions may be had in a single trial for \u201cboth the completed substantive offense and the underlying conspiracy\u201d). Under the rale, \u201c[w]hen to the idea of an offense plurality of agents is logically necessary, conspiracy [to commit that offense] ... cannot be maintained.\u201d <em>Stewart v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 473, 478, 303 S.E.2d 877, 879 (1983) (holding that Wharton\u2019s Rule applies to the crime of pandering) (quoting 2 F. Wharton, <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 1604, at 1862 (12th ed.1932)). In other words, Wharton\u2019s Rule precludes conviction for both the substantive offense and the conspiracy to commit that offense when the substantive offense \u201cis of such a nature as to <em>necessarily require </em>the participation of two persons for its commission.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Iannelli, </em>420 U.S. at 774 n. 5, 95 S.Ct. at 1288 n. 5, (emphasis added) (quoting 1 R. Anderson, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure </em>\u00a7 89, at 191 (1957)); <em>see also Gebardi v. United States, </em>287 U.S. 112, 122, 53 S.Ct. 35, 37-38, 77 L.Ed. 206 (1932) (holding, with respect to the application of Wharton\u2019s Rule, that, \u201cwhere it is impossible under any circumstances to commit the substantive offense without cooperative action, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>preliminary agreement between the same parties to commit the offense is not an indictable conspiracy\u201d)- Thus, \u201c[ajpplication of the rule is dependent upon a showing that the commission of the substantive offense[ ] <em>requires </em>the participation of two people; the fact that two or more people combine to commit an offense that could be committed by only one person does not invoke application of the rule.\u201d <em>Ramsey, </em>2 Va.App. at 272, 343 S.E.2d at 470; <em>see also </em>Costello, <em>supra, </em>at 225 (\u201cSimply put, if the substantive offense can be committed by one person acting alone, Wharton\u2019s Rule does not apply.\u201d); LaFave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6.5(g)(4), at 610 (\u201cThe rule does not apply when the offense could be committed by one of the conspirators alone, nor even when cooperation was a practical but not logical necessity.\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">It is clear that conspiracy to commit murder and the substantive offense of murder are discrete crimes to which Wharton\u2019s Rule does not ordinarily apply to bar the imposition of cumulative sentences. Unlike the crime of pandering and the \u201cclassic Wharton\u2019s Rule offenses \u2014 crimes such as adultery, incest, bigamy, dueling\u201d \u2014 which, by their nature, necessarily require the participation of two persons for their commission, murder obviously can be committed by one person acting alone. <em>Stewart, </em>225 Va. at 478, 303 S.E.2d at 879. Thus, \u201cseparate sanctions may be imposed\u201d at a single trial for both murder and conspiracy to commit murder. <em>Iannelli, </em>420 U.S. at 771, 95 S.Ct. at 1287; <em>see Ramsey, 2 </em>Va.App. at 272, 343 S.E.2d at 470 (holding that, under Wharton\u2019s Rule, the defendant\u2019s convictions of forgery and uttering as a principal in the second degree did not preclude her conviction of conspiracy to commit uttering); <em>Boyd, </em>236 Va. at 351, 374 S.E.2d at 303 (permitting the \u201cconviction of both the completed substantive offense and the underlying conspiracy\u201d if the convictions occur at the same trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Appellant asserts, however, that Wharton\u2019s Rule precludes her conviction for conspiracy to commit murder because her murder conviction was based solely on her participation in the commission of the murder as an accessory before the fact or co-conspirator. By definition, she argues, a crime the convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>tion of which is based solely on a theory of accomplice liability necessarily requires the participation of at least two persons for its commission. Thus, she argues, she may not properly be convicted and punished for both the charged murder and the charged conspiracy to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Although seemingly meritorious at first blush, appellant\u2019s argument ultimately fails for two fundamental reasons. First, appellant\u2019s reliance on the fact that she was convicted of murder under a theory of accomplice liability is misplaced in this context. As we implicitly held in <em>Ramsey, </em>in determining whether Wharton\u2019s Rule applies to a substantive offense the conviction of which is based on accomplice liability, the focus must be on the underlying criminal act of the particular substantive offense rather than on the accomplice aspect of the offense. 2 Va.App. at 272, 343 S.E.2d at 470. The accompliceship itself is not the completed criminal act upon which the conviction is based but simply the means by which criminal responsibility for the completed criminal act is incurred under Code \u00a7 18.2-18. <em>See Snyder v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 1009, 1017, 121 S.E.2d 452, 458 (1961) (holding that \u201cbefore the accessory to a crime can be convicted as such, it must be shown that the crime has been committed by the principal\u201d). Thus, the accomplice aspect of the substantive crime reflects the accused\u2019s participation in the crime and serves as the basis of the accused\u2019s criminal liability for that crime but does not constitute the substantive crime itself. Here, the substantive offense is murder, a crime which, as noted, can logically be committed by one person.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Second, Wharton\u2019s Rule \u201chas continued vitality only as a judicial presumption, to be applied in the absence of legislative intent to the contrary.\u201d <em>Iannelli, </em>420 U.S. at 782, 95 S.Ct. at 1292. As alluded to earlier, our Supreme Court held in <em>Boyd, </em>in 1988, that the legislature did not intend, in enacting Code \u00a7 18.2-23.1, to \u201cprohibit ... conviction of both the completed substantive offense and the underlying conspiracy, provided the convictions occurred, as here, in a single trial.\u201d 236 Va. at 351, 374 S.E.2d at 303. Thus, upon comple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>tion of the substantive crime, the crime\u2019s actual perpetrator may be convicted and punished at the same trial for both the substantive crime and the underlying conspiracy. Additionally, Code \u00a7 18.2-18 provides that \u201cevery principal in the second degree and every accessory before the fact may be indicted, tried, convicted and punished in all respects as if a principal in the first degree.\u201d The statute\u2019s purpose is to ensure that any person who participates as an accomplice in a substantive crime is equally accountable and subject to the same punishment as the actual perpetrator of the crime. <em>See Charlton v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 47, 52, 526 S.E.2d 289, 292 (2000) (holding that Code \u00a7 18.2-18 \u201cdirect[s] that an accessory before the fact is accountable in all respects as the principal who carries out the intended crime, as well as any of its natural, probable, and incidental crimes\u201d). It is clear, therefore, from the legislature\u2019s silent approval of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Boyd </em>over the years and its enactment of Code \u00a7 18.2-18 that the legislature intends that an accomplice\u2019s participation in the completed substantive crime and the underlying conspiracy be treated \u2014 like the principal in the first degree\u2019s participation in those crimes \u2014 as discrete offenses for which separate convictions and punishments may be imposed in a single-trial setting. Indeed, to provide that a principal in the first degree may be separately punished for the underlying conspiracy but an accomplice to the crime may not would be to disallow the imposition of the same punishment on accomplices and principals in the first degree and would be contrary to Code \u00a7 18.2-18\u2019s mandate that such defendants may be punished equally. Hence, application of Wharton\u2019s Rule in this instance, as appellant urges, would be in direct contravention of \u201clegislative intent to the contrary.\u201d <em>Iannelli, </em>420 U.S. at 782, 95 S.Ct. at 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Consequently, we hold that Wharton\u2019s Rule does not apply here to relieve appellant of the imposition of punishment for her conviction of the charged offense of conspiracy to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>VI. EVIDENCE REGARDING HULBERT\u2019S MENTAL STATE</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in excluding Dr. Deem\u2019s potentially exculpatory testimony at trial regarding Hulbert\u2019s mental state at the time of the offense and in quashing portions of her subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>seeking potentially exculpatory documentation from Dr. Deem and Loudoun County Mental Health Center regarding Hulbert\u2019s mental state at the time of the offense. She asserts that Hulbert\u2019s mental condition at the time of the offense formed an important part of her defense because Hulbert misperceived her intentions and did not possess the mental capacity to enter into a conspiracy. Thus, appellant argues, by limiting her access to such testimonial and documentary evidence, the trial court improperly \u201cabridged her right to call for evidence and present a defense.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">As noted above, after Hulbert was charged with the murder of appellant\u2019s father, the trial court directed that a mental evaluation be performed pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5 by the Loudoun County Mental Health Center to determine Hulbert\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense and to assist Hulbert\u2019s counsel in preparing his criminal defense, including providing mental health treatment to Hulbert if necessary. Dr. Deem, a clinical psychologist with Loudoun County Mental Health Center, performed the ordered mental evaluation, and other personnel at Loudoun County Mental Health Center provided the ordered mental health treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">When appellant requested the issuance of a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>to Dr. Deem for production of certain \u201cdocuments relied upon by Loudoun County Mental Health Center in the formation of opinions or reports regarding the mental health of Kyle Hulbert,\u201d Hulbert\u2019s attorney filed a motion to quash the requested subpoena, asserting that the material was protected by the attorney-client privilege under Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5(E). The trial court granted the motion to quash with respect to Dr. Deem\u2019s notes of his interviews with third parties and the Loudoun County Mental Health Center\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>treatment notes, finding those documents were protected under the attorney-client privilege because \u201cDr. Deem was an indispensable agent of [Hulbert\u2019s] attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">At trial, when appellant called Dr. Deem as a witness, Hulbert\u2019s counsel objected to any testimony by Dr. Deem relating to Hulbert\u2019s mental state on the grounds of attorney-client privilege. Appellant\u2019s counsel proffered that he would ask Dr. Deem to give an opinion as to Hulbert\u2019s mental health.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court sustained the objection of Hulbert\u2019s counsel, and Dr. Deem did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">On appeal, as below, the parties agree that the court-ordered report prepared by Dr. Deem pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5 is protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege established in subsection E of the statute. They further agree that Hulbert\u2019s statements to Dr. Deem, as the agent of Hulbert\u2019s attorney, are also protected under the attorney-client privilege. They disagree, however, as to whether Dr. Deem\u2019s conclusions concerning Hulbert\u2019s mental state at the time of the offense, Dr. Deem\u2019s notes of his interviews with third parties that he conducted in the course of his evaluation of Hulbert\u2019s mental condition, and the Loudoun County Mental Health Center\u2019s treatment notes are similarly protected. The Commonwealth asserts they are so protected. Appellant claims that those conclusions and documents are not protected and that the trial court erred in denying her access to them. The dispositive question before us, then, is threefold: whether the attorney-client privilege set forth in Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5 operates to thwart appellant\u2019s access to (1) Dr. Deem\u2019s testimony regarding Hulbert\u2019s mental state, (2) Dr. Deem\u2019s notes of his interviews with third parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>regarding Hulbert\u2019s mental state, and (3) the treatment notes of the Loudoun County Mental Health Center regarding Hulbert\u2019s mental state. As the resolution of these issues is interrelated and interdependent, we will address them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u201cThe admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>James v.

Furthermore, we review a trial court\u2019s decision regarding a motion to quash the issuance of a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>\u201cunder an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>America Online, Inc. v.

When the language in a statute is clear and unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language. We must determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent from the words appearing in the statute, unless a literal construction of the statute would yield an absurd result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\"><em>Cummings v. Fulghum, </em>261 Va. 73, 77, 540 S.E.2d 494, 496 (2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5 governs the resolution of this issue. Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5(A) requires the appointment of \u201cone or more qualified mental health experts\u201d to assist an indigent defendant who has shown before trial that his sanity at the time of the offense is likely to be \u201ca significant factor in his defense.\u201d The appointed mental health experts are to evaluate the defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the offense and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>if appropriate, \u201cassist in the development of an insanity defense.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5(A). Additionally, pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5(D), the mental health experts are to prepare a \u201cfull report\u201d concerning the defendant\u2019s mental condition at the time of the offense. Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5(E) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">Disclosure of evaluation results. \u2014 The report described in subsection D shall be sent solely to the attorney for the defendant and shall be deemed to be protected by the lawyer-client privilege. However, the Commonwealth shall be given the report, the results of any other evaluation of the defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense, and copies of psychiatric, psychological, medical, or other records obtained during the course of any such evaluation, after the attorney for the defendant gives notice of an intent to present psychiatric or psychological evidence pursuant to \u00a7 19.2-168.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The statute clearly provides that the results of the mental health evaluation performed pursuant to the statute will not be disclosed to anyone except defense counsel until the defendant gives notice of his intent to present expert evidence at trial on the issue of his insanity at the time of the offense. In the meantime, those results are fully protected under the attorney-client privilege. Thus, absent a waiver of that privilege by the defendant, neither the Commonwealth nor any other party other than the defendant is entitled to receive the evaluation results unless and until the defendant gives notice that he will assert an insanity defense. Similarly, the statute provides that the Commonwealth is not entitled to receive the results of other evaluations of the defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense and the records associated therewith until notice of the defendant\u2019s intention to present evidence of insanity has been given. It necessarily follows, therefore, as a matter of logic, that, under the statute, the Commonwealth likewise may not receive the psychiatric, psychological, medical, or other records produced by the mental health experts during the course of the evaluation and the defense-related treatment ordered under Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5(A) and the prepa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ration of the report ordered under Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5(D) until after the defendant has given notice that he mil assert an insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">To construe Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5 as meaning otherwise would improperly lead to the absurd results of (1) prohibiting the Commonwealth from receiving the records obtained during other mental health evaluations of the defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the offense until a notice of insanity defense is filed but allowing the Commonwealth access to the underlying records produced by the mental health experts performing the ordered evaluation under Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5 before such notice is given and (2) protecting the results of the ordered evaluation from disclosure until notice is given by the defense pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-168 while allowing pre-notice discovery of the records upon which those results were based and from which those results could be directly or indirectly deduced. <em>See generally Cook v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 111, 116, 597 S.E.2d 84, 87 (2004) (noting that \u201cour case law uses the phrase \u2018absurd result\u2019 to describe situations in which the law would be internally inconsistent\u201d). Accordingly, we hold that the psychiatric, psychological, medical, and other records produced by the mental health experts appointed under Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5 in the course of fulfilling their court-ordered responsibilities under Code 19.2-169.5 are protected under that statute from being disclosed to the Commonwealth until the defendant gives notice pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-168.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Our Supreme Court has described the attorney-client privilege as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">Confidential communications between attorney and client made because of that relationship and concerning the subject matter of the attorney\u2019s employment \u201care privileged from disclosure, even for the purpose of administering justice.\u201d The privilege attaches to communications of the client made to the attorney\u2019s agents ... when such agent\u2019s services are indispensable to the attorney\u2019s effective representation of the client. Nevertheless, the privilege is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>exception to the general duty to disclose, is an obstacle to investigation of the truth, and should be strictly construed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\"><em>Commonwealth v. Edwards, </em>235 Va. 499, 508-09, 370 S.E.2d 296, 301 (1988) (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Grant v. Harris, </em>116 Va. 642, 648, 82 S.E. 718, 719 (1914)). It is clear that, in providing in Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5(D) that the evaluation results, although not communications by the client to counsel\u2019s agent, are to be protected under the attorney-client privilege, the legislature recognizes that the services of the mental health experts appointed pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5(A) are indispensable to defense counsel\u2019s effective representation of the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Indeed, the absence of such protection would have a chilling effect on the information the appointed experts could obtain from the client during their evaluation and treatment in preparation of the defendant\u2019s case, since a defendant would be reluctant to speak candidly to a mental health expert who could be called as an exculpatory witness in the trial of an alleged accomplice with adverse interests even though no notice of insanity defense had been given by the defendant or whose notes could be made immediately available to the Commonwealth. As our Supreme Court has observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">[communications between lawyer and client are privileged to the end that the client be free to make a full, complete and accurate disclosure of all facts, unencumbered by fear that such true disclosure will be used or divulged by his attorney, and without fear of disclosure <em>by any legal process.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-8\"><em>Seventh Dist. Comm. v. Gunter, </em>212 Va. 278, 286-87, 183 S.E.2d 713, 719 (1971) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Here, Hulbert had not given any notice of his intent to assert an insanity defense when the trial court ruled on appellant\u2019s request for access to Dr. Deem\u2019s notes of his interviews with third parties regarding Hulbert\u2019s mental state and the Loudoun County Mental Health Center\u2019s treatment notes or when appellant called Dr. Deem as a witness at her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, Hulbert had not waived his statutorily provided attorney-client privilege protecting the results of his mental health evaluation under Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5. Consequently, under Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5(E), those results were not to be made available to anyone other than Hulbert\u2019s counsel and the Commonwealth was not entitled to receive the records produced by Dr. Deem and the Loudoun County Mental Health Center during the course of their court-ordered evaluation and treatment of Hulbert\u2019s mental condition under Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">As noted, when Dr. Deem was called to testify, appellant\u2019s counsel specifically represented that he would ask Dr. Deem to give his opinion regarding Hulbert\u2019s mental state at the time of the offense. As that opinion would reveal the results of Hulbert\u2019s mental health evaluation performed by Dr. Deem pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5, the trial court properly excluded Dr. Deem\u2019s testimony. Likewise, the trial court properly denied appellant\u2019s access to Dr. Deem\u2019s notes of his interviews with third parties regarding Hulbert\u2019s mental state and the Loudoun County Mental Health Center\u2019s treatment notes because the Commonwealth would have had access to those documents if they were released to appellant. <em>See </em>Rule 3A:12(b) (\u201cAny subpoenaed writings and objects, regardless by whom requested, shall be available for examination and review by all parties and counsel.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Accordingly, we hold that, contrary to appellant\u2019s claim, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant access to Dr. Deem\u2019s testimony and notes and the Loudoun County Mental Health Center\u2019s notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court and appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-7\">.
