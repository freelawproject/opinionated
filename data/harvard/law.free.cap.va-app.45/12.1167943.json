On appeal, he contends that he was not in the \u201ccustody of the court,\u201d and thus did not escape. We agree and reverse and dismiss appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">I. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL POSTURE</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Juares v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 154, 156, 493 S.E.2d 677, 678 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">The facts of this case are uncontroverted. On July 24, 2003, appellant pled guilty to five felony drug charges and three additional misdemeanor offenses. The trial court ordered a presentence investigation and report returnable to September 4, 2003 and continued appellant on bond.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant was told to report to the regional jail on August 1, 2003, prior to his sentencing date. He failed to report to the jail as ordered and was arrested at a friend\u2019s apartment on August 7, 2003. He was then charged with escape from court custody. At trial, he argued that the Commonwealth failed to prove that he was in the \u201ccustody of the court\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-479(B). The trial court found him guilty and sentenced him to two years in prison with one year suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The sole issue raised in this appeal is whether appellant was \u201cin the custody of [the] court\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-479(B) when he failed to report to jail after being released on bond by the trial court. We note that we have not addressed the meaning of the term \u201ccustody\u201d in this statutory context.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u201cIn determining whether the trial court made an error of law, \u2018we review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u2019 \u201d Rollins v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 73, 78-79, 554 S.E.2d 99, 102 (2001) (quoting <em>Timbers v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 187, 193, 503 S.E.2d 233, 236 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-479(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">If any person lawfully confined in jail or lawfully in the custody of any court or officer thereof or of any law-enforcement officer on a charge or conviction of a felony escapes, otherwise than by force or violence or by setting fire to the jail, he shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">In <em>Cavell v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 484, 506 S.E.2d 552 (1998), we addressed <em>en banc </em>the requirements of being \u201clawfully in the custody of ... [a] law enforcement officer.\u201d While dealing with an arrest issue, that analysis is instructive in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">In <em>Cavell, </em>the police attempted to arrest the defendant on an outstanding felony warrant. The police approached and repeatedly told Cavell that he was under arrest. Cavell refused to submit to the officer, and he fled when the police attempted to grab him. The police \u201cneither touched appellant nor obtained appellant\u2019s submission to his show of authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487, 506 S.E.2d at 553. In the context of an arrest, we reasoned that, since Cavell was neither touched nor submitted to the officer\u2019s authority, he was not in custody: \u201cIn short, the evidence shows appellant did not submit ... to [the officer\u2019s] show of authority, and ... was not detained by the exercise of any physical restraint at the time he fled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, we required either some type of immediate physical control or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>submission. In so doing, we expressly overruled our earlier holding in <em>Castell v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 78, 461 S.E.2d 438 (1995). <em>See Cavell, </em>28 Va.App. at 487, 506 S.E.2d at 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Recently, in <em>White v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 96, 591 S.E.2d 662 (2004), the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether a defendant was in \u201ccustody\u201d within the meaning of this statute. In finding the evidence insufficient to sustain White\u2019s conviction, the court emphasized the necessity of immediate control: \u201c[I]t is clear that for purposes of prohibiting an escape under Code \u00a7 18.2-479,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the General Assembly must have intended that the term \u2018custody\" would include a <em>degree of physical control or restraint </em>under circumstances other than those also necessary to constitute an actual custodial arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104, 591 S.E.2d at 667 (emphasis added) (footnote added). While noting that a \u201cformal arrest\u201d is not a prerequisite to being in custody, the court emphasized that an individual\u2019s \u201cfreedom of movement\u201d must be curtailed. <em>Id. </em>at 104, 105, 591 S.E.2d at 667, 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Appellant in the instant case had been released from the trial court pending sentence and allowed to remain free on bond. At that point he was no longer in the physical custody or even presence of the court. Thus, the \u201csufficient restraint to have physical control over him\u201d did not presently exist. <em>See id. </em>at 106, 591 S.E.2d at 668. At best, he had a future appearance requirement. Additionally, he failed to appear at the jail, and thus he never submitted to the court\u2019s directive or authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">To escape from \u201ccourt custody\u201d clearly encompasses those instances where a defendant flees from a courtroom or a court security officer. This would be analogous to the \u201carrest custody\u201d defined by <em>Cavell </em>and <em>White. </em>To extend this analysis as the Commonwealth suggests would require us to adopt a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\u201cconstructive\u201d rather than \u201cactual\u201d control test as outlined by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the trial court and dismiss the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-11\">. The orders of conviction on the five felony offenses read that appellant \"is continued under present bond until date of sentencing.\u201d However both counsel agree that appellant was ordered to report to jail on August 1, 2003 as part of the court order and that is the agreed factual basis of the instant offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b63-8\">. We note that while the factual basis for <em>White </em>was a police detention, the Court\u2019s statutory analysis is not limited, but applies to the entire group covered in Code \u00a7 18.2-479, i.e., \"any court or officer thereof or any law enforcement officer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b64-18\">. We do not preclude by this holding the trial court\u2019s other remedies for failure to abide by its orders.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
