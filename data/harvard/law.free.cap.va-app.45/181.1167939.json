McCLANAHAN, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Shanorda Doniel Morris was convicted of robbery, use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of, respectively, Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-58, -53.1, and -308.2. On appeal, Morris argues that the trial court erred in: (1) failing to dismiss the indictments for robbery and possession of a firearm after a felony conviction, on the grounds of double jeopardy, and (2) failing to dismiss the indictments for robbery, possession of a firearm after a felony conviction, and use of a firearm, applying Code \u00a7 19.2-294. For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">Morris entered a convenience store, produced a handgun and demanded money from the store clerk. The clerk gave him approximately $80. As he was leaving the store, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>directed the clerk to provide him with a carton of cigarettes. After receiving the cigarettes, Morris left the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Police obtained six arrest warrants for Morris. Three warrants were for the felonies of robbery, use of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and intentionally carrying a firearm after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of, respectively, Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-58, -53.1, and -308.2. The other three warrants were for the Class 1 misdemeanors of stealing and carrying away property valued at less than $200, carrying a concealed handgun, and brandishing a firearm, in violation of, respectively, Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-96, -308 and -282. After Morris was arrested and read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, he admitted to robbing the store clerk with a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The general district court certified the felonies to the grand jury. During the same proceeding, the court addressed the misdemeanor charges, finding Morris guilty of concealing a weapon and brandishing a firearm and dismissing the petit larceny charge. Morris subsequently filed pleadings in the circuit court to dismiss the felony indictments on the grounds of double jeopardy and Code \u00a7 19.2-294. After hearing argument, the court overruled the motions. Morris then entered conditional guilty pleas to the three felony charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AUEG\">A. Code \u00a7 19.2-294</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Morris argues that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the indictments for robbery, possession of a firearm after a felony conviction, and use of a firearm in the commission of a robbery on the grounds that failure to do so was a violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-294. Code \u00a7 19.2-294 provides: \u201cIf the same act be a violation of two or more statutes ... conviction under one of such statutes or ordinances shall be a bar to a prosecution or proceeding under the other or others.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-294 is \u201cintended to protect an accused from the \u2018hazards of vexatious, multiple prosecutions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Phillips v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 548, 553, 514 S.E.2d 340, 343 (1999). \u201cBy its terms, the statute only bars \u2018prosecutions or proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>ings\u2019 after there has been a \u2018conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 892, 897, 421 S.E.2d 455, 459 (1992) <em>(en banc). </em>Thus, \u201cthe statute does not apply to simultaneous prosecutions, because only a prior conviction for the violation of an act will bar a later prosecution for the same act.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>257 Va. at 552, 514 S.E.2d at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">.Morris concedes that <em>Phillips </em>held that misdemeanor convictions in district court do not fall within the protection of Code \u00a7 19.2-294 where the prosecution includes a simultaneous hearing on related felonies. However, he argues that applying the holding of that case disregards the fact that the statute refers disjunctively to \u201cprosecution\u201d and \u201cproceeding.\u201d In <em>Slater v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 593, 425 S.E.2d 816 (1993), we said that when charges are brought at the same time and joined in a single evidentiary hearing in the district court, the <em>proceedings </em>are concurrent rather than successive, even if the misdemeanor is concluded and the felony is tried later. <em>Id. </em>at 595, 425 S.E.2d at 817. According to <em>Phillips, </em>this is because \u201cthe amenability of the misdemeanor charges to an early conclusion in the general district.court did not result in a successive prosecution of the felony charges in the circuit court.\u201d 257 Va. at 553, 514 S.E.2d at 343 (citing <em>Slater, </em>15 Va.App. at 595, 425 S.E.2d at 817). In <em>Phillips, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court went on to say, \u201c[i]n a criminal case, a \u2018prosecution\u2019 is the process in which an accused is brought to justice from the time a formal accusation is made through trial and final judgment in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Sigmon v. Commonwealth, </em>200 Va. 258, 267, 105 S.E.2d 171, 178 (1958)). \u201cThe present prosecutions were simulta neous, not successive, because they were joined in a single evidentiary hearing in the general district court. Thus, the later events in the circuit court on the felony charges were merely a continuation of the same prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have the same situation in the case at bar. The proceedings or prosecutions were simultaneous. We must apply the holding of <em>Phillips </em>and, therefore, Morris has no recourse under Code \u00a7 19.2-294. \u201cWe are bound by decisions of the Supreme Court of Virginia and are without authority to overrule [them].\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number><em>Roane v. Roane, </em>12 Va.App. 989, 993, 407 S.E.2d 698, 700 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Morris also contends that his robbery charge should be dismissed because Code \u00a7 19.2-294 is remedial legislation and should be strictly construed against the Commonwealth and in favor of the accused. On its face, however, Code \u00a7 19.2-294 is implicated only when both convictions are for violations of a statute or a local ordinance or a combination of such. It does not apply if one of the charges is a common law offense. <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 1, 8-9, 406 S.E.2d 15, 19, <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 945, 112 S.Ct. 388, 116 L.Ed.2d 339 (1991). Morris\u2019 robbery charge is a common law offense and, therefore, Code \u00a7 19.2-294 is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Additionally, as Morris points out, these arguments were raised by the dissent in <em>Phillips. </em>They were also raised in the dissent in <em>Hall, </em>14 Va.App. 892, 421 S.E.2d 455, and the panel majority decision in <em>Lash v. Henrico County, </em>13 Va.App. 251, 410 S.E.2d 689 (1991). The <em>Lash </em>decision was reversed by our <em>en banc </em>decision in <em>Hall. </em>None of the majority decisions in those cases adopted these arguments appellant again now raises.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">B. Double Jeopardy</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Morris argues that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the indictment for robbery on the ground that his constitutional protection against double jeopardy was violated. He claims that he was placed in double jeopardy: (1) because petit larceny is a lesser-included offense of robbery; (2) brandishing a firearm is a lesser-included offense of robbery; (3) possession of a firearm by a felon is a lesser-included offense of brandishing a firearm; and, (4) possession of a firearm by a felon is a lesser-included offense of carrying a concealed weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\u201cDouble jeopardy principles \u2018protect against prosecution for the same offense after either an acquittal or a conviction of that offense and against multiple punishments for that same offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hudgins v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>1, 5, 577 S.E.2d 505, 506-07 (2003) (quoting <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 196, 199, 539 S.E.2d 732, 733-34 (2001)). In the context of a simultaneous prosecution, the double jeopardy defense does not apply unless the defendant is twice punished for one criminal act, and, as Morris argues here, one punishment is for a crime that is a lesser-included offense. <em>Goodman v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 374, 385-86, 558 S.E.2d 555, 561 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Appellant\u2019s first double jeopardy claim is without merit. Although he was convicted of robbery, the petit larceny charge was dismissed by the district court. Thus, Morris did not receive \u201cmultiple punishments\u201d for a \u201csingle offense,\u201d which is the only double jeopardy protection in a simultaneous prosecution case such as this one. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Second, brandishing a firearm, Code \u00a7 18.2-282, is a not a lesser-included offense of robbery, Code \u00a7 18.2-58. To be convicted of brandishing a firearm, the defendant must point or brandish a firearm. <em>Kelsoe v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 197, 198, 308 S.E.2d 104, 104 (1983). \u201cRobbery involves taking, with the intent to steal, of the personal property of another, from his person or in his presence, against his will, by violence or intimidation.\u201d <em>Phoung v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va. App. 457, 462, 424 S.E.2d 712, 715 (1992) (citing <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 566, 572, 414 S.E.2d 193, 196 (1992)). Given that robbery does not require the use of a firearm, and brandishing does not require the taking of property, but requires pointing or brandishing a firearm, it is clear that robbery can be committed without brandishing and brandishing can be committed without the taking of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Third, Morris further contends that the indictment for possession of a firearm by a felon, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, is barred as a lesser-included offense of brandishing a firearm, Code \u00a7 18.2-282, and of carrying a concealed weapon, Code \u00a7 18.2-308. According to Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, it is unlawful for \u201cany person who has been convicted of a felony ... to knowingly and intentionally possess or transport any firearm or stun weapon, taser ... or ... carry about his person, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>hidden from common observation, any weapon described in subsection A of \u00a7 18.2-308.\u201d As stated above, the elements of brandishing a firearm under Code \u00a7 18.2-282 are (1) pointing or brandishing a firearm and (2) doing so in a manner to induce fear in the victim. <em>Kelsoe, </em>226 Va. at 198, 308 S.E.2d at 104. Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 requires the element that the defendant is a prior felon, and Code \u00a7 18.2-282 requires the elements of brandishing the firearm and creating fear in the mind of the victim. Both code sections require proof of an element that the other does not; therefore, possession of a firearm by a felon is not a lesser-included offense of brandishing a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Finally, Morris contends possession of a firearm by a felon is a lesser-included offense of carrying a concealed weapon. A conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A), requires that one of the weapons set forth in the section has been carried about the defendant\u2019s person, \u201chidden from common observation.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 requires proof that defendant has committed a felony, which is not required under \u00a7 18.2-308(A). Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) requires that the weapon is carried on the defendant\u2019s person, which is not required by \u00a7 18.2-308.2. Again, each code section requires proof of an element that the other does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Because Morris was not twice punished for one criminal act nor punished for a crime that is a lesser-included offense of another, his convictions do not violate the protections against double jeopardy. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b238-8\">BENTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AFAD\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">As I have indicated on several occasions, the decision of the Supreme Court of Virginia in <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 196, 200-01, 539 S.E.2d 732, 734 (2001), appears to be at variance with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Blockburger </em>analysis in <em>Whalen v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 693-94, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1438-39, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980). <em>See Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 504, 508, 600 S.E.2d 133, 135 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>(2004) (Benton, J., concurring); <em>Ragsdale v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 421, 430-32, 565 S.E.2d 331, 336-37 (2002) (Benton, J., concurring). Because I am bound by <em>Coleman, </em>I concur in the majority opinion\u2019s holding that brandishing a firearm is not a lesser-included offense of the armed robbery for which Morris was indicted and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">I concur in the holdings that the other offenses are not lesser-included offenses, and I concur in the remainder of the opinion. Therefore, I would also affirm the convictions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
