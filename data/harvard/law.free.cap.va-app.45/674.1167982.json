HUMPHREYS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">Appellants Nelson County Schools and CompManagement, Inc. (collectively, \u201cemployer\u201d) appeal from a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission awarding medical benefits to appellee Brenda Ann Woodson (\u2018Woodson\u201d) pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-603. The sole issue on appeal is whether the commission erroneously concluded that Woodson could recover medical benefits notwithstanding her failure to specifically request medical benefits in her application to the commission. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the commission did not err, and we affirm the award of medical benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">On November 26, 2003, Woodson filed a claim for benefits, alleging that she suffered a work-related injury while checking the oil level in her school bus. Woodson used the commission\u2019s standard application form, which contains a section with the heading: \u201cWhat specific benefits are you seeking? Check all that apply.\u201d In the following list, Woodson checked the entry \u201cCompensation for total wage loss for the periods listed below.\u201d Woodson did not check the entries \u201cPayment of lifetime medical costs for this injury and/or disease\u201d or \u201cPay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>ment of specific medical bills (attach to this form) related to this injury and/or disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">During the hearing before the deputy commissioner, employer objected to Woodson\u2019s testimony about her medical treatment, arguing that \u201cour position is medicals are not an issue\u201d because \u201c[t]hat\u2019s not part of the application, and that\u2019s also not part of what was asked for even in the interrogatories.\u201d The commissioner, however, held that a request for medical benefits was \u201cimplicit\u201d in the filing of the application for benefits, noting that \u201c[w]hen you have an injury you go to the doctor[,][a]nd to say ... you don\u2019t want your doctor to be paid but you want to be compensated for lost time\u201d is \u201cludicrous.\u201d Thus, the deputy commissioner awarded Woodson temporary total disability benefits and medical benefits \u201cpursuant to \u00a7 65.2-603 for as long as necessary for her August 21, 2003, neck injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Employer appealed to the full commission, which affirmed the decision of the deputy commissioner. The commission \u201cagree[d] with the Deputy Commissioner that it was not necessary for [Woodson] to specifically allege that [she] was claiming medical benefits for treatment related to [her] accident,\u201d reasoning that \u201c[s]uch a claim is implicit in an initial claim that alleges disability from work.\u201d The commission also disagreed with employer\u2019s argument that Woodson was required to check the entry on the application indicating that she was seeking \u201cpayment of lifetime medical costs for this injury and/or disease,\u201d noting instead that that part of the application \u201cpertains to a medical only claim.\u201d Employer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Although we defer to the commission in its role as fact finder, we \u201creview questions of law <em>de novo,\" Rusty\u2019s Welding Serv., Inc. v. Gibson, </em>29 Va.App. 119, 127, 510 S.E.2d 255, 259 (1999) (en banc), and therefore do not consider ourselves \u201c\u2018bound by the legal determinations made by the commission.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grayson County Sch. Bd. v. Cornett, </em>39 Va. App. 279, 281, 572 S.E.2d 505, 506 (2002) (quoting <em>Robinson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number><em>Salvation Army, </em>20 Va.App. 570, 572, 459 S.E.2d 103, 104 (1995)); <em>see also Sturtz v. Chesapeake Corp., </em>38 Va.App. 672, 675, 568 S.E.2d 381, 383 (2002). Even so, with regard to the commission\u2019s interpretation of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, \u201c \u2018we follow the settled rule that the construction accorded a statute by public officials charged with its administration is entitled to be given weight by the courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sturtz, </em>38 Va.App. at 675, 568 S.E.2d at 383 (quoting <em>Bohle v. Henrico County Sch. Bd., </em>246 Va. 30, 35, 431 S.E.2d 36, 39 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">As pertinent here, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides that, \u201c[a]s long as necessary after an accident, the employer <em>shall </em>furnish or cause to be furnished, free of charge to the injured employee, a physician chosen by the injured employee ... and [any] other necessary medical attention\u201d related to the compensable injury. Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A)(1) (emphasis added). It is well established that \u201c[t]he medical attention and hospitalization which the employee is entitled to receive and the employer is required to furnish ... is incidental to and a part of the compensation to which the employee is entitled under the act.\u201d <em>Merrimac Anthracite Coal Corp. v. Showalter, </em>158 Va. 227, 231-32, 163 S.E. 73, 74 (1932); <em>see also Warren Trucking Co. v. Chandler, </em>221 Va. 1108, 1115, 277 S.E.2d 488, 492 (1981); <em>Fairfax Hosp. v. DeLaFleur, </em>221 Va. 406, 409, 270 S.E.2d 720, 722 (1980) (per curiam) (\u201cIf the employer is liable for compensation, it is also liable for medical expenses causally related to the injury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Because \u201c[t]his statutory duty on the employer is mandatory,\u201d <em>Cash v. Am. Health Ins. Corp., </em>203 Va. 719, 721, 127 S.E.2d 119, 121 (1962), an injured employee is automatical ly entitled to receive medical benefits once the fact of a compensable injury has been established. This entitlement cannot be negated by the employee\u2019s failure to specifically request an award of medical benefits in her application to the commission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Employer, however, argues that, even if a compensable injury has been established, an employee cannot recover relief not specifically requested in the employee\u2019s application for benefits, reasoning that, under the circumstances of this case, permitting Woodson to recover medical benefits would violate its right to due process of law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">\u201cPleading requirements in administrative proceedings ... are traditionally more informal than judicial proceedings.\u201d Sergio\u2019s <em>Pizza v. Soncini, </em>1 Va.App. 370, 376, 339 S.E.2d 204, 207 (1986). Thus, \u201c[wjhile some degree of formality or the use of standardized uniform procedures and forms may be more conducive to an orderly and expeditious process, rigid or technical rules of pleading ... shall not apply so long as the procedures adopted protect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Hospice Choice, Inc. v. O\u2019Quin, </em>42 Va.App. 598, 605-06, 593 S.E.2d 554, 557 (2004). In other words, \u201c[t]he procedure utilized [need only] afford the parties minimal due process safeguards.\u201d <em>Sergio\u2019s Pizza, </em>1 Va.App. at 376, 339 S.E.2d at 207; <em>see also Henrico (County of) Public Utilities v. Taylor, </em>34 Va.App. 233, 243, 540 S.E.2d 501, 506-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>07 (2001) (\u201cIn the context of a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding, due process \u2018is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Duncan v. ABF Freight Sys., Inc., </em>20 Va.App. 418, 422, 457 S.E.2d 424, 426 (1995) (internal quotations omitted))). To satisfy \u201cminimal due process safeguards,\u201d the challenged procedure must provide \u201c \u2018notice reasonably calculated, under all circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and to afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schwab Construction v. McCarter, </em>25 Va.App. 104, 111, 486 S.E.2d 562, 565 (1997) (quoting <em>Oak Hill Nursing Home, Inc. v. Back, </em>221 Va. 411, 416, 270 S.E.2d 723, 726 (1980) (internal quotations omitted)). Thus, we have held that, as long as the employee\u2019s application for benefits provides an employer with notice \u201cof the potential issues in a case,\u201d the claim will satisfy \u201cminimal due process safeguards.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Paul Johnson Plastering, </em>37 Va.App. 716, 723, 561 S.E.2d 40, 44 (2002), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>265 Va. 237, 576 S.E.2d 447 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">The circumstances of this case are analogous to those in <em>Fairfax Hospital, </em>where the employer contended that the commission erred in awarding the employee the medical costs associated with her work-related injury, arguing \u201cthat the issue of liability for such costs was never litigated before the hearing commissioner.\u201d 221 Va. at 409, 270 S.E.2d at 722. The Virginia Supreme Court rejected the employer\u2019s argument, reasoning that \u201c[t]he full medical record was before the Commission,\u201d and, as a result, the employer \u201cwas not denied the opportunity to contest the issue of liability for the [] medical expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410, 270 S.E.2d at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Similarly, here, \u201c[t]he full medical record was before the Commission,\u201d and employer was provided with an opportunity \u201cto contest the issue of liability for the [ ] medical expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Employer, moreover, did not request a continuance, nor did it \u201cassert that [it] was unprepared to proceed on this issue or ask the [commission] to consider the merits of the [issue] at a later date.\u201d <em>Parish v. Spaulding, </em>257 Va. 357, 362, 513 S.E.2d 391, 393 (1999). Because employer was aware of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>pendency of the action, had notice of the potential issues in the case, and was afforded an opportunity to present its objections, the minimal requirements of due process were satisfied, and employer has not established that it was prejudiced by Woodson\u2019s failure to request an award of medical benefits prior to the hearing before the deputy commissioner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the commission\u2019s award of benefits. <em>Cf. Taylor, 34 </em>Va.App. at 245, 540 S.E.2d at 507 (holding that, where the employee, prior to the hearing, indicated that she would be seeking temporary total disability benefits as well as partial disability benefits, and did not seek any benefits outside the time period identified in the application, the employer failed to establish prejudice and, thus, its due process rights were not violated).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-6\">. We further note that Woodson was not required, by statute or rule, to file an application listing all of the benefits to which she believed she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>was entitled. Commission Rule 1.1 requires only that a claim for benefits \u201cshall\u201d be in writing, and \"should\u201d set forth, <em>inter alia, </em>the benefits sought. Because \"the word \u2018should\u2019 ordinarily implies no more than expediency and is directory only,\u201d <em>Brushy Ridge Coal Co. v. Blevins, </em>6 Va.App. 73, 78, 367 S.E.2d 204, 206 (1988), Rule 1:1 therefore acts as a \"guide,\u201d and \u201cdoes not automatically exclude from consideration a claim which omits one or more of the items of information which the rules say a claim \u2018should set forth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Massey Builders Supply Corp. v. Colgan, </em>36 Va.App. 496, 503-04, 553 S.E.2d 146, 150 (2001). Also, although \"the commission disseminates a standardized claim form on which an injured employee may report an industrial injury, [] neither the Act nor the commission\u2019s rules require that a claim must be filed on that or any other form.\u201d <em>Fairfax County Sch. Bd. v. Humphrey, </em>41 Va.App. 147, 156, 583 S.E.2d 65, 69 (2003) (internal quotations omitted). Rather, a claimant need only file a written claim that both identifies \"the employer, the date of the accident, the location of the accident, and the injuries suffered\u201d and \"fairly apprise[s] the commission that a claim [for benefits is] being made.\u201d <em>Cheski v. Arlington County Pub. Schs., </em>16 Va.App. 936, 938, 434 S.E.2d 353, 355 (1993) (internal quotations omitted). Thus, we have never held, nor do we now hold, that a claimant must specifically identify all of the benefits sought in order to file a proper claim under the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b729-5\">. We also note that, because no specific payments for medical benefits have been ordered, employer is free to contest the necessity and reasonableness of Woodson\u2019s medical expenses in any subsequent proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b729-6\">. <em>But cf. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Cardosa, 26 </em>Va.App. 220, 227-28, 494 S.E.2d 147, 151 (1997) (holding that, where the commission, <em>sua sponte </em>and without notice to the employer, modified the employee\u2019s claim and awarded benefits for a period other than that identified in the application for benefits, the employer\u2019s due process rights had been violated, reasoning that, because the modification did not occur until <em>\"after </em>both the hearing and the review proceedings were concluded,\u201d the employer \"had no notice of a potential award ... until the commission rendered its decision\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Sergio\u2019s Pizza, </em>1 Va.App. at 377, 339 S.E.2d at 208 (holding that notice was not properly given where the deputy commissioner modified the claimant\u2019s petition from that of a new occupational injury to a change-in-condition application <em>after </em>the hearing, during the <em>review </em>stage of the proceedings, reasoning that the \"course of action adopted precluded an adequate opportunity to defend at the hearing stage ... or at any stage at which the employer could have submitted evidence\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
