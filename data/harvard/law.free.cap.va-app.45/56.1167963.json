Rutledge contends the trial judge erred in ruling that her marital property settlement agreement prohibited the trial judge from exercising discretionary authority to award attorney\u2019s fees to her in a post divorce proceeding to modify spousal support. We hold that because the agreement expressly provides for attorney\u2019s fees in some instances but does not do so for modification proceedings, the trial judge did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Kathleen D. Rutledge and Ronald L. Rutledge were divorced by a final decree entered on July 15, 1999. The final decree \u201caffirmed, ratified, and incorporated\u201d the parties\u2019 property settlement agreement. Pertinent to this appeal, the property settlement agreement provides that \u201c[t]he husband shall pay to the wife the sum of $1,300.00 per month for her maintenance and support\u201d and also provides for modification of the spousal support as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">Upon the petition of either party upon a material change of circumstances in a manner which is consistent with ... Code Section 20-107.1 ..., a Court of competent jurisdiction shall be able to modify by increasing or decreasing or terminating or reserving the right to spousal support as the circumstances may make proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Four years after entry of the final decree, the wife filed a petition in the circuit court to increase spousal support, alleging a material change in circumstances and requesting an award of attorney\u2019s fees. The husband denied that a material change in circumstances had occurred, denied the wife was entitled to any relief, and requested dismissal of the petition. Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial judge found that a material change in circumstances had occurred, and he increased spousal support to $2,000 per month. The trial judge also found that an award of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cdoes not contra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>vene any provision of the agreement\u201d and awarded the wife her attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The husband filed a motion to reconsider the award of attorney\u2019s fees. In his motion, the husband asserted that the following provisions of the agreement contain the only basis for an award of attorney\u2019s fees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">11. Divorce &amp; Associated Matters, Legal Fees:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">:}\u00ab \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">C. The husband shall pay to the wife the sum of $3,000 as and for the expenditure of attorney\u2019s fees necessitated by her as a result of filing of the Bill of Complaint for Divorce. Said payment shall be made to her within ninety (90) days of the execution of this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">12. Breach of this Agreement, and Enforcement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-10\">&gt;j: <em>% </em>ij: <em>ifc</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">B. In the event of a breach of this Agreement, the party committing the breach shall be obligated to pay the reasonable and necessary costs, including reasonable legal fees incurred by the non-breaching party to enforce or protect the non-breaching party\u2019s interests or rights hereunder. The amount of such reasonable costs and legal fees shall be submitted to the Court having jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter hereof, and if the party alleging breach substantially prevails in such an action then both parties will move the court that the order disposing of any such allegation of breach include a provision making an award of reasonable and necessary costs and legal fees in the favor of the substantially prevailing party, without prejudice to the non-prevailing party to contest the reasonableness or necessity of any such cost and legal fee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">The husband argued that Code \u00a7 20-109(C) restricts the trial judge\u2019s authority to award attorney\u2019s fees to the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">The wife responded that the trial judge had inherent authority, pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109(A), to award attorney\u2019s fees in spousal support modification proceedings. She also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>argued that, in any event, paragraphs 11(C) and 12(B) are silent regarding the issue of attorney\u2019s fees in modification proceedings and, therefore, the \u201cright to seek fees in this case has not been waived or limited by the terms of their agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The trial judge granted the motion to reconsider. In pertinent part, he ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">The parties specifically address the issue of attorney\u2019s fees in their [agreement]. Section 11(C) ... provides that the husband will pay the wife $3000 as and for the expenditure of attorney\u2019s fees necessitated by her as a result of the filing of the Bill of Complaint for Divorce. Also, Section 12(A) and 12(B) [provide] for an award of attorney\u2019s fees in the event of a breach of the parties\u2019 PSA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">Here, the parties\u2019 [agreement] expressly provides for an award of attorney\u2019s fees in certain situations, but does not provide for an award of attorney\u2019s fees incurred as a result of either party petitioning for a modification of spousal support. Pursuant to ... Code ... \u00a7 20-109(C), the Court cannot go beyond the terms of the parties\u2019 [agreement]. The [agreement] fails to provide for an award of attorney\u2019s fees for a parties\u2019 modification of spousal support, and the Court is without power to make such an award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The wife appeals from the order denying her request for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">The parties agree that the resolution of this case turns upon the application of Code \u00a7 20-109. The portions of the statute pertinent to this appeal are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>A. Upon petition of either party the court may increase, decrease, or terminate the amount or duration of any spousal support and maintenance ... as the circumstances may make proper____ The provisions of this subsection shall apply to all orders and decrees for spousal support, regardless of the date of the suit for initial setting of support, the date of entry of any such order or decree, or the date of any petition for modification of support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">sj* sji :j;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">C. In suits for divorce, ... if a stipulation or contract signed by the party to whom such relief might otherwise be awarded is filed before entry of a final decree, no decree or order directing the payment of support and maintenance for the spouse, suit money, or counsel fee or establishing or imposing any other condition or consideration, monetary or nonmonetary, shall be entered except in accordance with that stipulation or contract. If such a stipulation or contract is filed after entry of a final decree and if any party so moves, the court shall modify its decree to conform to such stipulation or contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Code \u00a7 20-109.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">The wife contends the limiting language in Code \u00a7 20-109(C) \u2014 \u201cno decree ... directing the payment of ... counsel fee ... shall be entered except in accordance with that ... contract\u201d \u2014 should be read to mean that the trial judge is authorized to grant her attorney\u2019s fees unless the agreement forbids it. Thus, she argues that because the agreement \u201cdid not address the issue of an award of attorney\u2019s fees incurred by either party as an incident to a post-divorce proceeding for modification of spousal support ..., Code \u00a7 20-109(C) did not restrict the trial court\u2019s power to award such attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">Subsection A and C of the statute are interrelated. In analyzing these subsections, we have held that, although \u201cCode \u00a7 20-109(A) empowers trial courts to modify a spousal support award, ... Code \u00a7 20-109(C) expressly limits the court\u2019s authority ... according to the terms of a stipulation or contract signed by the parties.\u201d <em>Blackburn v. Michael, </em>30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Va.App. 95, 100, 515 S.E.2d 780, 783 (1999). Likewise, the Supreme Court has held that, when the parties\u2019 agreement has been affirmed, ratified, and incorporated into the final decree of divorce, \u201c \u2018[Code] \u00a7 20-109 restricts the court\u2019s jurisdiction over awarding \u201calimony, suit money, or counsel fee\u201d to the terms of the contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thomas v. Thomas, </em>216 Va. 741, 743, 222 S.E.2d 557, 559 (1976) (quoting <em>McLoughlin v. McLoughlin, </em>211 Va. 365, 368, 177 S.E.2d 781, 783 (1970)). As these cases hold, the statutory language of Code \u00a7 20-109(C) restricts the judge to decreeing according \u201cto the terms\u201d of the agreement. In the context of this statute, which provides that \u201cno decree or order directing the payment of ... counsel fee ... shall be entered except in accordance with that contract,\u201d the words, \u201cexcept in accordance with that ... contract,\u201d are not ambiguous. The plain meaning of these words is not susceptible to another understanding. <em>See, e.g., In re Coane\u2019s Estate, </em>310 Pa. 138, 165 A. 2, 4 (1933) (reviewing a will in which a testator directed payments to his wife \u201c \u2018in accordance with the terms of the antinuptial agreement,\u2019 \u201d the court observed that \u201c \u2018[i]n accordance with\u2019 cannot be construed to mean \u2018in place of,\u2019 or \u2018as a substitute for,\u2019 and this is made especially clear by the fact that the payments provided for are to be \u2018in accordance with the terms\u2019 of the antinuptial agreement, not with some of them, but with all of them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Although our decisions and the decisions of the Supreme Court have not always used consistent language in applying Code \u00a7 20-109, we have never intimated that subsection C permits a trial judge to grant relief in derogation of the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement. For example, in <em>White v. White, </em>257 Va. 139, 509 S.E.2d 323 (1999), where the final decree of divorce incorporated a settlement agreement that obligated the husband to pay the monthly mortgage payments on a residence to a bank, the trial judge ruled that the husband was in contempt for failing to make the mortgage payments to the wife after she sold the residence several years following the divorce and after the bank received from the sale proceeds the balance due on the mortgage. <em>Id. </em>at 142-43, 509 S.E.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>324. Reversing that decision, the Supreme Court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-4\">The agreement clearly obligates Mr. White to pay the $30,000 mortgage on the house to [the] Bank in 120 monthly installments. It contains no provision for Mr. White to make any payments to Mrs. White. Moreover, and of particular significance in this case, nothing within the express terms of the. agreement evinces any intent of the parties that Mr. White\u2019s obligation would survive the satisfaction of the mortgage debt, regardless of the manner in which that debt was extinguished.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the agreement obligated Mr. White to make payments on the mortgage on the marital home so long as that debt existed, but did not obligate him to pay a fixed sum to the wife in installments with interest, as she alleged in her bill of complaint and as the trial court subsequently found in the show cause hearing. The language of the final decree of divorce referencing the agreement as \u201can agreement ... with respect to maintenance and support\u201d could not, and did not, alter the intent of the parties as expressed in the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 145, 509 S.E.2d at 326. In reaching this decision, the Court ruled that \u201cCode \u00a7 20-109[C] inhibits the power of the court to award or consider modification of the decree to the extent that spousal support and maintenance are provided for in the incorporated agreement of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144, 509 S.E.2d at 325. <em>See also Owney v. Owney, </em>8 Va.App. 255, 260, 379 S.E.2d 745, 748 (1989) (holding that the judge\u2019s \u201caward contravenes the plain language of the agreement\u201d and was \u201cplainly inconsistent with the contract\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">As <em>White </em>demonstrates, the statutory proviso, that no order \u201cshall be entered except in accordance with the ... contract,\u201d requires the trial judge to examine the parties\u2019 agreement to ascertain whether the relief sought by the moving party is encompassed within the terms of the agreement. <em>White, </em>257 Va. at 144-45, 509 S.E.2d at 326. <em>See also Owney, </em>8 Va.App. at 260, 379 S.E.2d at 748 (holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>where the agreement \u201cspecifically releases the husband and wife \u2018of any claim either might have for alimony or support,\u2019 [t]he trial court\u2019s conclusion that the payments under paragraph six of the agreement were \u2018intended by the parties as spousal support\u2019 and the subsequent award of \u2018$182.00 per month as spousal support\u2019 were plainly inconsistent with the contract\u201d because Code \u00a7 20-109(C) bars payment of support and maintenance for the spouse except in accordance with the contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The wife argues that the agreement in this case \u201cwas silent as to whether either party could be awarded attorney\u2019s fees incurred incident to ... post divorce modification proceedings.\u201d Thus, she contends the agreement was not a bar to an award of attorney\u2019s fees and the trial judge retained discretionary authority to award attorney\u2019s fees. We disagree. We believe it is more accurate to say no \u201cterms\u201d of the agreement provide for attorney\u2019s fees in the instance of either party seeking a modification of spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\u201c[M]arital property settlements ... are contracts subject to the rules of construction applicable to contracts generally, including the application of the plain meaning of unambiguous contractual terms.\u201d <em>Pysell v. Keck, </em>263 Va. 457, 460, 559 S.E.2d 677, 678 (2002). According to the rules of construction, \u201c[c]ourts cannot read into contracts language which will add to or take away the meaning of words already contained therein.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Holyfield, </em>227 Va. 184, 187, 313 S.E.2d 396, 398 (1984).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">A well-settled principle of contract law dictates that where an agreement is complete on its face, is plain and unambiguous in its terms, the court is not at liberty to search for its meaning beyond the instrument itself. A contract is not deemed ambiguous merely because the parties disagree as to the meaning of the language they used to express their agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-8\"><em>Ross v. Craw, </em>231 Va. 206, 212-13, 343 S.E.2d 312, 316 (1986) (internal citations and quotations omitted). \u201cIn reviewing the agreement, we must gather the intent of the parties and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>meaning of the language ... from an examination of the <em>entire </em>instrument, giving full effect to the words the parties actually used.\u201d <em>Layne v. Henderson, </em>232 Va. 332, 337-38, 351 S.E.2d 18, 22 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">A review of this contract shows the parties were cognizant of events in which attorney\u2019s fees would be paid, and they provided for attorney\u2019s fees in two instances: first, $3,000 to the wife for attorney\u2019s fees for filing the Bill of Complaint and, second, a reasonable fee to be assessed by a judge against either party who breaches the agreement and causes the other to incur fees in enforcing the agreement. The agreement does not provide for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees in any other instance. To be more precise, nowhere in the agreement is there a provision requiring the payment of attorney\u2019s fees to either party who seeks a change in the support payment because of a change in circumstances. The parties could have provided for fees in other instances but did not. The express reference to attorney\u2019s fees for these two particular proceedings implies the preclusion of attorney\u2019s fees in other instances under the maxim, <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius. See Smith v. Pocahontas Fuel Company, Inc., </em>177 Va. 267, 285, 13 S.E.2d 301, 309 (1941) (applying the principle of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>to hold that a contract which specifies a lessee\u2019s obligation to pay for unmined coal \u201cfound in the two seams mentioned ... excludes any obligation of the lessee to pay for coal in the other seams\u201d). In order to find in this agreement a requirement for attorney\u2019s fees in other unspecified instances, we \u201cwould have to insert words into the writing contrary to the elementary rule that the function of the court is to construe the contract made by the parties, not to make a contract for them.\u201d <em>Cave Hill Corporation v. Hiers, </em>264 Va. 640, 646, 570 S.E.2d 790, 793(2002). In other words, \u201cwhat the parties claim they might have said, or should have said, cannot alter what they actually said.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>227 Va. at 188, 313 S.E.2d at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The wife cites <em>Sanford v. Sanford, </em>19 Va.App. 241, 450 S.E.2d 185 (1994), as a case in which the trial judge ordered that the parties exchange copies of their future income tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>returns despite the husband\u2019s argument that Code \u00a7 20-109 prohibits such an order because the statute bars the judge from \u201cimposing any ... condition ... except in accordance with ... [the parties\u2019] contract.\u201d There, we held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac8\">Assuredly, the parties\u2019 property settlement agreement does not obligate the parties to exchange income tax returns. However, nothing in the agreement precludes the trial court from requiring either party to provide the other with a copy of his or her income tax returns. The agreement is silent in this regard. Code \u00a7 20-109 only restricts the action a trial court may take where the parties have agreed upon a matter. Code \u00a7 20-109 does not prohibit a trial court from ordering a course of action upon a matter that the parties do not address in their property settlement agreement, provided the court is not otherwise precluded from doing so and the course of action is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 250-51, 450 S.E.2d at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">In this case, however, unlike <em>Sanford, </em>the parties have agreed upon the matter of attorney\u2019s fees. An examination of the entire agreement discloses that the parties specified the two instances in which attorney\u2019s fees could be awarded. This proceeding for modification of spousal support is an instance that does not fall within those provisions. The mere absence of terms specifying other events that one party contends normally would be found in the contract is an insufficient basis, standing alone, to render the contract ambiguous or subject the contract to judicial construction. <em>Wilson, </em>227 Va. at 188, 313 S.E.2d at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Furthermore, in their agreement the parties expressly waived all claims except as provided in the agreement. In its introductory provisions, the agreement uses the following broad language to note the parties\u2019 intentions to resolve all rights, claims, and obligations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">WHEREAS, the parties now desire to settle and determine their mutual obligations, all of their property rights, all rights of support and maintenance of either party by the other and all other miscellaneous rights, claims \u2014 and obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>gations between them arising from their marriage to one another and otherwise....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Among the ensuing terms of the agreement is a specific waiver clause, which includes the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">Each party hereby also waives, releases, and discharges the other party from any and all claims, causes of action, or demands whatsoever, in law or equity, which he or she might have or might claim to have against the other party by reason of any matter, cause, or thing whatsoever except in an action or actions for divorce or in an action or actions to enforce a provision or provisions of this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Because Code \u00a7 20-109(C) restricts the trial judge\u2019s jurisdiction such that he could enter \u201cno decree or order directing the payment of ... counsel fee ... except in accordance with that ... contract,\u201d we hold that the trial judge did not err in refusing to award to the wife her attorney\u2019s fees. The judge\u2019s order granted relief \u201caccording to the terms of [the] ... contract signed by the parties.\u201d <em>Blackburn, </em>30 Va.App. at 100, 515 S.E.2d at 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-11\">. Section 12(A) of the agreement does not provide for attorney\u2019s fees. It addresses the matter of breach of the agreement in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-12\">Each of the obligations imposed upon a party hereunder is intended to stand independently of any and all other obligations imposed hereunder, and a breach of any such obligation shall not be deemed to impair \u2014 nor do the parties intend such breach to discharge \u2014 any party from performing any other obligation imposed hereunder.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
