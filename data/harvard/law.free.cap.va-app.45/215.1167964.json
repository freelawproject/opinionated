Under the circumstances of this case, we hold that it does not. Accordingly, we remand this case to the circuit court with direction to entertain the merits of appellant\u2019s motion for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b265-17\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. Appellant Carmen Mina (\u201cwife\u201d) and appellee Mark Mina (\u201chusband\u201d) were di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>vorced by final decree dated June 30, 2000. Along with the divorce decree and settlement agreement, the trial court entered a consent order, titled \u201cOrder for Future Distribution of Retirement Pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">On October 31, 2003, husband filed a \u201cMotion to Vacate Order for Future Distribution of Retirement Pay.\u201d On February 12, 2004, the trial court conducted an <em>ore tenus </em>hearing on the merits of the motion to vacate. After wife presented her evidence on the merits, she asked the court to bifurcate the hearing, reserving for a later date the arguments and evidence relating to the parties\u2019 respective requests for attorney\u2019s fees. Husband did not object, instead noting that \u201cboth parties reserve the issue of fees for a later date.\u201d The trial court therefore bifurcated the hearing and, as a result, did not hear any evidence or argument relating to either party\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. At the conclusion of the hearing on the merits, the trial court stated that it would be \u201cprepared to rule\u201d on March 12, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">On February 18, 2004, before the court had ruled on the merits of the motion to vacate, husband filed an \u201cAmended Motion to Vacate Order for Future Distribution of Retirement Pay.\u201d In the amended motion to vacate, husband notes that, \u201c[sjince the court has bifurcated the issue of attorney fees, [husband] reserves the right to seek and request the same at appropriate time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">On March 12, 2004, after conducting another <em>ore terms </em>hearing, the trial court issued a written order denying the motion to vacate. The order provides that \u201cthe parties may present evidence in support of their requests for attorney\u2019s fees on Friday Motion\u2019s docket before the Honorable Gaylord L. Finch, Jr.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The written order contains no language directing the case to be stricken from the docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>On June 4, 2004, wife filed a motion seeking an award of the attorney\u2019s fees and costs she incurred while opposing the motion to vacate. During the subsequent hearing on wife\u2019s motion, husband argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over the issue of attorney\u2019s fees because wife did not file her motion within twenty-one days after issuance of the order denying the motion to vacate. Wife, in contrast, argued that \u201cthe order entered by the Court allowed ... either party to file a motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and present evidence at a later date,\u201d noting that \u201cthe Court has inherent authority to reserve the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees notwithstanding the entry of a final [decree].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">By order dated July 2, 2004, the trial court denied wife\u2019s motion. The court\u2019s written order merely provides that, \u201cupon consideration of the pleadings filed herein, the evidence presented, and the argument of counsel for the parties; it is hereby adjudged, ordered and decreed that [wife\u2019s] Motion for Attorney\u2019s Fees and Costs is Denied.\u201d At the conclusion of the hearing, however, the trial court informed the parties that it was denying the motion because, pursuant to Rule 1:1, \u201cthe Court no longer has jurisdiction to award attorney fees in this matter.\u201d Wife appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">. II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">On appeal, wife argues that, \u201c[t]hrough its bifurcation of the consideration of the parties\u2019 claims for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, the trial court reserved jurisdiction to consider these claims.\u201d Wife also argues that the March 12 order is not a final order because it \u201cdid not dispose of the whole subject before it and did not provide relief on all issues before it.\u201d Thus, wife concludes that the trial court \u201cerred in finding that it did not have jurisdiction to consider [her] Motion for Attorney\u2019s Fees and Costs.\u201d Because we agree that the March 12 order is not a final order for purposes of Rule 1:1, we remand this case to the circuit court with direction to entertain the merits of wife\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Rule 1:1 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a]ll final judgments, orders, and decrees, irrespective of terms of court, shall remain under the control of the trial court and subject to be modified, vacated, or suspended for twenty-one days after the date of entry, and no longer.\u201d Generally, \u201ca final order for purposes of Rule 1:1 \u2018is one which disposes of the whole subject, gives all the relief contemplated, provides with reasonable completeness for giving effect to the sentence, and leaves nothing to be done in the cause save to superintend ministerially the execution of the order.\u2019 \u201d <em>James v. James, </em>263 Va. 474, 481, 562 S.E.2d 133, 137 (2002) (quoting <em>Daniels v. Truck &amp; Equip. Corp., </em>205 Va. 579, 585, 139 S.E.2d 31, 35 (1964)); <em>see also Burns v. Equitable Assocs., </em>220 Va. 1020, 1028, 265 S.E.2d 737, 742 (1980); <em>Estate of Hackler v. Hackler, </em>44 Va.App. 51, 61, 602 S.E.2d 426, 431 (2004). Thus, as noted by the Virginia Supreme Court, an order that \u201cretains jurisdiction to reconsider the judgment or to address other matters still pending\u201d is not a final order under Rule 1:1 and does not commence the running of the 21-day period. <em>Super Fresh Food Mkts. of Va., Inc. v. Ruffin, </em>263 Va. 555, 561, 561 S.E.2d 734, 737 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Here, the March 12 order did not \u201cdispose of the whole subject\u201d or grant all \u201crelief contemplated\u201d by the parties. Both parties raised the issue of attorney\u2019s fees prior to the issuance of the March 12 order by expressly including a request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs in their prayers for relief. The trial court bifurcated the underlying hearing on the merits and informed the parties that it would hear arguments relating to attorney\u2019s fees <em>after </em>reaching a ruling on the merits. Thus, in its order denying the motion to vacate, the court indicated that the parties \u201cmay\u201d present their arguments for attorney\u2019s fees and costs at a later date.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the March 12 order does not \u201cdispose\u201d of the issue of attorney\u2019s fees \u2014 \u201crelief contemplated\u201d by both parties prior to issuance of the order \u2014 the order is not a final order for purposes of Rule 1:1. <em>See Estate of Hackler, </em>44 Va.App. at 61, 602 S.E.2d at 431 (holding that an order was not final where the \u201corder stated that the court would end the cause after [a] final accounting was reviewed and approved,\u201d but \u201cdid not say that the cause was ended,\u201d reasoning that \u201c[t]his language indicates that the trial court considered that the cause was still open\u201d). And, because the March 12 order was not a final order, the trial court had jurisdiction to hear wife\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees even though twenty-one days had elapsed since entry of the order resolving the merits of the underlying motion to vacate. <em>Cf. Vokes v. Vokes, </em>28 Va.App. 349, 358-59, 504 S.E.2d 865, 870 (1998) (vacating award of attorney\u2019s fees that was based entirely on the denial of a motion to reconsider, where the order denying the motion to reconsider was entered more than twenty-one days after entry of final judgment and, therefore, \u201cthe trial court was without jurisdiction when it adjudicated [the motion to reconsider]\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u201cAn award of attorney\u2019s fees is a matter submitted to the trial court\u2019s sound discretion and is reviewable on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>appeal only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Graves v. Graves, </em>4 Va.App. 326, 333, 357 S.E.2d 554, 558 (1987). However, \u201c[a]n abuse of discretion can be found if the trial court uses an improper legal standard in exercising its discretionary function,\u201d <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 262, 578 S.E.2d 833, 836 (2003), because \u201ca trial court \u2018by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law,\u2019 \u201d <em>Shooltz v. Shooltz, </em>27 Va.App. 264, 271, 498 S.E.2d 437, 441 (1998) (quoting <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2047, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996)). Because the trial court improperly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the issue of attorney\u2019s fees, it abused its discretion as a matter of law. Accordingly, we reverse the order denying wife\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and we remand this case to the circuit court with direction to entertain the merits of her motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-8\">. The trial court also advised the parties during the hearing that \"the motion for attorney fees can be set for another Friday on [the court\u2019s] docket if the parties wish to present oral argument on the matter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b268-6\">. In <em>Patel v. Patel, </em>33 Va.App. 776, 537 S.E.2d 11 (2000), the trial court bifurcated a divorce proceeding, reserving ruling on the issue of equitable distribution and retaining the case on its docket \"until March 31, 1998.\" We held that the court lost jurisdiction over the issue of equitable distribution twenty-one days after March 31, reasoning that the trial court only extended its jurisdiction over the bifurcated issue for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the limited period specified in its order. <em>See id. </em>at 783, 537 S.E.2d at 15. Here, however, the court did not set a deadline, merely indicating that the parties could present their arguments at some unspecified date in the future.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b269-7\">. Generally, a motion for sanctions must be made within twenty-one days after issuance of the order disposing of the merits of the underlying action. <em>See Smith v. Stanaway, </em>242 Va. 286, 289-90, 410 S.E.2d 610, 612 (1991) (reversing award of sanctions where motion for sanctions was made seven days after entry of final order but court did not award sanctions until more than twenty-one days after entry of the final order); <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Hadid, </em>238 Va. 722, 733, 385 S.E.2d 898, 905 (1989) (approving denial of sanctions where the motion for sanctions was heard twenty-five days after issuance of the final order, reasoning that \"after twenty-one days elapsed, the trial court no longer had jurisdiction over the matter\u201d). A request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs is analogous to a motion for sanctions. However, <em>Smith </em>and <em>Murray </em>are distinguishable because, in both cases, neither party had requested sanctions prior to the issuance of the final order, nor did the final order expressly reserve ruling on the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
