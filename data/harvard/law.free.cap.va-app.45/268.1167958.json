We hold the governing statutes afford him no such discretion. We reverse the circuit court\u2019s contrary ruling and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">A. <em>The Statutory Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"A3E\">(i) <em>The 1998 Tobacco Settlement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">In 1998, Virginia and forty-five other states entered into a Master Settlement Agreement with the several major tobacco manufacturers. <em>See generally Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 </em>U.S. 525, 533, 121 S.Ct. 2404, 2405-06, 150 L.Ed.2d 532 (2001); <em>Star Scientific, Inc. v. Beales, </em>278 F.3d 339 (4th Cir.2002) (upholding Virginia tobacco settlement statutes against various constitutional challenges). The parties intended the settlement to end further litigation between state governments and tobacco manufacturers. The states released the manufacturers from past and future liability in exchange for their agreement to abide by advertising and promotional restrictions and to make annual monetary payments to the states based on annual cigarette sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Not all tobacco manufacturers participated in the original settlement. For those that did not participate, the General Assembly enacted the Tobacco Escrow Act, Code \u00a7 3.1-336.1 <em>et seq. </em>The Act permits manufacturers to sell tobacco products in the Commonwealth if they either (i) join the master settlement agreement and comply with its terms, or (ii) make specified payments into an escrow fund intended to \u201cguarantee a source of compensation and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large, short-term profits and then becoming judgment-proof before liability may arise____\u201d 1999 Va. Acts, chs. 714, 754; <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 3.1-336.2(A). If they choose the latter option, the manufacturers must file annual certifications with the Attorney General verifying that they made the required escrow payments. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 3.1-336.2(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>(ii) <em>Enforcing Escrow Payment Obligations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The Tobacco Escrow Act authorizes the Attorney General to \u201cbring a civil action on behalf of the Commonwealth against any tobacco product manufacturer that fails to place into escrow the funds required under this section.\u201d Code \u00a7 3.1-336.2(C). Upon finding a manufacturer liable, the \u201ccourt\u201d may assess a \u201ccivil penalty\u201d against the manufacturer. Code \u00a7 3.1-336.2(0(1) &amp; (2). Depending on whether the court classifies the violation as knowing or inadvertent, the penalty can range from 5% to 300% of the delinquent amount. <em>Id. </em>When a court finds a \u201csecond knowing violation,\u201d the court can prohibit the manufacturer \u201cfrom selling cigarettes to consumers within the Commonwealth\u201d for up to two years. Code \u00a7 3.1-336.2(0(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">(iii) <em>Admission Into &amp; Exclusion From The Directory</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">In 2003, the General Assembly passed additional legislation to enhance the enforceability of the Tobacco Escrow Act. <em>See </em>2003 Va. Acts, ch. 789 (Code \u00a7\u00a7 3.1-336.3 to 3.1-336.16). These new provisions, commonly called the \u201cComplementary Legislation,\u201d require the Attorney General to maintain a directory listing all manufacturers that have filed current and accurate certifications. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 3.1-336.5(A). A manufacturer not listed in the directory may not sell any tobacco products in the Commonwealth. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 3.1-336.6, 3.1-336.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Under Code \u00a7 3.1-336.5(A), the Attorney General \u201cshall\u201d list in the directory all manufacturers with \u201ccurrent and accurate certifications\u201d in conformity with Code \u00a7 3.1-336.4. The Act provides two exceptions to this mandatory duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The first exception states that the Attorney General \u201cshall not\u201d include in the directory \u201cany nonparticipating manufacturer that fails to provide the required certification or whose certification the Attorney General determines is not in compliance with subsections C and D of \u00a7 3.1-336.4, unless the Attorney General has determined that such violation has been cured to his satisfaction.\u201d Code \u00a7 3.1-336.5(A)(1). Subsec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>tions C and D of \u00a7 3.1-336.4 require that the certification include certain information, verify that the escrow fund has been established, and include a declaration that the manufacturer is in \u201cfull compliance\u201d with the governing statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">The second exception makes clear no manufacturer can be included in the directory if the Attorney General concludes the required escrow funds \u201chave not been fully paid\u201d or the manufacturer has not satisfied \u201call outstanding final judgments\u201d for any statutory violation. Code \u00a7 3.1-336.5(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Finally, Code \u00a7 3.1-336.11 subjects any \u201cdetermination of the Attorney General to not list or to remove\u201d a manufacturer from the directory to judicial review pursuant to the Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA), Code \u00a7 2.2-4000 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">B. <em>The Dispute Between Citland &amp; The Attorney General</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Citland did not participate in the 1998 master settlement agreement. In 2003, Citland submitted an application to the Attorney General for inclusion in the directory. The Attorney General initially rejected the application, alleging that Citland had sold cigarettes in Virginia in 2001 and 2002 without filing the necessary certifications and depositing the appropriate escrow funds. In response, Citland filed the appropriate certifications and fully funded the escrow account.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Citland again asked to be included in the directory. The Attorney General again refused. Before being allowed into the directory, the Attorney General advised, Citland would have to pay a proposed statutory penalty of almost $150,000 for the earlier statutory defaults that allegedly occurred in 2001 and 2002. Citland contested the amount of the proposed penalty and asserted legal defenses to its imposition. Citland also argued that only a court, not the Attorney General, could impose statutory penalties. Only the nonpayment of a judicially imposed penalty, Citland reasoned, could preclude it from being listed in the directory. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 3.1-336.5(A)(2). The Attorney General disagreed, entered a final case decision excluding Citland from the directory, and advised Citland of its right of appeal under the VAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Citland filed a VAPA appeal in circuit court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The circuit court received from the parties an agreed statement of facts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both parties conceded that Citland \u201csatisfied all of the requirements\u201d of the Attorney General \u201cexcept one: Citland has not paid the penalties demanded by the Attorney General for Citland\u2019s alleged failure to timely establish and fund a qualified escrow account for sales in the Commonwealth during calendar years 2001 and 2002.\u201d Joint Statement of Record \u00b6 15, at 4-5. After briefing and oral argument, the circuit court dismissed the appeal and denied Citland all of its requested relief. Citland now appeals to us, claiming the circuit court erred as a matter of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As it did below, Citland contends on appeal that the Attorney General has no discretion to exclude it from the directory for nonpayment of proposed penalties for alleged violations of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Under the VAPA, the governing standard of review depends on the nature of the controversy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the contest involves factfinding, we defer to the agency just as we would a jury or a trial court. <em>See Mattaponi Indian Tribe v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 690, 706, 601 S.E.2d 667, 675 (2004) (noting the court may reject agency factfinding \u201conly if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number><em>necessarily </em>come to a different conclusion\u201d (citations omitted and emphasis in original)). Similarly, when the appellant challenges a judgment call on a topic on which \u201cthe agency has been entrusted with wide discretion by the General Assembly,\u201d we will overturn the decision only if it can be fairly characterized as \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d and thus a \u201cclear abuse of delegated discretion.\u201d <em>Vasaio v. Dep\u2019t of Motor Vehicles, </em>42 Va.App. 190, 196-97, 590 S.E.2d 596, 599 (2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">On the other hand, an \u201cagency does not possess specialized competence over the interpretation of a statute merely because it addresses topics within the agency\u2019s delegable authority.\u201d <em>Finnerty v. Thornton Hall, Inc., </em>42 Va.App. 628, 634, 593 S.E.2d 568, 571 (2004); <em>see also 7-Eleven, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality, </em>42 Va.App. 65, 73, 590 S.E.2d 84, 88 (2003) <em>(en </em>banc). Pure statutory construction, a matter within the \u201ccore competency of the judiciary,\u201d <em>Finnerty, </em>42 Va. App. at 635, 593 S.E.2d at 571, requires <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Mattaponi Indian Tribe, </em>43 Va.App. at 707, 601 S.E.2d at 675 (citation omitted). \u201cThis axiom stems from basic principles of separation of powers. \u2018It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\u2019 \u201d <em>Finnerty, </em>42 Va.App. at 635, 593 S.E.2d at 571 (quoting <em>Marbury v. Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803)). It necessarily follows that the <em>a priori </em>question whether the statute delegates or withholds discretion is itself a question of statutory interpretation, one impheating our duty of <em>de novo </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Exercising this duty, we conclude that the General Assembly did not delegate to the Attorney General discretionary power to exclude manufacturers from the directory solely for nonpayment of proposed penalties. Code \u00a7 3.1-336.5(A) makes clear the Attorney General \u201cshah\u201d list in the directory all manufacturers with \u201ccurrent and accurate certifications\u201d in conformity with Code \u00a7 3.1-336.4. \u201cIn its ordinary use, \u2018shall\u2019 is a word of command, and is the language of command, and is the ordinary, usual, and natural word used in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>a mandate.\u201d <em>Cirrito v. Cirrito, </em>44 Va.App. 287, 309, 605 S.E.2d 268, 279 (2004) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Though exceptions exist to this statutory mandate, none apply to this case. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 3.1-336.5(A)(1) &amp; (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Code \u00a7 3.1-336.5(A)(1) granted the Attorney General the discretionary authority to exclude Citland from the directory if, in his judgment, Citland failed to \u201ccure\u201d its prior violation of \u201csubsections C and D of \u00a7 3.1-336.4.\u201d Subsections C and D require, among other things, annual certification verifying that the manufacturer has established an escrow fund and otherwise complied with all statutory obligations. Code \u00a7 3.1-336.4(C) &amp; (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Nothing in subsections C or D of \u00a7 3.1-336.4 \u2014 or, for that matter, any other statutory provision \u2014 required Citland to pay a proposed civil penalty. Instead, Code \u00a7 3.1-336.2(C)(1) makes clear the \u201ccourt, upon finding a violation\u201d has sole authority to \u201cimpose a civil penalty\u201d under the statute. In this respect, the Attorney General\u2019s role is not adjudicative, but representative. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 3.1-336.2(C) (authorizing the Attorney General to file a civil penalty action \u201con behalf of the Commonwealth\u201d). The Attorney General brings the suit. The court alone decides it.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Even so, the Attorney General responds, his power to insist upon a \u201ccure\u201d before listing a manufacturer in the directory includes not only the power to require full present compliance, but also the power to impose a civil penalty for alleged past noncompliance. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In accepted legal parlance, a cure remedies a default \u2014 not penalizes it. Curing a default \u201ccommonly means taking care of the triggering event and returning to pre-default condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>tions\u201d or \u201cto remedy or rectify the default and restore matters to the status quo ante.\u201d <em>Litton v. Wachovia Bank, </em>330 F.3d 636, 644 (4th Cir.2003) (citations omitted). A contractual party, for example, cures a breach of contract by remedying the breach,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> not by paying punitive damages. The remedial concept of cure does not typically include any punitive connotation, the chief characteristic of a civil penalty. <em>See generally Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1198 (8th ed.2004) (defining penalty as \u201cPunishment imposed on a wrongdoer ... esp., a sum of money exacted as punishment for either a wrong to the state or a civil wrong\u201d); <em>United States v. Telluride Co., </em>146 F.3d 1241, 1246 (10th Cir.1998) (finding the ordinary meaning of \u201cpenalty\u201d is \u201ca sanction or punishment imposed for violating a public law which goes beyond compensation for the injury caused by the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">We accept that the conventional use of a term may be misleading when placed in an unconventional statutory context. The context of the tobacco statutes, however, confirms our interpretation. If the \u201ccure\u201d discretion of Code \u00a7 3.1-336.5(A)(1) extended to proposed penalties, it would undermine Code \u00a7 3.1-336.2(C)(1)\u2019s carefully crafted scheme of <em>judicially </em>imposed penalties. It is hardly likely the Attorney General would file suit to collect a penalty payment he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>already received. The judicial process overseeing the imposition of civil penalties would be sidelined, almost to the point of irrelevancy, if the Attorney General could collect proposed penalties as a tribute for admission into the directory.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The Attorney General\u2019s view of his \u201ccure\u201d discretion would also put into question what meaning, if any, would be left of Code \u00a7 3.1-336.5(A)(2) in civil penalty cases. It excludes manufacturers from the directory for, among other things, failing to satisfy \u201call outstanding final judgments.\u201d Here again, there would be no final judgments imposing civil penalties if the Attorney General coerced manufacturers into paying proposed penalties \u2014 using entry into, or expulsion from, the directory as the instrument of coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In sum, Code \u00a7 3.1-336.5(A)(1) does not grant the Attorney General discretion to exclude Citland from the directory because of nonpayment of proposed penalties for alleged violations of the tobacco statutes. The circuit court, therefore, erred as a matter of law in dismissing the VAPA appeal filed by Citland. We remand this matter to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-6\">.

Two days after Citland filed its VAPA appeal in the circuit court, the Attorney General filed a separate action in circuit court seeking the judicial imposition of civil penalties under Code \u00a7 3.1-336.2(C). The civil penally proceeding is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\">. The same standard applies to the circuit court, as it does to us. \"Under the VAPA, the circuit court reviews the agency's action in a manner 'equivalent to an appellate court\u2019s role in an appeal from a trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mattaponi Indian Tribe v.
