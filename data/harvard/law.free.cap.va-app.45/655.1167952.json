On appeal, husband contends the trial court erred in (1) deciding he and Roseanne Gaffney (wife) had entered into a valid and binding property settlement agreement and incorporating the terms of that purported agreement into the final decree of divorce, (2) granting wife attorney\u2019s fees of $15,000, and (3) ordering him, in conjunction with its award to wife of fifty percent of the marital share of his United States Public Health Service pension, to indemnify wife for any future diminution of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>award resulting from his waiver of retirement pay in order to receive additional disability pay. For the reasons that follow, we hold the trial court erred in deciding the parties had entered into a valid and binding property settlement. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the issues of equitable distribution and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">\u201cOn appeal, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to wife, the prevailing party below, granting to that evidence all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Wright v. Wright, </em>38 Va.App. 394, 398, 564 S.E.2d 702, 704 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">So viewed, the evidence established that husband and wife married in 1977 and separated in December 2000. No children were born of the marriage. In July 2002, wife filed for divorce requesting, <em>inter alia, </em>spousal support, attorney\u2019s fees, and equitable distribution of the parties\u2019 marital assets. In November 2002, husband filed an answer and cross-bill for divorce also seeking spousal support, attorney\u2019s fees, and equitable distribution. An <em>ore tenus </em>hearing was scheduled for October 21, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">On October 16, 2003, wife\u2019s counsel sent husband\u2019s counsel a letter via e-mail setting forth the terms of a proposed property settlement agreement. The first sentence of the letter read, \u201cPending [husband\u2019s] response to our latest proposal as to the pension issue, the following is the agreed settlement of property, which will be bifurcated from the issues of pension and spousal support at court.\u201d The first fourteen paragraphs of the proposed agreement described how the parties\u2019 real property, personal property, debts, and obligations were to be distributed. The last three paragraphs set forth proposals for settling the outstanding issues of husband\u2019s pension, spousal support, and the further incurrence of attorney\u2019s fees. The same day, husband\u2019s counsel responded via e-mail, \u201cI can\u2019t sign the letter, <em>per se, </em>but I confirm by this e-mail that the portion of the letter describing the settled terms [set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>paragraphs one through fourteen] accurately reflects our agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Prior to the October 21, 2003 hearing, wife\u2019s counsel presented husband\u2019s counsel with a formal \u201cSeparation and Property Settlement Agreement\u201d signed by wife. The proposed agreement encompassed all of the terms set forth in wife\u2019s counsel\u2019s October 16, 2003 e-mail, contained additional boilerplate language and details regarding the implementation of those terms, and noted that the issues of spousal support, husband\u2019s pension, and further incurred attorney\u2019s fees were to be submitted to the trial court for resolution at the October 21, 2003 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">On the morning of the October 21, 2003 hearing, husband\u2019s counsel informed wife\u2019s counsel that husband had not yet signed the proposed agreement but he \u201cintended to obtain his signature following the proceedings.\u201d Although he believed the \u201cagreement set forth a settlement between the parties\u201d and that he \u201chad authority from [husband] to enter into the agreement\u201d on husband\u2019s behalf, husband\u2019s counsel was not sure at the time that husband would actually sign the proposed agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">At the commencement of the October 21, 2003 hearing, the trial court noted that both parties were represented by counsel and that the case was before the court for equitable distribution. In her opening statement, wife\u2019s counsel asserted that the parties had \u201caccumulated nearly $920,000 ... in non-retirement assets\u201d and \u201c$44,000 in retirement savings.\u201d She then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">Those assets have been divided by agreement fifty/flfty and each side has prepared a chart of the agreed assets each will receive. The only difference in the charts is that we differ in the value of the condo that [wife] will receive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">And [husband] places a $25,000 figure on twenty-six year old furniture that [wife] has in her possession. Other than that, I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any dispute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">Wife\u2019s counsel then asserted that the. only outstanding issues needing determination by the court were the division of hus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>band\u2019s United States Public Health Service pension, spousal support, and attorney\u2019s fees related to the October 21, 2003 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In his opening statement, husband\u2019s counsel confirmed wife\u2019s counsel\u2019s remarks regarding the parties\u2019 purported settlement: \u201cThe parties have \u2014 as [wife\u2019s counsel] has indicated \u2014 resolved the issue of property division, with the exception of the pension. And we\u2019re going to each submit exhibits to Your Honor showing what we believe the parties[\u2019] property settlement to be worth. And there\u2019s clear differences in the values.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Both parties then testified and presented exhibits with respect to the outstanding issues of husband\u2019s pension, spousal support, and attorney\u2019s fees. Much of that evidence regarded the parties\u2019 projected incomes and expenses and the value of the assets divided under the terms of the parties\u2019 purported settlement. To the extent it showed the division of the parties\u2019 property, such evidence was not inconsistent with the basic terms of the proposed agreement signed by wife and presented to husband\u2019s counsel, although not all the terms of that agreement were reflected in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">On direct examination, wife testified that her Exhibit 1 was a chart \u201cof the division of property for the settled part of this case.\u201d Wife\u2019s Exhibit 1 listed the value and allotment of certain of the parties\u2019 assets and liabilities and showed a lump-sum payment to wife of $15,000. Later in the hearing, wife testified that the value of the parties\u2019 furniture, which was allotted to her under \u201cthe terms of the settlement,\u201d was worthless and that she \u201cwas required to pay in terms of the settlement\u201d the debt incurred during the marriage on five credit cards, which totaled $43,417. She also testified that, \u201c[a]s part of the settlement,\u201d she had agreed to cooperate if husband wished a continuation of health insurance. On cross-examination, wife testified that, under the terms of the settlement, she was to receive title to the marital home and would assume responsibility for the $47,000 in back taxes she owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>On direct examination, when shown his Exhibit 1 and asked, \u201cIs that your evaluation of the value of the settlement,\u201d husband responded, \u201cBasically, yes, it is.\u201d Like wife\u2019s Exhibit 1, husband\u2019s Exhibit 1 listed the value and allotment of certain of the parties\u2019 assets and liabilities and showed a lump-sum payment to wife of $15,000. Husband further testified that, \u201cas part of the settlement,\u201d he relinquished a credit of $53,000 he was originally to have received. Husband also testified that his Exhibit 2 represented \u201ca description of the income producing portion of the asset settlement that he and [wife] reached\u201d and that, \u201cas part of the settlement,\u201d he agreed to pay $10,000 of wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and a lump sum of $15,000. At no point during the hearing did husband object to any of the numerous references to the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The parties presented additional evidence during the hearing regarding wife\u2019s request for half of the marital portion of husband\u2019s pension and their requests for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and spousal support. At the conclusion of the evidence and argument by counsel, the trial court awarded wife half of the marital share of husband\u2019s pension, granted both parties a reservation of the right to seek spousal support in the future, and denied the parties\u2019 requests for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">On November 19, 2003, wife filed a motion requesting that the terms of the \u201csettlement of property issues reached and affirmed by the parties\u201d at the October 21, 2003 hearing be incorporated into a final decree of divorce. Wife additionally asked for an award of her attorney\u2019s fees \u201cincurred as a result of [husband\u2019s] refusal to sign\u201d the property settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Shortly thereafter, husband filed an objection to wife\u2019s motion and a motion seeking a declaratory judgment that the purported settlement was not a binding and enforceable settlement agreement. Citing the need for his testimony at the hearing on husband\u2019s motion, husband\u2019s attorney filed a motion to withdraw as counsel. Husband\u2019s new counsel was subsequently substituted for his original counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>The trial court conducted a hearing on wife\u2019s and husband\u2019s motions on March 24, 2004. At that hearing, wife called husband\u2019s former counsel as a witness to testify as to the existence of a settlement agreement between the parties. When asked by wife\u2019s counsel if, prior to the October 21, 2003 hearing, \u201cthere was a settlement of all property issues, with the exception of the pension,\u201d husband\u2019s former counsel responded, \u201cYou and I reached terms for settlement of the issues that were pending before the Court, between us.\u201d Husband\u2019s former counsel further testified, on cross-examination, that \u201cthere was never an occasion during [the October 21, 2003] hearing when we specifically spread the terms on the record ... and asked ... each of the parties ... to stand and affirm that it was their agreement.\u201d Husband\u2019s former counsel, who was qualified as an expert in the practice of domestic relations law in Virginia, further testified on cross-examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">Q. [0]n how many occasions would you have been in court or before a court reporter, where there was a record, where you or your opposing attorney would recite the terms of the settlement agreement, ... where you recited the terms or your colleague has recited the terms and had the parties affirm, make an affirmative statement that they agreed to those terms?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">A. Too many to count.... I\u2019ve been doing this for 30 years. I can\u2019t imagine how many times I\u2019ve done that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">Q. And would it be fair to say that on those occasions when you would put those terms on the record, that it was done with much more specificity than the terms of this alleged agreement were put on the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">A. Well, ... the idea was to attempt to make sure that no term was omitted when you are creating a record like that. And what usually happens is between the two lawyers sort of jumping in to remind another lawyer that he or she has forgotten something, the idea is to spread all of the details of the settlement on the record, before the parties are asked to affirm that it was their settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">Q. Was that done in the record in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">Q. Now, on those innumerable occasions when you were present where the terms were dictated onto a record, and then the parties were asked to affirm, was it the intent that the parties knew that they were affirming what had just been read as the terms of the agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">A. That was the idea. Obviously, they had an opportunity to say if there was some part of the record that was being created that they did not think was accurate or that something had been left out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">Q. And on those occasions, the parties would be asked words to the effect, have you heard the terms that have just been recited, and do those terms fairly and accurately represent the settlement which you believe you have settled the case on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">A. Or some similar formulation, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-9\">Q. Was that ever done in open court on a record in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-10\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">Husband then testified that he never signed the property settlement agreement that was presented to his counsel in this case and that, while he \u201caffirm[ed] assets\u201d and testified regarding \u201cthe value of the settlement\u201d at the October 21, 2003 hearing, he did not affirm the terms of the purported settlement agreement. He further testified that he did not believe he could enter into a valid and binding property settlement agreement without formally signing a written agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-12\">Noting that \u201clegally an attorney is treated synonymously with his or her client and ... that the parties are bound by [their attorney\u2019s] proffers and stipulations, especially when no exceptions or objections [are] noted during the hearing,\u201d the trial court ruled that the parties had reached a valid and binding property settlement agreement resolving all property division issues except husband\u2019s pension. A court reporter was present at the October 21, 2003 hearing, the court noted further, and the parties \u201cwere placed under oath and [husband] never indicated his disagreement with his own attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>or ... wife\u2019s attorney.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court granted wife\u2019s motion for entry of a final decree of divorce incorporating the terms of the parties\u2019 property settlement agreement and awarded wife $15,000 in attorney\u2019s fees incurred with respect to the March 24, 2004 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Wife\u2019s counsel subsequently submitted to the trial court for entry a final decree of divorce setting forth the terms of the parties\u2019 property settlement agreement and the court\u2019s rulings on the division of husband\u2019s pension, spousal support, and attorney\u2019s fees. Filing a motion to reconsider, husband moved to have those portions of the proposed final decree guaranteeing wife a certain level of income from his pension stricken. The trial court denied husband\u2019s motion and entered the submitted final decree on April 28, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">\u201cWhen the parties have entered into a <em>valid </em>agreement, the trial court may incorporate [the terms of] that agreement ... into its final decree of divorce.\u201d <em>Pelfrey v. Pelfrey, </em>25 Va.App. 239, 244, 487 S.E.2d 281, 283-84 (1997) (emphasis added) (citing Code \u00a7 20-109.1). The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the parties\u2019 purported settlement agreement, the terms of which the trial <em>court </em>incorporated into the final decree of divorce, was a valid and binding marital agreement under Code \u00a7 20-155. Because this is a question of law involving the construction and application of Code \u00a7 20-155, we review the trial court\u2019s judgment <em>de novo. See Sink v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 655, 658, 507 S.E.2d 670, 671 (1998) (noting that, \u201c[although the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact are binding on appeal unless plainly wrong, we review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Husband argues the alleged settlement agreement was invalid under Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-155 and 20-149 because it was not in writing or signed by the parties and the parties\u2019 exhibits and statements regarding those exhibits at the October 21, 2003 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>hearing failed to comport with the specific requirements necessary to invoke the exception set forth in Code \u00a7 20-155(ii). Wife argues that not only did the exhibits and testimony of the parties satisfy the requirements of Code \u00a7 20-155(ii), the stipulation and proffers of the parties\u2019 attorneys legally bound both parties to the terms of the agreement under <em>Newman v. Newman, </em>42 Va.App. 557, 593 S.E.2d 533 (2004) (en banc). Because the plain meaning of the language of Code \u00a7 20-155 supports his position, we agree with husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">\u201cThe General Assembly has identified agreements between spouses involving rights and obligations arising from the marital relationship as a unique category of agreements subject to specific requirements.\u201d <em>Flanary v. Milton, </em>263 Va. 20, 22, 556 S.E.2d 767, 768 (2002). Code \u00a7 20-155 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">Married persons may enter into agreements with each other for the purpose of settling the rights and obligations of either or both of them, to the same extent, with the same effect, and subject to the same conditions, as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 20-147 through 20-154 for agreements between prospective spouses, except that such marital agreements shall become effective immediately upon their execution. If the terms of such agreement are (i) contained in a court order endorsed by counsel or the parties or (n) recorded and transcribed by a court reporter and affirmed by the parties on the record personally, the agreement is not required to be in writing and is considered to be executed. A reconciliation of the parties after the signing of a separation or property settlement agreement shall abrogate such agreement unless otherwise expressly set forth in the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACA\">Code \u00a7 20-150 provides that parties may enter into such agreements with respect to \u201c[t]he disposition of property upon separation [or] marital dissolution.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-149 requires that such agreements \u201cbe in writing and signed by both parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Here, the marital agreement at issue, which purportedly settled the parties\u2019 property rights in connection with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>divorce proceedings, was not in writing or signed by the parties. As noted above, however, Code \u00a7 20-155 provides that a marital agreement that is not in writing and not signed by the parties is valid and binding if \u201cthe terms of such agreement are (i) contained in a court order endorsed by counsel or the parties or (ii) recorded and transcribed by a court reporter and affirmed by the parties on the record personally.\u201d It is undisputed that no such mutually \u201cendorsed\u201d court order was presented in this case. The question remains, however, whether the subject agreement was valid under the exception set forth in Code \u00a7 20-155(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">According to husband, that exception does not apply in this case because the terms of the subject agreement were not \u201crecorded and transcribed\u201d or \u201caffirmed by the parties on the record personally,\u201d as required by the statute. Wife counters that, although the actual terms of the settlement agreement were not specifically recited into the record and affirmed all together at the equitable distribution hearing, the requirements of Code \u00a7 20 \u2014 155(ii) were met because the parties placed the necessary terms of the agreement on the record through their exhibits and personally affirmed those terms through their sworn testimony concerning the exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">We are mindful, in construing and applying Code \u00a7 20-155 in this case, that \u2018\u201c[cjourts are not permitted to rewrite statutes. This is a legislative function. The manifest intention of the legislature, clearly disclosed by its language, must be applied. There can be no departure from the words used where the intention is clear.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barr v. Town &amp; Country Properties, </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Commonwealth, </em>182 Va. 560, 566, 29 S.E.2d 838, 841 (1944)). In other words, \u201c \u2018[w]here the legislature has used words of a plain and definite import the courts cannot put upon them a construction which amounts to holding the legislature did not mean what it has actually expressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Watkins v. Hall, </em>161 Va. 924, 930, 172 S.E. 445, 447 (1934)). \u2018We must ... assume that the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the ... statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, if the statutory language at issue is plain and unambiguous, we</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">\u201cgive that language a \u2018literal construction\u2019 unless doing so \u2018would involve a manifest absurdity.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Cent. Va. Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Assocs., P.C. v. Whitfield, </em>42 Va.App. 264, 276, 590 S.E.2d 631, 638 (2004)] (quoting <em>Chase v. Daimler-Chrysler Corp., </em>266 Va. 544, 547, 587 S.E.2d 521, 522 (2003)). And, by literal, we mean the statutory words \u201cshould be given their \u2018common, ordinary and accepted\u2019 \u201d understanding. <em>Mouberry v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 576, 583, 575 S.E.2d 567, 570 (2003) (quoting <em>Germek v. Germek, </em>34 Va.App. 1, 8, 537 S.E.2d 596, 600 (2000)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-6\"><em>Meador v. Va. Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Program, </em>44 Va.App. 149, 154, 604 S.E.2d 88, 91 (2004). Furthermore, we will consider the words at issue in light of the context in which they are used, which includes the other language in the statute. <em>Murphy v. Norfolk Cmty. Servs. Bd., </em>260 Va. 334, 339-40, 533 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">As relevant to the issue before us, the language used in Code \u00a7 20 \u2014 155(ii) is plain and unambiguous and, construed literally, clearly manifests the legislature\u2019s intent to provide a specific method by which an unwritten, unsigned marital agreement may be exempted from the requirements of Code \u00a7 20-149. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-155(ii), the requirements that a marital agreement be in writing and signed by the parties do not apply if the terms of the agreement are <em>\u201crecorded and transcribed </em>by a court reporter and <em>affirmed </em>by the parties on the record personally.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In light of the context in which it is used in the statute, the verb \u201crecord\u201d commonly means \u201cto put into written form\u201d or \u201ccause (sound ...) to be transferred to and registered on something (as a ... magnetic tape) by mechanical usu[ally] electronic means in such a way that the thing so transferred and registered can (as by the use of a ... tape recorder) be subsequently reproduced.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1898 (1993). \u201cTranscribe\u201d means to \u201cto make a written or typed copy of (spoken material, especially] testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>ny).\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1585 (8th ed. 2004). It logically follows that, as used in Code \u00a7 20 \u2014 155(ii), the term \u201ccourt reporter\u201d refers to a \u201cperson who records testimony, steno-graphically or by electronic or other means, and, when requested, prepares a transcript.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391. Moreover, as used in the statute, the term \u201caffirm\u201d is an exact synonym of \u201cconfirm,\u201d which commonly means \u201cto make valid by formal assent.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s, supra, </em>at 35, 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Applying these definitions, it is clear that, contrary to wife\u2019s claim, the placement of a written exhibit directly into the record is not the same thing as having the contents of that exhibit \u201crecorded and transcribed by a court reporter.\u201d A written exhibit obviously is not spoken material and, thus, by definition, is not something that can generally be transcribed by a court reporter. Indeed, a court reporter cannot logically put a written exhibit into written form or cause the sound of a written exhibit to be registered on something by mechanical means unless the exhibit is read into the record. Thus, where a marital agreement subject to the requirements of Code \u00a7 20-149 is not in writing or signed by the parties, the mere introduction into evidence, as in this case, of written exhibits reflecting various terms of the agreement is not enough to satisfy Code \u00a7 20-155(ii)\u2019s mandate that the terms of the agreement be \u201crecorded and transcribed by a court reporter.\u201d <em>See generally De Avies v. De Avies, </em>42 Va.App. 342, 344, 592 S.E.2d 351, 352 (2004) (noting that, after submitting several written exhibits reflecting the agreed disposition of the parties\u2019 assets, counsel, \u201c[o]n behalf of their respective clients, ... read into the record in open court [with a court reporter present] the specific terms of their agreement on all issues\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">It is equally, clear from the plain meaning of the language of Code \u00a7 20 \u2014 155(ii) that the giving of testimony by the parties that merely reflects the existence of the marital agreement at issue and describes some of the terms of that agreement, as occurred in this case, is not the equivalent of affirming the actual terms of the agreement themselves. Likewise, the failure of a party to personally voice an objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>tion during the proceedings to statements by either party\u2019s counsel reflecting the existence of such an agreement does not constitute the giving of a \u201cformal assent\u201d on the record to the terms of the agreement. In light of the requisite solemn and ceremonial nature of such an assent, Code \u00a7 20 \u2014 155(ii) plainly contemplates that the parties perform some affirmative act that officially manifests their assent to the terms of the agreement on the record. <em>See Webster\u2019s, supra, </em>at 893 (defining \u201cformal\u201d as, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cceremonial\u201d and \u201ccarried out with solemnity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">We conclude, therefore, that, to satisfy Code \u00a7 20-155(ii)\u2019s mandate that the terms of the agreement be \u201crecorded and transcribed by a court reporter and affirmed by the parties on the record personally,\u201d the terms of the agreement must be read or recited into the record in the presence of a court reporter and the parties must specifically and affirmatively manifest their assent to those terms on the record. Not only does this literal application of the language used in Code \u00a7 20-155(ii) not lead to absurd results, to hold otherwise would be to impermissibly expand the scope of the exception set forth in Code \u00a7 20 \u2014 155(ii) in a manner that is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s plain terms. <em>See Commonwealth v. Brown, </em>259 Va. 697, 704-05, 529 S.E.2d 96, 100 (2000) (holding that, under the fundamental principle of statutory construction <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>\u2014 which \u201cprovides that where a statute speaks in specific terms, an implication arises that omitted terms were not intended to be included within the scope of the statute\u201d \u2014 when a \u201c \u2018legislative enactment limits the manner in which something may be done, the enactment also evinces the intent that it shall not be done another way1 \u201d (quoting <em>Grigg v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 356, 364, 297 S.E.2d 799, 803 (1982))); <em>cf. Flanary, </em>263 Va. at 23, 556 S.E.2d at 769 (holding that a court may not read a new exception into a \u201cstatute plain on its face\u201d). Had the legislature wished to create a more expansive exception, it could have done so, but it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>We further conclude that wife\u2019s reliance on <em>Newman </em>is misplaced. In <em>Newman, </em>we held \u201cthat an attorney acting with actual authority may sign a consent decree on his client\u2019s behalf and thereby satisfy the signature requirement of Code \u00a7 20-109(C)\u201d and upheld the trial court\u2019s denial of the former husband\u2019s motion to modify his contractual obligation to pay his former wife spousal support pursuant to an agreed support award executed solely by the parties\u2019 respective counsel. 42 Va.App. at 568, 593 S.E.2d at 539. In reaching that decision, we concluded that Code 20-109(C) did not displace the common law of agency, under which \u201cthe signature of a disclosed, authorized agent has the same legal force as the signature of his principal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567, 593 S.E.2d at 538 (\u201cAbsent a clearly expressed legislative intent otherwise, statutes should not be construed to displace long-established common law principles.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The present case, however, is not an agency case. Code \u00a7 20 \u2014 155(ii), unlike Code \u00a7 20-109(C), clearly displaces the common law principles of agency. Code \u00a7 20-155(i) specifically permits the parties\u2019 \u201ccounsel or the parties\u201d to endorse the order containing the terms of the marital agreement at issue. Conversely, Code \u00a7 20-155(ii) requires that the terms of the agreement at issue be \u201caffirmed by the parties on the record personally.\u201d In light of the context in which it is used in the statute, the term \u201cpersonally\u201d means \u201cso as to be [done in person without the intervention of another].\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s, swpra, </em>at 1686-87. Plainly, in specifically requiring in Code \u00a7 20 \u2014 155(ii) that the parties affirm the terms of the marital agreement at issue \u201cpersonally,\u201d the legislature intended that the parties\u2019 counsel not be permitted to affirm the terms of the agreement for the parties. Thus, the fact that the parties\u2019 respective counsel stipulated in this case to the existence of an agreement in their representations to the trial court and set forth the terms of the parties\u2019 property settlement agreement in e-mails to each other and the fact that husband\u2019s former counsel testified he had authority to enter into an agreement for husband and reached such an agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>ment with wife\u2019s counsel are inapposite to the issue before us in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"A_qa\">We conclude, therefore, that, because the terms of the marital agreement at issue in this case were not \u201crecorded and transcribed by a court reporter and affirmed by the parties on the record personally,\u201d the exception set forth in Code \u00a7 20-155(h) does not apply and the agreement at issue is not a valid agreement under Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-155 and 20-149. Consequently, the trial court erred in incorporating the terms of that agreement into the final decree of divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the trial court and remand the issue of equitable distribution for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Furthermore, because it is part of the overall equitable distribution award and will necessarily be impacted by those further proceedings, we also reverse and remand the issue of the division of husband\u2019s pension for consideration anew under Code \u00a7 20-107.3. Similarly, because the court\u2019s award of $15,000 in attorney\u2019s fees to wife was based on the trial court\u2019s determination that the parties had entered into a valid and binding property settlement agreement, we reverse and remand the issue of attorney\u2019s fees for consideration anew in light of our decision that the parties did not enter into a valid and binding property settlement agreement. In view of our reversal and remand of the disposition of husband\u2019s pension and the award of attorney\u2019s fees, we do not reach the merits of husband\u2019s claims of error regarding those matters here.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
