ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">This appeal presents the question whether a settlement agreed to by all litigants before the circuit court, consummated by the entry of a consent dismissal order, moots appellate review of the circuit court\u2019s earlier denial of the appellant\u2019s motion to intervene. Under the circumstances of this case, we hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">In 1993, the City of Newport News applied for a permit from the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC) seeking permission to install a raw water intake on state-owned bottomlands in the Mattaponi River. A decade later, in 2003, the VMRC denied the permit, prompting Newport News to file an appeal to the circuit court under the Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA), Code \u00a7 2.2-4000 <em>et seq. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Newport News challenged the VMRC\u2019s decision, as well as the administrative procedures used to reach it.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">The Mattaponi Indian Tribe and Chief Carl T. Lone Eagle Custalow (collectively, the Tribe) filed a motion to intervene in the circuit court VAPA appeal, seeking to defend the VMRC\u2019s permit denial. The Tribe argued, among others things, that the VMRC had no choice but to deny the permit \u2014 because granting it, the Tribe argued, would have violated tribal rights under the 1677 Treaty at Middle Plantation. <em>See generally Mattaponi Indian Tribe v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 690, 697-98, 601 S.E.2d 667, 671 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The circuit court denied the motion to intervene, finding the Tribe\u2019s assertions insufficient to warrant permissive intervention under Rule 2:15 or the VAPA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Tribe filed an interlocutory appeal seeking appellate review of the circuit court\u2019s order denying intervention. We dismissed the appeal as outside our jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 17.1-405. <em>Mattaponi Indian Tribe v. Va. Marine Res. Comm\u2019n, </em>43 Va.App. 728, 601 S.E.2d 686 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Newport News and the VMRC later agreed to settle the case. The settlement called for a remand of the permit application back to the VMRC for reconsideration pursuant to various agreed-upon procedures. In \u201caccordance with\u201d the settlement, the circuit court dismissed the VAPA appeal and remanded the matter to the VMRC \u201cfor further proceedings to be conducted as specified in the parties\u2019 settlement agreement.\u201d Following the entry of the final order, the Tribe filed this appeal challenging the circuit court\u2019s decision denying the motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Newport News and the VMRC contend their settlement and consent dismissal order moot any justiciable appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>late controversy over the circuit court\u2019s denial of the Tribe\u2019s intervention motion. Even if the Tribe should have been allowed to intervene in the circuit court VAPA case, Newport News and the VMRC point out, that proceeding no longer exists \u2014 nor does the underlying dispute prompting the litigation. We find this reasoning persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Having settled their dispute, agreed to a final dismissal order, and forgone any further appeals, Newport News and the VMRC achieved perhaps the highest form of finality the law can give. To permit a putative intervenor to reopen this case, thereby forcing the settling litigants to continue litigating against their will, would be hardly in keeping with the principles of repose which normally accompany a final settlement. <em>See Sierra Club, Inc. v. EPA, </em>358 F.3d 516, 518 (7th Cir.2004) (\u201cOfficious intermeddlers ought not be allowed to hijack litigation that the real parties in interest can resolve to mutual benefit.\u201d). To be sure, it \u201chas never been supposed that one party \u2014 whether an original party, a party that was joined later, or an intervenor \u2014 could preclude other parties from settling their own disputes.\u201d <em>Lawyer v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>521 U.S. 567, 578-79, 117 S.Ct. 2186, 2193-94, 138 L.Ed.2d 669 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">For these reasons, absent the assertion of an independent claim, \u201ca permissive intervenor may not breathe life into a non-existent lawsuit.\u201d <em>Horn v. Eltra Corp., </em>686 F.2d 439, 442 n. 2 (6th Cir.1982) (quoting <em>McKay v. Heyison, </em>614 F.2d 899, 906 (3d Cir.1980)) (internal quotation marks omitted). When \u201cthere is no longer any action in which appellants can intervene, judicial consideration of the question would be fruitless.\u201d <em>United States v. Ford, </em>650 F.2d 1141, 1143 (9th Cir.1981) (holding appeal moot where underlying action had been dismissed on plaintiffs motion). Under these circumstances, \u201can intervenor cannot keep a lawsuit alive which the original parties wish to end.\u201d <em>Citibank, N.A. v. State, </em>599 N.W.2d 402, 405 (S.D.1999) (citation omitted); <em>see also State ex rel. United States Steel Corp. v. Ross, </em>22 Ohio St.3d 85, 488 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>N.E.2d 876 (1986) (dismissing appeal as moot due to final settlement between the named parties).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">We acknowledge that a final order, even when the product of a settlement, may be upended on appeal by intervenors denied admission into a proceeding in which they had an inviolate statutory or common law right to participate. <em>See, e.g., Cont'l Baking Co. v. Charlottesville, </em>202 Va. 798, 803, 120 S.E.2d 476, 478 (1961) (vacating final order because, under an annexation statute, intervenors \u201cshall be made parties defendant\u201d). But that is not the situation here. Nothing in Rule 2:15, the VAPA, or the enabling statutes for the VMRC gives the Tribe the <em>right </em>to intervene. As the Tribe acknowledges,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> its best argument relies on principles of permissive intervention \u2014 a matter within the sound discretion of the circuit court.. <em>See generally Hudson v. Jarrett, </em>269 Va. 24, 606 S.E.2d 827 (2005) (noting that intervention decisions generally fall \u201cwithin the discretion of the trial court\u201d); Kent Sinclair &amp; Leigh B. Middleditch, Jr., <em>Virginia Civil Procedure </em>\u00a7 9.13, at 409 (3d ed. 1998) (observing that, under Rule 2:15, the \u201ctrial court has considerable discretion\u201d in deciding intervention requests).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Finally, we also reject the Tribe\u2019s argument that any decision by the VMRC (granting or denying the permit) or by the circuit court (reviewing that decision on appeal under the VAPA) could prejudice any legally enforceable rights the Tribe has under the 1677 Treaty at Middle Plantation \u2014 thus presenting the Tribe with this one and only opportunity to vindicate its tribal rights under the treaty. Though the VMRC may consider any matter within its statutory mandate, it had no administrative jurisdiction to <em>adjudicate </em>the Tribe\u2019s treaty rights. <em>See Mattaponi Indian Tribe, </em>43 Va.App. at 708-09, 601 S.E.2d at 676 (holding that State Water Control Board has no statutory authority to adjudicate the Tribe\u2019s freestanding treaty claims); <em>see also Zappulla v. Crown, </em>239 Va. 566, 571, 391 S.E.2d 65, 68 (1990) (concluding that issuance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>of a VMRC permit \u201cdoes not amount to an adjudication of conflicting private property claims\u201d). For similar reasons, no settlement between Newport News and the VMRC could prejudice any rights the Tribe has under the treaty. As the United States Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\">Of course, parties who choose to resolve litigation through settlement may not dispose of the claims of a third party, and <em>a fortiori </em>may not impose duties or obligations on a third party, without that party\u2019s agreement. A court\u2019s approval of a consent decree between some of the parties therefore cannot dispose of the valid claims of nonconsenting intervenors; if properly raised, these claims remain and may be litigated by the intervenor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-5\"><em>Local Number 93, Int\u2019l Assoc. of Firefighters v. Cleveland, </em>478 U.S. 501, 529, 106 S.Ct. 3063, 3079, 92 L.Ed.2d 405 (1986).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">For these reasons, we hold that the settlement between Newport News and the VMRC, consummated by the entry of a consent dismissal order, moots the Tribe\u2019s appeal of the circuit court\u2019s decision to deny the Tribe\u2019s motion to intervene.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\"><em>Appeal Dismissed </em>As <em>Moot.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-9\">. After the filing of a petition for appeal, VAPA proceedings \"shall be held as in a suit in equity and the rules contained in Part Two, where not in conflict with the code of Virginia or this part, shall apply.

This appeal brings before us the circuit court\u2019s intervention decision, but not any question concerning the propriety of the final consent order. <em>See generally Tidewater Psychiatric Inst. v. Buttery, </em>8 Va.App. 380, 383-84, 382 S.E.2d 288, 290 (1989) (finding a party denied permission to intervene is an \"aggrieved party\u2019\u2019 within the meaning of Code \u00a7 17-116.05 (predecessor to Code \u00a7 17.1-405) only for purposes of appealing the intervention denial). We thus express no opinion on the Tribe\u2019s challenge to the trial court's adoption of the settlement terms in the final consent order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b262-10\">.

Rountree, </em>200 Va. 57, 63, 104 S.E.2d 42, 47-48 (1958). Though exceptions exist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>to this settled principle, <em>id. </em>at 64, 104 S.E.2d at 48, none apply to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
