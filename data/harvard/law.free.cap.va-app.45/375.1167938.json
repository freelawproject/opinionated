Commonwealth, </em>04 Vap UNP 1351034 (2004). In that decision, a divided panel of this Court reversed Gonzales\u2019 conviction for rape in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-61 and forcible sodomy in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1, finding that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of prior crimes and that such error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">By order dated August 10, 2004, we granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for a rehearing en banc, stayed the mandate of that decision, and reinstated the appeal. Upon rehearing this case en banc, we reverse Gonzales\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Juares v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 154, 156, 493 S.E.2d 677, 678 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-13\">So viewed, the evidence established that appellant made an appointment with Naomi Parrish (Parrish) in response to her advertisement as a dancer performing \u201cfantasy shows, private dancing, bachelor parties.\u201d Parrish provided him with di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>rections to her apartment. When appellant arrived at her apartment, Parrish took him to a bedroom where she told him the price for dancing was $150 for one-half hour, and $190 for an hour. She testified that sex was not discussed at this time. Appellant handed Parrish $80, which she said was unacceptable, and she handed appellant\u2019s money back to him. He slammed the bedroom door shut. Parrish told him to leave. He said no and blocked the door. Appellant said he wanted \u201cthis sh.. now,\u201d which Parrish testified had a \u201csexual implication like he wanted to have intercourse with [her].\u201d She asked him not to harm her, and tried to talk him into letting her leave, to which he responded \u201chell no.\u201d Appellant pushed her onto the bed, pinned her down, and told her to take the money. She responded \u201cI don\u2019t do that, I\u2019m just a dancer.\u201d He then raped and sodomized her. Afterwards appellant apologized, said a girlfriend had left him, and he had been abducted by his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Appellant later telephoned Parrish, and she provided his telephone number to police. Parrish and the police made a sting call to appellant during which he stated that he raped her as an \u201cemotional outlet\u201d after being \u201cdeceived\u201d by his girlfriend and that he was very sorry. In a later phone call appellant asked her to forgive him and said that he had called a rape crisis hotline. When asked about his apologetic tone later, appellant stated that he was not apologizing for raping her, but because he still owed her $180. At trial, appellant denied that he raped her and testified they had consensual sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">During a pretrial motion <em>in limine, </em>the Commonwealth moved to admit the testimony of two women who described similar crimes allegedly committed by appellant. At the hearing, the prosecutor acknowledged that the evidence was not offered to show identity. Instead, the Commonwealth stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">[COMMONWEALTH]: Your Honor, I\u2019m seeking to have this evidence admitted to show the conduct of the Defendant towards the victim in this case, and I would ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>THE COURT: Is that intent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">[COMMONWEALTH]: It is intent being that this \u2014 defense \u2014 it\u2019s my belief, -will be based on these statements\u2014 that this is a consensual encounter meaning that she\u2019s ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHA_\">THE COURT: She contracts for this and she is volunteering for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">[COMMONWEALTH]: Absolutely \u2014 and that this would show \u2014 the fact that he has done this not with just Ms. Parrish but with two other escorts that he went there -with the intent of raping her. Under the guise of going there as, you know, sort of a business deal if you will, but he goes there really with the intent \u2014 that\u2019s how he gains access is by making this arrangement for an appointment \u2014 and goes there and immediately jumps upon these women and rapes them and forces himself on them \u2014 that that is his intent is to go there to rape these women, to force himself on them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The trial court allowed the evidence of the similar crimes. A jury convicted appellant of sodomy and rape and sentenced him to a total of twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">On appeal, appellant contends the trial court erred in admitting evidence of similar crimes to show his intent to rape Parrish, because his intent is not an element of the crime charged. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">\u201cThe admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988). However, \u201c[b]y definition, when the trial court makes an error of law, an abuse of discretion occurs.\u201d <em>Bass v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 373, 382, 523 S.E.2d 534, 539 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">Evidence that the accused committed other crimes is generally inadmissible to prove guilt of the crime for which the accused is on trial, even if the other crimes are of the same nature as the crime charged in the indictment. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number><em>Kirkpatrick v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 269, 272, 176 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1970). \u201cThe purpose of this rule is to prevent confusion of offenses, unfair surprise to the defendant and a suggestion of \u2018criminal propensity,\u2019 thus preserving the \u2018presumption of innocence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crump v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 286, 289, 411 S.E.2d 238, 240 (1991) (quoting <em>Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 497, 502, 303 S.E.2d 890, 893 (1983)). However, this general rule \u201cmust sometimes yield to society\u2019s interest in the truth-finding process, and numerous exceptions allow evidence of prior misconduct whenever the legitimate probative value outweighs the incidental prejudice to the accused.\u201d <em>Dunbar v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 387, 390, 512 S.E.2d 823, 825 (1999) (citing <em>Wilkins v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 293, 297, 443 S.E.2d 440, 443 (1994)). Evidence of similar crimes may be admissible to show the intent, or identity of the accused when these are in issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Kirkpatrick, </em>211 Va. at 272, 176 S.E.2d at 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">This case is controlled by the recently decided case of <em>Commonwealth v. Minor, </em>267 Va. 166, 591 S.E.2d 61 (2004). On strikingly similar facts, the Supreme Court held that testimony of prior victims of similar sexual crimes was inadmissible to show the intent of the appellant toward the victim. As in this case, the only issue in dispute at trial was whether the sexual acts were consensual or forced.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addressing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>whether the evidence was admissible to show intent, the Court reasoned that \u201ca defendant\u2019s intent to commit the crime of rape is not the same issue as whether a victim consented to sexual intercourse. Those two issues are distinct and should not be blurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173, 591 S.E.2d at 66. Thus, the Court further held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">\u201cAlthough proof of rape requires proof of intent, <em>the required intent is established upon proof that the accused knowingly and intentionally committed the acts constituting the elements of rape. </em>The elements of rape ... consist of engaging in sexual intercourse with the victim, against her will, by force, threat, or intimidation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-6\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Clifton v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 178, 184, 468 S.E.2d 155, 158 (1996)). The Court in <em>Minor </em>thus recognized that the crime of rape does not require proof that the defendant harbor a specific intent to have intercourse without the victim\u2019s consent, only the general intent evidenced by the act of committing the offense itself. The lack of consent required for rape involves the victim\u2019s mental state, not the defendant\u2019s. <em>See id. </em>The Court also noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">[Ejvidence showing that a defendant committed similar sexual offenses against an individual other than the victim in a particular case is, on occasion, admissible to prove certain contested matters, such as a defendant\u2019s identity or the attitude of a defendant toward a victim, provided the proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>tive value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect. Indeed, if the evidence of other similar offenses had been offered as proof on a contested issue about the defendant\u2019s identity in these offenses, that evidence would likely have been admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 174, 591 S.E.2d at 67 (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The Court thus held that the evidence of other crimes was inadmissible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">In our view, evidence showing that a defendant raped one or more individuals other than the victim in the crime charged is generally not relevant to the question whether that victim did or did not consent to sexual intercourse with the defendant. This is so because the fact that one woman was raped has no tendency to prove that another woman did not consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 175, 591 S.E.2d at 67 (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">The dissent mistakes the requisite elements of the offense of rape. As the Supreme Court stated as long ago as 1886, \u201c[wjhenever there is a carnal connection, and no consent in fact ... there is evidently, in the wrongful act itself, all the force which the law demands as an element of the crime.\u201d <em>Bailey v. Commonwealth, </em>82 Va. 107, 111 (1886). In other words, \u201c[t]o determine whether the element of force has been proved in the crime [of rape], the inquiry is whether the act or acts were effected with or without the victim\u2019s consent.\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 983, 986, 252 S.E.2d 370, 372 (1979). Thus, if the victim did not consent, the specific issue in the instant case, the use of force is shown by the act of non-consensual intercourse itself. Thus, the dissent\u2019s argument that the \u201clack of consent\u201d of the victim equates to a requirement to show the defendant\u2019s \u201cintent\u201d to use force does not track clear Virginia precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the evidence of prior crimes was inadmissible in this case. Evidence of other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>similar crimes is inadmissible to show intent when it is not an element of the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">III. HARMLESS ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The Commonwealth contends that even if the trial judge erred, such error was harmless. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The standard for non-constitutional error is established in Virginia\u2019s harmless error statute, Code \u00a7 8.01-678, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">When it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached, no judgment shall be arrested or reversed ... [f]or any ... defect, imperfection, or omission in the record, or for any error committed on the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Additionally,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">Code \u00a7 8.01-678 has been applied in both criminal and civil cases. In a criminal case, it is implicit that, in order to determine whether there has been a fair trial on the merits and whether substantial justice has been reached, a reviewing court must decide whether the alleged error substantially influenced the jury. If it did not, the error is harmless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-11\"><em>Clay v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 253, 259, 546 S.E.2d 728, 731 (2001) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Our Supreme Court has applied the following standard adopted in <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946), to non-constitutional error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-12\">If, when all is said and done, the conviction is sure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect, the verdict and the judgment should stand____But if one cannot say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>were not affected____If so, or if one is left in grave doubt, the conviction cannot stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 764-65, 66 S.Ct. at 1248 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Applying this standard and Code \u00a7 8.01-678, we cannot say on this record that the trial court\u2019s admission of the testimony of similar crimes was harmless. One of the witnesses, S.B., testified that she was a prostitute and appellant was a \u201cregular customer\u201d who on one occasion acted in a manner similar to that described at trial. She also testified that on other occasions he was \u201cfine.\u201d The second witness, N.S., testified that she was an escort who had arranged a meeting with appellant and was attacked in a manner similar to that alleged in this case. The testimony of the two women was highly prejudicial and encouraged the inference that because appellant committed similar crimes in the past, he likely committed the crimes charged in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Foster v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 316, 320, 362 S.E.2d 745, 747 (1987) (reversible error to admit testimony of other sexual offenses); <em>see also Guill v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 134, 141-42, 495 S.E.2d 489, 493 (1998) (holding that evidence of a prior crime \u201cwas inadmissible and had no probative value,\u201d concluding that the judgment should be reversed because \u201cits admission caused undue prejudice to the defendant\u201d); <em>Donahue v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 145, 156, 300 S.E.2d 768, 774 (1983) (\u201c \u2018Since we have no way of knowing the effect the court\u2019s admission of testimony as to defendant\u2019s prior bad acts ... had upon the minds of the jury, we cannot say that the error was not prejudicial.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Eccles v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 20, 22-23, 197 S.E.2d 332, 333 (1973) (omission in origi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>nal))); <em>Knick v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 103, 105, 421 S.E.2d 479, 481 (1992) (\u201cBecause the jury erroneously heard testimony about the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts, which included assaulting and pulling a gun on his former wife, we cannot say that it plainly appears from the record that defendant has had \u2018 \u201ca fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u201d \u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-6\">. The identity of the accused is not an issue in this case. Appellant admitted at trial there was sexual contact with the victim but said it was consensual.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b429-7\">. The Commonwealth, however, contends that intent was at issue in this case because Gonzales \u201cdenied engaging in sexual intercourse with the victim at all.\u201d The dissent similarly argues that proof of Gonzales\u2019 other crimes should be admissible because, <em>inter alia, </em>Gonzales disputed \u201cwhether the event had occurred.\" However, any such statement that could be construed as a \"denial\u201d was made pretrial and was not the posture of the case at trial. As we have noted, however, \"[i]f evidence of another crime is offered ostensibly to prove intent, <em>it is still not admissible if the actual issue is ... commission of the act itself.\u201d Foster v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 316, 323, 362 S.E.2d 745, 749 (1987) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Henderson v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 125, 129, 360 S.E.2d 876, 878 (1987)); <em>see also Blaylock v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 579, 496 S.E.2d 97 <em>(1998). </em>Here, the fact placed at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>issue by Gonzales\u2019 pretrial statements was \"commission of the act itself,\u201d not whether the act, if committed, was committed intentionally. Thus, the Commonwealth could not use proof of the other alleged crimes \u2014 under the guise of proof of intent \u2014 as a bootstrap for proving that Gonzales committed this particular act. <em>See Foster, </em>5 Va.App. at 320, 362 S.E.2d at 747 (trial court erred in admitting evidence of a separate sexual assault because the evidence \u201cmerely showed that [the defendant] had a propensity to commit this type of crime,\u201d which \"is precisely what the prosecution is not allowed to show in a criminal case\u201d); <em>see also Hill v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 480, 486, 438 S.E.2d 296, 300 (1993) (noting that the nexus between a prior criminal act and the current charge \"must be greater than a basic recitation of the fact that intent is an element of the crime,\u201d reasoning that \"[t]o conclude otherwise is to allow the exception in <em>Kirkpatrick </em>to swallow the general rule\u201d that evidence of prior crimes is inadmissible).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b433-8\">. Indeed, the Commonwealth implicitly conceded during closing arguments that admission of the other women\u2019s testimony would affect the verdict, informing the jury that the other women were called to testify \"because without them, maybe you could say okay, maybe this was a fee dispute. Maybe ... she didn't get the money that she wanted. Maybe this was rough sex. <em>But you know that\u2019s not the case because you heard from them, </em>this is what he does.\u201d (Emphasis added). Additionally, while the dissent rests its assertion that any error was harmless based on the \"numerous and compelling admissions\u201d of the appellant, this misstates the record which is equivocal at best.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b434-7\">McCLANAHAN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ASX\">with whom KELSEY, J., joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\"><em>Commonwealth v. Minor, </em>267 Va. 166, 591 S.E.2d 61 (2004), held that other crimes evidence has no logical bearing on consent, a function of the rape victim\u2019s state of mind. <em>Minor </em>did not hold \u2014 and it specifically disclaimed any intention to hold \u2014 that such evidence can never have any bearing on <em>mens rea, </em>a function of the rapist\u2019s state of mind. By conflating the two, the majority has done just what <em>Minor </em>said could not be done. They have \u201cblurred\u201d two \u201cdistinct\u201d concepts \u2014 the defendant\u2019s intent and the victim\u2019s consent. <em>Id. </em>at 173, 591 S.E.2d at 66. As a consequence, the evidentiary admissibility principles are likewise confused.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">There being no <em>per se </em>bar to the use of other crimes evidence on the issue of intent, the question presented then becomes whether the trial judge abused her discretion in admitting the evidence under the unique facts of this case. I do not believe she did. The prosecutor offered the evidence to show the defendant\u2019s intent to use force. The other crimes evidence showed a similar pattern of intent to use force. These factual similarities in the use of force take the proof of other crimes outside the maxim prohibiting its use as mere propensity evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">In any event, the great weight of the evidence before the jury renders harmless any ostensible error in admitting the other crimes evidence. The defendant admitted to raping the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>victim. Though he tried to later claim otherwise, his admissions and the victim\u2019s consistent description of the rape likely-left the jury with an irrepressible conviction of his guilt. Under the governing harmless error standard for non-constitutional error, the defendant\u2019s conviction should not be overturned even if the trial court erred in admitting the contested other crimes evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">I. Minor Does Not Preclude Evidence of Prior Bad Acts or Crimes on the Issue of Defendant\u2019s Intent to Use Force, Threat or Intimidation</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">A. <em>The Victim\u2019s Consent Is Not the Same Issue as the Defendant\u2019s Intent to Use Force, Threat or Intimidation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">An accused cannot \u201cintend\u201d consent or non-consent o'n the part of the victim, but he can intend to use force.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The majority cites no cases where evidence of intent to use force, threat or intimidation was inadmissible where that element of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>the crime was at issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, most appellate courts allow it, notwithstanding its potential misuse for other purposes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>In Virginia, lack of consent and force/threat/intimidation are separate elements of rape. In any case where rape is charged, the Commonwealth must establish 1) that the defendant had sexual intercourse with the victim; 2) that it was against her will and without her consent; and 3) that it was by force, threat or intimidation. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A). <em>See also </em>Virginia Model Jury Instructions, Criminal Instruction No. 644.100 (\u201cThe Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the following elements of [rape]: (1) That the defendant [had sexual intercourse with (name of person), who was not then the defendant\u2019s spouse; caused (name of person) to engage in sexual intercourse with another person]; and (2) That it was against her will and without her consent; and (3) That it was by force, threat or intimidation.\u201d) In this case, the evidence of Gonzales\u2019s prior bad acts was offered on the issue of whether Gonzales had the intent to commit the crime with force, threat or intimidation. In seeking to have the evidence admitted, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aek\">[T]his would show \u2014 the fact that he has done this not with just Ms. Parrish but with two other escorts that he went there with the intent of raping her.

In <em>Minor, </em>the only issue in dispute at trial was whether the sexual acts were consensual. In contrast, in the case at bar, from before the time of his arrest, Gonzales\u2019s numerous statements regarding the act of intercourse and use of force were neither consistent nor clear. Gonzales put his intent to use force, threat or intimidation at issue when he told the police and later testified that he went to the complainant\u2019s apartment for a massage with no plans for sexual contact, but that he eventually relented upon her suggestion to have intercourse.

In this case, however, the Commonwealth did not offer the evidence to assert \u201conce a rapist, always a rapist.\u201d Instead, the prosecution used it to point out the strikingly similar uses of force, threat or intimidation in the earlier incidents and the one then before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">These factual similarities would make the evidence usable for purposes of showing identity, an issue not in contest here. But that does not preclude its use to show the defendant\u2019s intent to use force. <em>See People v. James, </em>62 Cal.App.3d 399, 132 Cal.Rptr. 888, 891-92 (1976) (\u201cAppellant argues that common scheme relates to identity, which is not at issue in this case since appellant admits the acts charged and denies only the lack of consent of [the victim]. If this were the only reason for introducing evidence of common scheme, appellant would be correct that it is inadmissible where identity is not at issue. <em>Similarity of method may go to more than identity, however; it may also be used to show intent.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). As we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">Although the admissibility of evidence showing <em>modus operandi </em>has generally been viewed as a means of proving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>identity of a crime\u2019s perpetrator.... We see no reason, however, to limit the admissibility of evidence showing <em>modus operandi </em>to the purpose of proving identity. When evidence of idiosyncratic similarities in an accused\u2019s mode of attack exists and constitutes a logical connection with the crime charged, such evidence may be admitted for the purpose of establishing, by inference, the accused\u2019s <em>intent, </em>motive, malice, premeditation, or the accused\u2019s feelings toward the victim, as well as the perpetrator\u2019s identity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><em>Shifflett v.

He demanded from each substantially similar sexual acts. Afterwards, the defendant would apologize. The trial court heard the details of the prosecutor\u2019s proffer, as well as the evidence as it was introduced, and found the similarities sufficient to rationally relate each incident into a parallel pattern of force, threat or intimidation. Nothing in <em>Minor </em>suggests the trial court erred in doing so. <em>Minor </em>specifically distinguishes the use of this type of evidence for the purpose of showing whether the victim consented from whether the \u201caccused knowingly and intentionally committed ... rape ... by force, threat, or intimidation.\u201d <em>Minor, </em>267 Va. at 173, 591 S.E.2d at 66 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>II. The Crime of Rape</p>\n<p id=\"ACC\">A. <em>The Elements of Rape</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The common law defined rape as \u201cthe carnal knowledge of a woman forcibly and against her will.\u201d 4 William Blackstone, <em>Commentaries on the Law of England </em>*210 (1769); <em>see generally </em>Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Criminal Law </em>7.18, at 752-53 (3d ed.2000). In Code \u00a7 18.2-61, the Virginia legislature codified force, threat or intimidation as an element of rape. In pertinent part, that code section reads: \u201cA. If any person has sexual intercourse ... against the complaining witness\u2019s will, by force, threat or intimidation of or against the complaining witness or another person, ... he or she shall be guilty of rape.\u201d The rape statute requires not merely that the victim withhold consent, but that the accused coerce the victim\u2019s decision through the use of force, threat, or intimidation. <em>See Spencer v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 275, 283, 384 S.E.2d 775, 779 (1989) (\u201cRape is defined as \u2018sexual intercourse with a female by force and against her will.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Tuggle v.

Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 9, 16, 553 S.E.2d 533, 537 (2001) (\u201cIn order to find appellant guilty of rape under Code \u00a7 18.2-61(A)(i), the evidence must support a finding that the sexual intercourse was accomplished against the victim\u2019s will \u2018by force, threat or intimidation.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 118, 128-29, 428 S.E.2d 34, 42 (1993) (holding that defendant could be punished for more than one count of rape where the acts constituted \u201c \u2018separate acts of force\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>People v. Harrison, </em>48 Cal.3d 321, 256 Cal.Rptr. 401, 768 P.2d 1078, 1088 (1989))). It has long been the law that the very physical<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>ity of the act of noneonsensual intercourse can, depending on the circumstances, permit a reasonable inference of force, threat or intimidation. As the majority states, in such cases, the \u201cwrongful act itself\u2019 provides \u201call the force which the law demands as an element of the crime.\u201d <em>Bailey v. Commonwealth, </em>82 Va. 107, 111 (1886); <em>see also Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 983, 986, 252 S.E.2d 370, 372 (1979). In short, proof of non-consent may permit a reasonable inference of force, threat or intimidation. The absence of one implies the presence of the other. The reason the law allows that inference, though, is not because force/threat/intimidation is <em>not </em>an element of the crime, but because it is. If it were not relevant, we would not need to presume it \u2014 we could simply ignore it altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">B. <em>Specific Intent Crimes vs. General Intent Crimes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">By rejecting the trial court\u2019s reasoning, the majority implies that other crimes evidence is only admissible to show intent to commit a specific intent crime, not to prove a general intent crime such as rape or forcible sodomy. It has never been supposed in law that evidence of specific intent is inadmissible to prove a general intent crime. No citation can be offered for that <em>non sequitur. </em>Merely because rape is a general intent crime does not make specific intent evidence inadmissible. 1 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 5.2(a), at 340-41 (2d ed.2003), P. Lowe, J. Jeffries, Jr., R. Boone, <em>Criminal Law: Cases and Materials </em>232 (1982); <em>see also United States v. Hooton, </em>662 F.2d 628, 635 (9th Cir.1981) (\u201cMoreover, even in general intent crimes, the government can offer evidence of other acts as part of its case-in-chief when it is obvious that the defense will raise lack of intent as a defense.\u201d (citation omitted)). \u201c[T]he distinction between specific intent and general intent is of little help in deciding when intent is really an issue. All crimes other than those imposing strict liability require a degree of culpability, either knowledge, intent, recklessness, or willfulness.\u201d <em>United States v. Adderly, </em>529 F.2d 1178, 1181 (5th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Virginia courts have never held that because rape is a general intent crime, specific intent evidence is inadmissible, and other courts have expressly rejected such a limitation. <em>See United States v. Hatfield, </em>815 F.2d 1068, 1072 (6th Cir. 1987); <em>Hooton, </em>662 F.2d at 635; <em>Adderly, </em>529 F.2d at 1180; <em>State v. Synoracki, </em>253 Kan. 59, 853 P.2d 24, 32 (1993); <em>State v. Elliott, </em>352 N.C. 663, 535 S.E.2d 32 (2000) (reversing <em>State v. Elliott, </em>137 N.C.App. 282, 528 S.E.2d 32, 32 (2000), for the reasons given in the dissent). In fact, Virginia law has employed an \u201cinclusionary approach\u201d to the uncharged misconduct doctrine, admitting such evidence \u201cif relevant for any purpose <em>other than </em>to show a mere propensity or disposition on the part of the defendant to commit the crime.\u201d Kent Sinclair, Joseph C. Kearfott, Paul F. Sheridan <em>&amp; </em>Edward J. Imwinkelried, <em>Virginia Evidentiary Foundations </em>\u00a7 6.4[A], at 165 (1998) (emphasis in original). Intent is an issue in this case and the classification of rape as a general intent crime does not make the prior bad acts evidence of Gonzales\u2019s intent to use force on the victim irrelevant or inadmissible. Because Gonzales put his intent to use force, threat or intimidation at issue, the Commonwealth could employ the evidence of his prior bad acts to show his intent to use force, threat or intimidation in raping the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">III. Harmless Error</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Even if the trial court erred in admitting the disputed evidence, the error is harmless. Code \u00a7 8.01-678 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0D\">When it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached, no judgment shall be arrested or reversed ... [f]or any ... defect, imperfection, or omission in the record, or for any error committed on the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-7\"><em>See generally Clay v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 253, 259, 546 S.E.2d 728, 731 (2001) (observing that essential question is whether \u201cerror substantially influenced the jury\u201d). This test parallels the federal standard for non-constitutional error, which focuses on whether the error \u201chad substantial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v.

The evidence of Gonzales\u2019s guilt was so overwhelming, and the weight of the disputed testimony so slight in comparison, that the alleged error did not affect the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See McLean v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 200, 211, 527 S.E.2d 443, 448 (2000). \u201cThe admissibility of evidence is with the court, but its weight is wholly with the jury.\u201d <em>W.S. Forbes &amp; Co. v.

Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). \u201cOn appeal this court must \u2018discard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and <em>all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (citation omitted and emphasis in original). The victim offered a consistent account of the rape and sodomy that she claimed occurred, and that account was bolstered by Gonzales\u2019s numerous and compelling admissions that he raped and sodomized the victim. In a recorded exchange between Gonzales and the victim, which was introduced at trial, he expressed remorse, offered apologies, and requested the victim\u2019s forgiveness. During that exchange, he admitted at least four times that he raped the victim. He said that he had called a rape crisis hotline. When the victim asked Gonzales if raping her helped him in some way, he stated, \u201cat that particular time it probably helped me. Yeah, it probably helped me to release my anger, I guess, emotionally.\u201d He admitted that he raped the victim as an \u201cemotional outlet\u201d because his girlfriend \u201cwas deceiving\u201d him. He admitted to the victim, \u201cI am sorry for raping you.\u201d A short time later, he again admitted to the victim, \u201cI am very sorry for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>raping you.\u201d He said he \u201cfelt sorry\u201d after he left her apartment, and had feared she \u201cwas going to call the police\u201d over the incident. When the victim asked when Gonzales had decided to rape her, Gonzales said, \u2018When did I decide? It was just, um, when I saw you, I guess.\u201d The victim also asked Gonzales if he raped her because of his lack of money or over his anger or because of her appearance. He replied: \u201cI think it was probably. It was probably more a combination of all those things.\u201d When the victim asked, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you just, you know, ask me to sleep with you, rather than you know, slamming the door shut and hitting me and ripping off my panties?\u201d Gonzales answered, \u201cWhy not? I had \u2014 it was very hard for me because I \u2014 I thought, well, you\u2019d resist me.\u201d When the victim countered that she had, in fact, resisted him, Gonzales said, \u201cYeah, you did.\u201d Later, when interviewed by the police, Gonzales stated he slapped the victim because she didn\u2019t want to give him oral sex. At trial, when asked about his apologetic tone during the phone call, appellant stated that he \u201cpreferred\u201d to apologize for raping her rather than \u201cto send her the money\u201d he still owed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Gonzales\u2019s numerous statements and admissions, as well as the consistency of the victim\u2019s account of the event, lead ineluctably to the conclusion that the verdict was not affected by the claimed error. When other evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt is overwhelming, error may be deemed harmless. <em>See Bond v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 534, 539, 311 S.E.2d 769, 772 (1984). I would therefore affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b435-9\">. A Supreme Court of Pennsylvania case is particularly instructive on this point. In <em>Commonwealth v. Berkowitz, </em>537 Pa. 143, 641 A.2d 1161, 1164-65 (1994), a conviction^ of rape was reversed because there was insufficient evidence of \u201cforcible compulsion.\u201d The Court held the complainant\u2019s repeated statement of \u201cno\u201d during sexual intercourse with the accused was \"only relevant to the issue of consent,\" but \"not relevant to the issue of force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1164. Though her non-consent to the encounter was strongly supported by the evidence, a conviction for rape could not be sustained where \"the weight of his body on top of her was the only force applied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such \"force\u201d alone was deemed insufficient to establish the requisite amount of force for that element of rape. However, there was enough evidence to support a conviction for indecent assault, which required proof of non-consent but not proof of force. <em>Id. </em>at 1165-66. That case illustrates that consent and force are two distinct elements of the crime of rape. Intercourse can be accomplished by force, but not be considered rape if there was consent. Likewise, intercourse can be accomplished without consent but will not be rape, if force is absent, i.e., the accused may be guilty of a lower grade sexual offense. The Pennsylvania court stated that the legislature\u2019s choice to include a force element in the definition of rape must be interpreted to mean that the crime requires something more than a lack of consent. <em>Id. </em>at 1164-65. (Pennsylvania has adopted the Model Penal Code, whereas Virginia has not. However, the legal inquiry into the crime of rape remains substantially similar in both jurisdictions.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b436-5\">. \"Frequently, evidence that is inadmissible under a general rule of evidence is admissible under an exception to the general rule or under another rule.\u201d <em>Satterfield v.

When the Commonwealth is required to prove a crime of multiple elements, lack of evidence on one element does not render evidence on another element inadmissible. The chief question in virtually every case decided on the relevance of prior bad acts or crimes is whether the Commonwealth\u2019s proffered evidence tended to prove any relevant element of the offense charged. <em>See, e.g., Goins v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 442, 462, 470 S.E.2d 114, 127 (1996); <em>Woodfin v. Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 89, 95, 372 S.E.2d 377, 380-81 (1988); <em>Burley v.
