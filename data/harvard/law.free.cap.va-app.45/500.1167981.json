Barrs, wife, appeals a decision of the trial court reducing her spousal support from $8,000 per month to $6,000 per month. On appeal, she contends the trial court erred (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>in not granting her Motion for Summary Judgment; (2) in finding there has been a material change in circumstances; and (3) in denying her request for attorney\u2019s fees. For the reasons stated, we reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The facts are essentially uncontroverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Husband and wife were divorced in 1995. The final decree, entered August 25, 1995, awarded wife $1,248,870 as the marital award, with $248,870 payable on or before December 31, 1995, and thereafter $100,000 per year for ten years with interest at 9%. In addition to the annual installments of $100,000, wife received the following interest payments: 1996, $90,000; 1997, $81,000; 1998, $63,000; 1999, $54,000; 2000, $45,000; 2001, $36,000; 2002, $72,000; 2003, $27,000. The total principal and interest paid under the marital award was $1,516,870. The final decree also awarded wife $8,000 per month as spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Wife has suffered from multiple sclerosis since 1974. The disease is marked by balance and coordination problems, fatigue, seizures, and progressive diminution of intellectual capacity. As the illness progresses, she will need \u201cassisted living.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">During the marriage, the parties enjoyed quite a high standard of living, extensive vacations, a large waterfront house, a boat, and other indicia of financial success. At the time of the divorce, husband earned $250,000 per year. Wife was unemployed.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">In 2003, husband filed a \u201cNotice and Motion to Terminate or Amend Spousal Support.\u201d Wife filed an answer alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that she continued to need spousal support \u201cas her financial requirements have changed dramatically.\u201d After extensive discovery, wife filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court conducted a number of hearings on the various motions, and denied the motion for summary judgment on February 19, 2004, implicitly ruling there were genuine issues of fact in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Husband conceded at the April 1, 2004 hearing that he has the ability to pay the current award of spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Wife testified she had diminished her standard of living. She sold her large waterfront home in favor of a smaller apartment. She reduced her travel, partially because of her illness. Wife further testified the progressive and debilitating nature of her illness would ultimately require her to live in an assisted living facility. However, she had no immediate plans to do so. The trial court opined that wife is not \u201cliving beyond the standard of living established during the marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">At the hearing, husband argued the material change in circumstances was that wife now has $60,000 annual passive income and her net worth exceeds $1.6 million that she did not have in 1995. Wife responded by asserting that when the original marital award was made in 1995, the trial court, at that time, knew the $1,248,870 award would generate passive income. Interest the first year was $90,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Wife also asked for attorney\u2019s fees, which the trial court denied. Wife proffered the fees would be $13,658.66.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">For the purposes of appeal, wife concedes in her brief that her current monthly expenses are $9,752. Her passive income is $5,203 per month. Husband\u2019s expert witness, Michael Mares, CPA, testified wife would only need $6,000 spousal support per month to pay her current monthly expenses, without requiring her to invade the principal of her investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The trial court found a material change in circumstances and, following Mr. Mares\u2019 testimony, reduced spousal support to $6,000 per month, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">So I do find there is a material change in circumstances. I believe that one thing, we have Mrs. Barrs\u2019 passive income, unearned income I should say of $5,200 a month. That\u2019s a difference] since the last support order. And I have considered the factors listed in 20-107.1, I\u2019m obligated to consider those, which in Factor No. 1, the obligations, needs and financial resources of the parties, including but not limited to the income from pension, profit sharing or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>retirement plans, of whatever nature; No. 2, the standard of living established during the marriage, and No. 8, the provisions made with regard to the marital property under 20-107.3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">I. CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Wife contends the trial court erred by finding there has been a material change in circumstances since the final decree of 1995. More narrowly, the issue is whether wife\u2019s receipt of $5,203 per month as passive income from the principal of the equitable distribution award is such a change in circumstances.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">\u201cUpon petition of either party, a court may ... [modify] ... spousal support ... as the circumstances may make proper.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-109. \u201cThe moving party in a petition for modification of support is required to prove both a material change in circumstances and that this change warrants a modification of support.\u201d <em>Schoenwetter v. Schoenwetter, </em>8 Va.App. 601, 605, 383 S.E.2d 28, 30 (1989); <em>Furr v. Furr, </em>13 Va.App. 479, 481, 413 S.E.2d 72, 73 (1992); <em>see also Blank v. Blank, </em>10 Va.App. 1, 4, 389 S.E.2d 723, 724 (1990) (holding that spousal support must be redetermined if necessary in light of new circumstances). The material change in circumstances must have occurred after the most recent judicial review of the award, <em>see Hiner v. Hadeed, </em>15 Va.App. 575, 577, 425 S.E.2d 811, 812 (1993), and \u201cmust bear upon the financial needs of the dependent spouse or the ability of the supporting spouse to pay.\u201d <em>Hollowell v. Hollowell, </em>6 Va.App. 417, 419, 369 S.E.2d 451, 452 (1988). \u201cThe \u2018circumstances\u2019 which make \u2018proper\u2019 an increase, reduction or cessation of spousal support under Code \u00a7 20-109 are financial and economic ones.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419, 369 S.E.2d at 452-53.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">On appeal, the trial court\u2019s findings must be accorded great deference. <em>See Bandas v. Bandas, </em>16 Va.App. 427, 432, 430 S.E.2d 706, 708 (1993). \u201cIn determining whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>credible evidence exists, the appellate court does not retry the facts, reweigh the preponderance of the evidence, or make its own determination of the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>Wagner Enters., Inc. v. Brooks, </em>12 Va.App. 890, 894, 407 S.E.2d 32, 35 (1991). \u201cWe will not disturb the trial court\u2019s decision where it is based on an <em>ore tenus </em>hearing, unless it is \u2018plainly wrong or without evidence in the record to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Furr, </em>13 Va.App. at 481, 413 S.E.2d at 73 (quoting <em>Schoenwetter, </em>8 Va.App. at 605, 383 S.E.2d at 30).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-5\"><em>Moreno v. Moreno, </em>24 Va.App. 190, 195, 480 S.E.2d 792, 794-95 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Thus, the moving party has to prove: (1) a material change in circumstances; and (2) the change warrants a modification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our inquiry then is whether the trial court\u2019s finding that wife\u2019s receipt of the $5,203 passive income was a material change in circumstances is \u201cplainly wrong and without evidence to support it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Husband relies on the facts of <em>Moreno </em>to support his position that there is a material change in wife\u2019s circumstances. In <em>Moreno, </em>husband filed a motion to terminate spousal support, and argued, in part, that his retirement created a change in financial circumstances that adversely impacted his ability to meet his spousal support obligation. 24 Va.App. at 193, 480 S.E.2d at 794. The Court engaged in a lengthy discussion of the relationship between Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-107-1 (equitable distribution) and 20-107.3 (spousal support), and determined that the trial court properly reduced the husband\u2019s spousal support obligation based upon a change in husband\u2019s financial circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 205-06, 480 S.E.2d at 800. The facts in <em>Moreno </em>involved husband\u2019s income from a pension, his voluntary retirement to Thailand, and his prohibition from working in that country. Because <em>Moreno </em>did not address whether interest from a marital award was foresee<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>able, we find no guidance from <em>Moreno </em>in resolving the narrow issue presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The uncontroverted evidence is that when the trial court entered the final decree, wife was awarded $1,248,870 as her share of the marital estate, to be paid in installments. The first payment of $248,870 was due and payable on or before December 31, 1995. The remainder was payable $100,000 per year for 10 years at an interest rate of 9% per year. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3, the trial court then awarded $8,000 per month as spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The trial court, citing <em>Rowe v. Rowe, </em>24 Va.App. 123, 480 S.E.2d 760 (1997), correctly stated that it \u201cmust consider the ... income generating potential of the marital award as well as the marital award as well as any other income and expenses generated by the equitable distribution award.\u201d While we agree with the trial court\u2019s analysis, the facts show that the original equitable distribution award would clearly generate a steady and foreseeable stream of income for wife. Code \u00a7 20-107.1 requires a fact finder to consider the \u201cprovisions made with regard to the marital property under Code \u00a7 20-107.3.\u201d Thus, an award of spousal support must be made in light of the financial result of the equitable distribution award. <em>Gamble v. Gamble, </em>14 Va.App. 558, 577, 421 S.E.2d 635, 646 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The trial court, by virtue of its own order, knew wife would receive $248,870 within four months of the award of spousal support. The trial court also knew that in addition to the $100,000 per year principal payments, wife would receive interest payments as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">1996: $90,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqLT\">1997: $81,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASn\">1998: $63,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-hz\">1999: $54,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYn\">2000: $45,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-0\">2001: $36,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am_9\">2002: $72,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>2008: $27,000</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">We therefore conclude, at the time of the 1995 award of spousal support, passive income to the wife in the form of interest on the marital award was foreseeable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">In <em>Srinivasan v. Srinivasan </em>[, 10 Va.App. 728, 396 S.E.2d 675 (1990) ], this Court held that, in setting support awards, a court \u201cmust look to current circumstances and what the circumstances will be \u201cwithin the immediate or reasonably foreseeable future,\u2019 not to what may happen in the future.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at] 735, 396 S.E.2d [at] 679 (quoting <em>Young v. Young, </em>3 Va.App. 80, 81-82, 348 S.E.2d 46, 47 (1986)). What is \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d depends on the circumstances of the particular case. Thus, when reviewing an appeal from a denial of an increase in support, this Court looks to objective evidence available at the time of the previous award of support in order to assess what increases in expenses might reasonably have been expected. In doing so, we avoid assessing such increases in light of evidence that these increases have, in fact, occurred. \u201c\u2018[S]pousal support awards must be determined in light of contemporary circumstances and ... redetermined [if necessary] in light of new circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blank v. Blank, </em>10 Va.App. 1, 4, 389 S.E.2d 723, 724 (1990) (quoting <em>Jacobs v. Jacobs, </em>219 Va. 993, 995, 254 S.E.2d 56, 58 (1979)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqc\"><em>Furr, </em>13 Va.App. at 482, 413 S.E.2d at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">At the time of the modification hearing, wife\u2019s passive income was $5,203 per month, or $62,436 per year. Yet, her passive income, from interest alone, in 1996 was $90,000. It was only in 1999 that her passive income fell below the $62,436.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the wife\u2019s receipt of the passive income from the marital award constituted a change in circumstances is plainly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>II. ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The trial court denied wife\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. Husband argues that wife\u2019s appeal of this issue is barred by Rule 5A:18 because wife failed to reference any attorney\u2019s fees in her endorsement of the final decree. We find that the issue was preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">By wife specifically requesting attorney\u2019s fees in both the May 25, 2004 and June 10, 2004 hearings, wife made her request known to the trial court. Code \u00a7 8.01-384(A) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">No party, after having made an objection or motion known to the court, shall be required to make such objection or motion again in order to preserve his right to appeal, challenge, or move for reconsideration of, a ruling, order, or action of the court. No party shall be deemed to have agreed to, or acquiesced in, any written order of a trial court so as to forfeit his right to contest such order on appeal except by express written agreement in his endorsement of the order. Arguments made at trial via written pleading, memorandum, recital of objections in a final order, oral argument reduced to transcript, or agreed written statements of facts shall, unless expressly withdrawn or waived, be deemed preserved therein for assertion on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Having made the oral motion for attorney\u2019s fees in two separate hearings, the wife was not required to restate her position in the final court order in order to preserve this issue for our review. <em>See Weidman v. Babcock, </em>241 Va. 40, 44, 400 S.E.2d 164, 167 (1991) (\u201cThe main purpose of requiring timely specific objections is to afford the trial court an opportunity to rule intelligently on the issues presented, thus avoiding unnecessary appeals and reversals.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">Wife claims that the trial court abused its discretion in not awarding her attorney\u2019s fees. An award of attorney\u2019s fees is a matter submitted to the sound discretion of the trial court and is reviewable on appeal only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Graves v. Graves, </em>4 Va.App. 326, 333, 357 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>554, 558 (1987). The key to a proper award of counsel fees is reasonableness under all the circumstances. <em>McGinnis v. McGinnis, </em>1 Va.App. 272, 277, 388 S.E.2d 159, 162 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">While the trial court did not articulate the reasons for denying attorney\u2019s fees, the record reflects that both parties had substantial resources to pay their respective attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Artis v. Artis, </em>4 Va.App. 132, 138, 354 S.E.2d 812, 815 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The trial court found that both sides presented the trial court with arguments supported by the law and evidence. <em>See Jones v. Davis, </em>43 Va.App. 9, 595 S.E.2d 501 (2004). Under these circumstances, we cannot find the denial of attorney\u2019s fees was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">III. DEFAULTED ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Wife, by hand, endorsed the final July 23, 2004 order as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">Seen and objected to as stated to the Court on 11/14/03, 2/19/04, 4/1/04, 5/25/04, and 6/7/04.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The evidence faded to show any change of circumstances, which were proper for a change in spousal support. This was the sole issue before the court but we respectfully suggest that the court did not understand the sole issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">The typed objection read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-11\">HAVE SEEN AND OBJECT TO A FINDING THAT THERE IS A MATERIAL CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT A REDUCTION IN SUPPORT IS JUSTIFIED BASED ON THE RECORD AND APPLICABLE LAW.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">We find these issues are defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">At the conclusion of the June 10, 2004 hearing, the trial court gave wife\u2019s counsel an opportunity to preserve wife\u2019s \u201cexceptions\u201d for the record. Counsel denied the court\u2019s invita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>tion, indicating, \u201cI\u2019m just going to say exceptions as noted at trial of the case and so I will rely on those without having to recite them all over again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">However, wife did not comply with Rule 5A:20(C) which requires, in the opening brief, \u201ca statement of the questions presented with a clear and exact reference to the page(s) of the transcript, written statement, record, or appendix where each question was preserved in the trial court.\u201d Wife only referred to objections stated in four particular hearings without making reference to \u201cthe page(s) of the transcript ... record or appendix where each question was preserved in the trial court.\u201d \u201c[W]e will not search the record for errors in order to interpret the appellant\u2019s contention and correct deficiencies in a brief.\u201d <em>Buchanan v. Buchanan, </em>14 Va.App. 53, 56, 415 S.E.2d 237, 239 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Wife\u2019s endorsement of the order objecting to the court\u2019s finding that a material change in circumstances has occurred preserved that issue. However, one of the subparts<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of that issue is defaulted. Because wife did not comply with Rule 5A:20(C), we cannot determine if those issues were preserved pursuant to Rule 5A:18.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">We find that the trial court erred in concluding that the wife\u2019s receipt of passive income from the marital award consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>tuted a change in circumstances. As to that portion of the trial court\u2019s order, we reverse and remand for the trial court to enter an order consistent with this opinion. All other aspects of the court\u2019s order remain in effect.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-8\">. The second prong was not argued below nor ruled on by the trial court. This issue was not addressed on appeal. We will not consider this prong. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-10\">.

The subpart contends the trial court erred in:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">Retroactively imposing a burden upon the appellant to expend all her monthly income from all sources or risk a reduction of spousal support without regard for the appellant\u2019s financial decisions as to lifestyle and long term financial planning.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b560-11\">. Rule 5A: 18:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-12\">No ruling of the trial court or the Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission will be considered as a. basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice. A mere statement that the judgment or award is contrary to the law and the evidence is not sufficient to constitute a question to be ruled upon on appeal.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b561-13\">. Wife also contends that the trial court erred in denying her motion for summary judgment. Because we hold the trial court plainly erred in modifying wife\u2019s spousal support, we need not address wife's earlier summary judgment motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b561-6\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Alk\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">I concur in Parts II and III of the Analysis portion of the majority opinion. For the reasons that follow, I do not join in Part I. Although I believe the evidence proved a change in circumstances, I believe the change was not material. Therefore, I would also reverse the trial judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">\u201cUpon the petition of either party the court may increase ... spousal support and maintenance ... as the circumstances may make proper.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-109. \u201cThe party moving for a modification of support payments must prove \u2018both a material change in circumstances and that this change warrants a modification of support.\u2019 \u201d <em>Furr v. Furr, </em>13 Va.App. 479, 481, 413 S.E.2d 72, 73 (1992). \u201cWhether a change of circumstances exists is a factual finding that will not be disturbed on appeal if the finding is supported by credible evidence.\u201d <em>Visikides v. Derr, </em>3 Va.App. 69, 70, 348 S.E.2d 40, 41 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">As the majority indicates, the issue in this case is whether the evidence proved a material change in circumstances. In determining that a material change in circumstances had occurred, the trial judge looked at the objective circumstances as they existed at the time the initial spousal support was fixed. He found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">So I do find there is a material change in circumstances. I believe that one thing, we have [the wife\u2019s] passive income, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>unearned income I should say of $5,200 a month. That\u2019s a difference] since the last support order. And I have considered the factors listed in [Code \u00a7 ] 20-107.1, I\u2019m obligated to consider those, which in Factor No. 1, the obligations, needs and financial resources of the parties, including but not limited to the income from pension, profit sharing or retirement plans, of whatever nature; No. 2, the standard of living established during the marriage, and No. 8, the provisions made with regard to the marital property under [Code \u00a7 ] 20-107.3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The trial judge correctly found that this earning on the wife\u2019s invested assets did not exist in 1995. Indeed, in 1995, when a trial judge made this spousal support award, he had no basis to know what the wife\u2019s unearned income on her invested assets would be in 2003. Had he attempted to factor into the spousal support award such a speculative assumption about earned income on her invested assets nine years into the future, he would have committed error. \u201cPreviously, ... we have held that the court, in setting support awards, must look to current circumstances and what the circumstances will be \u2018within the immediate or reasonably foreseeable future,\u2019 not to what may happen in the future.\u201d <em>Srinivasan v. Srinivasan, </em>10 Va.App. 728, 735, 396 S.E.2d 675, 679 (1990).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">The courts of this Commonwealth are empowered to assess spousal support awards, not to penalize or reward either party to the marriage contract, but rather to do equity between the two and to protect society\u2019s interests in the incidents of the marital relationship____ The balance must be struck and awards made \u201cupon the basis of the circumstances disclosed by the evidence at the time of the award.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Thomas, </em>217 Va. 502, 505, 229 S.E.2d 887, 889-90 (1976). Code \u00a7 20-109 grants courts continuing jurisdiction to modify awards \u201cwhere changed circumstances are demonstrated.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">This statutory scheme recognizes that comparative needs and capacities change as circumstances change, that changes are not fairly predictable, and that <em>spousal support awards must be determined in light of contemporary cir</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number><em>cumstances and then, if necessary, redetermined in light of new circumstances.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\"><em>Jacobs v. Jacobs, 219 </em>Va. 993, 995, 254 S.E.2d 56, 57-58 (1979) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The wife argues that the parties and the trial judge should have foreseen that the corpus of her invested assets would eventually produce some unearned income. Even if that is the case, neither the parties nor the trial judge could have predicted in 1995 what those earnings would be in 2003 or in the future. Just because a party could have foreseen an eventual change in an asset, we cannot say the party or the judge should have predicted the \u201cfull cost\u201d resulting from the change. <em>See Furr, </em>13 Va.App. at 483, 413 S.E.2d at 75. It is precisely for this reason that Code \u00a7 20-109 authorizes the trial judge to \u201cincrease, decrease, or terminate the amount or duration of any spousal support and maintenance that may thereafter accrue, whether previously or hereafter awarded, as the circumstances may make proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The income generated by a party\u2019s assets is a financial resource that a trial judge properly considers in assessing a change in circumstances and in determining spousal support. <em>See Moreno v. Moreno, </em>24 Va.App. 190, 198, 480 S.E.2d 792, 796 (1997). The trial judge\u2019s finding in this case that the wife\u2019s \u201cpassive income, unearned income ... of $5,200 a month ... [is] different since the last support order\u201d is supported by the evidence and is not plainly wrong. Nothing in this record suggests that the trial judge fixed the spousal support award in 1995 based upon a speculative assumption that in 2003 the wife\u2019s invested assets would total $1,605,706.87 or that those assets would generate $60,000 in passive, unearned income in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">I believe, however, that this change in circumstances was not shown to be material. Not every change in circumstances is material. <em>Head v. Head, </em>24 Va.App. 166, 174-75, 480 S.E.2d 780, 784-85 (1997). \u201c\u2018Material\u2019 is defined as \u2018[o]f such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>nature that knowledge of the item would affect a person\u2019s decision-making process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Montgomery Mutual Insurance v. Riddle, </em>266 Va. 539, 543, 587 S.E.2d 513, 515 (2003) (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>991 (7th ed.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The wife contends the trial judge erred by \u201cfailing] ... to acknowledge ... that the 1995 trial court clearly understood that the [wife] would be receiving ongoing significant unearned monthly income on her $1,248,870 equitable distribution award, in addition to her $8,000 monthly spousal support.\u201d The record establishes, however, that when the judge made the spousal support award in 1995, the wife did not receive the monetary award in a lump sum. Instead, the trial judge ordered the husband to satisfy the monetary award by paying the wife $243,163.25 in 1995 and the balance in yearly installments of $100,000 at nine percent interest. No evidence in this record establishes that in 1995 the wife had invested assets or that either party proved any facts concerning the wife\u2019s unearned income on her invested assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The wife also argues that the trial judge \u201cclearly anticipated\u201d the wife would receive unearned income in 1995, and she points to an exhibit that details the installment payments the husband was required to make so as to satisfy the monetary award and the nine percent interest the husband was to pay on the deferred installment payments. I agree that in 1995 the trial judge was aware that she would receive these interest payments for the next ten years. Those interest payments, which compensated the wife for the deferred receipt of the balance of the monetary award, reflect various ingredients. \u201cThe basic function of interest is to protect the time value of the sum awarded from the eroding impact of inflation on its relative purchasing power, and offset the loss of value to a party who does not take the property awarded at the time of the award.\u201d <em>Votzmeyer v. Votzmeyer, </em>964 S.W.2d 315, 321 (Tex.App.1998). <em>See also Reese v. Reese, </em>696 N.E.2d 460, 463 (Ind.App.1998) (holding that \u201c[ijnterest represents the time value of money. Interest is compensation to a property owner for the loss of use of his property.\u201d). In addition, interest on owed money also has a component that represents the price <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>the debtor party pays for the use of money. <em>Owens v. Bank of Glade Spring, </em>195 Va. 1138, 1148, 81 S.E.2d 565, 572 (1954). <em>See also Overbeek v. Heimbecker, </em>101 F.3d 1225, 1228 (7th Cir.1996) (holding that \u201c[t]he purpose of post judgment interest is ... to encourage prompt payment and compensate [one party] for another\u2019s party\u2019s use of its money\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In other words, those interest payments compensated the wife for the eroding impact of inflation upon her deferred receipt of the funds, for the loss of investment earnings over the period the installments were paid, and for the husband\u2019s use of her funds. The quantum the trial judge attributed to each of these factors is unknown. Because, however, some component of these interest payments, which were spread over a ten-year period, represents compensation for lost \u201cearnings\u201d to the wife, the record does not establish that the $60,000 in earnings the wife received from her invested income in 2003 was a material factor in the change in circumstances. As the exhibit shows, in 1996 the wife received $90,000 in interest, some component of which represented reimbursement for earnings loss due to the deferred receipt of the monetary award. In 2003 she received $27,000 in interest payments, which again represents, in part, reimbursement for lost earnings. However, in 2003 she also received $60,000 in earnings from her invested assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Simply put, while the $60,000 in earnings in 2003 from her invested assets was a change in circumstances, the record fails to show that this change in the source of her earnings is a material change.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For these reasons, I agree with the trial judge that the evidence proved a change in circumstances; however, I do not agree that the change was shown to be material. I, therefore, concur in reversing the order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b565-7\">.
