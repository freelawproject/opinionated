Randolph appeals from the trial court\u2019s order of January 8, 2004, finding the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence sufficient to justify finding him guilty as charged of possession of cocaine, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250, but deferring disposition of the charge and granting him first offender status under Code \u00a7 18.2-251. On appeal, Randolph contends the trial court erred in finding the evidence \u201csufficient to convict [him] of possession of cocaine\u201d and denying his motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">In awarding this appeal, we directed the parties to address the issue whether this Court has jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. Finding the trial court\u2019s order of January 8, 2004, deferring disposition of the charge does not constitute a final judgment of conviction, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction and, thus, do not reach Randolph\u2019s claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The relevant facts in this appeal are not in dispute. On May 19, 2003, Randolph was involved in an automobile accident and transported by a police officer to the emergency room at Obici Hospital in the City of Suffolk. Later, Officer M.T. Erie transported Randolph to the psychiatric ward of the hospital, where psychiatric nurse Mary Catherine Lawrence admitted him pursuant to a temporary detention order. At the time of his admission, Randolph was wearing a coat. Pursuant to hospital procedures established for the safety of the staff and patients, Lawrence asked Randolph to remove his clothing. Lawrence inventoried Randolph\u2019s belongings and removed a Gucci knit cap from the pocket of his coat. When she unfolded the cap to make sure there was nothing in it, \u201clittle white crackly things,\u201d which were later determined to be rocks of crack cocaine, fell out of it. She sealed the cocaine in a zip-lock bag and gave it to Officer Erie.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Randolph was subsequently indicted for possession of cocaine, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250. After pleading not guilty at his arraignment, Randolph was tried on the charge in a bench trial. At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, Randolph moved to strike, arguing that the undisputed fact that he was involuntarily admitted to the psychiatric ward of the hospital pursuant to a temporary detention order proved that he was not capable at the time of knowingly and intentionally possessing the cocaine. The trial court denied the motion. After resting without presenting any evidence, Randolph renewed his motion to strike. The trial court again denied the motion. Randolph then asked the court to defer disposition of the charge and grant him first offender status under Code \u00a7 18.2-251. In response, the trial court found that the evidence presented was \u201csufficient for a finding of guilt\u201d but withheld the finding and ordered \u201cthat a presentence report be prepared prior to determination of guilt ... for consideration ] of the first offender status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">At the sentencing hearing, the Commonwealth agreed that it was appropriate to grant Randolph first offender status <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>under Code \u00a7 18.2-251. Finding Randolph was a suitable candidate for first offender status and \u201cthe evidence presented at trial would justify a finding of guilt,\u201d the trial court deferred disposition of the possession of cocaine charge and placed Randolph on first offender status under Code \u00a7 18.2-251. The court ordered Randolph to serve twenty-four months of probation upon terms and conditions pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-251, including participation in substance abuse and mental health treatment and counseling deemed necessary by Randolph\u2019s probation officer. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-251, the trial court also suspended Randolph\u2019s driver\u2019s license for six months and ordered him to pay costs of $900. The trial court further ordered that, \u201cupon violation of the terms and conditions of said probation, the Court may enter an adjudication of guilt\u201d and, \u201cupon fulfillment of the terms and conditions of said probation, the Court shall discharge the defendant and dismiss the proceedings against him pursuant to [Code \u00a7 ] 18.2-251.\u201d The court continued the \u201cmatter on the docket for review\u201d on January 6, 2006. The trial court memorialized its rulings in an order entered January 8, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">This appeal followed. In granting Randolph\u2019s petition for appeal, we directed the parties to address the issue whether this Court has jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Appealing from the trial court\u2019s order of January 8, 2004, Randolph contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to strike on the ground that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient, as a matter of law, to prove he knowingly and intentionally possessed the cocaine found in his possession at the hospital\u2019s psychiatric ward.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">As a threshold matter, however, we must decide whether this Court has jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. Specifically, we must determine whether the trial court\u2019s order of January 8, 2004, finding the evidence sufficient to justify finding Randolph guilty as charged of possession of cocaine but deferring disposition of that charge and granting him first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>offender status under Code \u00a7 18.2-251<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is a final judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">It is well established that the \u201cCourt of Appeals of Virginia is a court of limited jurisdiction. Unless a statute confers jurisdiction in this Court, we are without power to review an appeal.\u201d <em>Canova Elec. Contracting, Inc. v. LMI Ins. Co., </em>22 Va.App. 595, 599, 471 S.E.2d 827, 829 (1996) (citation omitted). Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A)(i) controls our appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases. Hence, unless Randolph is an \u201caggrieved party ... petitioning] ... from ... [a] <em>final conviction </em>in a circuit court of ... a crime,\u201d we are without jurisdiction to consider the merits of this appeal. Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A)(i) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, the order or judgment appealed from must be final. <em>West v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 241, 243, 455 S.E.2d 1, 2 (1995) (upholding the rule that \u201ccriminal appeals lie only to final judgments\u201d); <em>Fuller v. Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 327, 333, 53 S.E.2d 26, 28-29 (1949) (holding that a judgment or order that is not final, i.e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\u201cnot a complete disposition of the case,\u201d does not invoke the appellate criminal jurisdiction of the Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Randolph contends that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. He argues that, while not technically convicted of possession of cocaine, he was, \u201cfor all practical purposes,\u201d adjudged guilty by the trial court, and subsequently forced to \u201csurrender many of his freedoms\u201d by being placed on probation in accordance with Code \u00a7 18.2-251. Continuing, he implicitly likens his position to that of a convicted defendant who is placed on probation after having had the imposition of his sentence suspended. Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s rationale in <em>Fuller, </em>189 Va. at 330-33, 53 S.E.2d at 27-28, regarding the finality of judgments suspending the imposition of sentence and authorizing probation, he concludes that the trial court\u2019s January 8, 2004 order finding the evidence sufficient to justify finding him guilty of possession of cocaine, deferring disposition of that charge, and placing him on probation under Code \u00a7 18.2-251 is a final order from which he may properly appeal pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A)(i). To hold otherwise, he argues, would defeat the highly remedial purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-251 by placing defendants like him on the horns of a dilemma, forcing them to choose between the certainty of avoiding punishment by obtaining first offender status under Code \u00a7 18.2-251 and the uncertainty of avoiding punishment by submitting to the trial court\u2019s judgment of guilt and seeking redress on appeal. The legislature, he asserts, could not have intended to put him and defendants like him in such a tenuous position.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Randolph\u2019s claim is without merit. For one thing, regardless of how he attempts to characterize his placement on first offender status under Code \u00a7 18.2-251, the fact is that, unlike a convicted defendant who has been placed on probation after having had the imposition of his sentence suspended, Randolph has not been adjudged guilty of any offense. Under the express terms of the January 8, 2004 order, which track the provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-251, the trial court found the evidence sufficient to justify finding Randolph guilty of possession of cocaine, but, instead of convicting Randolph, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>specifically deferred disposition of the charge, at Randolph\u2019s request, and ordered him to serve twenty-four months of probation upon certain terms and conditions. The trial court further ordered that, \u201cupon violation of the terms and conditions of said probation, the Court may enter an adjudication of guilt\u201d and, \u201cupon fulfillment of the terms and conditions of said probation, the Court shall discharge the defendant and dismiss the proceedings against him pursuant to [Code \u00a7 J18.2-251.\u201d The trial court then placed the matter on the court\u2019s docket for review on January 6, 2006. Hence, unless and until Randolph violates the terms and conditions of his probation, there will be no adjudication of guilt and, thus, no conviction. <em>See generally Webb v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 466, 470, 524 S.E.2d 164, 166 (2000) (noting that it is \u201cwell established in our jurisprudence that a \u2018conviction\u2019 ordinarily embraces both an adjudication of guilt and a related sentence, thus concluding a prosecution by final order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Likewise, the trial court\u2019s order of January 8, 2004 is not a final judgment or order. At this juncture, the order requires further action by the trial court. Indeed, the specific terms of the order establish the need for future disposition of the possession of cocaine charge, either by conviction upon violation of the terms and conditions of Randolph\u2019s probation or by discharge and dismissal upon fulfillment of those terms and conditions. Thus, the trial court\u2019s judgment will not be final until either disposition occurs. It is clear, therefore, that the January 8, 2004 order, from which Randolph appeals, \u201cis in no sense the pronouncement of a final judgment.\u201d <em>Sturgill v. Commonwealth, </em>175 Va. 584, 588, 7 S.E.2d 141, 142 (1940). The ultimate adjudication of Randolph\u2019s guilt remains in the balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Moreover, Randolph\u2019s reliance on <em>Fuller </em>is misplaced. In <em>Fuller, </em>the Supreme Court considered, <em>inter alia, </em>the question whether an order by the trial court suspending the imposition of a convicted defendant\u2019s sentence and placing him on probation, pursuant to former Code \u00a7 1922b (a predecessor to present Code \u00a7 19.2-303), constituted a final, appealable judgment. 189 Va. at 330, 53 S.E.2d at 27. Noting that \u201can order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>wherein the pronouncement of sentence is suspended is ordinarily not appealable,\u201d the Court went on to state that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az0\">the legislature may, of course, by appropriate statute permit an appeal from ... such a judgment or order ... either by express language granting the right of review of such an order, or by giving the judgment or order the necessary characteristics of a final judgment so as to be reviewable under the general law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-5\"><em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court concluded that Code \u00a7 1992b fell \u201cwithin the latter category.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9v\">After the trial court has adjudged the defendant \u201cguilty\u201d and has suspended either \u201cthe imposition or the execution of sentence, or commitment\u201d of the defendant, and fixed the terms of his probation, it has made a complete disposition of the case within the purview of the statute. Its action is then final and subject to review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 332, 53 S.E.2d at 28 (quoting Code \u00a7 1922b). This is true, the Court reasoned, because, although the trial court may subsequently revoke the suspension of the imposition of the defendant\u2019s sentence, \u201c[t]he happening of such an event, which brings into operation the right of revocation, does not alter the finality of the judgment previously entered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court then added that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-YL\">to say that a defendant must surrender his right to a suspension of the imposition of sentence and submit to a judgment, perhaps branding him a felon, as a condition to his right of appeal, would strip this highly remedial statute of much of its usefulness. New defendants would be so bold as to swap the certainty of escape from punishment, offered by a suspension of imposition of sentence or a suspension of execution of sentence, for the uncertainty of escape through a possible reversal of the judgment on appeal. Clearly, we think, the statute does not contemplate that [a] defendant should be put in that position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 332-33, 53 S.E.2d at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The statute under consideration here, Code \u00a7 18.2-251, contains no express language granting a defendant placed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>first offender status the right to appeal from the trial court\u2019s order finding the evidence sufficient to justify finding him guilty and placing him on probation pursuant to the statute. Likewise, contrary to Randolph\u2019s claim, Code \u00a7 18.2-251 does not give \u201cthe judgment or order the necessary characteristics of a final judgment so as to be reviewable under the general law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 330, 53 S.E.2d at 27. In relying on <em>Fuller </em>to support his claim, Randolph selectively focuses on the final, supplemental portion of the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis quoted above. In doing so, he ignores the crux of the Court\u2019s analysis and the Court\u2019s conclusion that, once the trial court adjudges the defendant guilty, suspends the imposition of his sentence, and places him on probation, \u201cit has made a complete disposition of the case\u201d and \u201c[i]ts action is ... final and subject to review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332, 53 S.E.2d at 28. Pursuant to the express language of Code \u00a7 18.2-251, the trial court \u201cmay enter an adjudication of guilt\u201d against a defendant who has been placed on first offender status only \u201c[u]pon violation of a term or condition\u201d of the defendant\u2019s probation. Here, as previously discussed, there has been no such violation and, thus, no adjudication of guilt. It stands to reason under the Supreme Court\u2019s rationale in <em>Fuller, </em>therefore, that the present disposition of this case is not complete and the trial court\u2019s action is not final and subject to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Furthermore, the Supreme Court ultimately decided in <em>Fuller </em>that the particular order in question was not a final, appealable order because certain matters remained to be done in the case before judgment could be entered. <em>Id. </em>at 333, 53 S.E.2d at 28. Thus, the Supreme Court held that the order was \u201cnot a complete disposition of the case\u201d because \u201cthe matter [was] still in the breast of the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The same is true of the instant case. As previously mentioned, the trial court\u2019s order of January 8, 2004, requires further action by the trial court, depending on whether Randolph violates or fulfills the terms and conditions of his probation. The case remains on the court\u2019s active docket until either of these events occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Finally, had Randolph desired to immediately appeal the trial court\u2019s decision denying his motion to strike, he should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>not have requested placement on first offender status under Code \u00a7 18.2-251. While it is true that the opportunity to escape punishment under Code \u00a7 18.2-251 placed him on the horns of a dilemma, the criminal process, like the rest of the legal system, is replete with situations requiring choices between various alternatives, each with its own benefits and disadvantages. Here, Randolph chose to seek first offender status under Code \u00a7 18.2-251. Pursuant to that statute, if he complies with the terms and conditions of his probation, he will be discharged and the charge against him dismissed. If he fails to comply, and he is adjudged guilty of possession of cocaine and sentenced, he may appeal at that time. As it stands now, however, no final judgment of conviction has been entered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">For these reasons, we hold that this appeal is premature and we lack jurisdiction to entertain it. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-6\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-251 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">Whenever any person who has not previously been convicted of any [drug-related] offense ... pleads guilty to or enters a plea of not guilty to possession of a controlled substance under \u00a7 18.2-250 ..., the court, upon such plea if the facts found by the court would justify a finding of guilt, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the accused, may defer further proceedings and place him on probation upon terms and conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">Upon violation of a term or condition, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided. Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions, the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against him. Discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of guilt and is a conviction only for the purposes of applying this section in subsequent proceedings.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b218-9\">. Although not relevant here, the Supreme Court has explained that, in addition to \"appeals from final criminal convictions,\u201d appeals from post-conviction \"action on motions filed and disposed of while the trial court retains jurisdiction over the case\u201d are also subject to this Court\u2019s appellate criminal jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A)(i). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Southerly, </em>262 Va. 294, 299, 551 S.E.2d 650, 653 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
