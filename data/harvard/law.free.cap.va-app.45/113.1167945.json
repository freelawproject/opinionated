ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">This case presents the question whether an appellant\u2019s failure to appeal one of two alternative grounds for a trial court\u2019s decision waives any further appellate review of that decision. We hold that it does, subject to the caveat that the alternative holding must be legally capable \u2014 standing alone\u2014 of supporting the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The trial court found Otis Purcell Johnson, Jr., guilty of possession of heroin with intent to distribute. Before trial, Johnson moved to suppress the evidence on the ground that the arresting officer violated the Fourth Amendment by conducting an overbroad weapons frisk during an investigatory detention. During this frisk, the officer discovered heroin in a balled-up jacket that Johnson had been tightly clutching. At trial, the officer testified that outstanding warrants existed for Johnson\u2019s arrest at the time of the encounter \u2014 a fact he would have learned moments later while checking Johnson\u2019s identification. A search incident to arrest, the officer stated, would have necessarily followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The Commonwealth responded to the motion to suppress on two grounds. First, the prosecution claimed the circumstances justified a weapons search of the jacket. <em>See generally Simmons v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 552, 556, 231 S.E.2d 218, 221 (1977) (holding that, during a <em>Terry </em>stop, a weapons frisk may be conducted if the officer \u201creasonably believes that the individual might be armed\u201d). The prosecution also argued, in the alternative, the inevitable discovery doctrine cured any potential violation of Fourth Amendment search and seizure principles. <em>See generally Commonwealth v. Jones, </em>267 Va. 532, 535-38, 593 S.E.2d 204, 206-08 (2004) (tracing the history of the inevitable discovery doctrine and its application in Virginia).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The trial court denied Johnson\u2019s motion to suppress, holding that (i) the officer did not exceed the permissible limits of a weapons frisk, and (ii) in any event, the evidence proved the heroin would have been \u201cinevitably discovered\u201d by the officer even if the weapons frisk had not taken place due to the presence of several outstanding warrants for Johnson\u2019s arrest at the time of the encounter. Relying on both grounds, the trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">On appeal, Johnson challenges only the trial court\u2019s first holding. He argues the trial court erred in finding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>weapons frisk was within the scope of permissible Fourth Amendment limits. On that basis, Johnson requests that we reverse the trial court\u2019s denial of the suppression motion and vacate his conviction. Johnson, however, does not challenge on appeal the trial court\u2019s alternative holding applying the inevitable discovery doctrine to the facts of this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">From a practical point of view, for us to reverse the judgment, we would have to raise a challenge on Johnson\u2019s behalf to the trial court\u2019s inevitable discovery ruling, conceive of a reason to find fault with it, and then use that reason as a basis for setting aside Johnson\u2019s conviction. Suffice it to say, such an exercise of <em>sua sponte </em>judicial power would impermissibly place us in the role of advocate \u2014 far outside the boundaries of our traditional adjudicative duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">For these reasons, we join the majority of jurisdictions holding that in \u201csituations in which there is one or more alternative holdings on an issue,\u201d the appellant\u2019s \u201cfailure to address one of the holdings results in a waiver of any claim of error with respect to the court\u2019s decision on that issue.\u201d <em>United States v. Hatchett, </em>245 F.3d 625, 644-45 (7th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Kauthar SDN BHD v. Sternberg, </em>149 F.3d 659, 668 (7th Cir.1998)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If we were to hold otherwise, \u201can appellant could avoid the adverse effect of a separate and independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>basis for the judgment by ignoring it and leaving it unchallenged.\u201d <em>San Antonio Press v. Custom Bilt Machinery, </em>852 S.W.2d 64, 65 (Tex.App.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">That said, we still must satisfy ourselves that the alternative holding is indeed one that (when properly applied to the facts of a given case) would legally constitute a freestanding basis in support of the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Navajo Nation v. MacDonald, </em>180 Ariz. 539, 885 P.2d 1104, 1106 (Ct.App.1994) (concluding that the alternative hold ings \u201care sufficient to support the judgment\u201d against the appellant); <em>Career Builders, Inc. v. S. Indus. Builders, Inc., </em>149 Ga.App. 392, 254 S.E.2d 508, 509 (1979) (affirming trial court\u2019s judgment because the alternative ground was \u201csufficient on its face to support the judgment rendered\u201d); <em>Britton v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Crim. Justice, </em>95 S.W.3d 676, 681 (Tex.App. 2002) (holding that the \u201cunchallenged independent ground fully supports the eomplained-of ruling or judgment\u201d). The trial court\u2019s characterization of its decision as an alternative holding, of course, does not end the matter. We must determine whether it is or not. But, in making that decision, we do not examine the underlying merits of the alternative holding\u2014 for that is the very thing being waived by the appellant as a result of his failure to raise the point on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In this case, we agree with the trial court that the inevitable discovery doctrine, when properly applied, serves as an adequate and independent legal basis for denying Johnson\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>See Jones, </em>267 Va. at 535-36, 593 S.E.2d at 206 (applying inevitable discovery doctrine as a well recognized \u201cexception\u201d to the exclusionary rule); <em>Copeland v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 424, 432-37, 592 S.E.2d 391, 395-97 (2004) (recognizing \u201cthe inevitable discovery exception to an otherwise invalid warrantless search\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We do not, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>review the record to determine whether the trial court properly applied the doctrine to the factual circumstances of this case. Johnson waived that issue by not raising it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">For these reasons, we reject Johnson\u2019s appellate challenge to the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\">. In its appellee's brief, the Commonwealth raised the trial court\u2019s inevitable discovery ruling as an alternative basis for affirming Johnson\u2019s conviction. Johnson filed no reply brief, which he had a right to do under Rules 5A: 19(c)(3) and 5A:22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b164-8\">. <em>See also South Carolina Tax Comm\u2019n v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., </em>316 S.C. 163, 447 S.E.2d 843, 847 (1994) (affirming trial court \"where an appellant fails to appeal the alternative ground of a trial judge\u2019s ruling\u201d); <em>San Antonio Press, Inc. v. Custom Bilt Machinery, </em>852 S.W.2d 64, 65 (Tex.App.1993) (\"When a separate and independent ground that supports a judgment is not challenged on appeal, the appellate court must affirm.\u201d); <em>Morriss v. Enron Oil &amp; Gas Co., </em>948 S.W.2d 858, 871 (Tex.App.1997) (holding that appellant who does not complain about each independent ground waives his right to complain of the ruling). <em>See generally </em>5 Am.

We reach this conclusion without first deciding the merits of the properly appealed question concerning the scope of the <em>Terry </em>weapons frisk. Given our holding, any discussion on that point would conflict with two principles of judicial self-restraint: our reluctance to issue what amounts to an \"advisoiy opinion\u201d on an inessential subject, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number><em>Craddock v.
