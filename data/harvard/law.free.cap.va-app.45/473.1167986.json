We agree with Kyer that no warrant exception justified the police entry into the apartment. But we also agree with the trial court that, once inside, the police searched the apartment only after receiving permission from Kyer\u2019s mother to do so. This consent, the trial court correctly held, was \u201csufficiently an act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>of free will to purge the primary taint.\u201d <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 486, 83 S.Ct. 407, 416-17, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">\u201cOn appeal from a denial of a suppression motion, we must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Slayton v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 101, 103, 582 S.E.2d 448, 449 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">At about 2:00 a.m. on August 26, 2002, Officer B.E. Davis and Detective Brent Story responded to a burglar alarm at the Southside Speedway. They saw two suspects running from the scene. They caught one, but the other got away. With a tip from the detained suspect, the officers\u2019 investigation led them to the Kyer apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The officers arrived at the apartment at approximately 4:00 a.m. The ft-ont door of the apartment was open wide enough for an individual to \u201cwalk through it without touching the door.\u201d There were no lights on. In this particular area, Detective Story observed, \u201cit was not uncommon for this situation to occur.\u201d \u201cEvery time it does,\u201d he testified, \u201cwe make entry to make sure everything inside is okay.\u201d They knocked on the door several times, waited a couple of minutes, and then went inside with weapons drawn and flashlights on. Fearing someone had \u201cforced entry or broken into the home,\u201d the officers conducted a two to three minute \u201ccursory\u201d protective sweep looking for any possible intruders.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">After completing the protective sweep, Officer Davis awoke Kyer\u2019s mother, who was still asleep in her bedroom. Davis identified himself, inquired about her well-being, and asked if anyone else was \u201csupposed to be in the house.\u201d She told him she lived there alone with her two sons. When asked if \u201cshe was okay,\u201d she replied \u201cshe was fine.\u201d During this conversation, Detective Story waited in the living room. Officer Davis left her bedroom to permit her to \u201cget herself together.\u201d He went back into the living room and waited with Detective Story. Kyer\u2019s mother came out and then \u201cexcused herself to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>go back into her bedroom\u201d before again reappearing to speak with the officers about ten minutes later. By this time, Kyer\u2019s brother had joined the officers in the living room after being awoken by them. No one else was in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Detective Story sat down in a chair across from Kyer\u2019s mother and explained \u201cwhat was going on and why [they] had been there originally and also explained to her why [they] came in in the first place so she would understand that.\u201d She told the officers \u201ceverything was okay\u201d and that she had been asleep. The officers also advised her about the Southside Speedway incident and the suggestion that her son may have been involved. She said she thought he was home all night and was still there.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">After she had been briefed on the situation, Officer Davis then asked Kyer\u2019s mother for permission to search for \u201canything that was stolen from the Southside Speedway.\u201d She consented to the search. In the loft where Kyer normally slept, Officer Davis found several items stolen during the burglary of the Southside Speedway.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Kyer was charged with three counts of statutory burglary and three counts of petit larceny. Kyer moved to suppress the inculpatory evidence found in his bedroom, arguing that the officers\u2019 initial entry into the apartment was unlawful. That warrantless entry, Kyer argued, nullified the subsequent consent to search given by his mother. The trial court rejected both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The initial entry, the court held, fell within the \u201ccommunity caretaker doctrine and/or exigent circumstances\u201d exception to the warrant requirement. The court found the officers\u2019 subjective intent in entering the apartment was motivated by their good faith desire to ensure an intruder had not come through the opened front door. Finding the officers\u2019 testimony credible, the court found they were not \u201cacting under a pretext\u201d to gain entry into the apartment to continue their investigation of the Southside Speedway burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">The trial court also held that, even if the initial entry fell outside the community caretaker or emergency exceptions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Kyer\u2019s mother voluntarily consented to the search and \u201cthe totality of the circumstances are not sufficient to have vitiated her consent.\u201d \u201cSo, on that ground, irrespective of what decision the Court might reach on the question of exigent circumstances or exercising community caretaker function, the consent was valid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Following the trial court\u2019s ruling on the suppression motion, Kyer stipulated that the evidence was sufficient to prove his guilt on all charges. Upon being convicted, Kyer appealed to us challenging the trial court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion. A panel of our Court held the community caretaker doctrine authorized the initial entry into the apartment, thereby mooting any need to examine the legal efficacy of the later consent to search. <em>Kyer v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 603, 601 S.E.2d 6 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Having reconsidered the matter <em>en banc, </em>we hold the initial entry cannot be justified under the emergency or community caretaker doctrines and thus the consent issue must be decided. And, on that point, we agree with the trial court that the consent was not nullified by the earlier unlawful entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">\u201cThough the ultimate question whether the officers violated the Fourth Amendment triggers <em>de novo </em>scrutiny, we defer to the trial court\u2019s findings of \u2018historical fact\u2019 and give \u2018due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Slayton, </em>41 Va.App. at 105, 582 S.E.2d at 449 (quoting <em>Barkley v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 682, 689-90, 576 S.E.2d 234, 237-38 (2003)). Thus, we must give \u201cdeference to the factual findings of the trial court\u201d and \u201cindependently determine\u201d whether those findings satisfy the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Whitfield v. Commonwealth, </em>265 Va. 358, 361, 576 S.E.2d 463, 464 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">To prevail on appeal, \u201cthe defendant must show that the trial court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion, when the evidence is considered in the light most favorable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>prosecution, was reversible error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, on appeal, the \u201cburden to establish that the denial of the motion to suppress constituted reversible error rests with the defendant.\u201d <em>King v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 306, 308, 572 S.E.2d 518, 519 (2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">A. <em>The Initial Entry</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Among the many interests served by the Fourth Amendment, the privacy interest in one\u2019s home has few equals. \u201cAt the very core of the Fourth Amendment stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.\u201d <em>Kyllo v. United States, </em>533 U.S. 27, 31, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 2041, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIt is axiomatic that the \u2018physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Welsh v. Wisconsin, </em>466 U.S. 740, 748, 104 S.Ct. 2091, 2097, 80 L.Ed.2d 732 (1984) (citation omitted). But even on this topic the Fourth Amendment\u2019s text endorses no absolutes. It instead condemns only \u201cunreasonable\u201d searches and seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">One concession to reasonableness, the emergency exception, recognizes the \u201cright of the police to enter and investigate\u201d when someone\u2019s health or physical safety is genuinely threatened. <em>Reynolds v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 430, 437, 388 S.E.2d 659, 664 (1990) (citation omitted); <em>see also Mincey v. Arizona, </em>437 U.S. 385, 98 S.Ct. 2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978). It rests on the commonsense rationale that \u201cpreservation of human life is paramount to the right of privacy\u201d protected by the Fourth Amendment. <em>Reynolds, </em>9 Va.App. at 437, 388 S.E.2d at 664 (citation omitted). This concern parallels one of the applications of the community caretaker exception, which recognizes that \u201cpolice owe \u2018duties to the public, such as rendering aid to individuals in danger of physical harm, reducing the commission of crimes through patrol and other preventive measures, and providing services on an emergency basis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436, 388 S.E.2d at 663.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>In this case, however, we need not engage in any extended analysis of the emergency or community caretaker exceptions. Nor need we elaborate on their various formulations. We believe the facts would not justify an objectively reasonable officer to think either exception applied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Stripped of its immaterial aspects, the fact pattern in this case includes only one arguably suspicious circumstance: an open door on an August night.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">There were no signs of forced entry \u2014 such as pry marks, mangled locks, broken hinges, or disfigured door jams.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No one called out for help. No sounds or observations suggested panic or danger within the apartment. There were no reports from neighbors about any unique medical concerns or other vulnerabilities of the apartment\u2019s occupants. Nor did any of Kyer\u2019s neighbors report any suspicious circumstances suggest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>ing foul play. <em>Cf. Hill v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 1, 4, 441 S.E.2d 50, 51 (1994) (finding exigent circumstances existed when a neighbor reported that the homeowner \u201chad been out of town for two days\u201d prior to the police discovery of an open front door, leading the neighbor to fear \u201cthe house had been burglarized\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The mere discovery of an \u201copen door\u201d of a residence\u2014 absent some other reason for concern \u2014 \u201cis not, <em>in and of itself, </em>a circumstance that could give rise to a reasonable belief that entry is necessary to prevent harm to persons or property.\u201d <em>State v. Christenson, </em>181 Or.App. 345, 45 P.3d 511, 513 (2002) (emphasis added). \u201cIt is simply too common an event to create a concern of harm in the absence of other signs of trouble, such as evidence of a forced entry or a medical emergency; here, there were no such indications.\u201d <em>Id</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In short, when the \u201conly evidence of an emergency was a door left open late on a summer night,\u201d we agree with other courts that \u201cregardless of what the officers may subjectively have thought, a reasonable person would not believe an emergency existed.\u201d <em>State v. Swenson, </em>59 Wash.App. 586, 799 P.2d 1188, 1190 (1990); <em>see also State v. Ryon, </em>137 N.M. 174, 108 P.3d 1032, 1047 (2005) (noting that, under the emergency assistance doctrine, an \u201copen door ought not be viewed as a general invitation to enter\u201d). The police had no legal right, therefore, to enter the Kyer apartment uninvited. The trial court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>B. <em>The Consent To Search</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><em>As </em>a general rule, <em>\u201ca search </em>authorized by consent is wholly valid.\u201d <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 222, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2045, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). Consent loses its validity only if it is involuntary, <em>Ohio v. Robinette, </em>519 U.S. 33, 40, 117 S.Ct. 417, 421-22, 136 L.Ed.2d 347 (1996), or the product of a manipulative \u201cexploitation\u201d by the police of an earlier unconstitutional search or seizure. <em>Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 488, 83 S.Ct. at 418; <em>Warlick v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 263, 266, 208 S.E.2d 746, 748 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Consent following an unconstitutional act, however, can still be valid if it is \u201csufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint.\u201d <em>Brown v. Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 597, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 2258, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975) (citing <em>Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 486, 83 S.Ct. at 417). This attenuation principle should not be confused with a mere \u201cbut for\u201d standard of causation \u2014 which, if used for this purpose, would suppress evidence \u201csimply because it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police.\u201d <em>Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 488, 83 S.Ct. at 418. Instead, \u201ca finding with respect to attenuation ... can only be made after consideration of all the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Wellins, </em>654 F.2d 550, 554 (9th Cir.1981). This necessarily requires a \u201ccareful sifting of the unique facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 233, 93 S.Ct. at 2051. There being no fixed formula, courts consider the amount of time between the illegal action and the acquisition of the evidence, the presence of intervening circumstances (like consent), and the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 548 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Consistent with these principles, voluntary consent \u2014 when sufficiently an act of free will to dissipate the taint \u2014 can provide an independent basis for admitting evidence despite an earlier unlawful entry by police. <em>See, e.g., Seidman, </em>156 F.3d at 549 n. 10 (\u201cWe see no reason why [consent] could not also sever the connection between an unlawful act and the acquisition of additional evidence. Indeed, voluntary consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>is the quintessential act of free will.\u201d); <em>United States v. Dickson, </em>64 F.3d 409, 410-11 (8th Cir.1995) (holding that defendant\u2019s voluntary consent to search his apartment dissipated taint of prior illegal search); <em>United States v. Valencia, </em>913 F.2d 378, 382 (7th Cir.1990) (\u201cEven assuming the initial entry was illegal, we agree with the district court that that entry did not taint Valencia\u2019s subsequent consent.\u201d); <em>United States v. Sheppard, </em>901 F.2d 1230, 1234 (5th Cir.1990) (holding that defendant\u2019s voluntary consent to search his car dissipated taint of officer\u2019s illegal entry); <em>State v. Owen, </em>453 So.2d 1202, 1207 (La.1984) (holding that consent was valid despite \u201cclose temporal proximity between the illegal entry and Evans\u2019 consent\u201d because Evans had \u201cknowledge of the purpose of the entry and the manner in which it was made\u201d and thus the \u201cofficial misconduct had an insignificant effect on the subsequent consent\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">On the other hand, the purgation of free will may not suffice in all cases of consent. It may be insufficient, for example, when the evidence has already been discovered before the consent during the prior illegal search. <em>See, e.g., Wood v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 21, 30-32, 497 S.E.2d 484, 488-89 (1998); <em>Commonwealth v. Ealy, </em>12 Va.App. 744, 757-58, 407 S.E.2d 681, 689-90 (1991). It may be equally insufficient if given <em>after </em>the consenter has been illegally detained, <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 421, 433-35, 559 S.E.2d 374, 379-80 (2002), or <em>after </em>the police make an illegal entry for the \u201cvery purpose\u201d of obtaining consent, <em>Walls v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 639, 655, 347 S.E.2d 175, 184 (1986). Absent such exploitive circumstances, however, a consensual encounter following an \u201cillegal entry\u201d can still be \u201csufficiently independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>of the unlawful invasion to purge any taint arising from the initial entry.\u201d <em>Seidman, </em>156 F.3d at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In this case, Kyer does not contend on appeal that his mother\u2019s consent was involuntary. He argues only that, even if her \u201cconsent was voluntary,\u201d it still was not \u201csufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint\u201d of the unlawful entry. We disagree. Before she consented to the search, Kyer\u2019s mother had been fully briefed by the police about \u201cwhat was going on\u201d and why they entered her apartment in the first place. The conversation took place in her living room, after she had about ten minutes to compose herself. At no time prior to the consent did the police recover any incriminating evidence. Nor did they in any way imply she was the subject of a criminal investigation. They did not detain her, place her in custody, threaten her with arrest, or restrict her freedom of movement in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In these respects, our case parallels the situation addressed in <em>Valencia, </em>913 F.2d at 382, where the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit observed that the police</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASL\">did not exploit the initial entry. The police found no evidence as a result of that entry, and discovered no information that they used (or could use) to influence Valencia to consent to a search. Valencia points to the allegedly coercive effect of the officers\u2019 mere presence in his apartment. However, as we have seen, the district court found Valencia\u2019s consent to be free and voluntary. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the officers\u2019 presence did not coerce Valencia\u2019s consent. <em>Indeed, the district court explicitly found no evidence of any nexus between the initial entry and the consent.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). \u201cGiven all these factors,\u201d the Seventh Circuit held in <em>Valencia, </em>\u201cwe conclude that Valencia\u2019s consent was sufficiently independent of the allegedly illegal initial entry that the two events were \u2018so attenuated as to dissipate [any] taint\u2019 from the entry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Segura v. United States, </em>468 U.S. 796, 805, 104 S.Ct. 3380, 3385, 82 L.Ed.2d 599 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>We acknowledge that seeing two police officers, with weapons drawn, conduct a protective search of one\u2019s home would no doubt be an intimidating sight. But Kyer\u2019s mother saw none of that. She was asleep until awoken by Officer Davis. As the trial court found, this \u201cwas not a situation where they had guns drawn pointed at her head, asking her for consent.\u201d Nor is this a case where the officers entered for the \u201cvery purpose\u201d of obtaining consent. <em>Walls, </em>2 Va.App. at 655, 347 S.E.2d at 184. They entered because they believed the open door implied danger to those inside. Having weighed their credibility, the trial court found their explanation truthful and rejected the argument that the officers used this story as a mere pretext to gain entry into the house to investigate the Southside Speedway burglary. Bound by this factual finding, we see no reason to conclude the \u201cpurpose and flagrancy of the police misconduct,\u201d <em>Wood, </em>27 Va.App. at 30, 497 S.E.2d at 488, should invalidate the voluntary consent to search given by Kyer\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The main circumstance disfavoring this conclusion is the relatively short duration between the entry and consent. We think two observations answer that legitimate concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">First, the specific length of time was all but irrelevant from the perspective of Kyer\u2019s mother. She was asleep when the police entered the apartment. She remained asleep as they conducted a protective search. When Officer Davis awoke her, she did not know whether the police had been there for a few minutes or a few hours. Her concededly voluntary consent did not depend in any way on the <em>duration </em>of the officers\u2019 presence in her apartment. That is, nothing about the situation suggests that Kyer\u2019s mother would have been more readily inclined to consent had she known the officers had been in her apartment <em>longer </em>than they in fact were. <em>Cf. State v. Quinn, </em>290 Or. 383, 623 P.2d 630, 638 (1981) (finding defendant\u2019s consent was unaffected by prior illegal search because, as defendant was unaware of the illegal search, his consent was \u201cuninfluenced and untainted by the earlier unlawful act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Second, as for the ten minutes or so between being awakened and providing consent, Kyer\u2019s mother took that time to compose herself and to listen to the officers explain why they came to her apartment and why they entered it uninvited. By itself, however, this brief duration does not put the attenuation inquiry to an end. It is just one of several considerations. Even a very short duration need not negate the efficacy of a voluntary consent. <em>See, e.g., Seidman, </em>156 F.3d at 548 (finding a few minute period between entry and consent insufficient to negate consent); <em>Sheppard, </em>901 F.2d at 1235 (\u201cEven though the time span between the challenged conduct and Sheppard\u2019s consent was short, we cannot find that the second search resulted from the exploitation of the challenged conduct.\u201d); <em>Owen, </em>453 So.2d at 1207 (holding that consent was valid despite \u201cclose temporal proximity\u201d between the illegal entry and consent).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">In sum, we hold that the trial court erred in finding the initial police entry into the apartment could be justified under the emergency or community caretaker exceptions.

Even so, the Fourth Amendment relevance of <em>Christen-son (cf. post </em>at 18-20) appears at the heart of its analysis: \u201cWe have held that an open front door does not justify entry into a house under the emergency aid doctrine or the community caretaking exceptions to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution under more suspicious circumstances than those that existed here.\" <em>Id. </em>at 513 (citing <em>State v.

For similar reasons, a voluntary confession can be an act of free will sufficient to purge the taint of an earlier illegal arrest. <em>See New York v.

However, I continue to believe that the officers\u2019 initial entry into the Kyer residence was proper under the community caretaker exception to the warrant requirement. And, because the warrantless entry was reasonable, the officers properly searched the residence after obtaining the voluntary consent of Kyer\u2019s mother. Thus, although I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>affirm the judgment of the trial court, I concur only in the result reached by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The officers arrived at Kyer\u2019s home at approximately 4:00 in the morning. At that time, the front door was open \u201cwide enough for [Officer Davis] to walk through it without touching the door.\u201d It was dark and raining. There were no exterior lights on, and no lights were on inside the home. Because of these circumstances, Officer Davis and Detective Story believed that \u201c[s]omeone had forced entry or broken into the home.\u201d Accordingly, the officers \u201cmade a ... plan,\u201d discussing how they would respond if they \u201cencounter[ed] any opposition.\u201d The officers then \u201cknocked on the door several times,\u201d announcing their presence. There was no response. After waiting for \u201ca couple\u201d of minutes, the officers drew their firearms and flashlights and proceeded inside the home and up the stairs, \u201ccontinuing to announce [their] presence\u201d in \u201cloud voice[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Based on these facts, the trial court explicitly found that \u201cit was appropriate for the officers to enter the residence,\u201d reasoning that \u201cthe community caretaker doctrine and/or exigent circumstances permitted their entry into the residence.\u201d In particular, the court found that the officers\u2019 \u201cinitial contact or investigation was objectively reasonable,\u201d also concluding that the \u201cpolice officers in this case were [not] acting under a pretext.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">As recognized by the majority, \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that the \u2018physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Welsh v.

For that reason, the United States Supreme Court has carved out a few delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement. <em>United States District Court, </em>407 U.S. at 318, 92 S.Ct. at 2137.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">For example, according to the \u201cemergency doctrine,\u201d a warrantless entry into a private residence is valid if there is a \u201creasonably perceived \u2018emergency* requiring immediate entry as an incident to the service and protective functions of the police as opposed to, or as a complement to, their law enforcement functions.\u201d <em>United States v.

Although this Court has yet to apply the community caretaker exception to validate the warrantless search of a home, little distinction has been made between the circumstances governing the application of the community caretaker doctrine and those governing the application of the emergency exception to the warrant requirement, which unquestionably authorizes a warrantless entry into a private residence. <em>Compare Commonwealth v.

I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The appropriateness of applying the community caretaker doctrine to a given factual scenario is determined by whether, based upon the totality of the circumstances, it was reasonable for the officer to believe that his or her actions were necessary for: (1) the protection of the owner\u2019s property while it remains in police custody; (2) the protection of police against claims or disputes concerning lost or stolen property; or (3) protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>of the public and the police from physical danger. <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 723, 730, 594 S.E.2d 305, 309 (2004) (citing <em>Reese v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1035, 1039, 265 S.E.2d 746, 749 (1980); <em>South Dakota v.

Specific factors to be considered .include: (1) whether the officer\u2019s initial contact or investigation is reasonable; (2) whether the intrusion is limited; and (3) whether the officer is investigating criminal conduct under the pretext of exercising his community caretaker duties. <em>Waters, </em>20 Va.App. at 290, 456 S.E.2d at 530. Overall, \u201c[o]bjective reasonableness remains the linchpin of determining the validity of [the] action.\u201d <em>Id.; cf. Reynolds, </em>9 Va.App. at 437, 388 S.E.2d at 663-64 (applying objective reasonableness test to emergency exception to warrant requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, I would hold that the officers\u2019 warrantless entry into the home was justified pursuant to the community caretaker exception. The officers arrived at Kyer\u2019s home at 4:00 a.m. It was dark and raining outside. No lights were on inside or outside the home. Yet, the front door to Kyer\u2019s home stood open \u2014 wide enough that the officers could walk through it without touching the door. The officers announced their presence loudly, several times, and, after receiving no answer, they entered the home to determine whether anyone was in the home and whether those persons were in need of assistance. The officers made a limited \u201cprotective sweep,\u201d motivated only by the safety and well-being of the residents. Moreover, as expressly found by the trial court, the officers did not enter the home under the pretext of searching for evidence of criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Considering the totality of these circumstances, I would hold that the officers, acting out of \u201cconcern for the safety of the general public,\u201d <em>Cady, </em>413 U.S. at 447, 93 S.Ct. at 2531, reasonably believed that \u201cthere [might be] a difficulty requiring [their] general assistance.\u201d <em>Laney v. State, </em>117 S.W.3d 854, 861 (Tex.Ct.Crim.App.2003) (internal quotations omitted). Thus, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s determination that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>officers\u2019 limited entry was objectively reasonable and, as a result, constitutionally permissible pursuant to the community caretaker exception to the warrant requirement. Indeed, because the officers reasonably believed that \u201cfoul play\u201d might have occurred, I am of the opinion that the officers \u201cwould have been derelict in their duty\u201d had they <em>not </em>entered the residence. <em>State v. Hetzko, </em>283 So.2d 49, 52 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The majority, however, citing <em>State v. Christenson, </em>181 Or.App. 345, 45 P.3d 511 (2002), concludes that \u201can open door on a summer morning is not, <em>in and of itself, </em>a circumstance that could give rise to a reasonable belief that entry is necessary to prevent harm to persons or property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513 (emphasis added). Because <em>Christenson </em>is distinguishable from the present case in several key respects, I do not believe that its holding is persuasive under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">First, in <em>Christenson, </em>the investigating officers encountered an open door at 9:20 a.m., on a \u201csummer morning.\u201d Here, it was 4:00 a.m., dark, and raining. There is a significant difference between encountering an open door at 9:20 a.m. and encountering an open door at 4:00 a.m. That is, although it would not be particularly unusual to leave the front door ajar at 9:20 on a \u201csummer morning,\u201d it is markedly more suspicious to encounter an open door at 4:00 a.m., when it is still dark outside, it is raining, and the residents of the home are much more likely to be asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Second, in <em>Christenson, </em>the issue before the court was not whether the officers\u2019 conduct violated the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Rather, the <em>Christenson </em>court was interpreting a provision of the Oregon \u201ccommunity caretaker\u201d statute, Or. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 133.033, which, <em>inter alia, </em>gives \u201cofficers of [that] state\u201d the permission to enter \u201cthe premises of another\u201d so as to \u201c[p]revent serious harm to any person or property.\u201d Or. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 133.033(2)(a)(A). Although the court noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the \u201ccommunity caretaking function is subject to the limitations on warrantless searches contained in Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution,\u201d 45 P.3d at 513, the <em>Christenson </em>court did not rule that the officers\u2019 conduct, in addition to exceeding the scope of their statutory authority, also violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Rather, the court held only that the officers\u2019 conduct could not be validated under the state constitution, reasoning that <em>\u201c[tjhere is no community caretaking exception under the Oregon Constitution.\u201d Id. </em>at 514 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Third, in <em>Christenson, </em>the lower court <em>granted </em>the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, holding that \u201cthe officers had no basis in fact for having [the belief that someone inside the house was injured] other than that the door was open and the dogs were running around.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513. The appellate court acknowledged that it was \u201cbound by ... [this] finding[ ] of historical fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, in contrast, the trial court found that the initial investigation was \u201cobjectively reasonable,\u201d and <em>denied </em>the motion to suppress. We have held that \u201c[t]he reasonableness of a police officer\u2019s response in a given situation is a question of fact for the trial court[,] and its ruling will not be disturbed on appeal absent clear and manifest error.\u201d <em>Reynolds, </em>9 Va.App. at 437, 388 S.E.2d at 664; <em>see also Shears v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 394, 398, 477 S.E.2d 309, 311 (1996) (noting that this Court gives due weight to \u201ca trial court\u2019s finding that [an] officer was credible and [that the officer\u2019s] inference was reasonable\u201d (internal quotations omitted)). Accordingly, we, too, are \u201cbound by ... [this] finding[ ] of historical fact,\u201d <em>Christenson, </em>45 P.3d at 513, specifically, that the warrantless entry was objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Thus, I believe the significant disparities between the circumstances of the present case and those presented in <em>Christenson </em>render that case unsuitable to justify the majority\u2019s legal position.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Moreover, the majority\u2019s underlying rationale \u2014 that the officers needed some \u201cadditional fact\u201d to justify a warrantless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>entry under the circumstances of this case \u2014 demonstrates confusion or a decided lack of understanding of the community caretaker exception to the warrant requirement. Citing <em>Hill v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 1, 441 S.E.2d 50 (1994), a case in which a panel of this Court authorized a warrantless entry premised on the <em>exigent circumstances </em>exception to the warrant requirement, the majority concludes that \u201csomething more\u201d was needed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">In <em>Hill, </em>the police department received a call from a neighbor, requesting that the police \u201csend somebody out to check to see whether [Hill\u2019s] house had been broken into.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2, 441 S.E.2d at 50. The neighbor informed the police that Hill was out of town, that he had not been seen for two days, and that the front door to the house was open. <em>See id. </em>The officers went to the house to investigate. Upon their arrival, they noted that the front door \u201cwas open about twelve to fifteen inches,\u201d and they rang the doorbell and knocked on the door. <em>Id. </em>After receiving no response, the officers \u201centered the home <em>to investigate the possibility of a burglary.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). While searching the home \u201cin places where a burglar might hide,\u201d the officers discovered marijuana and various drug paraphernalia. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3, 441 S.E.2d at 50-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">On appeal, we held that the trial court properly denied Hill\u2019s motion to suppress, reasoning that the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement applied. <em>See id. </em>at 3, 441 S.E.2d at 51. We noted that, <em>\u201c[w]hen probable cause exists, </em>exigent circumstances excuse the requirement of obtaining a warrant,\u201d and concluded that, under the circumstances of that case, the officers had <em>\u201cprobable cause </em>to believe that Hill\u2019s house had been unlawfully entered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4, 441 S.E.2d at 51 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement applies when, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthere is a clear showing of probable case at the time of entry,\u201d and \u201cthe officers have strong reason to believe the suspects are present in the premises,\u201d or that evidence will be destroyed absent an immediate entry. <em>Id. </em>at 3, 441 S.E.2d at 51 (citing <em>Verez, </em>230 Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>405, 337 S.E.2d 749). Thus, this exception is properly applied where, as in <em>Hill, </em>there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been or is being committed, and the officers enter the premises <em>for the purpose of investigating that crime. See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The community caretaker exception, however, does not require a showing of probable cause. Rather, it requires an <em>objectively reasonable belief </em>that the officers\u2019 conduct is necessary to provide aid or to protect members of the public from physical harm. <em>See Williams, </em>42 Va.App. at 730, 594 S.E.2d at 309; <em>Waters, </em>20 Va.App. at 290, 456 S.E.2d at 530. Moreover, unlike the exigent circumstances exception, the warrant-less entry must be \u201ctotally divorced\u201d from a criminal investigation. <em>Cady, </em>413 U.S. at 436-37, 93 S.Ct. at 2526-27. That is, the police officers must be acting in a protective, rather than crime-fighting, capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Because the warrantless entry must be \u201ctotally divorced\u201d from a criminal investigation, proof that a crime has been or is being committed adds nothing to a community caretaker analysis. But here, by opining that some \u201cadditional fact\u201d would have justified the officers\u2019 warrantless entry, the majority, in essence, seems to be requiring a showing of probable cause as a prerequisite for application of the community caretaker doctrine. That is, the majority implies that, in order to have an objectively reasonable belief that an individual is in need of assistance, the officers must also have probable cause to believe that a crime has been or is being committed. In practical effect, then, the majority is subsuming the community caretaker doctrine into the exigent circumstances exception. I simply cannot join in this result. <em>See generally Laney, </em>117 S.W.3d at 860-61 (discussing the distinction between the community caretaker doctrine and the exigent circumstances exception); Mary Elisabeth Naumann, <em>Note, \u201cThe Community Caretaking Doctrine: Yet Another Fourth Amendment Exception,\u201d </em>26 Am. J.Crim. L. 325, 332 (1999) (\u201c[T]he reasoning behind the community caretaker doctrine precludes an equation ... [with the] exigent circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>[exception] because the latter necessarily involves criminal considerations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">For these reasons, I would hold that the officers\u2019 warrant-less entry was justified pursuant to the community caretaker exception to the warrant requirement. Had these officers\u2019 worst fears been justified and had hindsight disclosed a resident either deceased or in desperate need of medical assistance, I doubt that either the resident, assuming he or she survived, or the general public would accept the majority\u2019s reasoning that it would not be \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d for police to investigate such suspicious circumstances. Thus, although I agree that the trial court did not err in denying Kyer\u2019s motion to suppress, I disagree with the analysis of the majority and, consequently, concur only in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b537-8\">. Although the \"emergency doctrine\u201d is often equated to the \"exigent circumstances\u201d exception to the warrant requirement, the two differ slightly. When officers conduct an emergency entry for purposes of investigating a crime, the emergency is considered an \"exigency\u201d for purposes of the exigent circumstances exception, and the officers must have probable cause before they can enter the residence. <em>See Commonwealth v. Thornton, </em>24 Va.App. 478, 484, 483 S.E.2d 487, 490 (1997) (recognizing that, \"[a]mong the circumstances accepted as providing \u2018exigent circumstances' for a warrantless search, are those where a true \u2018emergency\u2019 exists\u201d). If, however, the officers effectuate an emergency entry for a purpose <em>unrelated </em>to the investigation of a crime \u2014 for example, to provide emergency aid to an injured resident \u2014 then the entry is valid as long as the officers had an objectively reasonable belief that their help was needed. In this latter sense, the emergency excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>tion is functionally equivalent to, and sometimes deemed a subset of, the community caretaker doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b538-6\">. As this Court recognized in <em>Wood v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 21, 28, 497 S.E.2d 484, 487 (1998), the United States Supreme Court has yet to decide whether a warrantless intrusion into an individual\u2019s <em>home </em>may be supported pursuant to the community caretaker exception. Nevertheless, we have applied the exception to uphold warrantless searches in the context of a search of an automobile. <em>See Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 723, 731, 594 S.E.2d 305, 309 (2004); <em>Barrett, </em>18 Va.App. at 778, 447 S.E.2d at 246. We have also extended this doctrine to permit warrantless searches of pedestrians or citizens that an officer reasonably believes are in distress or in need of assistance. <em>See Terry v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 87, 91, 474 S.E.2d 172, 174 (1996); <em>Waters, </em>20 Va.App. at 289-90, 456 S.E.2d at 529-30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b539-9\">. <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b540-9\">. We have consistently required that any warrantless search, pursuant to either the community caretaker exception or the emergency exception, must be factually unrelated to an intent to search for evidence of illegal activity. <em>See Reynolds, 9 </em>Va.App. at 438, 388 S.E.2d at 664 (applying the emergency exception and noting that \"[n]o evidence in the record suggest[ed] that the [officers\u2019] entry into appellants\u2019 house ... was a pretext to search for contraband or illegal activity rather than to look for possible victims and to secure the property,\u201d and finding that the officers \"act[ed] in good faith under the circumstances and according to their responsibilities as law enforcement officers\u201d); <em>see also Williams, </em>42 Va.App. at 731, 594 S.E.2d at 309 (noting that a search, pursuant to impoundment of a vehicle and corresponding community caretaking functions, \"must not be a pretextual surrogate for an improper investigatory motive\u201d); <em>Waters, </em>20 Va.App. at 290, 456 S.E.2d at 530 (applying the community caretaker exception in the context of a police/pedestrian encounter and stating that \"[t]he appropriateness of applying the community caretaker doctrine to a given factual scenario is determined by,\u201d among other things, \"whether ... the officer is not investigating criminal conduct under the pretext of exercising his community caretaker function\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b546-6\">FITZPATRICK, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ARUM\">with whom BENTON, and ELDER, JJ., join, concurring, in part, and dissenting, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">I concur in the majority\u2019s ruling that the community caretaker exemption to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement did not justify the police entry into appellant\u2019s apartment. However, I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority opinion that holds that appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s later consent to search was \u201csufficiently an act of free will\u201d to purge the originally illegality. <em>See Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 486, 83 S.Ct. 407, 416-17, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). Thus, I would reverse the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Having determined that the initial entry into Kyer\u2019s home was made in violation of the Fourth Amendment and that Kyer\u2019s mother gave consent to the police to search the home, it is necessary to analyze whether this consent was obtained as the result of the illegal entry. I believe that the facts of this case glaringly fail to establish that the consent given by Kyer\u2019s mother was sufficiently attenuated from the earlier unlawful police entry to provide an independent basis for admitting the seized contraband.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>The exclusionary rule prohibits the introduction into evidence of tangible and testimonial evidence acquired during an unlawful search, while also prohibiting the introduction of derivative evidence \u201cthat is the product of the primary evidence, or that is otherwise acquired as an indirect result of the unlawful search, up to the point at which the connection with the unlawful search becomes \u2018so attenuated as too dissipate the taint.\u2019 \u201d The exclusionary rule\u2019s prohibition of derivative evidence is the essence of the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-5\"><em>Commonwealth v. Ealy, </em>12 Va.App. 744, 754, 407 S.E.2d 681, 687-88 (1991) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The remaining question to be resolved is whether the later acquired evidence is tainted and was \u201ccome at by exploitation of the initial illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d <em>Segura v. United States, </em>468 U.S. 796, 804-05, 104 S.Ct. 3380, 3385, 82 L.Ed.2d 599 (1984). As stated by the Supreme Court in <em>Brown v. Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975), the fact that the consent ultimately given may have been voluntary, does not mean that the primary taint has been purged. <em>Id. </em>at 599, 95 S.Ct. at 2260. Factors that must be considered include the temporal proximity of the illegal entry, whether Kyer\u2019s mother was informed that she could withhold her consent, any additional intervening circumstances between the entry and the consent, and the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 603-04, 95 S.Ct. at 2261-62. <em>See also Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 421, 433-35, 559 S.E.2d 374, 379-80 (2002); <em>Walls v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 639, 654, 347 S.E.2d 175, 183 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">In the instant case, the facts establish that the police entered Kyer\u2019s home at 4:00 a.m. after failing to awaken the sleeping occupants. They went into Ms. Kyer\u2019s bedroom with their flashlights shining and their guns drawn. They identified themselves as police and after allowing her time to \u201cget herself together,\u201d but within ten minutes of the original contact, began to question her about her son\u2019s possible involvement in the theft they were investigating when they first came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>to her home. At that point she consented to the search. Ten minutes is hardly a reasonable period of time in which to recover from the police entry into a private home with guns drawn. Thus, there was no significant passage of time and the temporal intervention requirement was unmet. <em>See Taylor v. Alabama, </em>457 U.S. 687, 691, 102 S.Ct. 2664, 2667, 78 L.Ed.2d 314 (1982) (six hours between illegal arrest and confession); <em>Brown, </em>422 U.S. at 604, 95 S.Ct. at 2262 (two hours between arrest and confession).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Next, Ms. Kyer was never informed that she could refuse to consent to the police search. There were no other intervening circumstances between the police entry and their questioning of Ms. Kyer which led to her consent. The only <em>Brown </em>factor favorable to the Commonwealth\u2019s position is that the trial court found that the initial entry was not pretextural. While I agree with the majority that no single factor controls and a \u201ccareful sifting of the unique facts and circumstances of each case\u201d is required, the facts of this case do not establish the requisite break in the causal connection between the illegal entry and the later consent to search. This evidence was \u201c \u2018come at by exploitation of that illegality ... instead of by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 488, 83 S.Ct. at 418 (citation omitted).
