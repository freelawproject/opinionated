(\u201cemployer\u201d) discharged appellant Phillip L. Artis for cause after Artis staged a robbery in an attempt to murder a co-worker. Following his termination, Artis filed a claim with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, seeking temporary partial disability benefits. The commission denied Artis\u2019 claim, reasoning that Artis had forfeited his right to temporary disability benefits because his termination was attributable to his volitional misconduct rather than his disability. On appeal, Artis contends that the commission erred in denying his claim because the misconduct resulting in his termination was, in turn, caused by his compensable psychiatric disorder. For the reasons that follow, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>affirm the commission\u2019s denial of temporary partial disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Artis was formerly employed as a route salesman for employer, a position requiring Artis to drive a bakery delivery truck in and around the Washington metropolitan area. On October 2, 1999, Artis was driving a delivery truck along Interstate 66 in Fairfax County while en route to one of employer\u2019s customers. At approximately 3:45 a.m., Artis came upon an apparent \u201croad rage\u201d incident on the interstate. Several people involved in the incident got out of their vehicles and ran across the highway in front of Artis\u2019 truck. The last person attempting to cross the highway darted directly in the path of the truck. Although Artis tried to avoid hitting that individual, he was unable to do so, striking and killing the pedestrian.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Artis, who was in a \u201cdaze\u201d and hyperventilating after the accident, called employer to report the incident. Artis told his manager that he was too distraught to finish the shift, but the manager informed him that Artis had to complete the delivery route because employer did not have any other employees who could replace him. Artis finished his route, completed his paperwork, and drove himself home.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Two days later, Artis went to the Providence Hospital Wellness Institute, seeking medical treatment for back pain. He was diagnosed with thoracic strain and excused from work through October 10, 1999. On October 11, Artis returned to the Wellness Institute for a follow-up evaluation. Artis reported that he was unable to drive and was suffering from emotional distress because of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">On October 12, 1999, Dr. Cecil Harris, a clinical psychologist, evaluated Artis\u2019 mental condition. Artis told Dr. Harris that, after the accident, he began to experience flashbacks, fearing \u201cthat it would happen again\u201d and that he would be \u201cthought of as a killer.\u201d Those feelings caused Artis to experience \u201cdepression to the point ... [he] was suicidal.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Artis had also developed a fear of driving and crossing the street, occasionally suffered from anxiety attacks, had trouble sleeping and getting out of bed, and had experienced problems maintaining an erection. Artis additionally told Dr. Harris that, three years earlier, he had received psychological treatment for \u201crage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Dr. Harris found that Artis\u2019 initial mental examination \u201crevealed a nervous, tense/anxious, depressed, agitated, phobic male who was fully oriented with sad, hopeless, and depressed affect, and depressed/irritable mood,\u201d and who \u201cdenied suicidal and homicidal ideation and was having trouble containing paranoid, hostile, and violent urges secondary to his anxious, agitated feelings.\u201d Dr. Harris diagnosed Artis as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) and \u201cAdjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood,\u201d and he initiated a \u201ctreatment plan of twice weekly, or as needed psychotherapy.\u201d As part of his treatment, Artis also took Zyprexa, an anti-depressant. Dr. Harris additionally recommended that, when Artis returned to work, he should initially ride with another driver, then have another driver with him, and, ultimately, drive by himself \u201cwhen ready.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Thus, when Artis returned to work on October 25, 1999, he assumed a selective duty capacity. He began riding along with other drivers, and he later began to drive by himself, sometimes accompanied by a co-driver. By at least January of 2000, Artis \u201cwas returned to full duty with the stipulation if [he] need[ed] help, [he could] ask the night manager and [help] would be provided.\u201d According to Artis, the night manager \u201crefused on a few occasions\u201d to provide him with the requested help.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Artis continued to undergo \u201cgenerally weekly and sometimes bi-weekly\u201d counseling sessions with Dr. Harris through July 2000. During these sessions, Artis reported continuing feelings of rage and depression. Artis still experienced occasional flashbacks, and he was having trouble sleeping. Artis also believed that employer was not supportive of his recovery efforts, and he felt that employer was deliberately trying to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>get him to leave the company by, for example, denying him a ride-along helper.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">After a few months of counseling with Dr. Harris, Artis\u2019 psychological condition seemed to be improving. However, on May 4, 2000, employer re-assigned Artis to the route he was driving in October 1999 when he struck and killed the pedestrian. At that point, Artis\u2019 psychological condition began to deteriorate, causing him to experience suicidal and homicidal tendencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In response to Artis\u2019 re-assignment to his former route, Dr. Harris wrote a letter to William Walker, employer\u2019s human resources manager. Dr. Harris informed Walker that Artis was \u201cgreatly stressed and somewhat regressed,\u201d presumably because he had been \u201cscheduled to service the route where his accident occurred on October 2, 1999.\u201d Dr. Harris further indicated that, although Artis \u201chas made much progress in his therapy and his rehabilitation is progressing well,\u201d Artis \u201cis clinically not ready to service that particular route at this time.\u201d Dr. Harris concluded that \u201c[i]t is important that we continue to work closely together towards supporting [Artis\u2019] full recovery.\u201d Employer, however, did not re-assign Artis to a different route.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">By the beginning of June 2000, Artis was still experiencing homicidal and suicidal tendencies, but he informed Dr. Harris that he was \u201ccoping [with the] new route,\u201d and had developed sufficient \u201cconfidence to move forward now [without] a rider.\u201d On June 14, however, Artis told Dr. Harris that, although he had recently been given a ride-along helper, the dispatcher had informed Artis that \u201cthere would be no new approval for a new rider.\u201d Dr. Harris told Artis that he would write or call employer regarding Artis\u2019\u201dneed for a rider from time to time.\u201d Artis later testified that, at that point, he blamed Walker for denying him a \u201cride along helper,\u201d and he believed Walker was \u201coperating to get [him] out of the company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">On June 29, 2000, Artis \u201cfaked\u201d a robbery of the delivery truck he was driving, and he filed a false police report indicating that he had been robbed of \u201c[b]etween two and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>three hundred\u201d dollars. Artis staged the robbery because he expected Walker to respond to the scene of the reported robbery, at which time he intended to kill Walker. Artis later testified that his intent was \u201cto do the same harm [to Walker that Walker] was doing to my family.\u201d He wanted to \u201cget even\u201d because he felt that Walker failed to adequately respond to Artis\u2019 difficulties in performing his job. Artis also testified that he staged the robbery attempt because \u201cthe bills were mounting\u201d and he was having difficulty with child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">About an hour after the staged robbery, Artis was arrested, and he pled guilty to the charge of filing a false police report. After his arrest, employer fired Artis because of his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">On October 2, 2001, Artis filed a claim for benefits arising out of the accident of October 2, 1999. Artis alleged that he \u201cinjured his back and suffered psychological injuries, including post-traumatic stress disorder as a direct result\u201d of the compensable accident. Artis sought medical benefits, an award of temporary total disability from October 2, 1999 through December 17, 1999, and temporary partial disability compensation for various periods following the termination of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">At the hearing before the deputy commissioner, employer stipulated that, in October 1999, Artis experienced a compensable accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. Employer also acknowledged that there was some injury to claimant\u2019s back and some psychological injury resulting from that accident. Employer further agreed that some compensation was voluntarily paid and that \u201cpsychiatric treatment [was] authorized and paid for at least up until a certain point.\u201d Employer defended the claim on the grounds that Artis was not disabled in the nature or to the extent alleged, that there was no causal relationship between the injury and the subsequent periods of disability, and that Artis was not entitled to any partial disability benefits after he was terminated for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Artis contended, however, that he was entitled to post-termination temporary partial disability benefits because the misconduct that led to his termination was caused by his compensable disability. As proof of causation, Artis introduced a letter, dated July 18, 2000, that Dr. Harris had sent to Artis\u2019 union president. In this letter, Dr. Harris summarized Artis\u2019 diagnosis and treatment for PTSD, concluding that, \u201cArtis discussed in detail the incident of 06/29/00 in therapy. It is my opinion, based on the information I have, that Artis\u2019 involvement in this incident is related to his diagnosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Artis also introduced Dr. Harris\u2019 response to a letter from Artis\u2019 counsel, dated September 24, 2002. In this questionnaire, when asked to explain the basis for his conclusion that the \u201cfeigned robbery resulted directly from [claimant\u2019s] accident-related psychiatric condition,\u201d Harris responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">I still hold the opinion that the feigned robbery of 06/29/00 resulted directly from [ ] Artis\u2019[ ] accident-related psychiatric condition. Mr. Artis was still actively traumatized by his 10/02/99 fatality, on 06/29/00. He was also frustrated, angry, fearful and problem-solving very poorly at that time. He was sleep deprived [with] suicidal ideation as well. In his mind this was not an act of robbery, but one of symbolically regaining his loss of control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The deputy commissioner found that Artis \u201cexperienced a compensable injury by accident on October 2,1999, as alleged, resulting primarily in a post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201d The deputy commissioner also determined that \u201cclaimant carried his burden of proving entitlement to temporary [total] disability compensation from October 4, 1999, through October 10, 1999.\u201d The deputy commission further held, however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACD\">that the employer\u2019s termination of the claimant on June 29, 2000, based upon his fabrication of a robbery and the filing of a false police report, was for justified cause sufficient to permanently bar the claimant\u2019s entitlement to partial wage loss compensation thereafter.... We further conclude that the claimant\u2019s wage loss after June 29, 2000, <em>is properly attributable to his own conduct, </em>and not to any disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>resulting from the October 2, 1999 injury by accident. We reach this conclusion notwithstanding Dr. Harris\u2019 opinion that on June 29, 2000, the claimant remained \u201cactively traumatized\u201d by the events of October 2, 1999, and that his action in feigning the robbery attempt was \u201cone of symbolically regaining his loss of control.\u201d To the extent the claimant then felt pressured by. the employer to resume his normal work activities, a conclusion we doubt based upon our assessment of the claimant\u2019s credibility, the claimant had various other options available to him other than feigning a robbery so that he might attempt a murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Artis appealed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision to the full commission. The commission affirmed, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">The evidence in this case establishes that the claimant was under some restrictions at the time of his discharge. He was discharged after he feigned a robbery with the intent to harm an individual employed by the employer. Dr. Harris implicated a variety of factors which led to this behavior, including the claimant\u2019s frustration and anger. A close review of Dr. Harris\u2019[] contemporaneous treatment notes, as well as the claimant\u2019s testimony, demonstrates that the claimant\u2019s main problems were not directly related to his accident. The claimant\u2019s problems involved anger at his employer, and frustration over his financial status and his ongoing situation relative to perceived problems with accommodations and other employment issues not directly related to the initial trauma. These problems are of a nature more akin to stress resulting from an employee\u2019s interaction with his supervisors, which is not compensable. <em>See Teasley v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., </em>14 Va.App. 45, 415 S.E.2d 596 (1992). We also note that the documentary [evidence] reveals pre-existing problems with anger or \u201crage,\u201d despite the claimant\u2019s denials to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">We find that the totality of the evidence shows that the claimant was responsible for his wrongful actions on June 29, 2000. Under the circumstances presented, we agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>that the claimant was discharged for justified cause, supporting the forfeiture of benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Artis appealed this decision to this Court. By opinion dated June 1, 2004, a panel of this Court, with one judge dissenting, reversed the commission, concluding that \u201cthere is no credible evidence in the record to support the commission\u2019s finding that claimant was discharged from selective employment for reasons unrelated to his compensable work-related accident.\u201d <em>Artis v. Ottenberg\u2019s Bakers, Inc., </em>43 Va.App. 137, 157, 596 S.E.2d 547, 557 (2004), Accordingly, the panel remanded this case to the commission \u201cfor the purpose of calculating the amount of claimant\u2019s post-termination workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164, 596 S.E.2d at 560-61.</p>\n<p id=\"ACd\">We granted employer\u2019s petition for rehearing <em>en banc, </em>stayed the mandate of the panel decision, and reinstated the appeal. Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we affirm the commission\u2019s denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the commission erred in concluding that Artis\u2019 misconduct justified a forfeiture of his disability benefits. Artis argues that his misconduct did not justify forfeiture because it was caused by his compensable disability. We, however, agree with employer that there is credible evidence in the record supporting the commission\u2019s determination that Artis\u2019 termination was attributable to his wrongful, volitional conduct rather than his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">On appeal from a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence are viewed in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below. <em>Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Reed, </em>40 Va.App. 69, 72, 577 S.E.2d 538, 539 (2003); <em>Tomes v. James City (County of) Fire, </em>39 Va.App. 424, 429, 573 S.E.2d 312, 315 (2002). Also, \u201c[w]e do not judge the credibility of witnesses or weigh the evidence on appeal.\u201d <em>Celanese Fibers Co. v. Johnson, </em>229 Va. 117, 121, 326 S.E.2d 687, 690 (1985). Rather, we are bound by the commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>findings of fact as long as \u201cthere was credible evidence presented such that a reasonable mind <em>could </em>conclude that the fact in issue was proved,\u201d <em>Westmoreland Coal Co. v. Campbell, </em>7 Va.App. 217, 222, 372 S.E.2d 411, 415 (1988) (emphasis in original), even if there is evidence in the record that would support a contrary finding. <em>Morris v. Badger Powhatan/Figgie Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>3 Va.App. 276, 279, 348 S.E.2d 876, 877 (1986); <em>Russell Loungewear v. Gray, 2 </em>Va.App. 90, 95, 341 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">It is well settled that, \u201cwhere a disabled employee is terminated for cause from selective employment procured or offered by his employer, any subsequent wage loss is properly attributable to his wrongful act rather than his disability.\u201d <em>Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co. v. Murphy, </em>12 Va.App. 633, 639-40, 406 S.E.2d 190,193, <em>ajfd en banc, </em>13 Va.App. 304, 411 S.E.2d 444 (1991). Thus, an employee \u201cwho is terminated for cause and for reasons not concerning his disability is not entitled to receive compensation benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637, 406 S.E.2d at 192 (discussing <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Watson, </em>219 Va. 830, 252 S.E.2d 310 (1979)); <em>see also Potomac Edison Co. v. Cash, </em>18 Va.App. 629, 631, 446 S.E.2d 155, 157 (1994) (\u201cUnder the Act, an employee who is properly terminated from selective employment procured by the employer for cause consisting of willful misconduct forfeits his or her entitlement to future temporary partial disability benefits.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">As we have noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">\u201cA justified discharge ... does not simply mean that the employer can identify or assign a reason attributable to the employee as the cause for his or her being discharged. Whether the reason[ ] for the discharge is for cause, or is justified for purposes of forfeiting benefits must be determined in the context of the purpose of the Act and <em>whether the conduct is of such a nature that it warrants permanent forfeiture of those rights and benefits.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-7\"><em>Walter Reed Convalescent Ctr. v. Reese, </em>24 Va.App. 328, 336, 482 S.E.2d 92, 96-97 (1997) (quoting <em>Eppling v. Schultz Dining Programs, </em>18 Va.App. 125, 128, 442 S.E.2d 219, 221 (1994)) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>(alteration and omission in original) (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Also, it is not necessary to prove \u201cthat the employee\u2019s wrongful act was intentional, willful, or deliberate in order to justify a termination for cause and a forfeiture of compensation benefits.\u201d <em>Reese, </em>24 Va.App. at 336-87, 482 S.E.2d at 97. Rather, all that is required is a showing: (1) that the wage loss is \u201cproperly attributable\u201d to the wrongful act; and (2) that the employee is \u201cresponsible\u201d for that wrongful act. <em>Id, </em>at 336, 482 S.E.2d at 97 (\u201c \u2018In order to work a forfeiture, the wage loss [must be] properly attributable to [the employee\u2019s] wrongful act ... for which the employee is responsible.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Eppling, </em>18 Va.App. at 129, 442 S.E.2d at 222 (alterations and omission in original) (internal quotations omitted))).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">A. <em>Whether Artis\u2019 Termination Was \u201cAttributable\u201d to His Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In determining whether a claimant\u2019s termination was \u201cattributable\u201d to the claimant\u2019s wrongful act, the overriding inquiry is as follows: Was the claimant fired because of his disability, or was he fired because of his misconduct?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>making this determination, the commission should \u201cconsider the nature of [the] conduct\u201d alleged to justify the dismissal. <em>Eppling, </em>18 Va.App. at 129, 442 S.E.2d at 221. Ultimately, the burden of proof is on the claimant to demonstrate that his termination was attributable to his disability rather than his wrongful act. <em>See Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. v. Harrison, </em>228 Va. 598, 600-02, 324 S.E.2d 654, 655-56 (1985) (holding that claimant who had no previous disability award entered in his favor had the burden to prove that he was entitled to temporary total disability benefits following termination of employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Here, then, we must consider whether Artis was fired because of his disability <em>(e.g., </em>because his disability prevented him from adequately performing his duties), or whether he was fired for another reason entirely. The commission found that Artis failed to carry his burden of proving that his termination was attributable to his disability, concluding that Artis was discharged not because of his disability, but because he became angry with employer and, as a result, \u201cfeigned a robbery with the intent to harm an individual employed by the employer.\u201d There is credible evidence in the record supporting this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Specifically, the record indicates that Artis had been performing his full duties and receiving fall wages for at least six months preceding the staged robbery. Also, Artis was not fired because, for example, his disability rendered him unable to drive certain routes or perform the physical duties required by his job. <em>See, e.g., Watson, </em>219 Va. at 833, 252 S.E.2d at 312-13 (holding that, where the claimant failed to \u201cmake any claim that [his] job ... was too difficult for him to perform because of his [ ] injury ... it cannot be inferred from any evidence in the record that [he] was discharged as a result of his [] injury\u201d). As noted by the deputy commissioner, employer \u201chad modified [Artis\u2019] activities as of his return to work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>to accommodate the continuing effects of his diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder,\u201d and Artis \u201cwas at least some times provided an assistant and permitted to avoid driving his normal pre-injury route.\u201d Rather than being fired because he demanded an assistant or did not wish to drive his \u201cnormal\u201d route, it is uncontradicted that Artis was fired because he staged a robbery, misappropriating between $200 and $300 of the employer\u2019s funds, with the intent of murdering his supervisor once he arrived at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Additionally, the \u201cnature of [the] conduct\u201d resulting in Artis\u2019 dismissal, <em>Eppling, </em>18 Va.App. at 129, 442 S.E.2d at 221, certainly justifies a forfeiture of temporary partial disability benefits. Artis himself testified that he acted with premeditation, and with knowledge of his actions and the consequences of those actions. Attempted homicide constitutes precisely the type of \u201cwrongful act\u201d that should \u201cjustif[y]\u201d a forfeiture of compensation benefits. <em>Murphy, </em>12 Va.App. at 639, 406 S.E.2d at 193; <em>cf. Watson, </em>219 Va. at 833, 252 S.E.2d at 313 (holding that a partially disabled employee\u2019s benefits were properly terminated when the employee was discharged because he had been \u201can exceedingly poor worker during the entire period of his employment ... he had a great number of absences from work, and ... several times he left his job without authorization\u201d); <em>Marval Poultry Co. v. Johnson, </em>224 Va. 597, 598, 299 S.E.2d 343, 344 (1983) (holding that a disabled employee on selective work status was no longer entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits when \u201che [was] discharged by his employer for dishonesty\u201d); <em>Murphy, </em>12 Va.App. at 639, 406 S.E.2d at 193 (holding that an employee\u2019s conduct constituted \u201ccause\u201d for discharge, justifying a forfeiture of benefits, where he was guilty <em>of </em>fraudulent misrepresentations in his attempt to obtain compensation benefits); <em>Richfood, Inc. v. Williams, </em>20 Va.App. 404, 410, 457 S.E.2d 417, 420 (1995) (\u201cWhere passing drug and alcohol screening is made a clear and unequivocal condition of employment, ... failure to pass the screening is tantamount to misconduct ... for which an employee can be terminated.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Artis contends, however, that the commission erred in determining that his termination was not attributable to his disability because his disability caused the misconduct that, in turn, caused his termination. Initially, we note that the critical inquiry here is not whether there is a causal relationship between the disability and the claimant\u2019s <em>misconduct. </em>Rather, we are concerned with the relationship between the disability and the claimant\u2019s <em>termination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Regardless, we decline Artis\u2019 implicit offer to recognize a rule that would permit a claimant to show that he is entitled to post-termination benefits because, in an \u201cunbroken chain of events,\u201d his disability was a contributing cause of the misconduct resulting in his termination. Because such a rule would inevitably lead to absurd results, we hold instead that there must be an immediate, proximate nexus between the disability and the termination for the termination to be deemed \u201cattributable to\u201d the disability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">As the commission correctly found, that immediate nexus is lacking here: Artis was discharged because he staged a robbery, not because he was disabled. Thus, there is not, as Artis contends, an \u201cunbroken chain of events\u201d between Artis\u2019 compensable disability and his termination. Rather, Artis\u2019 own willful, volitional misconduct constitutes an intervening cause sufficient to break that chain of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Moreover, the commission expressly rejected Artis\u2019 contention that his psychiatric condition directly caused his misconduct, finding instead that Artis\u2019 misconduct was caused by \u201canger at his employer, and frustration over his financial status and his ongoing situation relative to perceived problems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>with accommodations and other employment issues not directly related to the initial trauma.\u201d This conclusion is supported by credible evidence in the record. Specifically, the record indicates that, despite having been paid full wages for at least six months, Artis\u2019 \u201cbills were mounting,\u201d and he was having difficulty paying for child support. Also, Artis had experienced previous problems with \u201crage,\u201d and he was becoming increasingly angry with his employer for re-assigning him to a route that he (understandably) did not wish to drive. Thus, credible evidence in the record supports the commission\u2019s conclusion that Artis\u2019 misconduct was caused by stress \u201cresulting from [his] interaction with his supervisors,\u201d not his psychiatric condition or its residual effects.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">We also reject Artis\u2019 argument that our decision in <em>Food Distributors v. Estate of Ball, </em>24 Va.App. 692, 485 S.E.2d 155 (1997), compels a different result. In <em>Estate of Ball, </em>the decedent suffered a job-related, compensable injury. <em>Id. </em>at 695, 485 S.E.2d at 157. Following the injury, the decedent was \u201cunable to work full time or to engage in simple, repetitive tasks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, he fell into a depression and ultimately committed suicide. <em>Id. </em>at 695-96, 485 S.E.2d at 157. The decedent\u2019s widow filed a claim for benefits, contending that the decedent\u2019s suicide was caused by his earlier, job-related injury. <em>Id. </em>at 696, 485 S.E.2d at 157. The employer, however, citing to Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(1),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> argued that \u201cthe commission erred in awarding benefits to claimant because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>decedent\u2019s suicide was an independent and willful act that barred compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697, 485 S.E.2d at 158. We affirmed the commission\u2019s award of benefits, holding that the record contained credible evidence indicating that the suicide was causally related to the earlier injury. <em>Id. </em>at 703-06, 485 S.E.2d at 161-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><em>Estate of Ball </em>is, however, inapposite to this case for three reasons. First and foremost, <em>Estate of Ball </em>concerned the doctrine of compensable consequences rather than the termination for cause doctrine. The doctrine of compensable consequences, also known as the chain of causation rule, is applicable when a claimant asserts that a subsequent injury should be compensable because it was \u201ccaused by\u201d an earlier, compensable injury. <em>See, e.g., Leadbetter, Inc. v. Penkalski, </em>21 Va.App. 427, 432, 464 S.E.2d 554, 556 (1995) (\u201c[W]here ... the chain of causation from the original industrial injury to the condition for which compensation is sought is direct, and not interrupted by any intervening cause attributable to the [employee\u2019s] own intentional conduct, then the subsequent [condition] should be compensable.\u201d (internal quotations omitted)). The doctrine of compensable consequences, therefore, deals not with the causal relationship between a termination and an injury, but rather, the causal relationship between an earlier injury and a subsequent injury. In contrast, the termination for cause doctrine applies when the claimant asserts that he was terminated because of his earlier, compensable injury. These are, therefore, entirely separate inquiries: One focuses on whether the claimant\u2019s <em>termination </em>was \u201cattributable to\u201d a prior compensable injury, and the other focuses on whether the claimant\u2019s <em>injury </em>was \u201ccaused by\u201d a prior compensable injury. Thus, the two doctrines cannot be intermingled \u2014 they deal with entirely separate circumstances and entirely separate rules of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Second, <em>Estate of Ball </em>involved the reconciliation of the statutory language \u201cwillful misconduct or intentional self-inflicted injury\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 65.2-306(A)(1) with eases involving suicide. There is no issue of statutory construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>tion \u2014 or suicide \u2014 involved in this ease. And third, <em>Estate of Ball affirmed </em>the commission\u2019s award of benefits, finding that credible evidence supported the commission\u2019s determination that the decedent\u2019s death was causally related to his injury. Here, in contrast, the commission <em>denied </em>Artis\u2019 claim of benefits, so we must affirm the commission\u2019s decision as long as there is credible evidence in the record supporting the commission\u2019s finding that Artis\u2019 termination was not attributable to his compensable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">In sum, there is ample evidence in the record supporting the commission\u2019s conclusion that Artis was fired because of his misconduct, not because of his disability. Thus, we affirm the commission\u2019s conclusion that Artis\u2019 termination was not attributable to his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">B. <em>Whether Artis Was \u201cResponsible\u201d for His Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">In determining whether the claimant was \u201cresponsible\u201d for his wrongful act, the crucial determination is whether the claimant\u2019s misconduct was voluntary or involuntary. A disabled employee who engages in voluntary misconduct is deemed to have constructively refused an offer of selective employment, thereby justifying a forfeiture of benefits. <em>See, e.g., Porter v. Ford Motor Co., </em>109 Mich.App. 728, 311 N.W.2d 458, 460 (1981) (\u201cA disabled employee who can perform that favored work, yet violates company rules to the extent that discharge is justified, in actuality is refusing to perform the favored work[,][ ] thus creating a bar to compensation____\u201d); <em>see also Richmond Cold Storage Co. v. Burton, </em>1 Va.App. 106, 111, 335 S.E.2d 847, 850 (1985) (noting that \u201can employee is guilty of \u2018misconduct connected with his work\u2019 when he <em>deliberately </em>violates a company rule\u201d (emphasis in original)). In contrast, conduct that is involuntary does not justify a forfeiture of benefits because it is, by its very nature, beyond the employee\u2019s control and, therefore, not equivalent to a constructive refusal of selective employment. <em>See, e.g., Reese, </em>24 Va.App. at 338, 482 S.E.2d at 98 (noting that, in <em>Eppling, </em>\u201cwe held that the claimant\u2019s excessive absenteeism caused by a non-work-related injury <em>beyond the employee\u2019s control </em>was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>the type of wrongful act which, upon termination, justified a forfeiture of workers\u2019 compensation benefits\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Under the circumstances of this case, there is credible evidence in the record supporting the commission\u2019s decision that Artis \u201cwas responsible for his wrongful actions on June 29, 2000.\u201d Although Dr. Harris opined that Artis\u2019 conduct was caused by his PTSD, there is no evidence that this \u201ccausal relationship\u201d affected Artis to such an extent that his actions were \u201cbeyond [his] control.\u201d <em>Reese, </em>24 Va.App. at 338-39, 482 S.E.2d at 97-98. Although Artis did offer proof that his accident resulted in a compensable psychiatric disorder, the evidence did not indicate that his mental state had deteriorated to the point that he was no longer able to control his actions. In fact, Artis himself testified that he acted with premeditation, and with knowledge of his actions and the consequences of those actions. Thus, credible evidence in the record supports the commission\u2019s determination that Artis was responsible for his voluntary misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Artis contends that our decision in <em>Timbrook v. O\u2019Sullivan Corp., </em>17 Va.App. 594, 439 S.E.2d 873 (1994), mandates a different result. In <em>TimbrooJc,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">[we] held that the <em>Murphy </em>forfeiture rule does not apply to an employee who was discharged for failing to notify her employer that she would be absent from selective employment <em>that she had refused. </em>Because the employee had refused, or not accepted, the employer\u2019s offer of selective employment, her termination following three consecutive absences was \u201cnot for cause or for misconduct, as in <em>Murphy, </em>[which would] justify a forfeiture of her compensation benefits that could never be cured.\u201d <em>[Timbrook, </em>17 Va.App. at 598, 439 S.E.2d at 876].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-7\"><em>Eppling, </em>18 Va.App. at 129-30, 442 S.E.2d at 222 (discussing <em>Timbrook, </em>17 Va.App. at 598, 439 S.E.2d at 876) (emphasis added). Unlike the claimant in <em>TimbrooJc, </em>Artis <em>accepted </em>employer\u2019s offer of selective employment. Thus, <em>TimbrooJc </em>is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>As noted by the deputy commissioner, \u201c[t]o the extent [Artis] then felt pressured by the employer to resume his normal work activities, ... [he] had various other options available to him other than feigning a robbery so that he might attempt a murder.\u201d Thus, because Artis\u2019 misconduct was purely voluntary in nature, the commission did not err in determining that Artis\u2019 termination for cause justified a forfeiture of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Accordingly, the commission correctly determined that Artis was terminated, not for reasons attributable to his injury or its residual effects, but for misconduct for which he was fully \u201cresponsible.\u201d Although we certainly do not condone the insensitive manner in which employer apparently treated Artis following his industrial accident, the reprehensibility of employer\u2019s conduct is not at issue here. Rather, we are constrained to deciding the issue of whether credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s determination that Artis\u2019 termination was attributable to his volitional misconduct rather than his disability. Here, because the record supports the commission\u2019s determination that employer did not terminate Artis because of his injury or its \u201cresidual effects,\u201d but rather, because of his voluntary, criminal acts, we affirm the commission\u2019s denial of post-termination partial disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-7\">. In construing <em>Murphy </em>and <em>Watson, </em>we note that we have used inconsistent and potentially confusing language when discussing this aspect of the forfeiture rule. For example, we have questioned whether the claimant's dismissal was \"concerning,\u201d <em>Richfood Inc. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>20 Va.App. 404, 408, 457 S.E.2d 417, 419 (1995); <em>Timbrook v. O\u2019Sullivan Corp., </em>17 Va.App. 594, 597, 439 S.E.2d 873, 875 (1994), \"related to,\u201d <em>Williams, </em>20 Va.App. at 409, 457 S.E.2d at 419; <em>Timbrook, </em>17 Va.App. at 595, 439 S.E.2d at 874, \"caused by,\" <em>Reese, </em>24 Va.App. at 338, 482 S.E.2d at 97; <em>Eppling, </em>18 Va.App. at 130, 442 S.E.2d at 222, \"as a result of,\u201d <em>Watson, </em>219 Va. at 833, 252 S.E.2d at 313, \"attributable to,\u201d <em>Eppling, </em>18 Va.App, at 129, 442 S.E.2d at 222, \"as a consequence of,\u201d <em>Williams, </em>20 Va.App. at 406, 457 S.E.2d at 418; <em>Eppling, </em>18 Va.App. at 130, 442 S.E.2d at 222, \"due to,\u201d <em>Williams, </em>20 Va.App. at 405, 457 S.E.2d at 417; <em>Eppling, </em>18 Va.App. at 129, 442 S.E.2d at 222, or \"causally related to,\u201d <em>Reese, </em>24 Va.App. at 330, 482 S.E.2d at 93, his compensable disability. Each of these phrases has a slightly different import. But regardless of which language is employed, the underlying focus is the same: Was the claimant fired because of his disability, or was he fired for another reason entirely? <em>See, e.g., Marval Poultry Co. v. Johnson, </em>224 Va. 597, 601, 299 S.E.2d 343, 345 (1983) (holding that claimant was not entitled to post-termination disability benefits where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>\"there is nothing in the record from which it may reasonably be inferred that [the claimant] was dismissed <em>because of </em>his [disability]\u201d rather than his dishonesty (emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b136-7\">. So, for example, if a claimant hurts his back, and \u2014 because of the pain \u2014 becomes an alcoholic, and is later fired because he appears for work in an inebriated state, he cannot then claim that his termination was \"attributable to\" his disability even though there is an attenuated chain of causation between the disability and the misconduct that caused his termination. In contrast, if that same claimant hurts his back, and is fired because he is no longer able to perform his duties, this more immediate nexus would suffice to show that his termination was \u201cattributable to\u201d his disability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b137-6\">. We also note that this is not a case where the commission was required to accept the \"uncontradicted medical evidence\u201d of one of the parties. Artis\u2019 only evidence that his misconduct was directly related to his disability was the opinion of his psychologist. Because a licensed psychologist is not a medical doctor, a psychologist\u2019s opinion is not actually \"medical\" evidence. <em>Cf. John v. Im, </em>263 Va. 315, 321, 559 S.E.2d 694, 697 (2002) (noting that an expert witness \"was a licensed psychologist, not a medical doctor\u201d).

Hence, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s analysis and conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">The sole issue before the commission was whether Artis was entitled to partial disability compensation following his termination from selective employment. Concluding, as the majori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ty notes, \u201cthat Artis failed to carry his burden of proving that his termination was attributable to his disability,\u201d the commission found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\">The evidence in this case establishes that the claimant was under some restrictions at the time of his discharge. He was discharged after he feigned a robbery with the intent to harm an individual employed by the employer. Dr. Harris implicated a variety of factors which led to this behavior, including the claimant\u2019s frustration and anger. A close review of Dr. Harris\u2019s contemporaneous treatment notes, as well as the claimant\u2019s testimony, demonstrates that the claimant\u2019s main problems were not directly related to his accident. The claimant\u2019s problems involved anger at his employer, and frustration over his financial status and his ongoing situation relative to perceived problems with accommodations and other employment issues not directly related to the initial trauma. These problems are of a nature more akin to stress resulting from an employee\u2019s interaction with his supervisors, which is not compensable. <em>See Teasley v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., </em>14 Va.App. 45, 415 S.E.2d 596 (1992). We also note that the documentary [evidence] reveals pre-existing problems with anger or \u201crage,\u201d despite the claimant\u2019s denials to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">We find that the totality of the evidence shows that the claimant was responsible for his wrongful actions on June 29, 2000. Under the circumstances presented, we agree that the claimant was discharged for justified cause, supporting the forfeiture of benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">On appeal, Artis does not challenge employer\u2019s right to terminate him for feigning the robbery. He argues, however, that his termination from selective employment did not justify a forfeiture of subsequent disability benefits because the evidence in the record supports no other conclusion than that his feigning the robbery was directly attributable to the post-traumatic stress disorder he suffered as a result of the October 2, 1999 compensable industrial accident. Thus, he contends the commission erred, as a matter of law, in finding that his post-termination wage loss was not causally related to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>compensable psychiatric disability and in ruling, based on that finding, that his discharge \u201cfor justified cause\u201d precluded him from receiving the requested post-termination wage-loss benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Employer concedes on appeal, as it did below, that, as a result of his industrial accident on October 2, 1999, Artis suffered a compensable psychiatric injury that was diagnosed as post-traumatic stress disorder. Employer maintains, however, that, because credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that Artis\u2019s feigning the robbery was attributable to his \u201cpre-existing problems with anger\u201d and \u201cthe stress that resulted from his interaction with employer, [and] not his work-related accident,\u201d this Court is bound by that finding. Because it is unrelated to the compensable accident, such stress, employer argues, in reliance on <em>Teasley, </em>14 Va.App. 45, 415 S.E.2d 596, provides no basis for post-termination disability benefits. Consequently, employer concludes, the commission correctly determined that Artis\u2019s willful misconduct justified the forfeiture of compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The determination whether the commission erred in concluding that Artis\u2019s feigning the robbery \u201cjustified a forfeiture of his disability benefits\u201d requires consideration of two inquiries: First, whether an injured employee\u2019s termination for cause from selective employment provided by the employer automatically bars the employee from receiving post-termination wage-loss benefits and, second, whether sufficient evidence exists to support the findings of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">In affirming the commission\u2019s decision, the majority, quoting <em>Walter Reed Convalescent Ctr. v. Reese, </em>24 Va.App. 328, 336-37, 482 S.E.2d 92, 97 (1997), holds that, when an employer discharges a partially disabled employee from selective employment for misconduct, \u201call that is required\u201d to \u201c \u2018justify ... a forfeiture of [post-termination] compensation benefits\u2019 \u201d is a \u201cshowing: (1) that the [fired employee\u2019s] wage loss is \u2018properly attributable\u2019 to the [employee\u2019s] wrongful act; and (2) that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>employee is \u2018responsible\u2019 for that wrongful act.\u201d I believe that, in reaching this conclusion, the majority misconstrues the applicable case law, which, in my view, also requires that the fired employee\u2019s wrongful act is not properly attributable to his or her work-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The so-called \u201ctermination for cause\u201d doctrine had its genesis in <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Watson, </em>219 Va. 830, 252 S.E.2d 310 (1979), and <em>Marval Poultry Co. v. Johnson, </em>224 Va. 597, 299 S.E.2d 343 (1983). In <em>Watson, </em>the claimant was fired by the employer because of his unsatisfactory selective work habits and performance. 219 Va. at 832, 252 S.E.2d at 312. The commission decided that the claimant was entitled to a resumption of ben\u00e9f\u00edts following his termination because, <em>inter alia, </em>his poor selective work performance \u201c \u2018could well [have been] attributable\u2019 \u201d to his work-related injury. 219 Va. at 833, 252 S.E.2d at 312. Finding no support for the commission\u2019s decision in the record, the Supreme Court of Virginia reversed the award, stressing that, \u201c[w]hen [the claimant\u2019s] actions and conduct in connection with his selected work ... [were] considered, it [could not] be inferred from any evidence in the record that [he] was discharged <em>as a result of his </em>... <em>injury.\u201d Id. </em>at 833, 252 S.E.2d at 312-13 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the claimant was discharged from selective employment for dishonesty. 224 Va. at 599, 299 S.E.2d at 344. The Supreme Court reversed the commission\u2019s decision awarding post-termination benefits, stating that \u201cthere [was] nothing in the record from which it [could] reasonably be inferred that [the claimant] was dismissed <em>because of his [accident-related] tendonitis.\u201d Id. </em>at 601, 299 S.E.2d at 345 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Examining <em>Watson </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>among other cases, this Court held in <em>C &amp; P Telephone Co. v.

In other words, a claimant\u2019s discharge from selective employment for willful misconduct does not, in itself, preclude the claimant from receiving post-termination wage-loss benefits if it is shown that the claimant\u2019s misconduct was properly attributable to his or her work-related injury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Eppling, </em>18 Va.App. at 128, 442 S.E.2d at 221. Thus, the determining factors in a case such as this are not solely the nature and willfulness of the misconduct that led to the injured employee\u2019s termination, but also the nature of the relationship, if any, between that misconduct and the employee\u2019s work-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">For example, in <em>Timbrook, </em>this Court determined that an injured employee\u2019s discharge from selective employment for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>work-related misconduct did not bar her right to post-termination compensation benefits because, among other reasons, the employee \u201cwas discharged for a \u2018reason[ ] concerning [her] disability.\u2019 \u201d 17 Va.App. at 599, 439 S.E.2d at 876.

Williams, </em>20 Va.App. 404, 409, 457 S.E.2d 417, 419 (1995) (emphases added), this Court held that an injured employee who was discharged from selective employment for work-related misconduct was not entitled to further disability benefits because \u201cthe reason for [the employee\u2019s] termination was <em>unrelated to Ms injury </em>and was due <em>solely </em>to his misconduct.\u201d Likewise, in <em>Reese, </em>24 Va.App. at 338-39, 482 S.E.2d at 97-98, this Court concluded that a partially disabled employee was not entitled to compensation for her post-termination wage loss because the employee\u2019s termination from selective employment for her \u201crepeated negligent errors\u201d at work was not caused by her compensable injury. This Court further explained in <em>Reese:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">In this case, the evidence established as a matter of law that claimant\u2019s wrongful acts ... <em>and not her injury or disability, </em>caused her wage loss. Thus, this loss was not employer\u2019s responsibility. The evidence established that claimant\u2019s termination was <em>unrelated to her injury </em>and was due <em>solely </em>to her misconduct.... In this case, credible evidence established that claimant\u2019s failure to properly perform her job was caused by her incompetence, <em>not her injury.

Hobson, </em>11 Va.App. 675, 678, 401 S.E.2d 213, 215 (1991) (holding that the claimant has the burden of establishing by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>preponderance of the evidence that he or she is entitled to compensation).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The commission found that Artis\u2019s discharge and resultant wage loss were not attributable to his October 2,1999 industrial accident but rather solely to his misconduct in feigning the robbery on June 29, 2000, for which he was responsible. In reaching that decision, the commission wholly rejected Dr. Harris\u2019s opinion that \u201cthe feigned robbery ... resulted directly from ... Artis\u2019s accident-related psychiatric condition.\u201d Relying instead on Dr. Harris\u2019s treatment notes and Artis\u2019s testimony, the commission found that Artis\u2019s misconduct was the result of his \u201canger at his employer, and frustration over his financial status and his ongoing situation relative to perceived problems with accommodations and other employment issues not directly related to the initial trauma.\u201d Such problems, the commission found, were \u201cof a nature more akin to stress resulting from an employee\u2019s interaction with his supervisors, which is not compensable,\u201d under <em>Teasley, </em>14 Va.App. 45, 415 S.E.2d 596. The commission added that Artis had \u201cpre-existing problems with anger or \u2018rage.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The determination whether a claimant\u2019s post-termination wage loss is causally related to his compensable injury by accident is a finding of fact. <em>See Reese, </em>24 Va.App. at 335, 337, 482 S.E.2d at 96-97; <em>Ingersoll-Rand Co. v.

To the contrary, I find that all of the relevant credible evidence in the record plainly supports the conclusion that Artis\u2019s action in feigning the robbery was directly related to his October 2, 1999 work-related accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The relevant evidence is undisputed. On October 2, 1999, Artis was involved in a traffic accident in which he unavoidably struck and killed a pedestrian with his delivery truck while working for employer. Because of that accident, Artis suffered from numerous emotional problems, including flashbacks of the accident, fear of driving and crossing the street, anxiety attacks, feelings of being a killer, trouble sleeping and getting out of bed, and problems maintaining an erection. Dr. Harris, a clinical psychologist who first treated Artis ten days after the accident and continued treating him several times a month thereafter through at least July 2000, noted at intake that, having suffered the accident, Artis was a \u201cnervous, tense/anxious, depressed, agitated, phobic male who was fully oriented with sad, hopeless, and depressed affect, and depressed/irritable mood,\u201d and who \u201cwas having trouble containing paranoid, hostile, and violent urges secondary to his anxious, agitated feelings.\u201d Dr. Harris specifically diagnosed Artis as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder directly caused by the October 2, 1999 industrial accident. Dr. Harris was positive in his diagnosis, and no evidence from any other mental health expert was provided to contradict that diagnosis. Employer accepted Artis\u2019s psychological injury as compensable and voluntarily authorized and paid for treatment of that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">At no point between October 12, 1999, and June 29, 2000, did Dr. Harris release Artis to full employment or otherwise indicate that Artis had recovered from his accident-related psychological injury. To the contrary, as Dr. Harris noted in his contemporaneous treatment notes, although Artis was able <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>to achieve \u201cbrief periods of higher level driving function\u201d at times, he continued to \u201cneed to temporarily self-modify his own driving exposure\u201d when the symptoms of his disorder affected his ability to drive safely. Indeed, the commission noted that Artis was still on selective employment at the time of the feigned robbery. Moreover, Dr. Harris\u2019s treatment notes indicate that Artis\u2019s underlying mental disorder continued throughout that period and adversely affected his ability to problem solve, control negative thoughts, and manage stress and anger during that entire time.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">As late as March 8, 2000, Dr. Harris wrote that, having started driving a new route on his own, Artis was thinking \u201cmore about violence\u201d and had concerns about his ability to control his anger. Dr. Harris further noted that Artis would need a rider to assist him on the route. On April 7, 2000, Dr. Harris indicated in his notes that Artis was having flashbacks of a \u201cman running in front of [his] truck.\u201d On April 27, 2000, Dr. Harris wrote that Artis was feeling \u201crage\u201d and was going to terminate his medication. On May 4, 2000, Dr. Harris noted Artis was upset because employer had assigned him to drive the route where the fatal accident had occurred on October 2, 1999, and insisted that he do so even though Artis explained to employer that he was \u201chaving trouble sleeping,\u201d was \u201chaving flashbacks,\u201d and was off his prescription medication at that point. Dr. Harris further noted that Artis was feeling \u201cpushed, trapped like [a] cornered animal [and] rage.\u201d That same day, Dr. Harris sent a letter to employer, stating that Artis was \u201cgreatly stressed and somewhat regressed, secondary to being scheduled to service the route where his accident occurred on October 2, 1999.\u201d Dr. Harris further stated in his letter that Artis was \u201cclinically not ready to service that particular route at this time. He has made much progress in his therapy and his rehabilitation is progressing well. It is however important that we continue to work closely together towards supporting his full recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Dr. Harris\u2019s records from June 7, 2000, indicate that Artis was experiencing symptoms, including homicidal feelings. On June 14, 2000, Dr. Harris noted that Artis was told by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>employer that he could not get any more riders to assist him on his routes. Dr. Harris further noted that he would call or write employer regarding Artis\u2019s \u201cneed for a rider from time to time\u201d and that he recommended Artis continue with his medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">On July 18, 2000, less than three weeks after Artis feigned the robbery, Dr. Harris opined that Artis\u2019s involvement in the June 29, 2000 incident was \u201crelated to\u201d Artis\u2019s diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. Dr. Harris further opined on September 24, 2002, that, as a result of the October 2, 1999 accident, Artis suffered from chrome post-traumatic stress disorder. Dr. Harris also opined on September 24, 2002, that \u201cthe feigned robbery of 06/29/00 resulted directly from Mr. Artis\u2019s accident-related psychiatric condition. Mr. Artis was still actively traumatized by his 10/02/99 fatality, on 06/29/00. He was also frustrated, angry, fearful and problem-solving very poorly at that time. He was sleep deprived [with] suicidal ideation as well.\u201d Again, Dr. Harris was positive in his diagnosis and opinion, and no other mental health professional\u2019s opinion was offered to refute Dr. Harris\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">I find nothing in the record, particularly in Dr. Harris\u2019s treatment notes and Artis\u2019s testimony, that is inconsistent with Dr. Harris\u2019s diagnosis and opinion. Despite rejecting Dr. Harris\u2019s opinion, the commission identified no such specific inconsistency in the record. Clearly, Artis never testified that his feigning the robbery was unrelated to his October 2, 1999 accident. Nor does anything in Dr. Harris\u2019s extensive treatment records suggest that the two incidents were not causally related. Indeed, Dr. Harris\u2019s notations and Artis\u2019s testimony regarding Artis\u2019s \u201canger at his employer[] and frustration over his financial status\u201d are not only consistent with but also clearly rooted in the documented post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms suffered by Artis during the treatment period, from his inability to contain his \u201cparanoid, hostile, and violent urges\u201d to his sleep deprivation and inability to problem solve, control negative thoughts, and manage stress and anger. As such, Dr. Harris\u2019s notations and Artis\u2019s testimony fully comport with Dr. Harris\u2019s opinion that Artis\u2019s involvement in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>June 29, 2000 incident was causally related to Ms accident-related psychological disorder. Dr. Harris\u2019s uneqMvocal expert opiraon may not, therefore, be disregarded by the commission as \u201cmherently incredible\u201d or \u201cinconsistent with other facts in the record.\u201d <em>Hercules, </em>13 Va.App. at 361, 412 S.E.2d at 187; <em>see also McReynolds, </em>157 Va. at 471, 162 S.E. at 9. Accordingly, the commission could not properly rely solely on isolated portions of Dr. Harris\u2019s notes and Artis\u2019s testimony that were not inconsistent with Dr. Harris\u2019s expert opinion to arbitrarily discount that opimon and to conclude on its own, in a matter that is clearly beyond common knowledge, that Artis\u2019s feigning the robbery was not causally related to Ms industrial accident.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Walrod, </em>210 Va. at 389, 171 S.E.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>185; <em>Layton, </em>9 Va.App. at 487, 389 S.E.2d at 187.

Holding that \u201cpurely psychological disability\u201d resulting from \u201cdisagreements over managerial decisions and conflicts with supervisory personnel that cause stressful consequences ... ordinarily are not compensable,\u201d we affirmed that decision. <em>Teasley, </em>14 Va.App. at 49, 415 S.E.2d at 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Here, unlike in <em>Teasley, </em>it is undisputed that Artis\u2019s post-traumatic stress disorder arose from his October 2,1999 work-related accident when he unavoidably killed a pedestrian, and not because of any disagreements or conflicts with employer. The relevant question here, therefore, is not whether Artis had angry disagreements with his employer, but whether he was unable to appropriately manage his anger towards employer and desist from acting on that anger because of the continuing psychological trauma of his work-related accident. The only evidence in the record that answers that question was provided by Dr. Harris, who clearly attributed the feigning of the robbery to the post-traumatic stress disorder Artis suffered. Dr. Harris unequivocally stated that the misconduct \u201cresulted directly from Mr. Artis\u2019s accident-related psychiatric condition.\u201d Dr. Harris further stated that Artis was \u201cstill actively traumatized\u201d at the time of the feigned robbery by his work-related accident. As a result, Dr. Harris stated, Artis was \u201cfrustrated, angry, fearful,\u201d and sleep deprived at the time of the feigned robbery, as well as exhibiting poor problem-solving ability and suicidal ideation. Dr. Harris further stated that, \u201c[i]n Artis\u2019s mind[,] [the feigned robbery] was not an act of robbery, but one of symbolically regaining his loss of control.\u201d Hence, <em>Teasley </em>is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Furthermore, the commission\u2019s vague reliance on the fact that Artis had a prior problem with rage as a dispositive factor in this case is also misplaced. While Artis indicated in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>intake questionnaire with Dr. Harris that he had received prior psychological treatment for \u201crage\u201d in 1996, no evidence was presented showing the precise nature or severity of that problem or the treatment therefor. Moreover, no evidence was presented to show that such a condition persisted three years later in 1999. Indeed, nothing in the record supports the commission\u2019s conclusion that the rage that resulted in the feigned robbery was simply a recurrence or continuation of Artis\u2019s earlier condition or that it was wholly unrelated to Artis\u2019s post-traumatic stress disorder. To the contrary, Artis testified that he had not previously suffered any symptoms similar to those he suffered as a result of his work-related accident. Artis\u2019s testimony was uncontradicted. In addition, Dr. Harris testified that Artis\u2019s post-traumatic stress disorder prevented him from properly managing his anger. Significantly, Dr. Harris was clearly aware of that notation by Artis in the questionnaire when he opined that Artis\u2019s conduct on June 29, 2000, was directly related to the October 2, 1999 accident. Dr. Harris drew no causal connection, in his treatment notes or elsewhere, between the prior condition noted by Artis and Artis\u2019s psychiatric disorder resulting from the accident. Nor, as previously noted, did any other health care professional do so in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">In addition, even assuming Artis\u2019s prior treatment for rage was relevant, \u201c[i]t is well established that the employer takes the employee as the employer finds the employee, even where the employee suffers some [pre-existing] infirmity.\u201d <em>Williams Indus., Inc. v. Wagoner, </em>24 Va.App. 181, 187-88, 480 S.E.2d 788, 791 (1997); <em>see also Owens, </em>30 Va.App. at 88, 515 S.E.2d at 350 (\u201cThe fact that [claimant] previously suffered from PTSD, and that this incident only aggravated a pre-existing condition, is not fatal to his claim.\u201d). \u201cA finding that a preexisting condition \u2018was accelerated or aggravated\u2019 by an injury sustained in an industrial accident establishes a causal connection between the injury and disability[,] and the \u2018disability resulting therefrom is compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u2019\u201d <em>Southern Iron Works, Inc. v. Wallace, </em>16 Va.App. 131, 134, 428 S.E.2d 32, 34 (1993) (quoting <em>Olsten of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>Richmond v. Leftwich, </em>230 Va. 317, 320, 336 S.E.2d 893, 895 (1985)). Plainly, if Artis had a pre-existing psychological condition, the evidence in this case shows that Artis\u2019s traumatic October 2, 1999 accident was sufficiently sudden, shocking, and frightful to have accelerated or aggravated that condition. <em>See Owens, </em>30 Va.App. at 88, 515 S.E.2d at 350 (holding that, to be compensable, the aggravation of a pre-existing psychological condition must be \u201ccausally related to (1) a physical injury or (2) to an obvious sudden shock or fright in the employment\u201d). Therefore, the mere, undeveloped fact that Artis received treatment for a prior psychological condition in 1996 is not persuasive evidence to show that Artis\u2019s discharge from selective employment was not properly attributable to the psychiatric disability he suffered as a direct result of his October 2,1999 compensable accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Thus, based on the record in this case, I would hold, as a matter of law, that no credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding of fact that Artis\u2019s post-termination wage loss was causally related solely to his misconduct on June 29, 2000, and not to his October 2,1999 compensable injury by accident. I would further hold that, in proving by a preponderance of the evidence that his feigning the robbery and resultant discharge from selective employment and wage loss were causally related to his October 2, 1999 compensable industrial accident, Artis met his burden of proving his entitlement to compensation for his post-termination wage loss. Dr. Harris\u2019s unequivocal expert opinion was that Artis suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his October 2, 1999 compensable accident and that Artis\u2019s actions on June 29, 2000, resulted directly from that psychological disorder. No evidence contradicts Dr. Harris\u2019s opinion, and I find no internal conflict in it. In fact, Dr. Harris\u2019s treatment notes and letters demonstrate the existence of an unbroken causal connection between Artis\u2019s work-related accident and his feigning the robbery. Thus, the uncontradicted evidence presented in this case establishes, as a matter of law, that Artis\u2019s termination from selective employment was causally related and, thus, properly attributable to his compensable work-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>accident and the resultant disability. Thus, consistent with the purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, employer is responsible for Artis\u2019s resulting post-termination wage loss. <em>See Reese, </em>24 Va.App. at 338, 482 S.E.2d at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">In summary, I would hold that an injured employee\u2019s firing for cause does not, in itself, automatically foreclose post-termination wage-loss compensation. If it is shown that the reason for the termination (e.g., the employee\u2019s misconduct) was properly attributable to the employee\u2019s work-related injury, the employee is entitled to benefits. I would further hold that, under the facts presented in this case, the commission erred in finding Artis had not met his burden of showing that his post-termination wage loss was properly attributable to his industrial accident. In focusing in its analysis primarily on the nature of Artis\u2019s misconduct, rather than on the underlying causal effect of Artis\u2019s work-related injury on his conduct, and permitting the commission to arbitrarily discount Dr. Harris\u2019s uncontroverted opinion regarding the causal connection between Artis\u2019s misconduct and the psychological disorder he suffered as a result of his industrial accident, the majority appears to disregard the essential purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, which is to compensate disabled workers for wage losses properly attributable to industrial accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">For these reasons, I would reverse the commission\u2019s decision denying Artis\u2019s claim for post-termination temporary partial disability benefits, enter judgment in favor of Artis, and remand this case to the commission for the purpose of calculating the appropriate benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b147-6\">. In asking in its \"overriding inquiry\u201d solely whether \"the claimant [was] fired because of his disability[ ] or ... because of his misconduct,\u201d and requiring the claimant \"to demonstrate that his termination was attributable to his disability rather than his wrongful act,\u201d the majority wholly fails to consider whether the wrongful act or misconduct for which the claimant was fired was properly attributable to his work-related injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b155-5\">. Relying on <em>John v. Im, </em>263 Va. 315, 559 S.E.2d 694 (2002), the majority states that the commission was not required to accept the uncontradicted opinion of Dr. Harris that Artis\u2019s misconduct was directly related to his work-related injury because Dr. Harris is only a psychologist and \"not a medical doctor.\u201d In my view, <em>John, </em>an automobile accident liability case involving the admissibility of an expert\u2019s opinion offered to prove that the plaintiff sustained a physical injury, has no bearing on this case. In <em>John, </em>the Supreme Court held that the expert witness, who was a licensed psychologist rather than a medical doctor, was \"not qualified to state an expert medical opinion regarding the cause of [a physical human] injury\u201d because such an opinion \"is part of the practice of medicine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321, 559 S.E.2d at 697. In other words, an expert witness may not render an opinion regarding a subject outside his or her field of expertise. Here, unlike in <em>John, </em>not only was the admissibility of Dr. Harris\u2019s opimon never contested, Dr. Harris\u2019s opinion was not about a \"physical injury.\u201d Rather, he opined solely that Artis\u2019s feigning the robbery was a direct result of his post-traumatic stress disorder, which itself was a direct result of his work-related accident. It is well settled in Virginia that clinical psychologists with the proper training, expertise, and experience are generally qualified to give expert testimony regarding a person\u2019s mental condition and to state an expert <em>medical </em>opinion regarding the relationship between that person\u2019s mental condition and his or her conduct. <em>See, e.g., Ward v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 648, 653, 570 S.E.2d 827, 831 (2002) (holding that a clinical psychologist was properly permitted to give expert testimony \"about the victim\u2019s mental condition\u201d); <em>Rollins v. Commonwealth, </em>207 Va. 575, 581, 151 S.E.2d 622, 626 (1966) (stating that \"the use of the psychologist in present society is growing and with this will come an increasing tendency to call him as an expert witness on the question of mental condition\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5 (providing that a qualified clinical psychologist may be appointed by the trial court \"to evaluate [a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense and, where appropriate, to assist in the development of an insanity defense\u201d); <em>cf. </em>Code \u00a7 54.1-3600 (defining the <em>\u201c[pjractice of clinical psychology\u201d </em>as, <em>inter alia, </em>the <em>\"[\u00bfdiagnosis ... of mental and emotional disorders </em>\u201d). Hence, the rule stated in <em>John </em>does not apply here to allow the commission to disregard Dr. Harris's expert medical opinion simply because he is a psychologist rather than a psychiatrist.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b156-8\">. As Artis points out on appeal, however, certain types of misconduct would prevent a claimant like him from receiving post-termination workers' compensation benefits. For example, Code \u00a7 65.2-510.1(A) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">Whenever an employee is imprisoned in a jail, state correctional facility, or any other place of incarceration and (i) the imprisonment resulted from the employee\u2019s conviction of a criminal offense and followed his sentencing therefor by a court of competent jurisdiction, (ii) the employee is receiving compensation for temporary total incapacity pursuant to \u00a7 65.2-500 or temporary partial incapacity under \u00a7 65.2-502, and (iii) the employee is medically released to perform selective employment, compensation benefits for wage loss shall be suspended under \u00a7 65.2-708 upon filing of a proper application to the [cjommission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">Furthermore, before a partially disabled claimant may receive wage-loss compensation, the claimant must first prove that he or she has adequately marketed his or her residual work capacity. <em>See Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. v. Harrison, </em>228 Va. 598, 600-01, 324 S.E.2d 654, 655-56 (1985); <em>Watts v. P &amp; J Hauling, Inc., </em>41 Va.App. 278, 286, 584 S.E.2d 457, 461 (2003). An incarcerated claimant would be unable to establish this required element because the claimant\u2019s incarceration would constitute a removal from the labor market. <em>See, e.g., Baskerville v. Saunders Oil Co., </em>1 Va.App. 188, 193, 336 S.E.2d 512, 514-15 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
