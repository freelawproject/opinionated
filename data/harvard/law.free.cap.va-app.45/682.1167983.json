HUMPHREYS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">Appellant George Fisher Robinson (\u201chusband\u201d) appeals an equitable distribution award entered pursuant to his divorce from appellee Elisa Kenty Robinson (\u201cwife\u201d). Husband contends that the trial court improperly classified the bulk of the parties\u2019 assets as marital property because the assets were purchased with his separate property, the trial court found that he carried his burden of proving retraceability, and there was no clear and convincing evidence that he had gifted those assets to wife. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We also decline to award either party the cost of their attorneys\u2019 fees for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">Husband and wife married on November 22, 1999, and they separated on September 5, 2002. No children were born of the marriage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During their relatively short marriage, neither party was employed in any capacity. Rather, the parties\u2019 only source of income was a trust fund husband inherited from his mother.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Husband receives a net monthly income of approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>mately $50,000 from the trust, which has a corpus in excess of $59 million. Husband has no control over the generation of trust income, and he is unable to invade the trust principal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Shortly after the marriage, the parties established a joint checking account and a joint savings account. The parties arranged for husband\u2019s trust income to be electronically deposited directly into the joint checking account, and the majority of the parties\u2019 expenses, including their car loans and mortgage payments, were paid from that account. During the course of the marriage, husband deposited a total of $2,156,351.14 into the joint checking account, and wife deposited $3,703.80 into the checking account during that same time frame.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">One month after their marriage, husband and wife purchased a home, known as \u201cBleak House,\u201d in Earleysville, Virginia. The property was jointly-titled in both parties\u2019 names, and wife co-signed the mortgage on the residence. The purchase price of the house was $380,000, but the parties enhanced the value of the home by adding a heated in-ground swimming pool and a basketball court. The parties used husband\u2019s trust income to furnish the home and to pay for the mortgage and home improvement costs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">In July 2001, the parties also purchased a 2001 Ford Excursion and a 2001 Ford F-350..They paid between $40,000 and $45,000 for each vehicle, and husband and wife are both listed on the titles of these vehicles. Although wife co-signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>the loans for these vehicles as well, husband\u2019s trust income was used to make the down payment and all subsequent payments on both vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Wife\u2019s primary contribution to the marriage involved handling the parties\u2019 finances. In addition to paying the bills, wife encouraged husband to set aside additional money in the savings account and to curb his spendthrift habits. Wife also \u201ctook care of the home, washed the clothes, cooked dinner ... cleaned the house, mowed the grass, took care of the pool ... [and did the] [sjweeping, [] general cleaning and cooking.\u201d Husband, in contrast, took care of the grocery shopping and helped wife maintain the exterior of the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">As of the date of separation, the joint savings account contained $244,137.16, and the joint checking account had a balance of $68,886.67. After the parties separated, husband removed the $244,137.16 from the joint savings account and then closed that account. Husband also withdrew $38,886.67 from the joint checking account, leaving a balance of $30,000 at wife\u2019s disposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">On November 1, 2002, wife filed a bill of complaint, seeking a divorce on the grounds of desertion, an award of spousal support, and equitable distribution of the marital estate. The trial court held an emergency <em>pendente lite </em>hearing on December 20, 2002. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court ordered husband to pay all of the parties\u2019 outstanding debts and to continue paying the mortgage on Bleak House. The court also awarded wife $4,500 a month in temporary spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">On November 4, 2003, the trial court conducted a hearing on the merits of wife\u2019s bill of complaint. During the hearing, husband testified that he set up the checking account in both parties\u2019 names \u201c[p]urely for convenience just so [wife] would be able to sign checks to pay bills\u201d and that he set up the savings account as a joint account for the \u201c[s]ame reason.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Husband also testified that wife co-signed the mortgage and the lo.ans on the vehicles because \u201cshe didn\u2019t have any income to back up a loan and [his] credit was not in good enough shape to get the loan by [himself] even with [his] income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">During closing arguments, wife contended that almost all of the parties\u2019 assets \u2014 including the marital residence and the two vehicles \u2014 should be equitably distributed, arguing that \u201cthe way the money was handled would allow the Court to infer intent on Mr. Robinson\u2019s part to make a gift.\u201d Husband, in contrast, argued that simply retitling separate property is insufficient evidence of donative intent and, thus, the bulk of the parties\u2019 estate constituted husband\u2019s separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">At a hearing conducted on January 13, 2004, the court awarded wife a divorce <em>a vinculo matrimonii </em>on the grounds of separation for one year. As for classification of the parties\u2019 assets, the court found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">I find that while Mr. Robinson clearly made all or almost all of the monetary contributions to the marriage, the wife, Mrs. Robinson, did make significant nonmonetary contributions. To me, the logical conclusion of the husband\u2019s argument that since he could trace his monetary contributions to all of the assets of the marriage, thus they should be his, would mean that in every marriage where the wife does not work and produce income, she would not be able to share in any of the assets accumulated during the marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\">So to me, while it\u2019s clear most of the assets of the marriage were purchased with moneys obtained solely from the husband\u2019s trust proceeds and I would concede could be traced as contemplated by statute, it\u2019s equally clear to me that Mrs. Robinson deserves a share in a portion of those assets based on the factors. To me, just because it came from a trust fund \u2014 the parties considered it as their income. To me, it\u2019s just the same as if Mr. Robinson was actually earning that money on a monthly \u2014 on a yearly basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">Thus, the court ordered the marital home to be sold and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>proceeds divided between the parties.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court also ordered that wife should receive one-half of the $244,137.16 that husband withdrew from the savings, reasoning that \u201csuch funds were there and available, regardless of the source of those funds, largely through the efforts of Mrs. Robinson to bring Mr. Robinson\u2019s spending habits under control and to better manage their income. I believe she is entitled to half of it, which is $122,069.\u201d The court also ordered husband to pay wife an additional $5,368, reasoning that, on the date of separation, husband withdrew $38,886 from the joint checking account and left wife $27,610, resulting in a difference of $11,276, of which the court believed wife was entitled to half.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The trial court also awarded wife the Ford Excursion and ordered husband to pay off the remaining debt on the vehicle. The court awarded husband the F-350. Finally, the court ordered husband to pay $3,500 a month in spousal support from February 1, 2004 until July 1, 2005, reasoning that a limited period of spousal support was warranted because the marriage was of relatively short duration. The court also noted that \u201cthe award made [to wife during] the equitable distribution was significant, especially considering monetary contributions by the husband and lack thereof by the wife,\u201d concluding that wife did not need spousal support for an extended period because she \u201cis receiving approximately a quarter of a million dollars in marital assets when the evidence shows she brought very little to the table in the first instance.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>After the hearing, husband moved to reconsider, arguing that \u201cthe Court\u2019s finding that all of the property would be considered marital, notwithstanding its further finding that Mr. Robinson had met his burden of retracing his separate contributions to the property, was in error.\u201d Husband reasoned that \u201cit was undisputed that Mr. Robinson\u2019s trust and the income from that trust were his separate property, acquired by him by inheritance long before the parties\u2019 marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The trial court denied husband\u2019s motion to reconsider, holding that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">[w]hile the property of Mr. Robinson came into the marital partnership as separate property ... Mrs. Robinson contributed significantly to the \u201cmaintenance\u201d and \u201cpreservation\u201d of the asset. It was, and is still, my belief that there would have been no asset to divide but for the efforts of Mrs. Robinson and I think she should be allowed to share in the same to the extent ordered in the court\u2019s ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Husband appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to wife, the party prevailing below. <em>Congdon v. Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. 255, 258, 578 S.E.2d 833, 835 (2003). Also, because the trial court\u2019s classification of property is a finding of fact, that classification will not be reversed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>appeal unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>McDavid v. McDavid, </em>19 Va.App. 406, 407-08, 451 S.E.2d 713, 715 (1994); <em>Srinivasan v. Srinivasan, </em>10 Va.App. 728, 732, 396 S.E.2d 675, 678 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Husband contends that the trial court erred in classifying the bulk of the parties\u2019 assets \u2014 including the marital residence and the joint bank accounts \u2014 as marital property. Husband reasons that he successfully traced all of the assets to his trust income, which constitutes his separate property. Because wife did not present clear and convincing evidence that husband gifted wife with any of these items, he concludes that the trial court erred when it determined that wife was entitled to a share of these assets. For the reasons that follow, we agree and reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The equitable distribution statute \u201c \u2018is intended to recognize a marriage as a partnership and to provide a means to divide equitably the wealth accumulated during and by that partnership based on the monetary and non-monetary contributions of each spouse.\u2019 \u201d <em>von Raab v. von Raab, </em>26 Va.App. 239, 245, 494 S.E.2d 156, 159 (1997) (quoting <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>4 Va.App. 19, 24, 354 S.E.2d 64, 66 (1987)). However, \u201c[ejquitable distribution deviates from traditional views of property ownership in that \u201cwhether the property is separate or marital is determined by the statutory definition and is not determined by legal title.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lightburn v. Lightburn, </em>22 Va. App. 612, 616, 472 S.E.2d 281, 283 (1996) (quoting <em>Garland v. Garland, </em>12 Va.App. 192, 195, 403 S.E.2d 4, 6 (1991)). Thus, before an equitable distribution award may be entered, the court must classify the parties\u2019 assets as \u201cmarital,\u201d \u201cseparate,\u201d or \u201cpart separate and part marital.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Property acquired during the marriage is presumptively marital, unless shown to be separate property. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20 \u2014 107.3(A)(2)(iii); <em>see also Rahbaran v. Rahbaran, </em>26 Va.App. 195, 209, 494 S.E.2d 135, 142 (1997); <em>Barnes v. Barnes, </em>16 Va.App. 98, 104, 428 S.E.2d 294, 299 (1993) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>(\u201c[Pjroperty acquired during the marriage is presumed to be marital and property acquired before marriage is presumed to be separate.\u201d). Because the majority of the parties\u2019 assets were acquired during the parties\u2019 marriage, husband had the burden of proving that those assets constitute his separate property. <em>See von Raab, </em>26 Va.App. at 248, 494 S.E.2d at 160.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">According to Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(1), separate property includes, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201call property acquired during the marriage by bequest, devise, descent, survivorship or gift from a source other than the other party,\u201d as well as \u201call property acquired during the marriage in exchange for or from the proceeds of the sale of separate property, provided that such property acquired during the marriage is maintained as separate property.\u201d Also, \u201c[ijncome received from separate property during the marriage is separate property if not attributable to the personal effort of either party,\u201d and \u201c[t]he increase in value of separate property during the marriage is separate property,\u201d unless that increase is both \u201csubstantial\u201d and attributable to significant \u201cpersonal efforts\u201d of either party, in which case the increase in value \u2014 and only that increase in value \u2014 \u201cis to be considered marital property.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Marital property, in contrast, includes \u201call property titled in the names of both parties,\u201d unless one of the exceptions contained in Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3) applies. As pertinent here, Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">In the case of the increase in value of separate property during the marriage, such increase in value shall be marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>property only to the extent that marital property or the personal efforts of either party have contributed to such increases, provided that any such personal efforts must be significant and result in substantial appreciation of the separate property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(a); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(1). Also, if \u201cmarital property and separate property are commingled into newly acquired property resulting in the loss of identity of the contributing properties, the commingled property shall be deemed transmuted to marital property.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(e). However, \u201cto the extent the contributed property is retraceable by a preponderance of the evidence and was not a gift, the contributed property shall retain its original classification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, \u201c[w]hen separate property is retitled in the joint names of the parties, the retitled property shall be deemed transmuted to marital property,\u201d unless the separate property \u201cis retraceable by a preponderance of the evidence and was not a gift,\u201d in which case that asset \u201cshall retain its original classification.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Neither party disputes that husband\u2019s trust income constitutes his separate property. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(1) (defining \u201cseparate property\u201d to include \u201call property acquired during the marriage by bequest, devise, descent, [or] survivor-ship,\u201d as well as \u201c[finc\u00f3me received from separate property during the marriage\u201d). Also, wife has not cross-appealed the trial court\u2019s finding that husband carried his burden of proving that almost all of the parties\u2019 assets \u201ccould be [retraced [to husband\u2019s trust income] as contemplated by the [equitable distribution] statute.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, assuming, as we must, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>husband carried his burden of retracing the assets to his separate property, wife had the burden of proving that those assets were marital property. <em>See von Raab, </em>26 Va.App. at 248, 494 S.E.2d at 160 (citing <em>Lightburn, </em>22 Va.App. at 617, 472 S.E.2d at 283).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Wife advances two arguments in support of her position that the trial court correctly classified the assets as marital property. First, she contends that the trial court correctly determined that husband \u201cgifted\u201d wife with a portion of his trust income. Second, wife contends that, \u201cbut for\u201d her decision to take control of husband\u2019s finances, husband would have squandered his trust income. Thus, wife concludes that the money the parties saved during the marriage (and all assets purchased with that money) resulted from her \u201cpersonal efforts\u201d and, thus, should be classified as marital property.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">1. <em>The Trial Court Did Not Find that Husband Gifted Wife with a Share of the Assets</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">As a general rule, \u201call property titled in the names of both parties\u201d should be classified as marital property. Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(2). This presumption also applies \u201c[w]hen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>separate property is retitled in the joint names of the parties.\u201d Code \u00a7 20 \u2014 107.3(A)(3)(f). However, if the jointly-titled asset (or an identifiable portion of that asset) \u201cis retraceable by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d to a separate asset, and the jointly-titled property \u201cwas not a gift,\u201d then the portion of the asset retraceable to the separate property \u201cshall retain its original classification.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Here, the trial court found \u2014 and wife does not contest \u2014 that husband carried his burden of proving that a majority of the parties\u2019 assets \u2014 including the home, the two vehicles, and the bank accounts \u2014 were retraceable to his trust income. Thus, those assets retained their separate character unless wife carried her burden of proving that the assets were \u201ca gift.\u201d <em>See id.; see also Utsch v. Utsch, </em>266 Va. 124, 128, 581 S.E.2d 507, 508 (2003) (\u201cThe burden of proof that the transfer was a gift is upon the party seeking to establish the gift.\u201d); <em>Cirrito v. Cirrito, </em>44 Va.App. 287, 303, 605 S.E.2d 268, 275-76 (2004) (\u201cThe burden of proof that the transfer was a gift is upon the party seeking to establish the gift by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d); <em>Theismann v. Theismann, </em>22 Va.App. 557, 565-66, 471 S.E.2d 809, 813 (noting that, if separate property is retitled in the names of both spouses, the non-owning spouse must \u201cprove the existence of a gift\u201d), <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>23 Va.App. 697, 479 S.E.2d 534 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">No presumption of gift arises from husband\u2019s decision to title his separate property in both parties\u2019 names. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(g); <em>Utsch, </em>266 Va. at 128, 581 S.E.2d at 508; <em>Rowe v. Rowe, </em>24 Va.App. 123, 134, 480 S.E.2d 760, 765 (1997) (\u201cThe fact that property is jointly titled must be considered by the trial court in determining if a gift was made, but alone, it is insufficient proof of a gift.\u201d); <em>Lightburn, </em>22 Va.App. at 616-17, 472 S.E.2d at 283 (\u201cVirginia does not presume a gift simply by virtue of jointly titling or retitling property.\u201d). Rather, to establish the existence of a gift, wife was required to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, the following three elements: \u201c(1) the intention on the part of the donor to make the gift; (2) delivery or transfer of the gift; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>and (3) acceptance of the gift by the donee.\u201d <em>Theismann, </em>22 Va.App. at 566, 471 S.E.2d at 813; <em>see also Utsch, </em>266 Va. at 128, 581 S.E.2d at 509; <em>Cirrito, </em>44 Va.App. at 303, 605 S.E.2d at 276. Here, husband argues that wife failed to prove the first element, specifically, \u201chis donative intent and the nature and extent of that intent.\u201d <em>Cirrito, </em>44 Va.App. at 303, 605 S.E.2d at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">During the equitable distribution hearing, wife testified that the parties considered the trust income to be \u201ctheir\u201d property. Also, on cross-examination, husband conceded that he had previously stated that he intended to make wife a \u201cco-owner\u201d of the bank accounts. However, husband also consistently testified that he created the joint bank accounts purely as a matter of convenience, and he denied intending to gift wife with a portion of his trust income or with a share of the jointly-titled assets purchased with that income.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The trial court did not expressly resolve this conflicting testimony, merely noting that \u201cthe parties considered it as their income ... it\u2019s just the same as if Mr. Robinson was actually earning that money on a monthly \u2014 on a yearly basis.\u201d As husband argues, this comment is not equivalent to holding that wife proved husband\u2019s donative intent by clear and convincing evidence. Although, unquestionably, \u201c[ijntent is a question to be determined by the fact finder,\u201d <em>Cirrito, </em>44 Va.App. at 305, 605 S.E.2d at 276, this Court cannot uphold a factual finding that simply does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Moreover, it is apparent that the trial court did not base its decision on a finding that husband gifted wife with a portion of his trust income. In its initial ruling on the merits, the trial court held that, based on wife\u2019s non-monetary contributions, wife \u201cdeserves a share in a portion of [the parties\u2019] assets.\u201d Similarly, in its denial of husband\u2019s motion to reconsider, the trial court reasoned that wife was entitled to a share of the bank accounts and the assets purchased with the trust income because she \u201ccontributed significantly to the \u2018maintenance\u2019 and \u2018preservation\u2019 of the [trust income].\u201d Absent from the court\u2019s ruling is any mention of a \u201cgift\u201d or an express or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>implied finding that wife carried her burden of proving husband\u2019s donative intent by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, we agree with husband that the trial court did not make the requisite findings to support a conclusion that husband gifted wife with a portion of his trust income.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">2. <em>The Assets Did Not Increase in Value as a Result of Wife\u2019s \u201cPersonal Efforts\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">As noted above, if a separate asset increases in value during the marriage, Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(a) authorizes the trial court to classify that increase in value as marital property, but only to the extent that the increase \u201cis attributable to the personal efforts of either party.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In order for this rule to apply, the \u201cpersonal efforts\u201d of the contributing spouse \u201cmust be significant and result in substantial appreciation of the separate property.\u201d <em>Id.) see also </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(1). Also, \u201c[s]eparate property that has appreciated in value due to forces other than either party\u2019s efforts, such as passive appreciation or the personal efforts of others, remains separate property.\u201d <em>Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. at 267, 578 S.E.2d at 839; <em>see Hart v. Hart, </em>35 Va.App. 221, 544 S.E.2d 366 (2001) (\u201cA party is entitled to the passive growth of [his] separate property____\u201d); <em>see also Martin v.

Thus, the burden of proof shifted to wife to demonstrate: (1) that she contributed \u201cmarital property or personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>effort\u201d to the trust income, and (2) that, as a proximate result of her contributions, \u201cthe separate property increased in value.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3); <em>see also Cirrito, 44 </em>Va.App. at 296-97, 605 S.E.2d at 272-73; <em>Congdon, </em>40 Va.App. at 267-68, 578 S.E.2d at 839; <em>Bchara v.

Thus, she concludes that the saved income \u2014 and the assets purchased and financed with that income \u2014 should be classified as marital property. In this vein, wife\u2019s argument parallels the trial court\u2019s ruling that wife\u2019s \u201csignificant\u201d contribution \u201cto the \u2018maintenance\u2019 and \u2018preservation\u2019 \u201d of husband\u2019s trust income should entitle her to a share of the parties\u2019 assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">However, although the \u201cincrease in value\u201d of separate property may be classified as marital property if attributable to either party\u2019s \u201cpersonal efforts,\u201d the underlying asset itself does not lose its separate character. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(a). Here, then, if the trust income \u201cincreased in value,\u201d for example, by earning investment income, that increase in value could potentially be classified as marital property. However, the trust income itself retained its separate character and could not be reclassified regardless of whether wife\u2019s \u201cpersonal efforts\u201d enhanced the value of that asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Here, with the exception of any passive interest that may have been generated, placing the trust income into a savings account did not increase the \u201cvalue\u201d of the income. The decision to save a portion of husband\u2019s trust income merely prevented that income from being spent on another asset. \u201cPreserving\u201d and \u201cmaintaining\u201d an asset is not necessarily equivalent to enhancing the value of that asset. <em>Cf.

Because there is no evidence that wife\u2019s \u201cpersonal efforts\u201d actually caused the separate asset to \u201cincrease in value,\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(a) and 20-107.3(A)(1) are inapplicable. <em>See id. </em>at 315, 563 S.E.2d at 404 (\u201c \u2018The significant factor, however, is not the amount of effort or funds expended, but rather the fact that value was generated or added by the expenditure or significant personal effort.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Gilman v.

Here, because \u201cthe record contains no evidence of the value of wife\u2019s contributions\u201d in managing and administering husband\u2019s trust income, \u201cher contributions were transmuted into husband\u2019s separate property when they were commingled with husband\u2019s separate property.\u201d <em>Rowe, </em>24 Va.App. at 136, 480 S.E.2d at 766 (holding that, where wife failed to produce any evidence relating to the \u201cvalue\u201d of the \u201ctime and energy\u201d she spent refurbishing a home that was husband\u2019s separate property, those efforts also became husband\u2019s separate property); <em>cf.

Thus, because the record contains no evidence relating to the \u201cvalue\u201d of wife\u2019s efforts to \u201cpreserve and maintain\u201d husband\u2019s trust income, those efforts did not transmute husband\u2019s separate property into marital property but, instead, were absorbed into and became part of his separate property. <em>See Rowe, </em>24 Va.App. at 136, 480 S.E.2d at 766; <em>see also Bchara, 38 </em>Va.App. at 315, 563 S.E.2d at 404 (\u201cThe record should include evidence of the monetary value of the non-owning spouse\u2019s personal efforts____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">For these reasons, we hold that the trial court clearly erred in classifying the joint bank accounts containing husband\u2019s trust income as marital property. Absent a finding that husband gifted a portion of his trust income to wife, those accounts remained his separate property. And, because the trial court found that husband carried his burden of proving retraceability, the court clearly erred in classifying the assets purchased and financed with husband\u2019s separate property\u2014 including Bleak House and the two vehicles \u2014 as marital property.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We therefore reverse and remand the equitable distribution award for reconsideration in light of the holding of this opinion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Both parties request that this Court award the costs and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred on appeal. <em>See generally O\u2019Loughlin v.

CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">For these reasons, we hold that the trial court clearly erred when it classified the parties\u2019 assets as marital property notwithstanding its conclusion that husband sustained his burden of proving retraceability. Accordingly, we reverse the equitable distribution award in its entirety and remand the case for reconsideration. We also decline to award either party the cost of their attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b734-13\">. However, both parties have minor children from former marriages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b734-14\">. Because husband's siblings are named beneficiaries as well, they also receive a portion of the income generated by the trust.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b735-8\">. It is unclear whether husband is a temporary or permanent trust beneficiary. Although husband testified, and has consistently maintained, that he is only entitled to receive income from the trust for a twenty-one-year period, the record contains a letter from the trust administrator indicating that husband\u2019s \"right to this income would only cease or terminate upon his death.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b735-9\">. Wife\u2019s contributions to the joint account were derived entirely from her periodic child support payments from her former husband.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b735-10\">. Husband testified that a portion of the down payment used to purchase the home was derived from a cash advance wife obtained from a credit card. However, it is undisputed that this loan was repaid using husband\u2019s trust income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b736-9\">. Similarly, at an earlier deposition, husband testified that \u201cconvenience is the only reason [they set up the accounts] that way.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b738-6\">. As of the date of the hearing, the appraised value of Bleak House was $470,000, the Ford Excursion was valued at $32,000, and the Ford F-350 was valued at $28,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b738-7\">. Although husband left $30,000 in the account, wife testified that several outstanding checks reduced the actual balance to $27,610.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b738-8\">. Wife did not cross-appeal the trial court\u2019s limited award of spousal support, nor did she request that, in the event the equitable distribution award is remanded, this Court remand the spousal support award for reconsideration as well. However, we note that the final decree expressly reserves the parties\u2019 right \"to petition the Court for a modification of the amount of spousal support upon a showing of a material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>change in circumstances.\u201d And, contrary to the implication contained in the dissent, nothing in this opinion precludes wife from requesting a modification of spousal support if, on remand, the trial court determines that husband did not gift wife with a share of his trust income and reduces (or eliminates) the equitable distribution award accordingly. <em>Cf. Thomasson v. Thomasson, 225 </em>Va. 394, 397 n. 1, 302 S.E.2d 63, 65 n. 1 (1983) (noting that the absence of \"an express reservation, in the final decree, of the court\u2019s power to fix and modify spousal support in the future as changed circumstances might thereafter require\u201d has the effect \u201cof foreclosing the wife from petitioning the court ... for a future award in light of changed circumstances\u201d). Thus, the inclusion of this provision in the final decree eliminates any need to remand the spousal support award for reconsideration <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b741-9\">. Not all of the property the court classified as marital was acquired \"during the marriage.\u201d For example, the court classified a station wagon that husband acquired from a prior marriage \u2014 and that was titled solely in his name \u2014 as marital property, and then distributed that station wagon to husband. Because this vehicle is presumptively husband\u2019s separate property, wife bore the burden of proving that an identifiable portion of the parties\u2019 equity in the station wagon constituted marital property because, for example, \"marital funds were used to discharge the loans\u201d on the vehicle. <em>Gilman v.

By holding that husband carried his burden of proving retraceability, the trial court implicitly concluded that all of the money in the bank accounts, as well as the money used to purchase the parties\u2019 assets, was derived from husband\u2019s trust income. Although wife testified that she received approximately $500 a month in child support, she admitted that she used that $500 exclusively to support her children. According<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>ly, the trial court could reasonably have inferred that none of wife\u2019s child support money \u2014 which would have been her separate property\u2014 was used to purchase any of the parties\u2019 assets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b743-9\">. Wife contends that husband \"only addresses the first of these two findings or issues, that is, the issue of gift,\u201d concluding that husband is procedurally barred from challenging the second aspect of the trial court\u2019s ruling, specifically, whether wife\u2019s \"personal efforts\u201d increased the value of his trust income. However, husband raised this objection before the trial court in his motion to reconsider, and, in pages 13-15 and 18-19 of his opening brief, he clearly addresses the issue. Also, the issue of whether the trial court erred in holding that husband's trust income should be classified as marital property because wife \"preserved and maintained\u201d that income is encompassed by husband\u2019s \"Question Presented,\u201d which broadly asserts that the trial court \u201cerred in classifying and dividing property as marital even though it found the same to have been purchased with the proceeds of Husband\u2019s admittedly separate estate.\u201d Thus, we find no merit in wife's argument that husband is procedurally barred from addressing the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b746-10\">. Although the trial court was not required to use any \"magic words\u201d to find that husband gifted wife with a portion of his trust income, the language used by the court must contain <em>some </em>language from which a finding of donative intent, delivery, and acceptance could be inferred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b746-11\">. \"Personal effort\u201d is defined as \"labor, effort, inventiveness, physical or intellectual skill, creativity, or managerial, promotional or marketing activity applied directly to the separate property of either party.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b748-6\">. It is also questionable whether wife's conduct actually constitutes a \"personal effort\u201d within the meaning of the equitable distribution statute. As we have noted, the statute \"contemplates a significant personal effort that substantially affects the value of property, <em>not merely a joint decision that may have been influenced by one spouse.\" Martin, 27 </em>Va.App. at 755, 501 S.E.2d at 455 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b749-6\">. The trial court did not find, nor do we address, whether the $90,000 appreciation in the value of Bleak House should be classified as marital property because it was attributable to an expenditure of marital funds or the \"personal efforts\u201d of the parties rather than passive market factors. <em>See generally Moran v. Moran, </em>29 Va.App. 408, 413, 512 S.E.2d 834, 836 (1999) (husband\u2019s evidence that $30,000 in marital funds were used to renovate the marital residence \u2014 wife\u2019s separate property \u2014 was insufficient to prove that the home\u2019s increase in value should be classified as marital property because the evidence \"failed to prove the extent to which the \u2018contributions\u2019 of marital funds to the renovations caused any of the home's appreciation in value\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b749-7\">. The trial court\u2019s concern, specifically, that this outcome \"would mean that in every marriage where the wife does not work and produce income, she would not be able to share in any of the assets accumulated during the marriage,\u201d is without merit.

First, I believe that an appeal of an equitable distribution award implicitly includes an appeal of the interrelated spousal support award. Thus, on reversal of an equitable distribution award, the trial court must reconsider its spousal support award, regardless of whether either party has expressly assigned error to that award. Second, I believe the evidence is sufficient to support a finding that husband made a gift of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>trust fund money to wife and that the trial court\u2019s ruling included an implicit finding to that effect. Thus, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s decision, and I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">SCOPE OF REMAND</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E)(8) requires that a court making a spousal support award must consider any equitable distribution award made pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3. Where the equitable distribution award is appealed and the court orders that \u201cthe provisions with regard to the marital property are to be considered on remand, the court must necessarily re-examine spousal support in the light of whatever new or different considerations flow from the additional proceedings.\u201d <em>McGinnis v. McGinnis, </em>1 Va.App. 272, 277, 338 S.E.2d 159, 161 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Here, husband appealed the trial court\u2019s equitable distribution ruling made pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3. Implicit in the scope of husband\u2019s appeal was that a reversal of the equitable distribution award on appeal would require the trial court to reconsider the spousal support award. <em>Cf. Morris v. Morris, </em>3 Va.App. 303, 311, 349 S.E.2d 661, 665 (1986) (where wife appealed equitable distribution award, husband appealed spousal support award, and Court found error only in equitable distribution award, holding Court \u201cmust vacate ... spousal support\u201d award because \u201cin determining spousal support the trial court must consider provisions made regarding marital property\u201d). Wife, who was not aggrieved by the spousal support award, had no duty to note a separate appeal of that award. Thus, reversing the equitable distribution award requires the concomitant vacating of the spousal support award and a remand to the trial court with directions to reconsider the spousal support award. This approach is particularly important in a case such as this one, in which the trial court specifically noted its award of spousal support for a defined duration was based in part on the size of the equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>distribution award it had allotted to wife, an award the majority has held was made erroneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">EVIDENCE OF GIFT</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">I also disagree with the majority because I believe the evidence was sufficient to support the equitable distribution award.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">The parties married on November 22, 1999, and on December 15, 1999, they opened a joint checking and a joint savings account. Husband\u2019s monthly trust income was electronically deposited into the joint checking account. Husband admitted on deposition that \u201cit was [his] intent that [wife] would be <em>co-owner </em>of the [parties\u2019 joint checking] account.\u201d (Emphasis added). The parties placed excess amounts from the joint checking account into the joint savings account, and they made all purchases and paid all bills from these accounts. Despite receiving approximately $50,000 per month from his trust fund, husband had never had a savings account and was heavily in debt at the time of the parties\u2019 marriage. Wife testified it \u201cwas a given\u201d that she would handle the trust funds during the parties\u2019 marriage, and she wrote almost all the checks from the account during the marriage. When the parties purchased the marital residence, they did so with funds from the joint savings account, with the exception of a cash advance on wife\u2019s credit card, which debt was subsequently paid with money from husband\u2019s trust fund. Wife cosigned the note for the property. Wife also co-signed for the purchase of the automobiles the parties bought during their marriage.

The trial court treated those sums \u201cas if [husband] was actually earning that money.\u201d On the issue of \u201cdistributing the marital property,\u201d the court \u201c[found] that while [husband] clearly made all or almost all of the monetary contributions to the marriage, [wife] did make significant nonmonetary contributions.\u201d It divided evenly between the parties the marital residence and joint accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Husband filed a motion to reconsider, arguing the court erred in classifying as marital the funds he had retraced to his separate property.

[wife] contributed significantly to the \u201cmaintenance\u201d and \u201cpreservation\u201d of the asset.

Street, </em>25 Va.App. 380, 387, 488 S.E.2d 665, 668 (1997) (en banc) (quoting <em>Martin v. Pittsylvania County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>3 Va.App. 15, 20, 348 S.E.2d 13, 16 (1986)). The trial court is presumed to know and properly apply the law \u201cabsent clear evidence to the contrary in the record.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 971, 978, 234 S.E.2d 286, 291 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">In making an equitable distribution award, the trial court must classify disputed property as separate, marital or hybrid property and must value and divide property as requested by the parties. <em>See Stumbo v. Stumbo, </em>20 Va.App. 685, 693, 460 S.E.2d 591, 595 (1995). However, beyond these basic requirements, the trial court need not make specific findings of fact to support the equitable distribution. As long as the record supports the result, the court need not quantify the weight it gave to each factor. <em>E.g. Marion v. Marion, </em>11 Va.App. 659, 664, 401 S.E.2d 432, 436 (1991). <em>Compare </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.1 (requiring, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[i]n contested cases in the circuit courts, any order granting, reserving or denying a request for spousal support shall be accompanied by written findings and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>conclusions of the court identifying the factors in subsection E which support the court\u2019s order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">\u201cIf [a] party claiming a separate interest in ... transmuted property proves retraceability,\u201d as husband did here, \u201cthe burden shifts to the other party to prove that the transmutation of the separate property resulted from a \u2018gift.\u2019 \u201d <em>von Raab v. von Raab, </em>26 Va.App. 239, 248, 494 S.E.2d 156, 160 (1997). The party claiming the existence of a gift must prove by clear and convincing evidence \u201c(1) intention on the part of the donor to make a gift; (2) delivery or transfer of the gift; and (3) acceptance of the gift by the donee.\u201d <em>Theismann v. Theismann, </em>22 Va.App. 557, 566, 471 S.E.2d 809, 813, <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>23 Va.App. 697, 479 S.E.2d 534 (1996). Per Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(g), \u201cno presumption of gift arises from the fact that the property was retitled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565, 471 S.E.2d at 813. Thus, evidence of joint titling, standing \u201calone, ... is insufficient proof of a gift,\u201d but proof \u201cthat property is jointly titled must be considered by the trial court in determining if a gift was made.\u201d <em>Rowe v. Rowe, </em>24 Va.App. 123, 137, 480 S.E.2d 760, 766 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"AjO\">The majority focuses on husband\u2019s argument that wife failed to prove the first element \u2014 that husband had the requisite donative intent. Donative intent, like any other type of intent, may be proved by circumstantial evidence, <em>see, e.g., Servis v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 507, 524, 371 S.E.2d 156, 165 (1988), such as a person\u2019s conduct and statements, <em>see Polk v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 590, 594, 358 S.E.2d 770, 773 (1987). I believe this is merely \u201ca standard of review case,\u201d <em>see Cirrito v. Cirrito, </em>44 Va.App. 287, 305, 605 S.E.2d 268, 277 (2004), and that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to wife, supports the trial court\u2019s implicit finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that husband acted with the requisite intent to gift to wife the trust funds deposited in the parties\u2019 joint checking account.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Although husband claimed at trial he had wife\u2019s name put on the joint checking and savings accounts merely for purposes of convenience, he also testified he did so with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>\u201cintent that [wife] would be <em>co-owner </em>of the [parties\u2019 joint checking] account.\u201d (Emphasis added). The trial court was entitled to reject husband\u2019s testimony that he made wife a co-owner of the property solely for convenience and to conclude that, by doing so, he gifted to her the contents of that account. <em>See also Utsch v. Utsch, </em>266 Va. 124, 128-29, 581 S.E.2d 507, 509 (2003) (stating that evidence need only establish that the transfer was a gift and not \u201cthat a gift was intended for a[ny] particular purpose\u201d). <em>But see Cirrito, </em>44 Va.App. at 306, 605 S.E.2d at 277 (concluding that quoted language from <em>Utsch </em>was <em>dicta). </em>Nothing in the relevant statutes or case law requires that the trial court\u2019s rejection of husband\u2019s testimony or finding of a gift had to be express as long as clear and convincing evidence supported its classification of the property as marital. Because the evidence supported the implicit finding that husband made a gift to wife of the trust funds deposited in the joint checking account, the evidence supported a finding that the home and cars, purchased with funds from the joint accounts, were marital, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Although the trial court referred to husband\u2019s monetary and wife\u2019s non-monetary contributions to the marriage, nothing in the record compels the conclusion that it considered these contributions as relevant to anything other than how to divide the property it had concluded was marital. Statements by the trial court in making the equitable distribution and denying husband\u2019s motion for reconsideration to the effect that wife\u2019s efforts to control husband\u2019s spending habits resulted in their accumulating savings of approximately $244,000 do not compel a different result. The trial court did not state that this was the basis for its classification ruling, and this information was clearly relevant to its determination of how much of a share of the particular marital asset wife was entitled to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">For these reasons, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s award, and I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
