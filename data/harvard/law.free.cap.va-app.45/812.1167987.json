We hold the evidence was sufficient and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">On March 26, 2003, Richmond police responded to a fire at a residence on Hanover Avenue in Richmond. After finding chemicals and explosives on the second floor, police called Special Agent Robert Ritchie of the F.B.I. to \u201ctake a look at the scene.\u201d Ritchie, a bomb technician, questioned appellant about the materials. Appellant responded that he \u201cwas making pyrotechnic devices, rockets and other pyrotechnic type devices.\u201d Appellant gave written consent for police to search the residence. Concerned about terrorism, Ritchie also wanted to examine the contents of a computer located inside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>residence for \u201cexplosive recipes\u201d and possible visits to websites that \u201cmight indicate he [appellant] was making explosive mixtures and not just pyrotechnic mixtures.\u201d Appellant consented to a search of the computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Police removed the explosives and the computer on March 27, 2003. After initially securing the residence on March 26, 2003, police guarded the residence until the next day when officers removed the computer. They did not see anyone come or go during that time. According to Ritchie, appellant gave his father a key to the residence \u201cso he [appellant] could still get into the house after he was released.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Police took the computer to Officer Jeff Deem, a computer forensics specialist. Deem examined the computer in June 2003 for bomb-related information. He began by removing the hard drive and creating a \u201ctrue and accurate copy of the media.\u201d Deem found information concerning child pornography and obtained a second search warrant before examining the computer further.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Deem conducted a forensic examination of the computer using Ncase software and certain key words connected to child pornography such as \u201clolita\u201d and \u201cunderage.\u201d He received more than one hundred hits. He looked for files or photographs, and located numerous images that were possibly child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">Deem identified fifteen photographs at trial as being the ones he recovered from the computer. Each picture was labeled with its file name as well as the path to the file\u2019s location on the computer. Deem testified the files were downloaded sometime between December 28, 2002 and January 3, 2003. The pictures were located in a file-sharing program called \u201cKaZaA.\u201d . The folder appeared on a desktop shortcut link titled \u201cmy shared folder.\u201d The folder contained files such as \u201ckids/girll3yearsold.jpg\u201d and \u201c11 \u2014 Hand 13yea-rand momjpg.\u201d The default setting for KaZaA is to share files with other users via the Internet, although this computer\u2019s setting had been manipulated not to share files. Deem testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>fied that there was no way to tell who downloaded the pictures or who used the computer at any given time.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Deem testified that the \u201csystems registry\u201d showed \u201cR. Clark Kromer\u201d was a registered owner of the Windows XP software. Another application on the computer showed a user name of \u201cclarkkromer.\u201d The computer was not password protected, and anyone could have access to it. Deem testified that there is no evidence to suggest that anyone other than appellant used the computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Kenneth Pew, an electrical engineer, testified that accessing the photographs was a six-step process and that there were over five hundred photographs on the photo directory. Pew could not testify about the shortcut link on the desktop because he did not have the hardware to examine the actual desktop. However, in addressing the issue of desktop icons, he testified that when one opened a desktop link, a list of files within that folder would appear on the screen.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Appellant made a motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, arguing that there was no evidence that appellant owned or used the computer at the time that the images were downloaded. Appellant conceded that the images were taken from the computer. The court denied the motion, finding that under a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d approach, the evidence was sufficient to find appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">Appellant argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to convict him of possession of child pornography. Specifically, he contends that the Commonwealth failed to prove he knowingly possessed the images contained within the computer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>In order to convict a person of possession of child pornography, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the individual \u201cknowingly possesse[d] sexually explicit visual material utilizing or having as a subject a person less than 18 years.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1:1. Appellant correctly points out that this statute does not define possession, nor does any opinion of Virginia\u2019s appellate courts. Thus, in this case of first impression, we must define \u201cpossession\u201d in the context of computer electronics, Internet technology, and intangible images.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">We take guidance from the federal case of <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>305 F.3d 1193 (10th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1223, 123 S.Ct. 1335, 154 L.Ed.2d 1082 (2003). The appellant in <em>Tucker </em>was convicted of one count of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B). The government\u2019s computer expert discovered child pornography files on both the hard drive and in the cache files of Tucker\u2019s computer. Tucker conceded that he knew that when he visited a Web page, the images on that page would be sent to his browser\u2019s cache and thereby saved on his hard drive. <em>Id. </em>at 1204.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">The <em>Tucker </em>court found that Tucker had control over the files present in his Web browser cache file. <em>Id. </em>The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-7\">Tucker ... intentionally sought out and viewed child pornography knowing that the images would be saved on his computer. Tucker may have wished that his Web browser did not automatically cache viewed images on his computer\u2019s hard drive, but he concedes he knew the Web browser was doing so. Tucker continued to view child pornography knowing that the pornography was being saved, if only temporarily, on his computer. In such circumstances, his possession was voluntary. Since he knew his browser cached the image files, each time he intentionally sought out and viewed child pornography with his Web browser he knowingly acquired and possessed the images.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1205 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">While the facts in <em>Tucker </em>differ from the facts here, we adopt the court\u2019s definition of possession of computer images. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>There is no question here that the images were downloaded and saved, and even linked to the desktop through a shortcut. We, therefore, begin with the premise that someone here \u201csought out\u201d child pornography. It is clear that someone \u201cacquired\u201d the offensive images and brought them into appellant\u2019s home from \u201ccyberspace.\u201d <em>See United States v. Perez, </em>247 F.Supp.2d 459, 484 n. 12 (S.D.N.Y.2003) (noting that without evidence that pornography was specifically downloaded and saved to a defendant\u2019s computer, the offending images \u201c \u2018may well have been located in cyberspace, not in [the defendant\u2019s] home\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Zimmerman, </em>277 F.3d 426, 435 (3d Cir.2002))). Thus, our inquiry is one of who possessed the images after they were already procured. Our analysis is whether the evidence sufficiently connects the appellant to the computer and the images.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">While this appears to be a case consigned to the new and evolving area of computer technology, we examine this case under familiar principles of constructive possession of contraband. We do not need to determine whether appellant was the person who downloaded the pornographic images, rather, we determine whether appellant knew the images existed and, if so, did he exercise dominion and control over them after they were downloaded?<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, we review the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Bright v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. App. 248, 250, 356 S.E.2d 443, 444 (1987). The trial court\u2019s judgment will not be set aside unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Josephs v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 87, 99, 390 S.E.2d 491, 497 (1990) <em>(en banc). </em>Under this standard, \u201ca reviewing court does not \u2018ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>Myers v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>113, 118, 596 S.E.2d 536, 538 (2004) (citation omitted and emphasis in original). It asks instead whether <em>\u201c \u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 250, 257, 584 S.E.2d 444, 447 (2003) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)) (emphasis in original). Thus, we do not \u201csubstitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact\u201d even if our opinion were to differ. <em>Wactor v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 375, 380, 564 S.E.2d 160, 162 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">In order to convict a person of illegal possession of contraband, \u201cproof of actual possession is not required; proof of constructive possession will suffice.\u201d <em>Maye v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 463, 483, 605 S.E.2d 353, 363 (2004). To support a conviction based upon constructive possession, \u201cthe Commonwealth must point to evidence of acts, statements, or conduct of the accused or other facts or circumstances which tend to show that the defendant was aware of both the presence and character of the [contraband] and that it was subject to his dominion and control.\u201d <em>Drew v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 471, 473, 338 S.E.2d 844, 845 (1986) (citation omitted). Ownership or occupancy of the premises on which the contraband was found is a circumstance probative of possession. <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 12, 492 S.E.2d 826, 832 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"AgV\">\u201cCircumstantial evidence is as competent and is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence, provided it is sufficiently convincing to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Breeden v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 169, 177, 596 S.E.2d 563, 567 (2004). \u201cThe Commonwealth is not required to prove that there is no possibility that someone else may have planted, discarded, abandoned or placed the [contraband]\u201d where the contraband is discovered. <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 1, 10, 421 S.E.2d 877, 883 (1992) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cTo resolve the issue, the Court must consider the totality of the circumstances established by the evidence.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number><em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 723, 735, 594 S.E.2d 305, 311 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Appellant\u2019s reasonable hypothesis of innocence is that others, family members or Mends, could have used the computer and downloaded the images. As we earlier indicated, whether appellant or someone else downloaded the images is not determinative of our analysis. The issue is whether appellant knowingly possessed the images after they were previously downloaded into the computer. The issue of who originally procured the offensive images is of no concern to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The trial court found that appellant had exclusive control of the residence. Appellant gave consent to search the residence, and he admitted ownership of certain pyrotechnics found on the premises. The court further found \u201cthe registration on the computer tied to his name,\u201d along with appellant\u2019s name being associated with the computer during the time when the computer made one hundred \u201chits\u201d on child pornography. The court concluded that, most importantly, the computer had \u201cquick desktop access\u201d to the folder containing the images. Using a totality of the circumstances approach, the court found the evidence sufficient to show appellant had control of the residence and the computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">We conclude that the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s findings. There is no dispute that the computer contained pornographic images in a KaZaA shared file that could be easily accessed through a desktop link. The computer was seized from a residence to which appellant had a key. Appellant gave a key to his father so that he would be able to enter the premises at a later date, indicating that appellant had control over the residence. Appellant also admitted that the chemical mixtures were his and that he was making \u201cpyrotechnic devices\u201d at the residence. The police did not see anyone else come to or go away from the residence from March 26 until they completed their search on March 27. The reasonable inference is that appellant lived at this residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>The systems registry on the computer revealed \u201cR. Clark Kromer\u201d as a registered owner of the Windows XP software. Another application showed a user name of \u201celarkkromer.\u201d The KaZaA software default setting had been manually set to disallow file sharing, establishing the user\u2019s control and management of the files. The evidence showed that the files had been downloaded between December 28, 2002 and January 3, 2003. The desktop shortcut, entitled \u201cmy shared folder,\u201d created easy access to files such as \u201cMds/girll3yearsold.jpg\u201d and \u201c11 \u2014 Hand 13yearand mom.jpg,\u201d making the existence of those files obvious to anyone who clicked on that link. The images, accessible to the user through that desktop shortcut, were conveniently located and readily viewable. The record supports the reasonable inference that appellant used the computer and had knowledge and control over its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Appellant cites <em>Perez, </em>for the proposition that \u201cone cannot be guilty of possession for simply having viewed an image on a web site, thereby causing the image to be automatically stored in the browser\u2019s cache, without having purposely saved or downloaded the image.\u201d Appellant did not contest at trial that the images were deliberately downloaded into the computer. Because appellant did not make this argument below, we will not consider it for the first time on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18; <em>see also Buck v. Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 449, 452-53, 443 S.E.2d 414, 417 (1994) (holding that the same argument must have been raised, with specificity, at trial before it can be considered on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">We are not suggesting that anyone who ever uses a computer containing sexually explicit images of children is guilty of possessing child pornography. Here, the reasonable inference is that appellant owned the residence and was the user/owner of the computer. While appellant contends the images were \u201chidden\u201d in the computer, the facts defeat his argument. The desktop shortcut indicates that the appellant manipulated the images to be easily accessible and continuously available. Under the specific facts of this case, it is clear that appellant possessed the computer and the images contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-13\">. Such an offense is now a Class 6 felony. The offense was a Class 1 misdemeanor on March 26, 2003, the date alleged in the indictments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b864-10\">. Appellant does not dispute that the images were sexually explicit, the subjects being less than eighteen years of age.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b866-7\">. We note that while the evidence shows that the images were downloaded between December 28, 2002 and January 3, 2003, the appellant was charged with possessing the images on March 26, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
