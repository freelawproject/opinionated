On appeal, he contends the trial court erroneously (1) admitted certain out-of-court statements in violation of the Confrontation Clause and Virginia\u2019s hearsay rule; (2) admitted unduly suggestive and tainted out-of-court and in-court identifications; (3) denied his motions for mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct; and (4) concluded the evidence was sufficient to support his convictions. We hold the trial court\u2019s admissions of the challenged statements, only some of which were admitted for their truth, and the eyewitness identifications did not constitute reversible error. We hold further that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motions for mistrial. Finally, we conclude the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s convictions. Thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">On Sunday, September 1, 2002, Shelly Marie Jackson (the victim) failed to return home as scheduled. On Wednesday, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>September 4, 2002, police found Jackson\u2019s body on property owned by appellant\u2019s father. Evidence adduced at trial established the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">On March 24, 2002, Jackson reported a burglary at her apartment. Police Lieutenant Brian Lovelace, who investigated the report, received \u201cinformation in from other people that\u201d Jackson had had a gun and a safe taken in the burglary and that Jackson was distributing marijuana for appellant from her apartment. As a result, Lt. Lovelace also was investigating appellant. Lt. Lovelace ultimately recovered a safe and a gun from a Kenneth Edmunds, who made a statement to Lt. Lovelace. On March 28, 2002, Jackson denied Lovelace\u2019s assertions that she was selling marijuana and that a safe and firearm had been taken in the burglary, but she gave consent for a search of her apartment, which yielded marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">On March 29, 2002, police executed a search warrant for appellant\u2019s residence. During that search, police found half a box of 9 millimeter ammunition in appellant\u2019s house under the bed in the master bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">On April 17, 2002, Lt. Lovelace advised Jackson that he had enough evidence, including the statement from Edmunds, to charge her even without her own admission. Jackson then made a written statement<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in which she said she had been selling marijuana for appellant and that he had supplied her with a safe and a gun to keep in her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Lt. Lovelace then obtained warrants charging Jackson with distributing marijuana and charging appellant with conspiracy to distribute marijuana. On April 18, 2002, appellant was arrested on that warrant and released. One of the conditions of his bond was that he have no contact with Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Sometime before appellant\u2019s June 24, 2002 prehminary hearing on the drug conspiracy charge, Lt. Lovelace talked to Jackson about \u201cturning state\u2019s evidence\u201d against appellant. The day prior to the preliminary hearing, either appellant or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>his wife, Shanetta, \u201ccalled [Jackson] and said they needed to meet.\u201d Jackson\u2019s cousin, Shelly Jones, accompanied Jackson to Cody\u2019s Store, where Jackson said \u201cshe was going to meet [appellant] to talk to him about court.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When Jackson and Jones arrived at Cody\u2019s Store, Jones waited in the car while Jackson climbed into appellant\u2019s truck and spoke to his wife. Appellant was not in the truck, but before Jackson completed her conversation with Shanetta, Jones saw appellant pacing back and forth on a nearby sidewalk. Also on June 23, 2002, Jackson apparently signed a statement, written in someone else\u2019s handwriting, saying she implicated appellant in her earlier confession because the police pressured her into doing so and that what she said about appellant was not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">On June 24, 2002, Jackson appeared at appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing with her attorney, Tracy Quackenbush, but chose not to testify. As a result, some of the charges against appellant were dismissed. However, after Jackson\u2019s preliminary hearing, Lt. Lovelace thought Jackson might change her mind about testifying against appellant. Lt. Lovelace said that, as a result, the Commonwealth planned to indict appellant at the September 2002 term of the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Prior to any indictment, Attorney Quackenbush received a copy of the statement Jackson had made to Lt. Lovelace on April 17, 2002. Quackenbush also received a call from the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office indicating that \u201cif [Jackson] did not cooperate^] ... the Commonwealth would be seeking a jury trial and would plan to bring on conspiracy charges and possibly another charge.\u201d On Friday, August 30, 2002, Quackenbush advised Jackson of the risks of not testifying about the contents of her confession and said \u201cshe should seriously consider cooperating.\u201d Quackenbush reported the conversation to the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, but she never received a final answer from Jackson about what Jackson intended to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>That evening, Jackson\u2019s brother answered the phone at Jackson\u2019s mother\u2019s house. Appellant\u2019s wife was on the phone and wanted to speak to Jackson, but Jackson was not there.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">On Saturday, August 31, 2002, Jackson told her cousin, Missy Jones, she \u201cwas going to\u201d testify at appellant\u2019s trial and \u201cthat she didn\u2019t really want to testify, but she had to.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">At 11:00 a.m. on Sunday, September 1, 2002, appellant used his cell phone to call Jackson at the residence she shared with her sister, Angela Jackson. Immediately thereafter, Jackson dressed herself and her two-year-old daughter, and they drove away from the residence in Jackson\u2019s car at \u201cclose to eleven-thirty.\u201d That same morning, Jackson telephoned her friend, Farah Canada, and asked Canada to watch her daughter, as Canada often did. At around 12:00 noon, Jackson dropped her daughter off at Canada\u2019s and said she was going to meet appellant \u201cdown the dirt road past [appellant\u2019s] house.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Jackson said \u201cshe would be right back\u201d and drove off in her car. Jackson never returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Later that same day, police in Reidsville, North Carolina, located Jackson\u2019s car at a Ramada Inn. On Monday, September 3, 2002, \u201cit was still positioned in the same place.\u201d The location where the car was found was about 58 miles from where Jackson\u2019s body later was found and took about one hour seven minutes to reach by car.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">On the evening of Monday, September 2, 2002, Angela Jackson reported her sister\u2019s disappearance to the police. The investigator who took Angela Jackson\u2019s statement retrieved a particular telephone number from the home\u2019s caller i.d. device. When the investigator dialed the number, she reached appellant on his cellular telephone. Appellant told the investigator \u201che kept that phone with him all the time\u201d \u201cunless it\u2019s on the charger inside the home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>On Wednesday, September 4, 2002, the police looked for Shelly Jackson\u2019s body on a piece of land owned by appellant\u2019s parents on which appellant lived. As they walked down a path in that area, they saw lying on the ground \u201ca white plastic piece that a lady would use in her hair.\u201d In the same \u201clittle area,\u201d they found a pocketknife, a dark stain later identified as blood, and an earring later identified as one Jackson had been wearing when she left her residence on Sunday, September 1, 2002. Nearby, they located Jackson\u2019s body. On the ground within a six-to-eight-foot radius of Jackson\u2019s body, the police found three Winchester 9 millimeter caliber shell casings. It was later determined that Jackson died of gunshot wounds to her head and right thigh. The medical examiner was unable to determine what type of gun caused Jackson\u2019s injuries. The precise date and time of Jackson\u2019s death also were not determinable.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">At the time of Jackson\u2019s death, she was pregnant. The father of her unborn child was a man named Roger Owen. Owen was \u201cstaying back and forth with his father in North Carolina and his mother ... in South Boston[, Virginia].\u201d Police interviewed Owen on at least two occasions after Jackson\u2019s death, but Investigator Sheldon Jennings, who spoke to him on one of those occasions, testified, \u201cI don\u2019t think he was a suspect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">After Jackson\u2019s body was found on Wednesday, September 4, 2002, Halifax investigators traveled to the Ramada Inn in Reidsville, North Carolina, where Jackson\u2019s car had been found. Adjacent to the Ramada Inn was a Chevron gas station and convenience store. The investigators spoke to cashier Mohammed Al-Rammal, who selected appellant\u2019s photograph from a photo array and said appellant had come into the store on Sunday, September 1, 2002, between about 2:00 and 4:00 p.m.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At trial, Al-Rammal again identified appellant as a person who had come into the store on the afternoon of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>Sunday, September 1, 2002. Appellant attempted to impeach Al-Rammal\u2019s testimony with a video surveillance tape from the convenience store, but the time and date stamps on that tape indicated the tape for September 1, 2002, \u201cstart[ed] at five\u201d p.m. and did not show what happened in the store between noon and 4:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">DNA analysis of blood found on the ground at the murder scene indicated that Jackson could not be eliminated as having been a contributor to the DNA. The hair pick bore evidence of Jackson\u2019s DNA and the DNA of a third party other than appellant. DNA found on the gear shift of Jackson\u2019s car, determined not to belong to Jackson, also did not belong to appellant. DNA found under Jackson\u2019s fingernails did not belong to appellant. Examination of the knife yielded no visible blood, but swabs of the rubber grip area of the knife yielded a \u201cmixture\u201d of DNA, indicating more than one individual contributed to the DNA on the knife. Forensic analysis eliminated Jackson as a possible contributor of the DNA on the knife. However, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was that appellant could not be eliminated as a contributor, and statistical analysis indicated it was \u201cMillions of times more likely\u201d that appellant was one of the contributors to the DNA on the knife grip as opposed to some unknown individual. Appellant presented a contrary opinion from an expert who testified that the DNA evidence excluded appellant as a contributor to the DNA on the knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">On September 10, 2002, about 150 feet from where Jackson\u2019s body had been found, investigators located a large hole, which one of the investigators referred to as \u201ca make-shift grave.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The hole itself was eleven inches deep and contained \u201ca small amount\u201d of \u201cstanding water.\u201d Rainfall records admitted at trial established that the area experienced a rainfall of 2.01 inches between 7:00 a.m. on Saturday, August 31, and 7:00 a.m. on Sunday, September 1, 2002. Between 7:00 a.m. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>on Sunday, September 1, and 7:00 a.m. on September 11, the day after the investigators found the hole, the area had only 0.04 inch of rain.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Evidence regarding appellant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s cellular telephone records for the afternoon of Sunday, September 1, 2002, showed four calls from appellant\u2019s cell phone to his home between 12:40 and 1:00 p.m. Beginning shortly after 1:00 p.m., numerous calls were placed between appellant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s cell phone. Those calls were carried by cellular telephone \u201cswitches\u201d beginning in the South Boston area; passing through the Danville \u201cswitch\u201d area at 1:29 p.m. and the Henderson, North Carolina, \u201cswitch\u201d area at 1:38 p.m.; and ending in the Reidsville, North Carolina, \u201cswitch\u201d area, where several calls were made between 1:57 p.m. and 2:14 p.m. Those calls showed appellant\u2019s cell phone accessed switches in North Carolina before his wife\u2019s did.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The jury convicted appellant of the charged offenses, and he noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">THE CONFRONTATION CLAUSE AND STATE HEARSAY RULES</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">\n<em>1. Confrontation Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">The Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause provides that, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const. Amend. VI. The Supreme Court \u201chas held that this bedrock procedural guarantee applies to both federal and state prosecutions.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 42, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 1359, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, 187 (2004). The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Crawford </em>\u201cchanged the legal landscape for determining whether the admission of hearsay statements violates the accused\u2019s right[s] under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Horton v. Allen, </em>370 F.3d 75, 83 (1st Cir.2004), <em>quoted with approval in United States v. Hendricks, </em>395 F.3d 173, 177 (3d Cir.2005). As set out in <em>Crawford, </em>if a statement is testimonial in nature, \u201cthe Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d at 203 (rejecting other, more \u201camorphous\u201d methods for determining reliability of testimonial statements).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Although the Court has not \u201cspell[ed] out a comprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial,\u2019 \u201d it has held \u201cthe term ... applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a formal trial; and <em>to police interrogations.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). \u201cAn accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">\u201c[Wjhen the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. at 1369 n. 9, 158 L.Ed.2d at 197 n. 9. \u201cThe [Confrontation] Clause ... [also] does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Tennessee v. Street, </em>471 U.S. 409, 414, 105 S.Ct. 2078, 2081-82, 85 L.Ed.2d 425, 431 (1985)); <em>see also, e.g., People v. McPherson, </em>263 Mich.App. 124, 687 N.W.2d 370, 376-77 (2004); <em>State v.

Mack, </em>337 Or. 586, 101 P.3d 349, 352 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Whether the admission of non-testimonial hearsay implicates the Confrontation Clause is unclear in the wake of <em>Crawford. </em>541 U.S. at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370, 158 L.Ed.2d at 199 (holding that \u201cwe need not definitively resolve [this question] today, because [the statement to police at issue] is testimonial under any definition\u201d and that the Confrontation Clause requires of non-testimonial hearsay, at most, that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>meet the test of <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980)). The Confrontation Clause requires of non-testimonial hearsay, at most, that \u201can unavailable witness\u2019s out-of-court statement ... has adequate indicia of relia<em>bility </em>\u2014 i.e., falls within a \u2018firmly rooted hearsay exception\u2019 or bears [other] \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42, 124 S.Ct. at 1359, 158 L.Ed.2d at 187; <em>see, e.g., Hendricks, </em>395 F.3d at 179 (holding that \u201cunless a hearsay statement qualifies as \u2018testimonial,\u2019 <em>Crawford </em>is inapplicable and <em>Roberts </em>still controls\u201d); <em>Riner v.

State Hearsay Rules</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Hearsay is \u201c[a] statement other than one made by the declarant while testifying at trial \u2014 offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>649 (5th ed.1979).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-7\">\u201cWhether an extrajudicial statement is hearsay depends upon the purpose for which it is offered and received into evidence. If the statement is received to prove the truth [or falsity] of its content, then it is hearsay and, in order to be admissible, must come within one of the many established exceptions to the general prohibition against admitting hearsay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-8\"><em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 171, 177, 487 S.E.2d 248, 251 (1997) (en banc) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">The \u201cstate-of-mind\u201d exception is one of these established hearsay exceptions. <em>Clay v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va. App. 96, 105-06, 531 S.E.2d 623, 627 (2000) (en banc), <em>aff'd, </em>262 Va. 253, 546 S.E.2d 728 (2001). If the declarant\u2019s state of mind is relevant to the case, then the declarations are admissible under this exception if they meet two additional conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-10\">1. The statement must refer to a presently existing state of mind. Although the mental state o[r] emotion must exist at the time of the declaration, it may relate to matters occurring in the past or in the future;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>2. There must be no obvious indication of falsification or contrivance[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 105 n. 4, 531 S.E.2d at 627 n. 4; <em>see also </em>Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 18-18, at 789 (6th ed.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\"> Despite the apparent inconsistencies in earlier Virginia decisions on the subject, controlling precedent holds that any state of mind of a homicide victim is admissible as long as it is \u201crelevant and probative of some material issue in the case\u201d; its relevance is not limited to rebutting claims of suicide, accident or self-defense. Clay, 262 Va. at 257, 546 S.E.2d at 730. Further, evidence of the communication of the victim\u2019s state of mind to the accused is required only when such communication is necessary to establish the relevance of the state of mind. <em>See Clay, </em>33 Va.App. at 106 n. 5, 531 S.E.2d at 627 n. 5 (holding communication of victim\u2019s state of mind to accused is necessary where evidence is offered to rebut defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense but not to rebut defense of accident); <em>see also Hanson v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 173, 188-89, 416 S.E.2d 14, 23 (1992) (\u201cFor the state of mind of the victim to be relevant to prove <em>the state of mind of the accused, </em>some nexus must exist which inferentially implicates the accused----\u201d (emphasis added)). For example, \u201ca statement made by a declarant is admissible for the purpose of showing the probable state of mind thereby induced in the hearer,\u201d such as proving the hearer had \u201cnotice ... or motive, ... when relevant and material.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 598, 602, 347 S.E.2d 163, 165 (1986) (citing E. Cleary, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 249 (3d ed.1984)). Such \u201cstatements are not hearsay at all\u201d if \u201cintroduced [only] to show the effect that they had on another person, and not to prove that what was said was true.\u201d Friend, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 18-18, at 792. However, if such a statement meets the requirements of the state-of-mind exception, it may be admitted and considered for its truth, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">\u201cOne of the most common uses of [the state-of-mind] exception is to prove the intention of a person concerning some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>future act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 790-91. Criminal intent, testamentary intent, and domiciliary intent may be proved with such evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 791. A related state-of-mind exception involves evidence of the \u201cdeclarations of a person of intent to do a future act, <em>as evidence that this act was in fact later done.\u201d Id.; see id. </em>at 791, (opining that in \u201c \u2018both civil and criminal [cases], evidence of ... declarations of intention or design should always be received unless too vague or remote to be of substantial probative value\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia and West Virginia </em>\u00a7 281 (Nash ed.1954))).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">In <em>Karnes v. Commonwealth, </em>125 Va. 758, 764, 99 S.E. 562, 564 (1919), a murder case, the Virginia Supreme Court adopted the United States Supreme Court\u2019s application of the state-of-mind exception in <em>Mutual Life Insurance Co. v.

In deciding <em>Clay, </em>the Court recognized \u201cit is difficult to reconcile the conflicting cases as to when a victim\u2019s statements are relevant\u201d but concluded without further qualification that the victim\u2019s statements that she feared the accused were admissible to rebut the defendant\u2019s claim of accidental death. <em>Id. </em>at 267-68, 546 S.E.2d at 730; <em>see Karnes, </em>125 Va. at 766-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>67, 99 S.E. at 565 (citing Virginia cases in which \u201cdeclarations of the deceased, not made in the presence of the accused,\u201d were \u201cadmitted as tending to show his guilt\u201d and holding that statements of deceased regarding fear of third party, Agee, not made in Agee\u2019s presence, \u201cwould have been clearly admissible on behalf of the Commonwealth in the prosecution of Agee for the crime\u201d). The Supreme Court\u2019s affirmance constitutes an adoption of this Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Clay.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Thus, despite the apparent inconsistencies in earlier Virginia decisions on the subject, we conclude that <em>any </em>state of mind of a homicide victim is admissible as long as it is both \u201crelevant and [more] probative [than prejudicial] of some material issue in the case.\u201d <em>Clay, </em>262 Va. at 257, 546 S.E.2d at 730.

Evidence establishing that appellant had the opportunity to kill Jackson to prevent her from testifying against him was relevant to the issue of his guilt or innocence. <em>Cf. Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 65, 69-73, 415 S.E.2d 439, 442-44 (1992) (reciting evidence of motive and opportunity as part of circumstantial evidence supporting conviction). Here, as in <em>Hillmon, </em>evidence of Jackson\u2019s intent to meet appellant was not \u201cproof that [she] actually\u201d met him, but proof of such an intent \u201cmade it <em>more probable </em>both\u201d that she went to meet him and that she actually succeeded in doing so. <em>Hillmon, </em>145 U.S. at 295-96, 12 S.Ct. at 912-13, 36 L.Ed. at 710 (emphasis added). As the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Karnes,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-7\">Much must be left to the discretion of the trial judge.... [W]hile a single circumstance, standing alone, may appear to be entirely immaterial and irrelevant, it frequently happens that the combined force of many concurrent and related circumstances, each insufficient in itself, may lead a reasonable mind irresistibly to a conclusion. Where the inquiry is as to the state of one\u2019s mind at a particular time, his statements and declarations indicating his state of mind are generally admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">125 Va. at 764, 99 S.E. at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">The trial court concluded the evidence established Jackson\u2019s September 1, 2002 statement to Canada referred to a present<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>ly existing state of mind, provided no obvious indication of fabrication or contrivance, and was relevant to the case. We hold the record supports these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">\n<em>(2) Statements to Canada Prior to September 2002</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">In contrast, we hold the court erred in admitting Canada\u2019s testimony about identical statements Jackson made when she dropped her daughter off at Canada\u2019s house on numerous occasions prior to September 1, 2002. These statements exhibited Jackson\u2019s state of mind at the time she made each previous statement, and no evidence indicated fabrication or contrivance on these prior occasions. Thus, they met the requirements of the state-of-mind exception to the hearsay rule. Nevertheless, controlling case law holds that evidence of where Jackson said she was going on these prior occasions was not relevant to prove where she went on September 1, 2002.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court held in <em>Ligon v. Southside Cardiology Associates, 258 </em>Va. 306, 519 S.E.2d 361 (1999),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE73\">[E]vidence of a person\u2019s general habits is not admissible for the purpose of showing the nature of his conduct on a specific occasion. Such evidence of habitual conduct is inadmissible because it consists only of collateral facts, from which no fair inferences can be drawn, and tends to mislead the jury and to divert its attention from the issues before the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 311, 519 S.E.2d at 363 (citation omitted). The Court also emphasized that its prior decisions did \u201cnot draw a distinction between \u2018general\u2019 and \u2018specific\u2019 habit evidence\u201d and \u201c[ijnstead ... focus[ed on] ... whether the proffered evidence is relevant to the issues at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>was a medical malpractice case in which the issue was the admissibility of evidence that the defendant had acted in a habitually negligent manner, the Supreme Court\u2019s language was broad. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>Further, it interpreted very narrowly an early criminal case, <em>Graham v. Commonwealth, </em>127 Va. 808, 103 S.E. 565 (1920), in which it had upheld the admission of habit evidence to prove the behavior of a murder victim immediately prior to his murder was in conformity with his behavior on prior occasions. <em>Ligon, </em>258 Va. at 312 n. 1, 519 S.E.2d at 364 n. 1. The Court in <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>interpreted <em>Graham </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-5\"><em>Graham, </em>cited by the defendant, is inapposite to the present case. There, we held that since the defendant on trial for murder had asserted a self-defense claim, alleging that the deceased had used violent, profane language and advanced toward him with a gun, the Commonwealth was entitled to introduce rebuttal evidence that the deceased did not have a habit of swearing. 127 Va. at 824, 103 S.E. at 570. We stated that this evidence was admissible under the same principle that allows the admission of character evidence. <em>Id. </em>Thus, our holding in <em>Graham </em>was limited to the use of a narrow category of rebuttal testimony to a claim of self-defense in a criminal prosecution, and is unrelated to the present issue of the admissibility of habit evidence in a negligence action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-6\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">In 2000, the General Assembly enacted a statute to counteract the 1999 <em>Lig\u00f3n </em>ruling and permit the admissibility of habit evidence, but that statute expressly applies only to civil proceedings. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-397.1. Thus, existing Supreme Court precedent authorizes the use of habit evidence in criminal cases only in the narrow circumstances of <em>Graham, </em>as construed in <em>Lig\u00f3n.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">As a result, we conclude the trial court\u2019s admission of Jackson\u2019s statements to Canada prior to September 1, 2002, about where she was going when she dropped her daughter off at Canada\u2019s house were improperly admitted. However, for the reasons discussed, <em>infra, </em>in Part II.E., we hold the erroneous admission of those statements was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>\n<em>(3) Statement to Shelly Jones on June 23, 2002</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The trial court\u2019s admission of Jackson\u2019s statement to Shelly Jones on June 23, 2002-that Jackson \u201csaid she was going to meet [appellant at a particular place] to talk to him about court\u201d \u2014 was not error. Although the statement was hearsay, it was admissible for the truth of the matter asserted under the state-of-mind exception. Shelly Jones testified without objection to certain background facts, including that either appellant or his wife, Shanetta, \u201ccalled [the victim] and said they needed to meet.\u201d Jones also testified that she accompanied Jackson to the store and saw her meet with appellant\u2019s wife inside a vehicle while appellant paced up and down on a nearby sidewalk. The only aspect of Shelly Jones\u2019s testimony to which appellant objected was her indication that the person Jackson said she was going to meet was appellant and that the subject of the intended meeting was \u201ccourt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Shelly Jones\u2019s testimony about Jackson\u2019s statements, like Canada\u2019s testimony, referred to Jackson\u2019s then-existing state of mind, and the record contains no indication that Jackson had- a motive to fabricate. Jones actually accompanied Jackson to the location of the meeting and saw Jackson meet with appellant\u2019s wife while appellant waited nearby. Finally, the evidence established that the meeting took place the day before appellant\u2019s June 24, 2002 preliminary hearing on the drug charge in which Jackson had implicated him, and appellant himself subsequently introduced a statement purportedly signed by Jackson on June 23, 2002, in which Jackson claimed to have falsely implicated appellant under pressure from police. Thus, appellant\u2019s evidence corroborated the fact that Jackson\u2019s June 23, 2002 meeting, although with appellant\u2019s wife, was, in fact, \u201cabout court.\u201d It also was probative of appellant\u2019s motive because it showed his concern over whether the victim would testify against him at his preliminary hearing and indicated a likelihood that the victim later communicated to him that she had changed her mind and intended to testify before the grand jury or at a later trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>\n<em>(k) Statement to Missy Jones on August 31, 2002</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Finally, Missy Jones\u2019s testimony that Jackson said she intended to testify against appellant at trial also was admissible for the truth of its contents under the state-of-mind exception. Jones\u2019s testimony established Jackson\u2019s statement of future intent and provided no indication that Jackson had a motive to fabricate. Further, the statement was relevant to the issue of appellant\u2019s motive for murder because the circumstantial evidence permitted an inference that Jackson communicated this intent to appellant before her death. <em>See Johnson, </em>2 Va.App. at 602, 347 S.E.2d at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The evidence established that, the day before appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing in June 2002, Jackson met with appellant\u2019s wife, spoke to appellant\u2019s wife about whether she would testify against appellant, and signed a statement \u2014 written in someone else\u2019s hand and introduced by appellant at trial \u2014 in which Jackson claimed her prior incrimination of appellant was false. Although appellant was not in Jackson\u2019s immediate presence during this meeting, he was in full view on a nearby sidewalk.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Other evidence established that in the two days (a) after Jackson\u2019s attorney advised her on August 30, 2002, that she should agree to testify against appellant and (b) before Jackson disappeared on September 1, 2002, appellant and his wife tried at least twice to reach Jackson and eventually succeeded in setting up a meeting that was to have occurred immediately before Jackson disappeared and in the place where her body was later found. This evidence supported the inference that sometime between when Jackson spoke to her lawyer on August 30, 2002, and the time she died, she told appellant she had changed her mind and intended to testify against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">Thus, Jackson\u2019s statement to Missy Jones of her intent to testify against appellant \u2014 coupled with evidence that appellant and his wife may previously have succeeded in talking appellant out of testifying against appellant, tried repeatedly to reach Jackson in the few days before her death, and eventually succeeded in setting up a meeting between appellant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Jackson that was to have occurred immediately before Jackson disappeared \u2014 was probative of appellant\u2019s possible motive for killing Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">\n<em>b. \u201cFirmly-Rooted\u201d Nature of State-of-Mind Exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">If the state-of-mind exception to the hearsay rule is \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d in Virginia\u2019s jurisprudence, the admission of Jackson\u2019s non-testimonial hearsay statements as related by Farah Canada,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Shelly Jones, and Missy Jones did not violate the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">\u201cWhether an exception is \u2018firmly rooted\u2019 depends at least in part on how long the exception has been recognized by the legislature or the courts.\u201d <em>Parker v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 643, 653, 587 S.E.2d 749, 754 (2003), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Crawford, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. The exception permitting the admission of relevant and material hearsay statements of a crime victim showing the victim\u2019s state of mind has been a part of Virginia jurisprudence since at least the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Karnes, </em>125 Va. 758, 99 S.E. 562, <em>cited with approval in Clay, </em>262 Va. at 257, 546 S.E.2d at 730. Although <em>Karnes </em>involved statements of the victim that a third party had threatened her and that she was afraid of him, the Court relied on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hillmon, </em>which, as discussed above, involved facts very similar to those at issue in appellant\u2019s case-use of the state-of-mind exception to prove the victim\u2019s intent to do a future act. <em>Karnes, </em>125 Va. at 763-65, 99 S.E. at 564; <em>see Hillmon, </em>145 U.S. at 294-96, 12 S.Ct. at 912-13, 36 L.Ed. at 710-11; <em>see also United Constr.

Because Jackson\u2019s non-testimonial statements to Canada, Shelly Jones, and Missy Jones were admissible under a \u201cfirmly-rooted\u201d exception to Virginia\u2019s hearsay rule, their admission did not violate the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">J. <em>Jackson\u2019s Written Confession to Police</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Jackson\u2019s written confession to police implicating appellant was testimonial under the Confrontation Clause and was made at a time when appellant had no opportunity for cross-examination. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d at 203. Thus, if the statement was offered to prove the truth of any of its contents vis-a-vis appellant, appellant was entitled, upon proper contemporaneous objection, to prevent admission of the offending portion of the confession unless the declarant was available for cross-examination at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 59 n. 9, 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1369 n. 9, 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d at 197 n. 9, 203. When appellant moved prior to trial to exclude the statement, the trial court ruled Jackson\u2019s written confession implicating appellant was admissible to show appellant\u2019s motive for wanting to kill Jackson but was not admissible to show appellant distributed drugs or conspired with Jackson to do so, or for the truth of any of the rest of its contents vis-\u00e1-vis appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">As set out above, \u201c[t]he [Confrontation] Clause ... does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. at 1369 n. 9, 158 L.Ed.2d at 197 n. 9 (citing <em>Street, </em>471 U.S. at 414, 105 S.Ct. at 2081-82, 85 L.Ed.2d at 431). Although the Commonwealth is not required to prove a defendant\u2019s motive for committing a crime, evidence of motive is relevant to proving one\u2019s guilt of a particular crime. <em>See, e.g., Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 213, 220, 429 S.E.2d 229, 234, <em>aff'd, </em>17 Va.App. 248, 436 S.E.2d 193 (1993) (en banc). Here, the Commonwealth offered evidence that Jackson had implicated appellant in a marijuana distribution conspiracy in order to show he had a motive for killing her, not to show that he had in fact engaged in such a conspiracy. <em>See Dednam v. State, </em>\u2014 S.W.2d-,-, 2005 WL 23329 (Ark.2005) (upholding admission of victim\u2019s testimonial statement impheating one Baker in uncharged crime, robbery of victim, for purpose of proving motive of defendant, Baker\u2019s cousin, to commit charged crime, killing of victim). Thus, the court\u2019s pretrial ruling that Jackson\u2019s statement was admissible to prove motive was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Appellant now contends that admission of the entire statement was error because it contained references to his possessing a gun and other things that were not directly relevant to motive. Because appellant did not request that Jackson\u2019s confession be redacted or summarized, the trial court\u2019s admission of the statement in its entirety was not erroneous. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18; <em>see also Street, </em>471 U.S. at 416, 105 S.Ct. at 2082-83, 85 L.Ed.2d at 432 (noting that although prosecutor could have used summary of unindicted co-conspirator\u2019s confession in rebuttal without actually \u201creading [the full] confession,\u201d \u201csuch a rebuttal presentation was not the only option constitutionally open\u201d). Further, \u201c[w]hen evidence that might otherwise be hearsay is admitted for a limited, non-hearsay purpose [and] the trial court ... instructs] the jury that they are to consider the evidence for the specific limited purpose ..., we presume that the jury followed that instruction.\u201d <em>Hanson, </em>14 Va.App. at 187, 416 S.E.2d at 22 (citing <em>LeVasseur v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 589, 304 S.E.2d 644, 657 (1983)). Here, appellant raised the issue of a limiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>instruction prior to trial, and the court told appellant it would consider such an instruction if appellant proffered it at trial. However, the record indicates appellant never proffered such an instruction at trial. Thus, appellant waived his right to have the jury instructed that it could consider the confession only as it related to appellant\u2019s motive. <em>See, e.g., Ohree v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 299, 308, 494 S.E.2d 484, 488 (1998) (\u201cRule 5A:18 applies to bar even constitutional claims.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">The facts here are distinguishable from those in <em>Donahue v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 145, 300 S.E.2d 768 (1983), relied on by appellant. In <em>Donahue, </em>the defendant objected to the admission of certain evidence, claiming it was hearsay, and the court accepted the Commonwealth\u2019s representation that it was not offering the evidence to prove the truth of its contents. <em>Id. </em>at 151, 300 S.E.2d at 771. Thereafter, however, the Commonwealth relied heavily on the truth of the statement\u2019s contents. <em>Id. </em>at 151-52, 300 S.E.2d at 771-72. The Supreme Court ruled that the defendant\u2019s failure to register an additional hearsay objection to admission of the evidence did not amount to a waiver of that objection and that the Commonwealth\u2019s use of the statement for its truth was reversible error because it did not fall under any hearsay exception and its admission was not harmless. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Here, based on the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Donahue, </em>we conclude the prosecutor remained bound by the court\u2019s pretrial ruling that Jackson\u2019s confession was admissible only to prove appellant\u2019s motive and not for the truth of Jackson\u2019s statements that appellant conspired with her to distribute marijuana, gave her a gun, and told her to lie to police about what was taken in the burglary of her home. However, we hold no reversible error occurred under <em>Donahue </em>because the prosecutor\u2019s comments in closing argument did not violate the court\u2019s pretrial ruling. As discussed above, Jackson\u2019s non-testimonial hearsay statements to Farah Canada and Shelly and Missy Jones, properly admitted for the truth of their contents under a firmly-rooted exception to Virginia\u2019s hearsay rule, were \u201cstatements made by the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>ceased\u201d or \u201cfrom the grave\u201d to which the prosecutor properly could refer in closing argument. Thus, these comments did not compel the conclusion that the prosecution made impermissible references to Jackson\u2019s confession. Similarly, the prosecutor\u2019s reference in closing argument to Jackson\u2019s confession to police as \u201ca very damning thing\u201d may fairly be construed only as an argument that it showed appellant had a strong motive for wanting to kill Jackson, a use of the statement permitted under the Confrontation Clause and the Commonwealth\u2019s hearsay rules. Further, when the prosecutor spoke of Lt. Lovelace\u2019s intentions regarding Jackson\u2019s confession, the prosecutor argued specifically that Lovelace \u201cwanted [Jackson] ... to testify against [appellant] because <em>she had identified him </em>as her supplier.\u201d (Emphasis added). The prosecutor expressly did not argue that appellant was, in fact, Jackson\u2019s supplier, only that Jackson had <em>identified him </em>as her supplier. The fact of identification established a motive regardless of the truth or falsity of the identification. <em>See Street, </em>471 U.S. at 411, 414, 105 S.Ct. at 2080, 2081, 85 L.Ed.2d at 429, 430 (holding that unindicted co-conspirator\u2019s out-of-court confession would have been hearsay only if \u201cjury had been asked to infer that [co-conspirator\u2019s] confession proved that defendant participated in the murder\u201d and was admissible to rebut defendant\u2019s claim that his own confession resulted when sheriff \u201cread from [co-conspirator\u2019s] statement and directed [defendant] to say the same thing\u201d). Finally, Lt. Lovelace had testified without objection that, during the course of his investigation, before Jackson made the written confession, Lovelace was \u201cgetting information in from other people\u201d that Jackson was distributing marijuana and that appellant was her supplier. Thus, other properly admitted evidence implied appellant was a drug dealer and would have permitted the prosecutor to refer to that connection without relying on Jackson\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">For similar reasons, the admission of Jackson\u2019s confession did not violate Virginia\u2019s hearsay rule. Excluded from the hearsay rule are statements not offered for the truth of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>their content. <em>See, e.g., Church v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 208, 211, 335 S.E.2d 823, 825 (1985).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-5\">Part of the difficulty in \u201cnot-for-truth\u201d situations is due to the fact that often such evidence will have a dual nature; the declaration may indeed be relevant on some matter unrelated to the truth of the content of the statement, and yet the content of the statement may go to the issues of the case as well. <em>See, e.g., Donahue v. Commonwealth, </em>[225 Va. 145, 300 S.E.2d 768 (1983)]. This is perhaps the situation which creates the greatest dilemma for the courts. In that regard, however, it should be remembered that it is a time-honored principle of evidence law that, in general, if evidence is admissible for <em>any </em>purpose, it is admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-6\"><em>Brown, 25 </em>Va.App. at 177-78, 487 S.E.2d at 251 (quoting 2 Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 18-3, at 95-96 (4th ed.1993) (footnote omitted)) (other citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">Here, the trial court ruled the statements were not offered for their truth; appellant never proffered a limiting instruction; and the prosecutor did not expressly argue to the jury the contents of Jackson\u2019s confession vis-a-vis appellant as if they were true.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">Further, the record supported a finding that the probative value of Jackson\u2019s confession and her implication of appellant was greater than any prejudice that might have resulted. As a general rule, \u201c[ejvidence tending to show commission of other offenses is not admissible in a criminal trial if its only relevance is to show the character of the accused or his disposition to commit a similar offense.\u201d <em>Essex v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 168, 171, 442 S.E.2d 707, 709 (1994). However, if \u201cevidence of another crime tends to prove \u2018any other relevant fact of the offense charged, and is otherwise admissible, it will not be excluded merely because it also shows [the defendant] to have been guilty of another crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Pugliese v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 82, 91, 428 S.E.2d 16, 23 (1993)); <em>see Farmer v.

An accused is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>entitled \u201cto have the evidence \u2018sanitized\u2019 so as to deny the jury knowledge of all but the immediate crime for which he is on trial.\u201d <em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 519, 526-27, 323 S.E.2d 572, 577 (1984). \u201cIn addressing the admissibility of other crimes evidence the court must balance the probative value of the evidence of the other offenses and determine whether it exceeds the prejudice to the accused. The court\u2019s weighing of these factors is reviewable only for clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Pavlick v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 219, 226, 497 S.E.2d 920, 924 (1998) (en banc) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">\u201cWhen evidence that might otherwise be hearsay is admitted for a limited, non-hearsay purpose [and] the trial court ... instructs] the jury that they are to consider the evidence for the specific limited purpose ..., we presume that the jury followed that instruction.\u201d <em>Hanson, </em>14 Va.App. at 187, 416 S.E.2d at 22. Here, because appellant requested but failed to proffer a limiting instruction \u2014 whether due to oversight or trial strategy \u2014 and because the Commonwealth did not rely on the evidence for an improper purpose, appellant may not now complain about the trial court\u2019s failure to give a limiting instruction or the possibility that the jury may have considered Jackson\u2019s confession for the truth of its allegation that appellant was a drug dealer. When hearsay evidence is admitted in a jury trial without a limiting instruction, the finder of fact may consider it for any purpose. <em>Cf. Stevens v.

Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 197-98, 93 S.Ct. 375, 381-82, 34 L.Ed.2d 401, 410-11 (1972). If the lineup was impermissibly suggestive, the identification may nevertheless be reliable and admissible if certain additional conditions are met. <em>Id. </em>at 199-200, 93 S.Ct. at 382-83, 34 L.Ed.2d at 411; <em>see also Manson v.

Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 421, 427, 393 S.E.2d 216, 220 (1990). Finally, even if an out-of-court identification cannot be admitted under this test, an in-court identification may still be admissible \u201cif the origin of that identification is independent of the inadmissible out-of-court identification procedure.\u201d <em>Hill v.

Out-of-Court Identification</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">In determining whether a photographic lineup was impermissibly suggestive under part (1) of the above test, a court should look to both the photographs themselves and the manner in which they were presented to the identifying witness. <em>See State v. Boykins, </em>173 W.Va. 761, 320 S.E.2d 134, 138 (1984). A valid lineup does not require that all the suspects or participants be alike in appearance and have the same description as long as nothing singles the accused out from the rest. <em>Williamson v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 57, 59, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>175 S.E.2d 285, 287 (1970). Where police indicate to the witness prior to the witness\u2019 viewing the photographs that they have evidence that one of the people in the lineup committed the crime, the chance of misidentification is heightened. <em>Bryant, </em>10 Va.App. at 425-26, 393 S.E.2d at 219 (citing <em>Simmons, </em>390 U.S. at 383, 88 S.Ct. at 971, 19 L.Ed.2d at 1253).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">In appellant\u2019s case, the evidence supported the trial court\u2019s ruling that the sequential photographic lineup presented to Al-Rammal on Wednesday, September 4, 2002, was not unduly suggestive. The array contained five very similar photographs. All were head shots of young males of the same race with similar hairstyles. Although one of the photographs was a \u201cmug shot\u201d taken against a backdrop including a height scale, the remaining four photographs, including the photograph of appellant, were taken against neutral backgrounds and gave no indication of the individual\u2019s height or custodial status.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The record supported a finding that the manner in which the lineup was presented to Al-Rammal also was not unduly suggestive. The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, established that, prior to showing AlRammal the photographs, the investigators said merely that they would like Al-Rammal to look at some photographs and tell them whether he had seen any of the people in the photographs in the Chevron station\u2019s convenience store in the preceding two to four days.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Investigator Clay testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>he did not indicate to Al-Rammal that he wanted Al-Rammal to choose any particular photo. Further, Investigator Clay made no representation that any of the individuals depicted in the photographs had, in fact, been in the store during that period of time. <em>Cf. Charity, </em>24 Va.App. at 262, 482 S.E.2d at 61 (noting as factor supporting finding of lack of suggestiveness that police \u201ctold [witness] she needed to see the video lineup [but] ... did not tell her it would include the perpetrator\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Appellant claims the out-of-court photo identification of September 4, 2002 was unduly suggestive but does not articulate precisely how he contends it was suggestive. He states in his recitation of the facts that the investigators were \u201cinterested in a black male with dreadlocks\u201d and that this interest somehow tainted Al-Rammal\u2019s identification of appellant\u2019s picture. Had the investigators told Al-Rammal they were looking for a young black male with dreadlocks and then showed him a photo array in which only one black male with dreadlocks appeared, no doubt exists that the lineup would have been unduly suggestive. However, the evidence, as found by the trial court, was that all photos in the array were head shots of relatively young black males with dreadlocks, and four of the five photos, including appellant\u2019s, had been taken against neutral backgrounds providing no indication of the subject\u2019s height or custodial status.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument, in essence, is that where no crime or other event has occurred causing a potential witness to focus on a particular person, no method exists that is not unduly suggestive by which police can seek to determine whether the witness might have encountered that person in a particular place or at a particular time. This simply is not the law. We cannot conceive of any lineup procedure that would have been significantly less suggestive than the one the investigators utilized on September 4, 2002, while still calculated to yield <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>useable information. Appellant\u2019s argument, in essence, is that Al-Rammal\u2019s credibility was suspect and, thus, that the identification was unreliable. Because the sequential photo lineup employed by the police was not unduly suggestive, Al-Rammal\u2019s out-of-court identification of appellant as having been in the convenience store on a relevant date at a relevant time was admissible. <em>Simmons, </em>390 U.S. at 384, 88 S.Ct. at 971, 19 L.Ed.2d at 1253. Appellant\u2019s arguments about Al-Rammal\u2019s credibility were appropriately left to the jury. <em>See Bryant, </em>10 Va.App. at 427, 393 S.E.2d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">\n<em>2. Iris-Court Identification</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Because the September 4, 2002 out-of-court identification was not unduly suggestive, it could not have irreparably tainted Al-Rammal\u2019s subsequent in-court identification of appellant, and thus, we need not consider whether the in-court identification was sufficiently independent of the original identification. However, appellant also contends the in-court identification was irreparably tainted by the identification AlRammal made for the prosecutor the week before the July 1, 2003 motion hearing. On that occasion, the prosecutor appeared at the Reidsville Chevron station with the same photos Al-Rammal had viewed on September 4, 2002, and told AlRammal which photo he had identified on that prior occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Assuming without deciding these events were unduly suggestive and could have created a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification, the evidence supported a finding that the in-court identification was based upon the witness\u2019 observation of the accused at the convenience store, independent of the lineup, rendering the in-court identification admissible. <em>Hill, </em>2 Va.App. at 693, 347 S.E.2d at 918. Al-Rammal testified that the prosecutor asked him if he could identify again the person he had previously identified, to which AlRammal responded he would do his best and picked out a picture. The record did not establish whether the prosecutor told Al-Rammal which picture he had identified on September 4, 2002 before or after Al-Rammal selected a photo in late June 2003. Also, the record did not establish which photo Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Rammal selected. Finally, and most importantly, Al-Rammal testified that he had an independent recollection both of the person he saw in the store on September 1, 2002, and the five photographs he viewed on September 4, 2002, as part of the sequential photo lineup. He testified without equivocation that his recollection of the appearance of the person he had seen in the Chevron station store on September 1, 2002, was not affected by the prosecutor\u2019s having shown him the photograph of appellant in late June 2003. <em>See McCary v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 219, 232-34, 321 S.E.2d 637, 644-45 (1984) (upholding admission of in-court identifications even though witnesses were originally unable to identify accused in photo lineup and were subsequently told by police that he was the perpetrator because in-court identifications \u201chad independent sources free from taint, specifically the ample opportunities the victims availed themselves of to observe McCary in his activities before and during the crime\u201d). Because the evidence supported a finding that Al-Rammal\u2019s in-court identification of appellant was not tainted by the June 2003 out-of-court identification, the trial court did not err by permitting the in-court identification and allowing the jury to evaluate what weight to give that identification. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">MISTRIAL MOTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">The denial of a motion for a mistrial will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Beavers v.

Thus, the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s implicit finding that there was no manifest probability that Canada\u2019s testimony was so prejudicial that the prejudice could not be cured with a cautionary instruction. <em>Compare Kitze, </em>246 Va. at 289, 435 S.E.2d at 586 (holding cautionary instruction insufficient to remove prejudice where prosecutor \u201cimproperly told the jury that if it found that Kitze had committed the offenses because of an irresistible impulse, then he would be set free, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>and he implied that the jurors, as protectors of the community, would have failed in their responsibility to protect the community\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Appellant also claims he was entitled to a mistrial when the Commonwealth offered into evidence a letter the trial court had already ruled was inadmissible. Appellant contends the prosecution intentionally offered the letter into evidence in contravention of the trial court\u2019s prior ruling in order \u201cto force the defense to object in front of the jury,\u201d which appellant contended was prejudicial. However, the trial court found \u201cthat it was not inappropriate for the Commonwealth to ask for [the letter\u2019s] admission and have the Court rule on it\u201d and that the occurrence did not provide grounds for a mistrial. We hold the record supports this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Prior to trial, the court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-7\">The admission of evidence is governed by rules of law. From time to time it may be the duty of the attorneys to make objections. And it would.be my duty as judge to rule on those objections and to determine whether you can consider certain evidence. You must not consider testimony or exhibits to which an objection was sustained or which has been ordered stricken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">At trial, the court ruled outside the presence of the jury that the Commonwealth would be allowed to show the letter to the testifying witness but that neither the letter itself nor its contents would be admitted into evidence. In the wake of this ruling, the Commonwealth expressed some confusion over how to handle the letter before the jury. The prosecutor indicated outside the presence of the jury that he would at least offer the letter into evidence, and appellant did not object. Thus, the record supports the court\u2019s express finding that it was not inappropriate for the Commonwealth to move the letter\u2019s admission in order to obtain a formal ruling and its implicit finding that these events did not present a manifest probability of prejudice sufficient to deprive appellant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">Finally, this same analysis supports the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s similar post-trial motions. Although appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>points on brief to \u201c[o]ther conduct by the prosecution\u201d that he contends was \u201cinconsistent with notions of fairness,\u201d nothing in the record indicates appellant brought to the attention of the trial court his position that these actions supported his request for a mistrial. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18. He may not raise them for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">When considering the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal in a criminal case, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to the evidence all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975). The credibility of a witness, the weight accorded the testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from proved facts are matters to be determined by the fact finder. <em>Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989). The judgment will not be set aside unless it is plainly wrong or without' supporting evidence. <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">\u201cCircumstantial evidence is as competent and is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence, provided it is sufficiently convincing to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 31, 53, 307 S.E.2d 864, 876 (1983). However, \u201cthe Commonwealth need only exclude reasonable hypotheses of innocence that flow from the evidence, not those that spring from the imagination of the defendant.\u201d <em>Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 751, 755, 433 S.E.2d 27, 29 (1993). \u2018Whether an alternative hypothesis of innocence is reasonable is a question of fact and, therefore, is binding on appeal unless plainly wrong.\u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 12-13, 492 S.E.2d 826, 832 (1997) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>\u201cWhere the evidence is entirely circumstantial, ... [t]he chain of necessary circumstances must be unbroken. The circumstances of motive, time, place, means and conduct must all concur to form an unbroken chain which links the defendant to the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Bishop v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 164, 169, 313 S.E.2d 390, 393 (1984). However, \u201cnot all of the listed circumstances must be proved in every case.\u201d <em>Cantrell v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 387, 398, 329 S.E.2d 22, 29 (1985). Rather, \u201cthose circumstances which <em>are </em>proved must each be consistent with guilt and inconsistent with innocence, and ... they must also be consistent with each other, that is to say, they must <em>concur </em>in pointing to the defendant as the perpetrator beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2018While no single piece of evidence may be sufficient, the \u2018combined force of many concurrent and related circumstances, each insufficient in itself, may lead a reasonable mind irresistibly to a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stamper v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 273, 257 S.E.2d 808, 818 (1979) (quoting <em>Karnes, </em>125 Va. at 764, 99 S.E. at 564).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Here, the circumstantial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, proved beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was criminally responsible for Jackson\u2019s murder, either as the trigger man or as a principal in the second degree by aiding and abetting the murder. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-18 (\u201cIn the case of every felony, every principal in the second degree ... may be indicted, tried, convicted and punished in all respects as if a principal in the first degree ____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Appellant had a powerful motive for wanting Jackson dead. In her confession to police, which the prosecution did not use to prove the truth of its contents, Jackson had implicated appellant in a marijuana distribution conspiracy, and police wanted Jackson to testify against appellant on related charges. Police had also gathered other evidence implicating appellant in marijuana distribution, the admission of which was not challenged by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>The day before appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing in June 2002, Jackson said she had to meet appellant at a particular location to talk \u201cabout court.\u201d Jackson then went to that location, where appellant\u2019s wife succeeded in talking Jackson out of testifying against appellant and had her sign a statement saying her earlier confession implicating appellant was false. Appellant was not in the immediate presence of Jackson and appellant\u2019s wife during that encounter, but he paced on a nearby sidewalk. Jackson refused to testify at appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing, and the charges against appellant were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">By August 2002, however, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office was planning to directly indict appellant on the charges previously dismissed at his preliminary hearing and again sought to have Jackson testify against him. The Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney told Jackson\u2019s lawyer how he planned to proceed against Jackson if she persisted in her refusal to testify against appellant. On Friday, August 30, 2002, Jackson\u2019s attorney advised Jackson that she should testify against appellant, and on the evening of Saturday, August 31, 2002, Jackson told her cousin, Missy Jones, she planned to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The only reasonable inference flowing from the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, is that appellant also learned of Jackson\u2019s intent to testify, giving him a motive for wanting her dead. Appellant\u2019s wife tried to reach Jackson by telephone the evening of Friday, August 30, 2002, but Jackson was not at home. On Sunday, September 1, 2002, appellant himself phoned Jackson at the residence she shared with her sister. Jackson immediately dressed her two-year-old daughter and drove her to the home of her friend and babysitter, Farah Canada, where she arrived at about 12:00 noon. Jackson told Canada she was going to meet appellant \u201cdown the dirt road past [appellant\u2019s] house\u201d and that \u201cshe would be right back,\u201d but Jackson never returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Jackson\u2019s body was subsequently found on property owned by appellant\u2019s father, in the location where Jackson had told Canada she was going to meet appellant. Jackson had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>shot, and within an eight-foot radius of her body, police found fresh shell casings of the same type police had recovered from beneath appellant\u2019s bed in a search of his home in March 2002. Evidence at the scene indicated Jackson had been dragged through the underbrush from another location a short distance away to the spot where her body was found. In the original location, police found an earring Jackson had been wearing when she left home shortly before she disappeared, as well as a spot of her blood and a pocketknife. The forensic evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, established that it was \u201cMillions of times more likely\u201d that appellant was one of the contributors to the DNA on the knife grip as opposed to some unknown individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">When police conducted an additional search of the area several days later, they located a large hole they referred to as \u201ca make-shift grave,\u201d about 150 feet from where Jackson\u2019s body had been found. The hole itself was eleven inches deep and contained \u201ca small amount\u201d of \u201cstanding water.\u201d Rainfall records admitted at trial established that two inches of rain fell between 7:00 a.m. on Saturday, August 31, and 7:00 a.m. on Sunday, September 1, 2002. However, between 7:00 a.m. on Sunday, September 1, and the time police found the hole, the area had only a negligible amount of rain, permitting the inference that the hole had been dug no later than 7:00 a.m. on September 1, 2002, <em>prior to </em>Jackson\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Appellant\u2019s cellular telephone records showed that, beginning at 12:40 p.m. on Sunday, September 1, 2002, appellant began to make a series of telephone calls first to his home and then to his wife\u2019s cellular telephone. The \u201cswitches\u201d accessed during those telephone calls indicated that appellant traveled southward past the Danville, Virginia switch and into North Carolina, where he made several calls that accessed the Reidsville, North Carolina switch between 1:57 and 2:14 p.m. Appellant admitted to police that he kept his cellular telephone in his possession at all times excepting those periods during which he was recharging it. Appellant\u2019s wife\u2019s cellular telephone records show that her telephone also traveled south during that period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Finally, appellant was seen at a particular Reidsville convenience store between 2:00 and 4:00 p.m. that afternoon, and Jackson\u2019s car was found abandoned in the adjacent parking lot of a hotel later that evening. The place where Jackson\u2019s car was found was about 58 miles from the crime scene and took police about one hour seven minutes to reach by car.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The only reasonable hypothesis flowing from this evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, is that appellant learned Jackson planned to testify against him; killed her to prevent her from doing so; drove her car to Reidsville, North Carolina, where he abandoned it; and met his wife or someone else using her cellular telephone, with whom he drove back to Virginia. Appellant\u2019s hypothesis that the father of Jackson\u2019s unborn baby could have killed her does not flow from the evidence, as the testimony established that police interviewed him on at least two occasions and did not consider him a suspect. Appellant, by contrast, had motive, opportunity, and means, and the circumstantial evidence \u201cpoint[ed] to [him] as the perpetrator beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Cantrell, </em>229 Va. at 398, 329 S.E.2d at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">HARMLESS ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">As discussed, <em>supra, </em>in Part II.A.3.a.(2), the trial court\u2019s admission of Jackson\u2019s statements about where she went to meet appellant on numerous prior occasions was error because this evidence was not relevant to prove where she went on September 1, 2002. Nevertheless, the erroneous admission of this evidence does not require reversal if the error was harmless. We conclude the error was harmless.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Y\">In Virginia, non-constitutional error is harmless \u201c[w]hen it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-678 (emphasis added). \u201c[A] fair trial on the merits and substantial justice\u201d are not achieved if an error at trial has affected the verdict. Consequently, under Code \u00a7 8.01-678, a crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>nal conviction must be reversed unless \u201cit plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that\u201d the error did not affect the verdict. An error does not affect a verdict if a reviewing court can conclude, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-5\"><em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) (en banc). <em>See generally Clay, </em>262 Va. at 260, 546 S.E.2d at 732 (adopting federal standard for determining whether non-constitutional error is harmless, including provision that verdict should stand if it \u201c \u2018did not influence the jury[] or had but slight effect\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 764-65, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1248, 90 L.Ed. 1557, 1566-67 (1946)).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">An error is harmless if \u201cother evidence of guilt is \u2018so overwhelming and the error so insignificant by comparison that the error could not have affected the verdict,\u2019 \u201d or, \u201ceven if the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt is not overwhelming, if the evidence admitted in error was merely cumulative of other, undisputed evidence.\u201d <em>Ferguson v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 9, 12, 427 S.E.2d 442, 444-45 (1993) (quoting <em>Hooker v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 454, 458 n. 2, 418 S.E.2d 343, 345 n. 2 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Here, both theories establish the harmlessness of the error in appellant\u2019s case. First, Jackson\u2019s erroneously admitted statements about where she was going to meet appellant on occasions prior to September 1, 2002, to the extent they may have been considered by the jury, were less probative of the facts at issue in the case than other properly admitted evidence \u2014 Jackson\u2019s statement about where she was going to meet appellant on the date at issue, September 1, 2002, immediately prior to her disappearance. Thus, to the extent the jury may have considered the irrelevant evidence as probative, it was \u201cmerely cumulative of other, undisputed evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">Second, we conclude the error was harmless because, as discussed in detail, <em>supra, </em>in Part H.D., \u201cother evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>guilt [was] \u2018so overwhelming and the error so insignificant by comparison that the error could not have affected the verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ferguson, </em>16 Va.App. at 12, 427 S.E.2d at 444-45 (quoting <em>Hooker, </em>14 Va.App. at 458 n. 2, 418 S.E.2d at 345 n. 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Further, the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Lig\u00f3n, </em>discussed in more detail, <em>supra, </em>in Part II.A.3.a.(2), does not support a contrary result. In <em>Lig\u00f3n, </em>a civil case, the record contained no evidence of the defendant doctor\u2019s conduct on the occasion at issue, and the doctor himself had no independent recollection of the patient whose treatment was at issue. 258 Va. at 309-10, 519 S.E.2d at 362-63. Thus, the only evidence regarding how the doctor treated the deceased patient\u2019s symptoms was the challenged evidence of how he routinely treated other patients with similar complaints. <em>Id. </em>Here, unlike in <em>Lig\u00f3n, </em>the record contained properly admitted evidence to establish what the victim said about where she was going on the precise day at issue, September 1, 2002, rendering the improperly admitted evidence of her prior actions or habit merely secondary. Thus, the risk that the improperly admitted evidence would \u201cmislead the jury\u201d or \u201cdivert its attention from the issues before the court\u201d was significantly lower than in <em>Ligon. Id. </em>at 311, 519 S.E.2d at 363. Coupled with the other overwhelming, albeit circumstantial, evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt, we hold the erroneous admission of Jackson\u2019s prior statements to Canada was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">For these reasons, we hold the trial court\u2019s admissions of the challenged hearsay statements and the eyewitness identifications did not constitute reversible error. We hold further that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motions for mistrial. Finally, we conclude the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s convictions. Thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b796-10\">.

When those defenses are not in issue, and when the accused has not been made aware of the victim\u2019s state of mind, the statement would become relevant only through \u201ca circuitous series of inferences.\u201d <em>United States v.

In so holding, the decision in <em>Hanson </em>contradicted its earlier assertion that a homicide victim's state of mind is relevant <em>only </em>where the death was the result of suicide, accident, or self-defense because the defendant in <em>Hanson </em>made no such claim. <em>Id. </em>at 179-80, 416 S.E.2d at 17-19 (reciting Hanson's testimony implicating another).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b809-8\">.
