Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. Div. Of Child Support Enforcement, </em>43 Va.App. 463, 598 S.E.2d 778 (2004), decided July 13, 2004. Angela Hodges appeals the trial court\u2019s decision affirming an administrative support order issued by the Commonwealth of Virginia, Department of Social Services, Division of Child Support Enforcement (DCSE), requiring reimbursement of a public assistance debt incurred on behalf of her minor child. She contends that Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 precludes DCSE from collecting the debt from her. Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we lift the stay of this Court\u2019s July 13, 2004 mandate. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Angela M. Hodges and Ronald R. Hodges are the parents of N., born in 1989. From 1990 to 1995, N. resided with her paternal grandmother, Phyllis Hodges. During that time, Phyllis Hodges received Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits from the Department of Social Services for the care of N. Ronald Hodges reimbursed the Department of Social Services for all but $2,860 of the TANF moneys paid for N.\u2019s benefit. In 1995, N. returned to Ronald and Angela Hodges\u2019 home. Angela Hodges was not then receiving any public assistance moneys, including TANF. However, the household did receive food stamps and Medicaid assistance for the benefit of her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">In 2002, DCSE issued an administrative support order seeking reimbursement from Angela Hodges for the balance of the TANF moneys paid on behalf of N. The order required that Angela pay $65 per month toward the debt. Angela <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Hodges appealed the administrative support order to the juvenile and domestic relations district court, which dismissed the order. DCSE appealed the decision to the circuit court, which found that Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 did not bar DCSE from collecting the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">On appeal, questions of statutory interpretation are reviewed <em>de novo </em>by this Court. Issues of \u201cpure statutory interpretation [are] the prerogative of the judiciary.\u201d <em>Sims Wholesale Co. v. Brown-Forman Corp., </em>251 Va. 398, 404, 468 S.E.2d 905, 908 (1996). \u201cThis axiom stems from basic principles of separation of powers. \u2018It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\u2019 \u201d <em>Finnerty v. Thornton Hall, Inc., </em>42 Va.App. 628, 635, 593 S.E.2d 568, 571 (2004) (quoting <em>Marbury v. Madison, </em>1 Cranch 137, 5 U.S. 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803)). Therefore, \u201cwe review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d Rollins v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 73, 79, 554 S.E.2d 99, 102 (2001) (citing <em>Timbers v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 187, 193, 503 S.E.2d 233, 236 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Angela Hodges contends that Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 precludes DCSE from assessing or collecting a TANF debt from her because she is receiving food stamps and Medicaid for children living in her home. Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As2\">Any payment of public assistance money made to or for the benefit of any dependent child or children or their custodial parent creates a debt due and owing to the Department by the person or persons who are responsible for support of such children or custodial parent in an amount equal to the amount of public assistance money so paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">When DCSE makes payments of public assistance money on behalf of the child of a noncustodial parent, under Code \u00a7 63.2-1908, the noncustodial parent becomes obligated to DCSE for the debt. Code \u00a7 63.2-1900 defines a noncustodial parent as \u201ca responsible person who is or may be obligated under Virginia law for support of a dependent child or child\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>caretaker.\u201d DCSE paid TANF to Phyllis Hodges, while Angela Hodges was a noncustodial parent, on behalf of Angela Hodges\u2019 child, N. Therefore, Angela Hodges, as a person responsible for the support of N., is a parent obligated under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">However, Code \u00a7 68.2-1908 includes a proviso: the debt is not to be incurred or collected from a noncustodial parent while she is receiving \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d for the benefit of the child.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">Debt created by an administrative support order under this section shall not be incurred by nor at any time be collected from a noncustodial parent who is the recipient of <em>public assistance moneys </em>for the benefit of minor dependent children for the period such person or persons are in such status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hodges contends that in Code \u00a7 63.2-1908, the term \u201cpublic assistance\u201d means the same thing as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>\u201cpublic assistance money.\u201d She contends that because her household receives \u201cpublic assistance\u201d in the form of food stamps and Medicaid for the benefit of her children, DCSE is prohibited by the statute from collecting the outstanding TANF debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">The Virginia Code does not define \u201cpublic assistance moneys.\u201d However, it does define \u201cpublic assistance\u201d to mean \u201cTemporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF); auxiliary grants to the aged, blind and disabled; medical assistance; energy assistance; food stamps; employment services; child care; and general relief.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.2-100. In some parts of Code \u00a7 63.2-1908, the legislature used the phrase \u201cpublic assistance,\u201d and in other parts it used the phrase, \u201cpublic assistance moneys.\u201d The question then becomes what the legislature meant by the phrases \u201cpublic assistance\u201d and \u201cpub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>lie assistance moneys\u201d in the same statute. The General Assembly is presumed to have given the two different phrases two different meanings. \u201c \u201cWhen the General Assembly uses two different terms in the same act, it is presumed to mean two different things.\u2019\u201d <em>Klarfeld v. Salsbury, </em>233 Va. 277, 284-85, 355 S.E.2d 319, 323 (1987) (quoting <em>Forst v. Rockingham Poultry Marketing Coop., Inc., </em>222 Va. 270, 278, 279 S.E.2d 400, 404 (1981)); <em>see also Morris v. Va. Retirement Sys., </em>28 Va.App. 799, 805-06, 508 S.E.2d 925, 928 (1999) (\u201cHad the legislature intended that the phrases \u2018any payments\u2019 ... and \u2018periodic payments for disability or death\u2019 ... [in the same statute] meant the same thing, they would have used the same terms.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Clearly, Code \u00a7 63.2-100 defines food stamps and Medicaid as \u201cpublic assistance.\u201d However, that does not make them \u201cpublic assistance <em>moneys.\u201d </em>If the legislature intended to include all forms of public assistance as defined by Code \u00a7 63.2-100, it would have only used the phrase \u201cpublic assistance\u201d in Code \u00a7 63.2-1908. If we interpret the phrase \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d to mean all forms of public assistance, the word \u201cmoneys\u201d would add nothing to the term \u201cpublic assistance\u201d and would be deprived of any effect. The word \u201cmoneys\u201d would be rendered superfluous. The Virginia Supreme Court has long held that \u201c[w]hen analyzing a statute, we must assume that \u2018the legislature chose, with care, the words it used ... and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Va. Beach v. ESG Enters., Inc., </em>243 Va. 149, 153, 413 S.E.2d 642, 644 (1992) (quoting <em>Barr v. Town and Country Props., </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990)); <em>see also Huffman v. Kite, </em>198 Va. 196, 199, 93 S.E.2d 328, 330 (1956); <em>Frazier v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 131, 135, 497 S.E.2d 879, 881 (1998). Virginia courts are bound, where possible, to give meaning to every word of a statute. <em>See, e.g., Monument Assocs. v. Arlington County Bd., </em>242 Va. 145, 149, 408 S.E.2d 889, 891 (1991); <em>Baker v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 306, 504 S.E.2d 394 (1998). \u201cIt is the duty of the courts to give effect, if possible, to every word of the written law.\u201d <em>Moyer v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 8, 35, 531 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>580, 593 (2000). A word or clause contained in a statute may-only be rejected as surplusage if it \u201cappears to have been inserted through inadvertence or mistake, and which is incapable of any sensible meaning,\u201d or is otherwise repugnant to the rest of the statute. <em>Burnette v. Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 785, 788-89, 75 S.E.2d 482, 485 (1953). \u201c[N]o part of an act should be treated as meaningless unless absolutely necessary.\u201d <em>Garrison v. First Fed. Savings and Loan Ass\u2019n of S.C., </em>241 Va. 335, 340, 402 S.E.2d 25, 28 (1991) (citing <em>Raven Red Ash Coal Corp. v. Absher, </em>153 Va. 332, 335, 149 S.E. 541, 542 (1929)). Therefore, to ensure that the word \u201cmoneys\u201d in the phrase \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d is given meaning, its definition must exclude food stamps and Medicaid assistance. \u201cIt is a well established rule of construction that a statute ought to be interpreted in such a manner that it may have effect, and not found to be vain and elusive.\u201d <em>Barnett v. D.L. Bromwell, Inc., </em>6 Va.App. 30, 34, 366 S.E.2d 271, 273 (1988) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>McFadden v. McNorton, </em>193 Va. 455, 461, 69 S.E.2d 445, 449 (1952)). \u201cWe must assume that the legislature did not intend to do a vain and useless thing.\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>190 Va. 280, 293, 56 S.E.2d 537, 543 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Some forms of public assistance are provided as cash transfers and others are not.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Virginia TANF is defined as a program in which a \u201crelative can receive monthly cash assistance for the support of his eligible children.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.2-100; <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 601 (providing that the purpose of TANF is to \u201cprovide assistance to needy families so that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>children may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives\u201d). On the other hand, some forms of public assistance are provided as non-cash transfers for specific goods and/or services. \u201cThe food stamp program allows qualified stores to accept food stamps instead of cash for certain food items. The store can then redeem the stamps for their cash value.\u201d <em>Traficanti v. United States, </em>227 F.3d 170, 174 (4th Cir.2000) (citing 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011 <em>et seq.). </em>\u201cCoupons issued to eligible households shall be used by them only to purchase food in retail food stores which have been approved for participation in the food stamp program at prices prevailing in such stores.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2016(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cCoupons issued and used as provided in [the Food Stamp Act are] redeemable [by the retail food stores] at face value by the Secretary [of Agriculture] through the facilities of the Treasury of the United States.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2013. Medicaid consists of reimbursements from the Department of Medical Assistance Services directly to medical providers for eligible services they render to eligible patients. <em>See generally </em>12 VAC 30; Code \u00a7\u00a7 32.1-310, -325. Recipients do not receive the benefit in any form other than services provided. The difference between TANF, food stamps and Medicaid is that the latter two forms of public assistance entail transfers to third parties. Neither food stamps nor Medicaid assistance consist of a fungible payment to the recipients. These forms of assistance are for goods or services supplied by third-party providers who are approved by the respective program administrators. The payments are then made to the third-party providers by government agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The only other court that has addressed this specific issue has held that food stamps and medical benefits are not \u201cpublic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>assistance moneys.\u201d In <em>Dep\u2019t of Soc. and Health Services v. Gerlack, </em>25 Wash.App. 541, 612 P.2d 382 (1980), a Washington appeals court interpreted a Washington statute almost identical to the Virginia statute at issue. It concluded that \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d had to denote something different from \u201cpublic assistance,\u201d \u201cbecause each word of a statute is to be given significance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385 (citation omitted). The relevant facts in <em>Gerlack </em>were almost identical to those in the instant case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">In addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that food stamps are not \u201cpublic assistance payments.\u201d <em>Siemens v. Bergland, </em>591 F.2d 1263, 1264 (9th Cir.1978). In the <em>Siemens </em>case, recipients of payments under a Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) program wanted the Secretary of Agriculture to include weekly CETA program payments in calculating their incomes for the purposes of food stamp eligibility. However, a CETA statute provided that the weekly payments were to be \u201cdisregarded in determining the amount of public assistance payments under Federal or Federally assisted public assistance programs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 821(a)). If food stamps were \u201cpublic assistance payments,\u201d then the Secretary could not include the CETA payments in the income calculations. If food stamps were not \u201cpublic assistance payments,\u201d the statute did not prohibit the Secretary from including the payments as income. The Court held that \u201cfood stamps are not \u2018public assistance payments\u2019 as defined in the CETA statute....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">If food stamps and Medicaid are included in the Virginia statutory phrase \u201cpublic assistance moneys,\u201d as Hodges urges, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 would then also mean that DCSE could collect from a noncustodial parent the amount of food stamps and Medicaid expended on behalf of his/her child. The first sentence of Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\">Any payment of <em>public assistance money </em>made to or for the benefit of any dependent child or children or their custodial parent creates a debt due and owing to the Department by the person or persons who are responsible for support of such children or custodial parent in an amount equal to the amount of <em>public assistance money </em>so paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">(Emphasis added.) In fact, if \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d includes food stamps and Medicaid payments, then DCSE would have a statutory obligation to collect the amount of those forms of public assistance expended on behalf of the dependent child from the noncustodial parent. Otherwise, the exact term, \u201cpublic assistance moneys,\u201d would be given a different meaning in the same statute. In the first sentence, \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d would mean \u201cTANF payments,\u201d and in the second to last sentence of the statute, the proviso at issue in this appeal, \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d would mean \u201cTANF payments, food stamps and Medicaid assistance.\u201d Considered as a whole, the legislature could not have possibly intended to assign two different meanings to the phrase \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d in the same statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>meanings of the words are adopted, it must be presumed that the legislature intended to give separate meanings to the phrases \u201cpublic assistance\u201d and \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d and did not intend merely to incorporate superfluous language. <em>See Burnette, </em>194 Va. at 788-89, 75 S.E.2d at 484-85.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Defining the phrase to include TANF payments, as opposed to TANF payments, food stamps and Medicaid, provides consistency and gives meaning to every word and phrase within the statute. \u201cWhen analyzing a statute, we must assume that \u2018the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute, and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Frazier, </em>27 Va.App. at 135, 497 S.E.2d at 881 (quoting <em>ESG Enters., Inc., </em>243 Va. at 153, 413 S.E.2d at 644).

Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\">\u201c[i]f the comparison of one clause with the rest of the statute makes a certain proposition clear and undoubted, the act must be construed accordingly and ought to be so construed as to make it a consistent whole.

Interpreting the phrase \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d throughout the statute to exclude food stamps and Medicaid assistance provides the greatest harmony and the least inconsistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">We hold that food stamps and Medicaid assistance are not \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d as contemplated in Code \u00a7 63.2-1908. The legislature did not exempt noncustodial parents receiving those forms of public assistance from reimbursing DCSE for moneys expended on behalf of their children. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-7\">. We do not agree with the premises of the concurring opinion for several reasons. First, the concurrence urges the Court to decide this case on the ground that the proviso does not apply due to the trial court's finding that Hodges is \"not now a noncustodial parent,\u201d a prerequisite to application of the exemption. Neither party questioned that finding, nor did they question the trial court's application or the meaning of \"noncustodial parent\u201d as it is used in Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 at the three-judge panel stage of these proceedings. <em>See Hodges, </em>43 Va.App. at 467 n. 1, 598 S.E.2d at 780 n. 1. The Court could not have addressed the noncustodial parent issue at the panel stage because it was not made part of the \"questions presented.\u201d <em>See Cirrito v. Cirrito, </em>44 Va.App. 287, 309, 605 S.E.2d 268, 278 (2004) (noting that arguments not presented in the \"questions presented\u201d will not be considered (citing Rule 5A:20(c)-(e))). In an analogous context, we have held that, generally, we will not consider \"additional authority on rehearing that could have been presented before the original panel.\u201d <em>Rusty\u2019s Welding Serv., Inc. v. Gibson, </em>29 Va.App. 119, 124 n. 1, 510 S.E.2d 255, 258 n. 1 (1999) <em>(en banc); see also Coleman v. City of Richmond, </em>6 Va.App. 296, 297 n. 1, 368 S.E.2d 298, 300 n. 1 (1988). It follows that the Court should not base its decision on grounds not raised at the panel level and not argued by either party. In short, the issue as to whether Hodges is a \"noncustodial parent\u201d has been defaulted on appeal. Therefore, we cannot agree with the \"narrower grounds\u201d upon which the concurrence rests its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Second, the concurring opinion's <em>sua sponte </em>interpretation of the meaning of \u201cnoncustodial parent\u201d is misplaced. Code \u00a7 63.2-1900 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>defines \"noncustodial parent\u201d not in terms of physical custody, but as the \"responsible person who is or may be obligated under Virginia law for support of a dependent child or caretaker.\u201d <em>See also 22 </em>VAC \u00a7 40-880-10. We are bound by the plain language of the statutory definition of \"noncustodial parent.\u201d <em>See Beck v.

The concurrence states that \u201c[l]f one of these prerequisites is not met (i.e., the individual is not a non-custodial parent or is not receiving public assistance money), then this limited exception does not apply----\" Such reasoning fails to properly apply the statutory definitions of \"noncustodial parent\u201d and \"debt\u201d within the context of the statutes. A \"debt\u201d is \"the total unpaid support obligation established by ... the payment of public assistance and owed by a noncustodial parent....\u201d Code \u00a7 63.2-1900. There is no statutory provision allowing Hodges to change her status from a noncustodial parent to \"not a non-custodial parent\u201d once the debt has been incurred. The only status that can change is the time period in which a debt can be incurred or the time period in which an obligation must be repaid. Therefore, the \"period\u201d to which the proviso refers is the period in which the noncustodial parent is \"the recipient of public assistance moneys for the benefit of minor dependent children.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.2-1908. Immunity from paying that debt does not depend on whether the noncustodial parent takes physical custody of the child. The noncustodial parent has debt immunity only when she is receiving public assistance moneys for the benefit of her dependent child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-5\">. \"Cash\u201d in this context should also be understood to include other forms of universally accepted fungible currency, such as checks.

The dissent relies on the definition of \"money[s]\u201d from <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1021 (7th ed.1999): \"assets that can easily be converted to cash.\u201d That meaning requires fungibility. As we point out below, food stamps and Medicaid assistance are not fungible, nor are they assets that can legally be converted to cash. Therefore, we do not agree that our meaning of moneys ignores the \"everyday, ordinary\u201d understanding of the word.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b176-5\">. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2024(b) details the fines and prison terms that may be levied against an individual convicted of the unauthorized use, transfer, acquisition, alteration, or possession of food stamp coupons or authorization cards.

We also note that the second and third sentences of Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 support the interpretation that the phrase \"public assistance moneys\u201d does not include food stamps and Medicaid assistance. If food stamps and/or Medicaid assistance are being received for the benefit of a child in the household who is not receiving TANF payments, the parent is not obligated to pay back the amount of the food stamps/Medicaid assistance. The obligation created is only for the amount of moneys paid, i.e., TANF payments or other types of cash assistance. Those sentences state,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">However, if a custodial parent receives TANF payments for some of the custodial parent's dependent children pursuant to \u00a7 63.2-604, the custodial parent shall receive the total amount of support collected for the children for whom no TANF benefits are received.

DCSE is not permitted to keep child support payments for children who are not receiving TANF or other cash assistance, even if food stamps and/or Medicaid assistance is being paid for their benefit.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b179-5\">. The dissent contends that the meaning of \u00a7 63.2-1908 should be ascertained by viewing it in relation to Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.2-1909 and -1910. While those statutes fall successively under Subtitle V, Administrative Child Support, Title 19, Child Support Enforcement, Article 2, Public Assistance, they are not part of a larger \"act.\" <em>But cf., Moreno v. Moreno, </em>24 Va.App. 190, 197, 480 S.E.2d 792, 796 (1997) (\u201cWhen the General Assembly uses different terms in the same <em>act, </em>it is presumed to mean different things____'In construing a statute the court should seek to discover the intention of the legislature as ascertained <em>from the act itself </em>when read in the light of other statutes relating to the same subject matter.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 33, 38, 409 S.E.2d 21, 24 (1991) (emphasis added))).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">In any event, if you apply Code \u00a7 63.2-1909 to our analysis, the treatment of the phrases \"public assistance\u201d and \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d is consistent with our interpretation of those phrases. Code \u00a7 63.2-1909 states that anyone who receives public assistance on behalf of a child is deemed to have assigned to DCSE any rights to any support payments up to the amount of public assistance <em>moneys </em>expended. It also allows DCSE to collect any outstanding support obligation from a noncustodial parent up to the amount of <em>moneys </em>expended on behalf of a child until that debt is repaid. The debt consists of the amount of <em>moneys </em>expended, not the amount of assistance provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">In addition, although the statutes all concern obligations created as a result of the payment of federally funded public assistance moneys on behalf of a child, the subject matter of each statute is different. Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 addresses TANF debt; Code \u00a7 63.2-1909 addresses the assignment of child support obligations; and Code \u00a7 63.2-1910 addresses foster care maintenance payments debt. The Federal code requires states receiving Federal TANF block grants to include a process for an assignment of support rights as a condition of providing assistance to a family. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 608(a)(3); <em>see generally </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 601 <em>et seq. </em>Support rights secured by a state as a condition for receiving TANF assistance (pursuant to Title IV, Part A of the Social Security Act) or on behalf of a child receiving foster care maintenance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>payments (pursuant to Title IV, Part E of the Social Security Act) creates an obligation in the person responsible for supporting the child. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 656(a)(1). Such obligations are to be collected by the state, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 656; however, the federal government does not prescribe the process under which those obligations are to be collected. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 617. Because the Commonwealth is required by the federal government to collect debt created by TANF/support payments and foster care maintenance payments, the General Assembly enacted statutes to meet those federal requirements. In doing so, the legislature enacted separate statutes for purposes of collecting TANF/support debt, Code \u00a7 63.2-1908, and foster care maintenance payments, Code \u00a7 63.2-1910. The legislature could have elected to enact one statute to cover both types of debt. However, it chose to treat TANF/support debt separately, and differently, from foster care maintenance payments debt. In the case of TANF, the legislature allows the noncustodial parent an exemption from paying back the debt while she is receiving money payments on behalf of the child. In the case of foster care maintenance payments, the legislature allows the noncustodial parent an exemption while she is receiving any kind of public assistance for the benefit of the child. Without enumerating them, we note that the eligibility requirements for receiving TANF assistance and the eligibility requirements for receiving foster care maintenance payments are different. Therefore, the intent of the legislature may have been to treat the collection of the different types of debt under each program differently. There is no requirement, federal or otherwise, that the General Assembly enact congruent provisos in the two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Simply put, in each of the statutes, Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.2-1908, -1909, and - 1910, if any kind of public assistance is provided on behalf of a child, the noncustodial parent must pay back <em>moneys </em>expended for the benefit of the child, unless the noncustodial parent is exempted. We must presume that the legislature chose its words with care and that each of the words has a specific meaning and is not superfluous. <em>ESG Enters., Inc., </em>243 Va. at 153, 413 S.E.2d at 644; <em>Burnette, </em>194 Va. at 788-89, 75 S.E.2d at.485.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b181-9\">HUMPHREYS, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A1Q\">concurring in result.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">I concur in the plurality\u2019s decision to affirm the judgment of the trial court in this case, but I write separately because I believe the case can and should be decided on narrower grounds.

Commonwealth v. Harley, </em>256 Va. 216, 219-20, 504 S.E.2d 852, 854 (1998) (declining the appellant\u2019s invitation \u201cto render an advisory opinion on a moot question based upon speculative facts,\u201d reasoning that \u201ccourts are not constituted ... to render advisory opinions, to decide moot questions or to answer inquiries which are merely speculative,\u201d and concluding that the court would instead \u201cawait the arrival of a case in which\u201d the issue was properly presented).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Under Code \u00a7 63.2-1908,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">[a]ny payment of public assistance money made to or for the benefit of any dependent child or children ... creates a debt due and owing to the Department by the person or persons who are responsible for support of such children ... in an amount equal to the amount of public assistance money so paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Thus, where TANF funds are distributed for the benefit of a minor child, the person \u201cresponsible\u201d for supporting that child incurs a debt and is obligated to repay the Department an amount equivalent to the funds distributed. Here, Hodges does not argue that she was not \u201cresponsible\u201d for supporting her child, nor does she argue that no TANF debt was incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 also provides that: \u201cDebt created by an administrative support order shall not be ... collected from a <em>noncustodial parent </em>who is the recipient of public assistance moneys for the benefit of minor dependent children for the period such person or persons are in such status.\u201d (Emphasis added). Thus, to qualify for this limited statutory reprieve, the individual must be both: (1) a non-custodial parent, (2) who is receiving public assistance moneys. If one of these prerequisites is not met (i.e., the individual is not a noncustodial parent or is not receiving public assistance money), then this limited exception does not apply, and the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>ment is free to pursue the individual for any debt that might be owed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Here, Hodges is contending that this statutory exception should apply because she is currently receiving public assistance moneys in the form of food stamps and Medicaid. The plurality has rejected her argument, holding that food stamps and Medicaid are not equivalent to \u201cpublic assistance moneys.\u201d However, I would hold that the statutory exception my colleagues seek to interpret does not apply in this case because the trial court expressly found that Hodges is \u201cnot now a noncustodial parent.\u201d Hodges has not appealed this factual finding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, because Hodges is not currently a \u201cnoncustodial parent,\u201d the statutory exemption does not apply, regardless of whether she is currently receiving public assistance moneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Hodges argues on appeal that the parties have implicitly, if not directly, agreed that she is a non-custodial parent. However, where the parties fail to appeal a finding of fact, that finding becomes conclusive and binding on this Court. <em>See, e.g., Tran v. Gwinn, </em>262 Va. 572, 582, 554 S.E.2d 63, 69 (2001). The parties simply cannot dispose of an issue on appeal by rewriting the trial court\u2019s findings of fact \u2014 they may as easily agree that the sky is green, but such an agreement would hardly make it so.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Moreover, the trial court\u2019s finding that Hodges is \u201cnot now a noncustodial parent\u201d is supported by evidence in the record. The resolution of this issue necessitates an inquiry into who, exactly, is a \u201cnoncustodial parent\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Because I am of the opinion that a \u201cnoncustodial parent\u201d is not necessarily equivalent to an \u201cobligor parent,\u201d I believe the trial court correctly found that Hodges \u2014 although an obligor parent \u2014 is \u201cnot now a noncustodial parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u201cNoncustodial parent\u201d is defined as a \u201cresponsible person who is or may be obligated under Virginia law for support of a dependent child or child\u2019s caretaker.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.2-1900; <em>see also </em>22 VAC 40-880-10. Although the current statute does not define \u201cresponsible person,\u201d former Code \u00a7 63.1-250 defined \u201cresponsible person\u201d as \u201cany obligor or person obligated under Virginia law for support of a dependent child or the child\u2019s caretaker.\u201d <em>See </em>22 VAC 40-880-10 (defining \u201cnoncustodial parent\u201d and incorporating by reference definition of \u201cresponsible person\u201d from \u201cCode \u00a7 63.1-250\u201d). Because a \u201cresponsible person\u201d encompasses \u201cany obligor <em>or </em>person,\u201d a non-custodial parent is, therefore, \u201cany \u2018obligor <em>or person </em>\u2018 who is or may be obligated under Virginia law for support of a dependent child or child\u2019s caretaker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Both the plurality and the dissent suggest that a \u201cnoncustodial parent\u201d is merely an obligor, or a parent who has already incurred a TANF debt. However, the definition of \u201cnoncustodial parent\u201d does not specifically incorporate the phrase \u201cobligor,\u201d instead using the term \u201cresponsible person.\u201d And, as noted above, a \u201cresponsible person\u201d is \u201cany obligor <em>or person </em>obligated under Virginia law for support of a dependent child or the child\u2019s caretaker.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.1-250 (repealed effective Oct. 1, 2002) (emphasis added). A \u201cresponsible person,\u201d then, is not necessarily an \u201cobligor.\u201d As a result, a \u201cnoncustodial parent\u201d might be, but is not necessarily, an obligor. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 37, 40, 434 S.E.2d 914, 915 (1993) (\u201cWhile certain conduct might be construed to fall within the definitions of both \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cdisplay,\u201d the two words are not synonymous. The definition of neither neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>sarily includes the definition of the other.\u201d). Thus, I cannot agree that \u201cnoncustodial\u201d is synonymous with \u201cobligor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">This conclusion is farther supported by the fact that the General Assembly defined \u201cobligor\u201d separately from, and more broadly than, \u201cnoncustodial parent.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 63.2-1900. And, as the plurality and dissent correctly point out, \u201c[w]hen the General Assembly uses two different terms in the same act, it is presumed to mean two different things,\u201d <em>Forst v. Rockingham, Poultry Mktg. Coop., </em>222 Va. 270, 278, 279 S.E.2d 400, 404 (1981), and \u201cno part of an act should be treated as meaningless unless absolutely necessary,\u201d <em>Garrison v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan </em>Assoc., 241 Va. 335, 340, 402 S.E.2d 25, 28 (1991). Thus, the terms \u201cnoncustodial\u201d and \u201cobligor\u201d cannot be read interchangeably, but must instead be given separate and distinct meanings. See <em>Indus. Dev. Auth. v.

Here, had the General Assembly intended for the statutory exception contained in Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 to apply to \u201cobligor\u201d parents who are receiving public assistance money, it presumably would have used the term \u201cobligor\u201d \u2014 which is defined and used throughout the statute \u2014 rather than the term \u201cnoncustodial.\u201d Interposing \u201cobligor\u201d in Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 in place of \u201cnoncustodial\u201d would effectively rewrite the statutory provision \u2014 a task suited for the legislature, not this Court. <em>See Barr v.

Accordingly, to give effect to the adjective \u201cnon-custodial,\u201d I believe this statutory definition must be read in conjunction with the phrase \u201ccustodial parent,\u201d which is defined as \u201cthe natural or adoptive parent with whom the child resides; a stepparent or other person who has physical custody of the child and with whom the child resides; or a local board that has legal custody of a child in foster care.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.2-1900; <em>see also Dep\u2019t of Med.

These judges agree that the exemption from repayment set out in paragraph 4 of Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 does not apply under the facts of this case. However, they disagree over why the exemption is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The first paragraph of Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">Any payment of public assistance money made to or for the benefit of any dependent child or children or their custodial parent creates a debt due and owing to the [State] Department [of Social Services (DSS)] by the person or persons who are responsible for support of such children or custodial parent in an amount equal to the amount of public assistance money so paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number><em>See </em>Code \u00a7 63.2-100 (defining \u201cDepartment\u201d). The fourth paragraph of Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 contains the following proviso:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXu\">Debt created by an administrative support order under this section shall not be incurred by nor at any time be collected from a noncustodial parent who is the recipient of public assistance moneys for the benefit of minor dependent children for the period such person or persons are in such status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Judge Humphreys interprets the exemption as requiring a finding that the person seeking to block repayment \u201cmust be both: (1) a non-custodial parent [and] (2) ... receiving public assistance moneys.\u201d He concludes the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant is \u201cnot now a noncustodial parent\u201d was unappealed and now compels the conclusion that the exemption does not apply, obviating the need to consider the second requirement for the exemption, that the individual must be \u201creceiving public assistance money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In their separate plurality opinion, the remaining five members of the majority conclude appellant was a \u201cnoncustodial parent\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 63.2-1908. They reject Judge Humphreys\u2019 reasoning and reach the second part of the Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 repayment exemption, which requires consideration of the scope of the terms \u201cpublic assistance\u201d and \u201cpublic assistance money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Like the five-judge plurality, I reject Judge Humphreys\u2019 conclusion that the trial judge\u2019s statement \u2014 that appellant is \u201cnot now a noncustodial parent\u201d \u2014 standing alone, compels the conclusion that the Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 repayment exemption does not apply. Like the five-judge plurality, I believe the procedural posture of this case requires us to consider the scope of the terms \u201cpublic assistance\u201d and \u201cpublic assistance money\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 63.2-1908. However, I disagree with the plurality\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cpublic assistance money\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 63.2-1908. I would hold the legislature intended the meaning of that term in Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 to be coextensive with the term, \u201cpublic assistance,\u201d as defined in Code \u00a7 63.2-100. I believe an examination of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>terms as used in Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 and related statutes reveals that this interpretation is the only one that yields consistent results. Thus, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the ruling of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u201cNONCUSTODIAL PARENT\u201d UNDER CODE \u00a7 63.2-1908</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The trial court found appellant is \u201cnot now a noncustodial parent.\u201d However, it permitted DSS to recover the debt from her under Code \u00a7 63.2-1908. Assuming we are bound by the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant is \u201cnot now a noncustodial parent,\u201d we must interpret that finding in the context of its ruling <em>permitting </em>DSS to recover the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">On appeal, a ruling is entitled to a presumption of correctness; a trial court is presumed to have known and properly applied the law, absent clear evidence to the contrary. <em>See Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 971, 978, 234 S.E.2d 286, 291 (1977); <em>Oliver v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 286, 297, 544 S.E.2d 870, 875 (2001). Applying this principle to the trial court\u2019s ruling permitting DSS to recover the debt from appellant, we are compelled to conclude the court determined that, <em>at the time the debt was incurred, </em>appellant was, in fact, a \u201cnoncustodial parent\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 63.2-1908, defined in Code \u00a7 63.2-1900 merely as an \u201cobligor,\u201d \u201ca responsible person who is or may be obligated under Virginia law for support of a dependent child.\u201d Viewed in this context, we are compelled to conclude the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant is \u201cnot now a noncustodial parent\u201d means simply that, <em>at the time of the collection efforts, </em>appellant was a \u201ccustodial parent,\u201d defined in Code \u00a7 63.2-1900 as, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe natural or adoptive parent with whom the child resides.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Accordingly, I believe the decision of ten members of this Court to consider the scope of the terms \u201cpublic assistance\u201d and \u201cpublic assistance money\u201d is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u201cPUBLIC ASSISTANCE\u201d AND \u201cPUBLIC ASSISTANCE MONEY\u201d UNDER CODE \u00a7 63.2-1908</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Code \u00a7 63.2-100 defines \u201cpublic assistance\u201d as \u201cTemporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF); auxiliary grants to the aged, blind and disabled; medical assistance; energy assistance; food stamps; employment services; child care; and general relief.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 refers not only to \u201cpublic assistance\u201d but also to \u201cpublic assistance money\u201d and \u201cpublic assistance moneys.\u201d Examining the usage of these terms in Code \u00a7 63.2-1908, the plurality concludes that \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d include only those types of fungible \u201cpublic assistance\u201d paid, by cash or check, directly to the person receiving the aid, such as TANF, and not sums paid to third parties on behalf of the person entitled to aid, such as through the food stamp and Medicaid programs. By construing the word \u201cmoney[s]\u201d so narrowly as to include only direct transfers by cash or check, the plurality disregards the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cmoney\u201d in the modern world of business and government and fails to give effect to the intent of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Here, the obvious intent of the legislature in enacting the part of Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 under review was to relieve a noncustodial parent of having to repay a debt created by an administrative support order during such time that the parent \u201cis the recipient of public assistance moneys for the benefit of minor dependent children.\u201d As appellant noted, \u201cthe obvious reason for the statutory exception to assessment and collection is to prohibit the Commonwealth from depleting the extremely limited financial resources of families with children as needing and receiving public assistance.\u201d The legislature merely acknowledged the unfairness of collecting from the noncustodial parent, during the time that the parent is receiving \u201cpublic assistance moneys for the benefit of minor dependent children,\u201d a debt for TANF benefits previously paid. Here, the public assistance moneys being paid for the minor dependent children were food stamps and Medicaid benefits. Public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>policy does not condone taking \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d paid to a parent for a minor dependent child, during the time the parent is receiving such benefits, to repay other public assistance funds previously paid on behalf of that parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The plurality has adopted the most narrow and restrictive meaning of the word \u201cmoneys,\u201d in disregard of the everyday, ordinary meaning of the word in the context of the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1021 (7th ed.1999), defines \u201cmoney[s]\u201d as \u201cassets that can easily be converted to cash.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary </em>1160 (2d ed.1983), variously defines \u201cmoney[s]\u201d as \u201cany substance or article used as money, as bank notes, checks, etc.\u201d and as \u201cproperty, possessions, wealth.\u201d This broader definition of \u201cmoney[s]\u201d was clearly what the legislature intended by enacting Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 and is the only construction that achieves a reasonable and meaningful result, especially when viewed in light of the way the terms \u201cpublic assistance\u201d and \u201cpublic assistance money\u201d are used in Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.2-1909 and -1910.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Code \u00a7 63.2-1910<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> applies to foster care expenditures and creates a debt owed to the local department of social services, similar to the one owed to DSS as provided for in Code \u00a7 63.2-1908, for any \u201cpayment ... for room, board, and social services for a child in the custody of the local department or [designated] public agency.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.2-1910 contains a proviso almost identical to the one in paragraph 4 of Code \u00a7 63.2-1908, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">Debts created by an administrative support order under this section shall not be incurred by nor at any time collected from a noncustodial parent who is the recipient of <em>public assistance </em>for the benefit of minor dependent children for the period such person is in such status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>(Emphasis added). These portions of the two code sections are identical in key respects except that Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 refers to \u201cpublic assistance <em>moneys </em>\u201d whereas Code \u00a7 63.2-1910 refers only to \u201cpublic assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">I agree with the general principles of statutory construction set out in the plurality opinion that \u201c[w]hen the General Assembly uses two different terms in the same act, it is presumed to mean two different things,\u201d <em>Forst v. Rockingham Poultry Mktg. Coop., </em>222 Va. 270, 278, 279 S.E.2d 400, 404 (1981), and that \u201cno part of an act should be treated as meaningless unless absolutely necessary,\u201d <em>Garrison v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assoc., </em>241 Va. 335, 340, 402 S.E.2d 25, 28 (1991). However, settled principles of statutory construction also provide that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">Proper construction seeks to harmonize the provisions of a statute both internally <em>and in relation to other statutes. ... </em>[Legislative purpose can best be \u201c \u2018ascertained from [a particular statute] when read in light of other statutes relating to the same subject matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moreno v. Moreno, </em>24 Va.App. 190, 197, 480 S.E.2d 792, 796 (1997) (citation omitted). The doctrine of <em>pari materia </em>teaches that \u201c \u2018statutes are not to be considered as isolated fragments of law, but as a whole, or as parts of a great, connected homogenous system, or a simple and complete statutory arrangement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 480 S.E.2d at 796 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-7\"><em>DMV v. Wallace, </em>29 Va.App. 228, 233-34, 511 S.E.2d 423, 425 (1999) (citation omitted) (first emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Under the plurality\u2019s interpretation of \u201cpublic assistance money,\u201d a noncustodial parent receiving food stamps or Medicaid payments but not TANF payments would not be responsible under Code \u00a7 63.2-1910, while receiving such benefits, for paying back \u201c[a]ny [foster care] payment made by a local department ... for room, board, and social services\u201d; however, such a parent would, nevertheless, be responsible under Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 for paying DSS back for any TANF payments previously received. I would hold that in light of the clear meaning of Code \u00a7 63.2-1910, such a construction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Code \u00a7 63.2-1908 fails to give proper consideration to the parallel language of Code \u00a7 63.2-1910 and would lead to an incongruous result.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Further, in Code \u00a7 63.2-1909, the General Assembly used these terms \u2014 \u201cpublic assistance,\u201d \u201cpublic assistance money,\u201d and \u201cpublic assistance moneys\u201d \u2014 in a seemingly interchangeable fashion. That code section provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">By accepting public assistance for or on behalf of a child or children, the recipient shall be deemed to have made an assignment to the Department of any and all right, title, and interest in any support obligation and arrearages owed to or for such child or children or custodial parent up to the amount of public assistance money paid for or on behalf of such child or children or custodial parent for such term of time as such public assistance moneys are paid; provided, however, that the Department may thereafter continue to collect any outstanding support obligation or arrearage owed to the Department as a result of such assignment up to the amount of public assistance money paid for or on behalf of such child or children or custodial parent which has not been paid by the noncustodial parent. The recipient shall also be deemed, without the necessity of signing any document, to have appointed the Commissioner as his or her true and lawful attorney-in-fact to act in his or her name, place, and stead to perform the specific act of endorsing any and all drafts, checks, money orders or other negotiable instruments representing support payments which are received on behalf of such child or children or custodial parent as reimbursement for the public assistance moneys previously paid to such recipient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Applying the plurality\u2019s definition of \u201cpublic assistance moneys,\u201d Code \u00a7 63.2-1909 would permit DSS to seek reimbursement only for TANF benefits and other payments made by cash or check and not for benefits paid to third parties, such as food stamps or Medicaid. Had the General Assembly intended to limit recoupment to the amount of moneys actually paid to the recipient, it would have had no need to mention all \u201cpublic assistance\u201d in the first portion of Code \u00a7 63.2-1909. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Thus, the most logical interpretation of Code \u00a7 63.2-1909, especially when read in <em>pan materia </em>with Code \u00a7\u00a7 63.2-1908 and -1910, is that the General Assembly used interchangeably the terms \u201cpublic assistance,\u201d which it defined in the code, and \u201cpublic assistance money\u201d and \u201cmoneys,\u201d which it did not separately define.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the ruling of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\">. Appellant specifically mentioned Code \u00a7 63.2-1910 on brief on appeal.
