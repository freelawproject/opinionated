ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The circuit court dismissed an administrative appeal filed by E. Dean Christian on the ground that he failed to name the Virginia Department of Social Services (VDSS) as a party in his petition for appeal. We hold that the petition sufficiently identified VDSS as a party. For this reason, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s dismissal order and remand this matter for further proceedings on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">To administer child protective services in the Commonwealth, the General Assembly delegates authority to VDSS, a state agency governed by a state board, Code \u00a7 63.2-215, and also requires that there \u201cshall be a local department of social services for each county or city under the supervision and management of a local director.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.2-324; <em>see also </em>22 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 40-705-10 (defining \u201cDepartment\u201d and \u201clocal department\u201d). The responsibility to. investigate complaints of child abuse and neglect rests primarily with the local departments. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 63.2-1503; 22 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 40-705-50(B). Through the use of administrative hearing officers, VDSS reviews <em>de novo </em>any contested determination by a local department. <em>See </em>Code 63.2-1526(B); 22 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 40-705-190(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">In this case, the Fluvanna County Department of Social Services made an administrative finding that Christian physically abused his child. Christian requested and received an \u201cinformal conference\u201d to dispute the finding. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 63.2-1526(A); 22 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 40-705-120(E). The local department reaffirmed its earlier decision. Christian then filed a petition with VDSS for a \u201cformal hearing\u201d by an administrative hearing officer. <em>See </em>Code 63.2-1526(B). The VDSS hearing officer affirmed the local department\u2019s findings in a decision entered on July 30, 2003. His written opinion used the caption \u201cIn the matter of E. Dean Christian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Christian filed a timely appeal to the circuit court seeking judicial review pursuant to the Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA), Code \u00a7 2.2-4000, <em>et seq. See </em>Code 63.2-1526(B) (authorizing VAPA appeals of decisions of VDSS hearing officers). The caption of the petition for appeal tracked the one used in the VDSS administrative process. Styled \u201cIn the matter of E. Dean Christian, appellant,\u201d the caption identified the case number of the VDSS administrative proceeding and requested service on the \u201cCommissioner\u201d of the \u201cVirginia Department of Social Services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The text of the petition specifically identified the VDSS hearing officer by name and stated the order being appealed was the hearing officer\u2019s July 30, 2003 final order. The petition also named the \u201cFluvanna County Department of Social Services\u201d as a \u201cparty to this suit.\u201d The petition complained about the final ruling of \u201cthe agency\u201d and requested that it be set aside. The petition concluded with a certificate of service stating that a copy had been mailed both to the \u201cCommissioner of the Virginia Department of Social Services\u201d and the \u201cDepartment of Social Services of Fluvanna County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">After being served with process, VDSS filed a plea in bar seeking to dismiss the VAPA appeal. VDSS argued that Christian\u2019s petition for appeal identified the local department, but failed to make clear VDSS was likewise a party to the VAPA appeal. Because Rule 2A:4\u2019s mandatory thirty-day period following the notice of appeal had passed, VDSS reasoned, it could not be added to the petition by amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In response, Christian argued that the petition identified VDSS as a party by specifically naming the VDSS hearing officer by name, using the VDSS caption of the case, requesting service on VDSS, and appealing the very decision (identified by complaint number and date of entry) issued by VDSS. If that were not enough, Christian argued in the alternative, he would still be entitled to amend the petition under Rule 1:8 to clarify any perceived ambiguities about whether VDSS was a party to the VAPA appeal. Finding neither of Christian\u2019s arguments persuasive, the circuit court dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Christian appeals to us, arguing that his petition for appeal was sufficient because VDSS lacks any real basis for claiming it had not been made a party to the VAPA appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">When the VAPA authorizes judicial review, it must be conducted \u201cin the manner provided by the rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-4026. Within thirty days of filing a notice of appeal, an appellant must file a petition for appeal in the circuit court. \u201cSuch filing shall include all steps provided in Rules 2:2 and 2:3 to cause a copy of the petition to be served (as in the case of a bill of complaint in equity) on the agency secretary and on every other party.\u201d Rule 2A:4(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, Rule 2A:4(b) requires the petition to \u201cdesignate the regulation or case decision appealed from, specify the errors assigned, state the reasons why the regulation or case decision is deemed to be unlawful and conclude with a specific statement of the relief requested.\u201d The thirty-day deadline implicates the circuit court\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction over the subject of the appeal.\u201d <em>State Water Control Bd. v. Crutchfield, </em>265 Va. 416, 423, 578 S.E.2d 762, 766 (2003); <em>Va. Ret Sys. v. Avery, </em>262 Va. 538, 542, 551 S.E.2d 612, 614 (2001); <em>Sours v. Va. Bd. for Architects, </em>30 Va.App. 313, 318, 516 S.E.2d 712, 715 (1999) (holding that \u201cthe timely filing of a petition for appeal of an agency decision is jurisdictional\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In this case, VDSS does not contend Christian filed his petition out of time \u2014 but that it was fatally insufficient because it failed to identify, in so many words, VDSS <em>as a party. </em>We disagree. A fair reading of the petition alerted VDSS that it was being called upon, however obliquely, to respond to the appeal. This should have been reasonably apparent because the petition specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>\u25a1 identified the decision of the VDSS hearing officer \u2014 a designee of the VDSS Commissioner<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 as the agency-ruling being appealed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-4\">\u25a1 requested, in the caption of the case, service on the VDSS Commissioner, a task only required to be done under Rule 2A:4(a) for parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">\u25a1 used the same style as the VDSS administrative caption of the case; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">\u25a1 certified that it was being mailed to the Commissioner of the VDSS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Given the unique statutory distribution of initial decision-making power to the local department and final authority to VDSS, the only administrative decision that could be appealed to the circuit court was the decision by the VDSS hearing officer. It takes little more effort to read the petition for appeal as necessarily identifying VDSS as the real party in interest. <em>See generally Williams Steel Erection Co. v. Dept. of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>42 Va.App. 814, 822, 595 S.E.2d 45, 49 (2004) (noting in parenthetical that \u201cwhere an existing deficiency is one of form rather than substance, appellate jurisdiction will still be conferred if the notice fairly and accurately advises the successful party of the ... appeal\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">(4,5] As a general rule, insubstantial defects in a timely filed appeal \u201cshould not be fatal where no genuine doubt exists about who is appealing, from what judgment, to which appellate court.\u201d <em>Becker v. Montgomery, </em>532 U.S. 757, 767-68, 121 S.Ct. 1801, 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 983 (2001); <em>see also Smith v. Barry, </em>502 U.S. 244, 245, 248-49, 112 S.Ct. 678, 682, 116 L.Ed.2d 678 (1992). Thus, when a \u201clitigant files papers in a fashion that is technically at variance with the letter of a procedural rule, a court may nonetheless find that the litigant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>has complied with the rule if the litigant\u2019s action is the functional equivalent of what the rule requires.\u201d <em>Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., </em>487 U.S. 312, 316-17, 108 S.Ct. 2405, 2408-09, 101 L.Ed.2d 285 (1988); <em>see also Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 181, 83 S.Ct. 227, 229, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962) (holding that, despite its \u201cinept\u201d draftsmanship, the appellant\u2019s intention to appeal the specific final order was \u201cmanifest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">That said, we do not hold that the mere mention of an agency anywhere in a VAPA petition, without more, necessarily makes it a party to the appeal. The natural pragmatism that accompanies principles of good pleading, as commendable as it may be, has its limits. In a VAPA appeal, an agency becomes a party only when identified in the petition <em>as a party to the appeal </em>\u2014 that is, where a reasonable reader would understand either from the petition\u2019s text or context or both that the agency is being mentioned not as a mere historical reference within the larger background of the case, but as the party against whom the appeal is being taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Under the unique circumstances of this case, we hold Christian\u2019s petition sufficiently identified VDSS as a party to this VAPA appeal. We reverse the circuit court\u2019s dismissal order and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\n<em>Reversed &amp; remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\">. It is better practice to identify all appellees by name in the caption of the case. By itself, however, the failure to do so does not require that the appeal be dismissed. <em>See Williams Steel Erection Co. v. Dept. of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>42 Va.App. 814, 821, 595 S.E.2d 45, 49 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-9\">. Code \u00a7 63.2-1526(B) authorizes the VDSS Commissioner to \"designate and authorize one or more members of his staff to conduct [administrative] hearings.\u201d <em>See also </em>22 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 40-705-190(H)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\">. In the circuit court, Christian moved for leave to amend his petition in the event \"it needs to be done\" to ensure that the petition sufficiently identified VDSS as a party. The circuit court denied the motion. On appeal to us, Christian argues that, \"assuming <em>arguendo\" </em>his petition failed to identify VDSS as a party, the circuit court erred in refusing his proposed amendment. Because we hold the petition sufficiently identified VDSS as a party, we need not rule on this alternative argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
