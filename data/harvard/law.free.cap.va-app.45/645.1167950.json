He contends the trial court erred in (1) resuspending only seven of the nine remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>years of his original sentences and (2) failing to consider reasonable alternatives to incarceration. Finding no error, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">\u201cUnder familiar principles of appellate review, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party that prevailed below.\u201d <em>Banks v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 539, 543, 586 S.E.2d 876, 877 (2003). So viewed, the evidence established that, while riding in the passenger seat of an automobile on May 25, 2001, appellant seized the steering wheel from the driver and caused the vehicle to collide with a tree. Both the driver and appellant were injured in the collision. Appellant was charged with and convicted of malicious wounding, driving while intoxicated, and driving on a suspended license. By order dated April 3, 2002, the trial court sentenced him to ten years in prison, with seven years suspended, on the malicious-wounding charge and twelve months in jail, with twelve months suspended, on each of the driving charges. The suspended sentences were conditioned upon appellant\u2019s good behavior, abstention from alcohol and drug use, five years of supervised probation, and successful completion of the \u201cDetention and Diversion Programs upon completion of his active sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">In prison, appellant\u2019s doctors prescribed Neurontin and Ibuprofen to treat the persistent back pain and numbness he continued to experience as a result of the collision. He tried other medications but believed this combination of pain medication was most effective in treating his condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">After serving his three-year active sentence, appellant went directly to the White Post Detention Center Program on April 19, 2004. He was still taking Neurontin and Ibuprofen at the time. Upon his arrival at the detention center, the facility nurse informed him that the use of Neurontin was not permitted in the facility. In response, appellant indicated he wanted to \u201csign out\u201d of the detention center program, but was per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>suaded to stay until he could see the facility physician. During his stay at the facility, appellant performed \u201cexceptionally well in all components of the program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">On April 22, 2004, appellant met with the physician. The doctor prescribed Tylenol 500 mg as an alternative to Neuron-tin. On April 27, 2004, appellant reported to the doctor that, although not as widespread as before, his back pain persisted. Upon examining him, the doctor noted that appellant was able to \u201ceasily ben[d] over on an elevated table to grab his socks and ... bend over at the waist\u201d and \u201chad no difficulty getting dressed and putting his boots on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">On April 30, 2004, appellant voluntarily withdrew from the detention center program, aware that such an action constituted a violation of the terms and conditions of his suspended sentences. In signing a form entitled \u201cVoluntary Request for Program Removal,\u201d appellant indicated he understood his decision would trigger a revocation hearing that could \u201cresult in the imposition of [his] suspended sentenced] and [his] incarceration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The trial court conducted a revocation hearing on June 7, 2004. At that hearing, appellant testified that, since his withdrawal from the detention center program, his prescription for pain medication had been changed to Flexeril and Motrin. He further testified he wanted to be reevaluated for the detention and diversion center programs and would be \u201cwilling to try to give it a go with the medications that [the doctors in those programs] would prescribe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Finding appellant \u201cguilty of violating the terms and conditions of the [April 3, 2002] order [requiring] him to enter into and successfully complete the detention center program and the diversion center program,\u201d the trial court revoked the suspension of the remaining seven-year portion of the prison sentence on the malicious-wounding charge and the unserved twelve-month jail sentences on the driving-while-intoxicated and driving-on-a-suspended-lieense charges. Further finding that appellant was not \u201can appropriate candidate for either the detention center or the diversion center program,\u201d the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>resuspended five years of the prison sentence and twelve months of each jail sentence, resulting in an active sentence of two years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">On appeal, appellant does not dispute that he violated the terms and conditions of his previously suspended sentences by voluntarily withdrawing from the detention center program. Nor does he challenge the trial court\u2019s revocation of the suspension of those sentences. Rather, he contends solely that the trial court abused its discretion (1) in resuspending only seven of the remaining nine years of his sentences and (2) in not considering reasonable alternatives to active incarceration at the revocation hearing. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">A. Resuspension of Sentences</p>\n<p id=\"A1A\">Code \u00a7 19.2-806(C) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-9\">If the court, after hearing, finds good cause to believe that the defendant has violated the terms of suspension, then ... the court shall revoke the suspension and the original sentence shall be in full force and effect. The court may again suspend all or any part of this sentence and may place the defendant upon terms and conditions or probation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">Having found good cause to believe appellant had violated the terms of suspension by voluntarily withdrawing from the detention center program, the trial court revoked the suspension of the balance of appellant\u2019s original sentences. Thus, the unserved nine-year portion of those sentences was \u201cin full force and effect\u201d and the trial court was authorized to resuspend \u201call or any part\u201d of that unserved portion of the original sentences. Code \u00a7 19.2-306(C). The trial court then resuspended seven of the nine remaining years.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">Appellant argues that the resultant imposition of two years of active prison time was disproportionate to his violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>the terms and conditions of his suspended sentences and was, thus, an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. Appellant\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The determination under Code \u00a7 19.2-306(0 of what, if any, part of the restored original sentence is to be resuspended is a matter that lies within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>See Slayton v. Commonwealth, </em>185 Va. 357, 365, 38 S.E.2d 479, 482-83 (1946) (noting that the suspension of a sentence is \u201cleft to the discretion of the trial court\u201d); <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 148, 152-53, 526 S.E.2d 784, 786-87 (2000) (noting that Code \u00a7 19.2-306 confers broad discretion upon the trial court in matters involving the suspension of sentences). Hence, the question here is simply whether there has been an abuse of discretion. The exercise of judicial discretion \u201c \u2018implies conscientious judgment, not arbitrary action.\u2019\u201d <em>Slayton, </em>185 Va. at 367, 38 S.E.2d at 484 (quoting <em>Burns v. United States, </em>287 U.S. 216, 222-23, 53 S.Ct. 154, 156, 77 L.Ed. 266 (1932)).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Here, there is no showing in the record that the trial court acted arbitrarily in resuspending only seven of the nine unserved years remaining on appellant\u2019s original sentences. After having been convicted of malicious wounding, driving while intoxicated, and driving on a suspended license, appellant was sentenced to a total of twelve years\u2019 incarceration. Treating appellant with leniency, the trial court suspended all but three years of appellant\u2019s sentences upon the condition that, among other things, he successfully complete the detention center program and the diversion center program. Thus, once appellant completed the three-year period of active incarceration, he was to be successively confined in \u201canother intermediate facility of the Department [of Corrections] as an alternative to incarceration where he would receive a variety of services.\u201d <em>Word v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 496, 504-05, 586 S.E.2d 282, 286 (2003). Clearly, then, the trial court did not intend that appellant would be released from confinement after only three years of incarceration without first spending \u201can additional term of confinement in a regimented environment with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>structured program between his active incarceration and his release into the community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 503, 586 S.E.2d at 285. When appellant violated the terms of his suspended sentences by voluntarily withdrawing from the detention center program, the trial court found that he was not \u201can appropriate candidate for either the detention center or the diversion center program\u201d and effectively returned him to active incarceration for an additional two years, which was well within the range of his original sentence and \u201cconsistent with the trial court\u2019s original sentencing objectives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505, 586 S.E.2d at 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Under these circumstances, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretionary authority under Code \u00a7 19.2-306(C). <em>See id. </em>(\u201cWhen [the defendant] could no longer satisfy the prerequisite condition under which his sentence was suspended, i.e. that he enter and successfully complete two Department programs, the court had the authority to reconsider the suspended sentences and to determine what portion of the suspended sentences or other alternatives to incarceration would be appropriate in lieu of the confinement that had been ordered in the community-based programs.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">B. Reasonable Alternatives to Incarceration</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court abused its discretion by not considering reasonable alternatives to active incarceration at the revocation hearing is also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">For one thing, appellant\u2019s premise that the trial court did not consider reasonable alternatives to active incarceration is not supported by the record. In response to appellant\u2019s request at the revocation hearing that he be reevaluated for the detention and diversion center programs, the trial court expressly found that appellant was no longer \u201can appropriate candidate for either the detention center or the diversion center program.\u201d Clearly, the making of such a finding constitutes consideration by the trial court of the alternatives to active incarceration requested by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Moreover, there is no legal authority requiring a trial court to consider reasonable alternatives to incarceration under the circumstances before us in this case. As previously mentioned, the trial court suspended nine of the twelve total years of appellant\u2019s sentences upon the condition that he successfully complete the detention center program and the diversion center program. After serving the active portion of his prison sentence, appellant reported to the detention center program, where he learned he would be unable to use the medication he found to be the most effective in relieving his back pain. Appellant was initially persuaded to stay in the program and performed \u201cexceptionally well.\u201d However, citing the unsuitability of the medication prescribed by the facility doctor, he voluntarily withdrew from the detention center program after eleven days, in violation of the terms and conditions of his suspended sentences. The record contains neither a finding by any healthcare personnel that such a withdrawal was medically necessary nor a determination by the Department of Corrections that appellant was unable to complete the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-316.2(A)(4) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">Upon the defendant\u2019s (i) voluntary withdrawal from the [detention center] program [or] (ii) removal from the [detention center] program by the Department for intractable behavior as defined in \u00a7 19.2-316.1 ..., the court shall cause the defendant to show cause why his ... suspension of sentence should not be revoked. Upon a finding that the defendant voluntarily withdrew from the program [or] was removed from the program by the Department for intractable behavior ..., the court may revoke all or part of the ... suspended sentence____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-316.1 defines \u201cintractable behavior\u201d as \u201cthat behavior which, in the determination of the Department of Corrections, (i) indicates an inmate\u2019s unwillingness or inability to conform his behavior to that necessary to his successful completion of the program or (ii) is so disruptive as to threaten the successful completion of the program by other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>participants.\u201d Thus, the Department of Corrections may remove a participant from the detention center program, under Code \u00a7 19.2-316.2(A)(4)(ii), for \u201cintractable behavior\u201d if the participant is \u201cno longer physically, or mentally, suited for the program.\u201d <em>Peyton v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 503, 511, 604 S.E.2d 17, 21 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Here, however, appellant concedes he voluntarily withdrew from the detention center program. Accordingly, the trial court was authorized, under Code \u00a7 19.2-316.2(A)(4), to revoke the suspension of appellant\u2019s previously suspended sentences and return him to active incarceration to serve the balance of his original sentences. <em>See also Leitao v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 435, 438, 573 S.E.2d 317, 319 (2002) (\u201cWhen a court revokes the suspension of execution of sentence, \u2018the original sentence shall be in full force and effect.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Code \u00a7 19.2-306(0)).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Nevertheless, relying on <em>Peyton, </em>appellant argues that, in light of the circumstances \u201cnecessitating\u201d his withdrawal from the detention center program, the trial court abused its discretion in not considering reasonable alternatives to incarceration. Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Peyton </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">In <em>Peyton, </em>the trial court suspended a part of Peyton\u2019s sentence upon the condition that he complete the detention center program. 268 Va. at 506, 604 S.E.2d at 18. After more than three months in the program, Peyton began vomiting blood and was taken to the hospital. <em>Id. </em>Citing \u201cmedical/psychological reasons,\u201d the Department of Corrections removed Peyton from the program. <em>Id. </em>at 507, 604 S.E.2d at 18. In a show cause hearing, having determined that Peyton had violated the terms of his suspended sentence by not completing the detention center program, \u201cthe trial court revoked the suspended sentence and imposed the original three[-]year active sentence,\u201d <em>id., </em>\u201cwithout considering reasonable alternatives to imprisonment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 511, 604 S.E.2d at 21. Upon review, the Supreme Court first noted that Peyton\u2019s removal from the detention center program was not a voluntary withdrawal from the program. <em>Id. </em>at 510, 604 S.E.2d at 20. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Examining the meaning of the term \u201cintractable behavior\u201d in Code \u00a7 19.2-316.2(A)(4)(ii) and focusing on the \u201cdistinction between the willful failure of an inmate to comply with the requirements of the detention center program ... and the subsequent inability of the inmate to do so resulting from an unforeseen medical condition,\u201d the Court then held that, where the removal of a participant from the detention center program results from the participant\u2019s \u201cunforeseen medical condition,\u201d rather than his willful \u201cbehavior or conduct,\u201d a trial court abuses its discretion in revoking a suspended sentence without considering \u201creasonable alternatives to imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511, 604 S.E.2d at 21. Finally, the Supreme Court determined that, in light of the circumstances of the case, the trial court abused its discretion in revoking Peyton\u2019s suspended sentence \u201cwithout considering reasonable alternatives to imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Here, unlike Peyton, appellant was not removed from the detention center program for \u201cintractable behavior.\u201d Instead, he chose to withdraw from the program of his own accord and his decision to do so was admittedly voluntary. Nothing in the record shows that his removal was being contemplated by the Department of Corrections or that it was medically necessary. Additionally, the instant record reflects that the trial court in this case, unlike the trial court in <em>Peyton, </em>considered alternatives to incarceration at the revocation hearing. Thus, <em>Peyton </em>is clearly distinguishable from the case before us and is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s decision, following appellant\u2019s violation of the terms and conditions of his suspended sentences, to effectively impose an active sentence of two years in prison rather than permit appellant to participate in the detention center and diversion center programs was not an abuse of the court\u2019s discretionary authority under Code \u00a7 19.2-316.2(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
