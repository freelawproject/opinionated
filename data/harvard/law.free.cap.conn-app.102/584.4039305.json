J.</author>\n<p id=\"APLF\">The defendant, Joseph G. Hill, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of attempt to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49\u2019 and 53a-134 (a) (3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant claims that the court\u2019s charge to the jury was ambiguous in that it failed to instruct the jury that it could only find him guilty if it found that the coparticipant in the crime used or threatened the use of a dangerous instrument. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>The following facts, which the jury reasonably could have found, are relevant to the defendant\u2019s appeal. At approximately 1:30 a.m. on May 21, 2002, Jorge Vega Pivaral, the complaining witness, was driving in the area of West Main Street in Stamford and was trying to locate his cousin. Pivaral, confused by the one-way streets, began to circle the area several times. Eventually, Pivaral turned onto Ann Street and observed the defendant and Miguel Cruz standing on a sidewalk on that street. As Pivaral turned onto Ann Street, the defendant asked Pivaral, through the open driver\u2019s side window, if he wanted to purchase any drugs, to which Pivaral declined. Cruz also asked Pivaral if he wanted any drugs. After responding that he did not want to buy any drugs, Pivaral asked the defendant and Cruz if they knew where he could find his cousin. Cruz replied that he knew where Pivaral\u2019s cousin lived and then told Pivaral to find a parking spot. Pivaral drove a short distance before parking his truck on the side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">After Pivaral parked his truck, the defendant entered the vehicle, sat in the passenger seat and asked Pivaral for a cigarette. Pivaral gave the defenadnt two cigarettes, and, thereafter, Cruz ran up the street, returning to the truck a moment later. When Cruz returned, he approached Pivaral, who still was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, and directed the pointed end of a big, wooden stick at Pivaral\u2019s face. Cruz demanded that Pivaral give him money, but Pivaral informed him that he did not have any money. When the defendant attempted to remove the keys from the ignition, Pivaral tried to kick him, but Cruz then began striking Pivaral in the head with the pointed stick. While Pivaral was being hit with the stick, the defendant removed the keys from the ignition and reached into Pivaral\u2019s pockets, looking for money. Pivaral sounded the truck\u2019s horn, causing the defendant and Cruz to flee. After using his cellular telephone to notify the police of the incident, Pivaral began <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>to chase the defendant and Cruz. Pivaral caught up with the defendant and Cruz and asked them to return his keys, but they responded by demanding money. Thereafter, the police arrived, apprehended the defendant and later located Pivaral\u2019s keys and the bloody stick that Cruz used to strike Pivaral. As a result of the injuries to his left temple, left ear and left side of his head, Pivaral received twenty-one stitches and was left with permanent scars.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The evidence was uncontested and overwhelming that Cruz, the defendant\u2019s coparticipant, used a dangerous instrument. Here, it is not in dispute that Cruz threatened to use and did use the stick in a manner that was capable of causing and did cause serious physical injuiy to Pivaral in the form of gouges to his head. At trial, the defendant testified that Cruz approached the driver\u2019s side window where Pivaral was sitting, \u201cstuck the stick\u201d in the window and demanded money. In addition, the defendant testified that Cruz held the stick \u201clike he had a gun\u201d and that he \u201cmust have hit [Pivaral] with the stick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">In an amended information, dated July 15, 2003, the state charged the defendant with criminal attempt to commit robbery in the first degree and assault in the second degree as an accessory. A jury trial was held on July 15, 17 and 18, 2003, after which the jury found the defendant not guilty on the charge of assault in the second degree as an accessory. The defendant, however, was found guilty of attempt to commit robbeiy in the first degree. Thereafter, the court imposed a sentence of ten years incarceration, to run consecutively to a sentence he already was serving for violating his probation. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">The defendant claims on appeal that the court\u2019s instructions to the jury were misleading and ambiguous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>with respect to the essential elements of attempt to commit robbery in the first degree. More specifically, the defendant claims that it was reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s oral and written instructions because they lacked a single, concise statement instructing the jury that in order to find him guilty of the charged offense, it had to find that the other participant in the crime used or threatened to use a dangerous instrument. The defendant concedes that this claim was not preserved at trial, but he seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree with the defendant that the record is adequate for our review and that the claim is of constitutional magnitude. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>206 Conn. 685, 708, 539 A.2d 561 (1988) (\u201c[i]t is . . . constitutionally axiomatic that the jury be instructed on the essential elements of a crime charged\u201d). We, however, conclude that the defendant has not demonstrated that a constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived him of a fair trial under the third prong of <em>Golding. </em>Therefore, we conclude that his claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In reviewing a jury instruction for impropriety, we adhere to the well established rule that \u201ca charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Leroy, </em>232 Conn. 1, 8, 653 A.2d 161 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>(1995). Our Supreme Court often has stated that a challenged jury instruction will not be tested by reference to whether the legal principles espoused in the charge are as accurate as those articulated in the opinions of the court of last resort. Id. Rather, the test of a court\u2019s charge is \u201cwhether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Accordingly, we do not view the instructions as improper when the instructions are \u201ccorrect in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cMoreover, as to unpreserved claims of constitutional error in jury instructions, [our Supreme Court has] stated that under the third prong of <em>Golding, </em>[a] defendant may prevail . . . only if . . . it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>275 Conn. 785, 865, 882 A.2d 604 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1025, 126 S. Ct. 1578, 164 L. Ed. 2d 309 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">We begin by reviewing the court\u2019s instructions to the jury with respect to the charge of attempt to commit robbery in the first degree. The court instructed the jury that the defendant was charged, under the first count of the information, with attempt to commit robbery in the first degree. Because the inchoate offense of attempt requires that the elements of robbery in the first degree be stated to the jury, as well as the elements of attempt, the court, stated that it would explain a step-by-step procedure and analysis for the jury to employ. The court instructed the jury that \u201cthe first thing [it had] to determine [was] whether the defendant [committed] what\u2019s called a larceny,\u201d and the court proceeded to give the elements of the offense of larceny, which are not in dispute in this appeal. Thereafter, the court stated that if the jury made a finding that the defendant committed a larceny, it, \u201cmust then determine if he [committed] a robbery.\u201d Robbery, the court explained, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>committed \u201cwhen in the course of committing a larceny, a [person] uses or threatens the immediate use of physical force upon [another] person for the purpose of compelling the property to be delivered up.\u201d The court continued by stating that the offense of robbery requires \u201ca specific intent to commit larceny by force.\u201d The court further instructed the members of the jury that \u201c [r] obbery then becomes first degree when in the course or commission of a robbery, the defendant or another participant in the crime, uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument.\u201d After repeating the elements of robbery in the first degree, the court defined the term \u201cdangerous instrument.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Next, the court reiterated that the state was charging the defendant with the commission of the crime of attempt to commit robbery in the first degree. The court read the text of \u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2), which provides the elements of the offense of attempt, and continued by adapting the principles of the attempt statute to the facts of the present case. More specifically, the court, in addressing the first element of attempt, stated that the defendant \u201cmust have acted with the same intent, the same state of mind required for the crime of robbery . . . .\u201d With respect to the second element, the court instructed that \u201cthe defendant must have acted to carry out that intent under the circumstances as he believed them to be, he must have engaged in conduct, which was a substantial step in a course of conduct, planned to end in his commission of the crime of robbery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Thereafter, the court instructed the jury on the doctrine of accessorial liability under the robbery in the first degree statute. The court stated the following: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>\u201cUnder our law, a defendant can be convicted of robbery in the first degree as a principal offender, as a principal, where a participant, other than the defendant, uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument. The statute imposes liability on a defendant when he commits robbery with another person, who, although unbeknownst to him, uses or threatens the use of any such dangerous instrument. ... To be guilty as an accessory, the defendant does not have to intend to commit robbery in the first degree or robbery by means of a dangerous instrument. <em>In this regard, all that is required is proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to commit a robbery or a larceny by force, as we\u2019ve discussed. It\u2019s not necessary, therefore, that the state prove that the defendant intended or was even aware that a confederate would use a dangerous instrument.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Last, the court instructed the jury that \u201cif [it] [found that] the state [had] proven all of these elements beyond a reasonable doubt, [its] verdict as to this defendant, as principal or accessory, would be guilty of attempted robbery in the first degree.\u201d In addition to its oral charge, the court provided the members of the jury with written instructions to summarize its oral instructions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">At oral argument before this court, the defendant asserted that the court\u2019s charge to the jury was ambiguous with respect to the instruction on the dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>instrument element and directed us to the portion of the oral instructions italicized previously and to the written instructions. With respect to the written instructions, the defendant argues that they are flawed because they failed to mention expressly the dangerous instrument element. See footnote 5 of this opinion. Specifically, the defendant refers to a portion of the oral instructions in which the court indicated that the written summary sheet would contain \u201cthe essential elements [of the crimes charged] . . . .\u201d Although the written instructions do not list specifically the dangerous instrument element of robbery in the first degree, they instruct the jury to \u201c[bear] in mind\u201d the charges given orally concerning \u201cprincipal and accessory liability\u201d and \u201cattempt to commit robbery in the first degree.\u201d In addition to defining the term \u201cdangerous instrument\u201d in its oral charge, the court also provided instructions on robbery in the first degree and accessorial liability, which repeatedly apprised the jury of how the defendant could be convicted when a coparticipant threatened to use or used a dangerous instrument. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that it was reasonably possible that the summary sheet misled the jury as to the elements of attempt to commit robbery in the first degree when the sheet expressly referred to the oral instructions that, when read as a whole, instructed the jury several times on the dangerous instrument element.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">To support his assertion that the court failed to instruct the jury that it must find that the other participant in the crime used or threatened to use a dangerous instrument, the defendant focuses on only two sentences in the court\u2019s comprehensive oral instructions. The challenged portion, however, represents only a part of the court\u2019s explanation of the doctrine of accessorial liability. Rather than viewing the challenged statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>in isolation, we consider the instructions to the jury as a whole. <em>State </em>v. Leroy, supra, 232 Conn. 8. The defendant ignores the part of the court\u2019s charge immediately preceding the challenged portion, in which the court stated that \u201ca defendant can be convicted of robbery in the first degree ... as a principal, where a participant, other than the defendant, uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument. The statute imposes liability on a defendant when he commits a robbery with another person, who, although unbeknowst to him, uses or threatens the use of any such dangerous instrument.\u201d These two sentences informed the juiy that the defendant, under the doctrine of accessorial liability, could not be convicted of robbery in the first degree unless the coparticipant used or threatened to use a dangerous instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Moreover, it is worth noting that a careful reading of the jury instructions in their entirety further belies the defendant\u2019s assertion of ambiguity in the charge. Because an instruction on attempt to commit robbery in the first degree requires a discussion of the underlying crime, the court explained the elements of the charged offense by employing a step-by-step procedure and analysis, which closely tracks the standard jury instruction for attempt found in D. Borden &amp; L. Orland, 5 Connecticut Practice Series: Connecticut Criminal Jury Instructions (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 5.2, pp. 367-69. In its explanation of the elements of the underlying crime of robbery in the first degree, the court\u2019s step-by-step procedure instructed the juiy to make findings and determinations as to the elements of larceny and robbery. Thereafter, the court repeatedly instructed on the dangerous instrument element of robbeiy in the first degree, stating that it was established when either the defendant or another participant in the crime used or threatened the use of a dangerous instrument. After discussing the elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>of attempt, the court explained accessorial liability, and, as noted previously, those instructions stated, more than once, how the defendant could be convicted of robbery in the first degree if another participant used or threatened to use a dangerous instrument.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To summarize, the court reminded the jury that it must find that the state proved all of the elements beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defendant guilty of the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Although the court\u2019s instructions to the jury must be correct in law, adapted to the issues and not misleading to the jury, we also are cognizant that the instructions need not be perfect, exhaustive or technically accurate. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>53 Conn. App. 551, 573, 733 A.2d 253, cert. denied, 250 Conn. 917, 734 A.2d 990 (1999). Accordingly, we conclude that contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, the court\u2019s failure to preface its instruction on the dangerous instrument element with the word \u201cfind\u201d does not render the instruction defective. Viewing the court\u2019s instructions to the jury as a whole, we conclude that the jury was instructed properly on the dangerous instrument element and was apprised that it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the state had proven all of the elements in order to find the defendant guilty of attempt to commit robbery in the first degree. The defendant\u2019s claim fails to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime, he . . .
