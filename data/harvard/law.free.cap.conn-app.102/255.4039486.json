He claims that (1) his guilty plea was constitutionally defective because it was not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered and (2) the court abused its discretion in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>disagree with both claims and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">On June 30, 2005, the defendant entered a plea of guilty to the charge of kidnapping in the first degree as an accessory in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (B) and 53a-8. The court conducted a plea canvass to ascertain whether the defendant\u2019s plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to the sentencing date, the defendant filed a motion to withdraw his plea, alleging that the plea was entered involuntarily in violation of Practice Book \u00a7 39-27 (2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On July 21, 2005, the defendant appeared before the court and orally amended his motion to add a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as a basis for his motion to withdraw. The defendant read a lengthy statement regarding his dissatisfaction with his attorney\u2019s performance. Defense counsel then requested an evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s behalf. The court reviewed the transcript of the plea canvass and denied both the request for an evidentiary hearing and the motion to withdraw the plea. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The defendant first claims that his plea was constitutionally defective because he did not understand the elements of the charged offense and therefore the plea was not entered knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. As the defendant concedes, his claim was not preserved properly,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and we therefore review it pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the record is adequate for review and the defendant has raised an issue of constitutional magnitude, we will review his claim. The defendant\u2019s claim fails, however, because he has not established that a constitutional violation clearly exists that clearly deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u201cBefore a guilty plea is accepted a defendant may withdraw it as a matter of right. Practice Book [\u00a7 39-26]. After a guilty plea is accepted but before the imposition of sentence the court is obligated to permit withdrawal upon proof of one of the grounds in [Practice Book \u00a7 39-27].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>182 Conn. 176, 185, 438 A.2d 46 (1980). \u201cThe burden is always on the defendant to show a plausible reason for the withdrawal of a plea of guilty. ... To warrant consideration, the defendant must allege and provide facts which justify permitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>him to withdraw his plea under [Practice Book \u00a7 39-27].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>253 Conn. 1, 51, 751 A.2d 298 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In support of his claim that his plea was not entered into knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily, the defendant argues that the court failed (1) to explain the elements of the kidnapping charge, (2) to ask him whether he understood those elements and (3) to ask him if his attorney had explained those elements to him. He also argues that the court should have explained that his liability under the kidnapping charge was as an accessory. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\u201cIt is well established that a plea of guilty cannot be voluntary in the sense that it constitutes an intelligent admission that the accused committed the offense unless the accused has received real notice of the true nature of the charge against him, the first and most universally recognized requirement of due process.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Lonberger, </em>459 U.S. 422, 436, 103 S. Ct. 843, 74 L. Ed. 2d 646 <em>(1983);State v. Johnson, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 38. \u201c[T]he determination as to whether a plea has been knowingly and voluntarily entered entails an examination of all of the relevant circumstances [and] the plea may satisfy constitutional requirements even in the absence of literal compliance with the prophylactic safeguards of [Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 39-19 and39-20].\u201d (Internalquotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 44; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>277 Conn. 764, 783, 894 A.2d 963 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Defense counsel generally is presumed to have informed the defendant of the charges against him. \u201c[E]ven without an express statement by the court of the elements of the dimes charged, it is appropriate to presume that in most cases defense counsel routinely explain the nature of the offense in sufficient detail to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>give the accused notice of what he is being asked to admit. . . . [U]nless a record contains some positive suggestion that the defendant\u2019s attorney had <em>not </em>informed the defendant of the elements of the crimes to which he was pleading guilty, the normal presumption applies.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>269 Conn. 799, 802, 850 A.2d 143 (2004); see also <em>Bradshaw </em>v. <em>Stumpf, </em>545 U.S. 175, 183, 125 S. Ct. 2398, 162 L. Ed. 2d 143 (2005) (\u201c[W]e have never held that the judge must himself explain the elements of each charge to the defendant on the record. Rather, the constitutional prerequisites of a valid plea may be satisfied where the record accurately reflects that the nature of the charge and the elements of the crime were explained to the defendant by his own, competent counsel.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">We can find no case, nor does the defendant cite to one, which instructed the trial court to explain the elements of the crime to the defendant. To the contrary, our appellate courts have held that atrial court\u2019s reading the relevant provisions of the statute is sufficient. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 38; <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>67 Conn. App. 351, 355, 786 A.2d 1252 (2001), cert. denied, 281 Conn. 912, 916 A.2d 54 (2007).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In fact, this court has stated that the trial court need not describe every element of the offense. \u201cOur courts have stopped short of adopting a per se rule that notice of the true nature of the charge always requires the court to give a description of every element of the offense charged. . . . The trial court\u2019s failure to explicate an element renders the plea invalid only where the omitted element is a critical one . . . and only where it is not appropriate to presume that defense counsel has explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>the nature of the offense in sufficient detail to give the accused notice of what he is being asked to admit.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hackett, </em>16 Conn. App. 601, 603, 548 A.2d 16 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">On the basis of the record before us, we conclude that the defendant adequately was apprised of the charges against him. The court informed the defendant that he was charged with kidnapping in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-92 (a), read the relevant portion of the statute and asked him whether he understood it, to which he responded affirmatively. Nothing in the record indicates that defense counsel failed to explain to the defendant the charges against him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state read the factual basis into the record, which also covered the elements of the offense, and therefore further served to put the defendant on notice of the elements of the crime. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 40. The court then specifically asked the defendant whether he was satisfied with counsel\u2019s representation, to which he responded: \u201cYes, sir. Very much.\u201d The court also twice asked the defendant whether his plea was voluntary, whether he wanted the court to accept it and whether he was sure he wanted to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument that the plea canvass was constitutionally defective because the court did not explain the requirements of the accessoiy statute is similarly unavailing. In addition to the court\u2019s specific reference to the accessorial liability statute during the plea canvass and the presumption that defense counsel explained accessory liability to the defendant, both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>substitute information and the clerk of the court at the time of the plea informed the defendant that he was being charged under the accessory statute. Moreover, because accessorial liability is not an independent crime but, rather, an alternate means by which a substantive crime can be committed, there is no practical difference between accessoiy or principal status; whether the defendant is labeled an accessoiy or a principal, the state must prove that he committed every element of the underlying offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>278 Conn. 598, 618, 900 A.2d 485 (2006). Thus, informing the defendant of the elements of the underlying offense, in this case, kidnapping, sufficed to provide him with notice of the charged crime. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s plea did not suffer from any constitutional infirmity and that he was not deprived of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The defendant next claims that the court abused its discretion by denying his request for an evidentiary hearing on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. In support of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant read a statement into the record regarding his counsel\u2019s representation. The defendant claimed that his counsel had failed to pursue, or failed to obtain in a timely fashion, certain items of evidence, namely, video footage, police reports, telephone call recordings and certain documents relevant to the victim\u2019s alleged criminal background and credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>The court reviewed the transcript of the plea proceeding with the defendant. At the plea proceeding, the court asked if the defendant was satisfied with his attorney\u2019s representation, and the defendant replied: \u201cYes, sir. Very much.\u201d The court noted that the transcript of the plea proceeding was bereft of any indication that the defendant was unsatisfied with his attorney\u2019s representation. The court denied the motion to withdraw the plea, concluding that the record was complete and that the defendant\u2019s claim lacked merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">At the outset, we note that the applicable standard of review of a trial court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing is abuse of discretion. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>62 Conn. App. 805, 815, 772 A.2d 690 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u201cIn considering whether to hold an evidentiary hearing on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea the court may disregard any allegations of fact, whether contained in the motion or made in an offer of proof, which are either conclusory, vague or oblique. For the purpose of determining whether to hold an evidentiary hearing, the court should ordinarily assume any specific allegations of fact to be true. If such allegations furnish a basis for withdrawal of the plea under [Practice Book \u00a7 39-27] and are not conclusively refuted by the record of the plea proceedings and other information contained in the court file, then an evidentiary hearing is required.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 185-86; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Blue, </em>230 Conn. 109, 125, 644 A.2d 859 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">In the present case, the defendant\u2019s allegations against his counsel all involved issues of which the defendant was aware prior to the plea proceeding, yet the defendant asserted during the plea proceeding that he was satisfied with his counsel\u2019s representation. As we have noted, the defendant affirmatively indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>that he was satisfied with his counsel\u2019s representation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This court has stated that \u201ca trial court . . . may properly rely on . . . the responses of the [defendant] at the time he responded to the trial court\u2019s plea canvass . . . .\u201d <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>19 Conn. App. 440, 443, 562 A.2d 588, cert. denied, 212 Conn. 817, 565 A.2d 534 (1989); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Casado, </em>42 Conn. App. 371, 377-78, 680 A.2d 981 (in denying request for evidentiary hearing, court properly relied on defendant\u2019s representation during plea proceeding that she was not forced or coerced into entering plea), cert. denied, 239 Conn. 920, 682 A.2d 1006 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">In this case, the court properly relied on the defendant\u2019s representation that he was very satisfied with his counsel\u2019s representation and on the absence of any indicia to the contrary.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the record of the plea canvass conclusively refutes the defendant\u2019s argument that his plea lacked the benefit of effective assistance of counsel. We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-7\"> In the plea canvass, the court included the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">\u201cQ.

The first two [prongs of <em>Golding] </em>involve a determination of whether the claim is renewable; the second two . . . involve a determination of whether the defendant may prevail.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Farr, </em>98 Conn.
