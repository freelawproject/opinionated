See <em>Scrivani </em>v. <em>Vallombroso, </em>99 Conn. App. 645, 916 A.2d 827, cert. denied, 282 Conn. 904, 920 A.2d 309 (2007). In that opinion, we remanded the case for an articulation as to whether in awarding attorney\u2019s fees and punitive damages under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the court considered the per se CUTPA violations that were based on violations of the Home Improvement Act, General Statutes \u00a7 20-418 et seq., in conjunction with the other CUTPA violations and, if it did, for the court to articulate the basis for its finding that the failure of the defendant, Andrew Vallombroso, to comply with the Home Improvement Act contributed to the harm sustained by the plaintiffs, Marlene Scrivani and Dina Garamella. We retained jurisdiction over the appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The court filed its articulation on April 20, 2007. In its articulation, the court stated that it did not consider the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the Home Improvement Act as a basis for awarding punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees, as those per se CUTPA violations were not the proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 harm. As further stated in its articulation, the court based its award of damages on the other CUTPA violations, which included the defendant\u2019s having engaged in \u201cdeceptive, unethical and unfair conduct . . . when he falsely represented to the plaintiffs that he and the people he would hire to install the CertainTeed siding were experienced in the installation of that product,\u201d as the defendant \u201cknew that he was not experienced in the installation of that type of siding, and he was aware or should have been aware that the man he hired also was not experienced or qualified.\u201d On the basis of those findings, the court determined that the plaintiffs suffered financial losses in connection with the installation of the siding and were entitled to punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Because the court did not base its award of punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees on the per se CUTPA violations that were based on violations of the Home Improvement Act, we conclude that the court did not improperly determine that the defendant violated CUTPA on the basis of violations of the Home Improvement Act that were unrelated to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The judgment as clarified by the trial court\u2019s articulation filed on April 20, 2007, is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b691-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a) provides: \u201cNo person shall engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b691-8\"> The defendant also claimed that the court improperly concluded that his conduct was sufficiently unfair and deceptive to constitute a violation of CUTPA. We affirmed that portion of the court\u2019s judgment. <em>Scrivani </em>v. <em>Vallombroso, </em>supra, 99 Conn. App. 648-50.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
