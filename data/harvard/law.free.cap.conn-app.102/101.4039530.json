Connelly, </em>state\u2019s attorney, <em>Ronald G. Weller, </em>senior assistant state\u2019s attorney, and <em>David A.

Shepard, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) (1), drinking while operating a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-213 (a) and operating a motor vehicle with a suspended license in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-215 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant claims that (1) the trial court\u2019s operating under the influence instruction to the jury was deficient and (2) the court improperly permitted a witness to express an opinion with regard to an ultimate issue in the case. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The defendant first claims that the court\u2019s operating under the influence instruction was deficient. The defendant argues that the court conveyed to the jury that he was guilty if he was \u201cdriving while impaired,\u201d thereby diluting the state\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">The defendant\u2019s claim is unpreserved because the defendant neither submitted a written request to charge nor took any exceptions to the court\u2019s charge. It is well settled that a claim of instructional error is preserved properly only when \u201cthe matter is covered by a written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>request to charge or exception has been taken by the party appealing immediately after the charge is delivered. . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 16-20; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>94 Conn. App. 812, 823, 894 A.2d 1032, cert. denied, 278 Conn. 915, 899 A.2d 621 (2006); <em>State </em>v. <em>L\u2019Minggio, </em>71 Conn. App. 656, 670-71, 803 A.2d 408, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 902, 810 A.2d 270 (2002); <em>State </em>v. <em>Adorno, </em>45 Conn. App. 187, 196-97, 695 A.2d 6, cert. denied, 242 Conn. 904, 697 A.2d 688 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Generally, \u201c[w]hen a party raises a claim for the first time on appeal, our review of the claim is limited to review under either the plain error doctrine as provided by Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, or the doctrine set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>68 Conn. App. 303, 308, 791 A.2d 621, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 920, 797 A.2d 518 (2002); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>93 Conn. App. 582, 590, 889 A.2d 943, cert. denied, 278 Conn. 902, 896 A.2d 105 (2006). The defendant has not sought review of his claim under either of those doctrines. Under the circumstances of this case, we will follow the general rule that \u201cit is not appropriate to engage in a level of review that is not requested. . . . When the parties have neither briefed nor argued plain error [or <em>Golding </em>review], we will not afford such review.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dockter </em>v. <em>Slowik, </em>91 Conn. App. 448, 463-64, 881 A.2d 479, cert. denied, 276 Conn. 919, 888 A.2d 87 (2005); see also <em>Ghant </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>255 Conn. 1, 17, 761 A.2d 740 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>supra, 590; <em>State </em>v. <em>Fagan, </em>92 Conn. App. 44, 51 n.4, 883 A.2d 8, cert. denied, 276 Conn. 924, 888 A.2d 91 (2005). Accordingly, we will not review the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim of instructional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly permitted a witness to express an opinion with regard to an ultimate issue in the case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>The state presented testimony from Clayton Brown, a state police trooper who administered three different field sobriety tests to the defendant prior to his arrest. Brown testified that the defendant failed these tests and testified concerning his observations of the defendant at the time of the arrest. The state later presented testimony from Jack Richman, an optometrist with expertise in field sobriety testing, including the horizontal gaze nystagmus test. The prosecutor asked Richman the following question: \u201cIf a person exhibits six clues in the horizontal gaze nystagmus [test], exhibits two clues in the one legged stand [test] . . . and exhibits seven clues in the walk and turn test, has an odor of alcoholic beverage, slurred speech and glassy eyes, would you have an opinion on whether or not they are under the influence?\u201d Arguing that the question was beyond Richman\u2019s \u201carea of expertise,\u201d the defendant\u2019s attorney objected to the question. The court, finding that Richman had \u201cadditional qualifications beyond the optometry field,\u201d overruled the objection. Richman then opined that the individual described in the hypothetical question exhibited \u201csigns of impairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the court should have sustained his objection because the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry improperly invited Richman to render an expert opinion as to one of the ultimate issues in the case, whether the defendant was under the influence of alcohol at the time of his arrest. The defendant argues: \u201c[T]he field sobriety test scores and overall appearance of the operator, as stated in the prosecutor\u2019s hypothetical, are precisely the test scores and overall appearance of the defendant as testified to by the police officer who administered the field sobriety tests.\u201d The defendant also argues: \u201cRichman\u2019s response . . . [was] tantamount to an opinion on [his] guilt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The defendant did not preserve this evidentiary claim for our review. At trial, the defendant\u2019s attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>objected on the distinct ground set forth previously, which is that the prosecutor\u2019s hypothetical question called for a response that went beyond Richman\u2019s area of expertise. \u201cAppellate review of evidentiary rulings is ordinarily limited to the specific legal [ground] raised by the objection of trial counsel. . . . To permit a party to raise a different ground on appeal than [that] raised during trial would amount to trial by ambuscade, unfair both to the trial court and the opposing party.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stenner, </em>281 Conn. 742, 755, 917 A.2d 28 (2007); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Calabrese, </em>279 Conn. 393, 408 n.18, 902 A.2d 1044 (2006). The defendant does not assert that he is entitled to any extraordinary means of review of this unpreserved evi-dentiary claim, and we will not afford it review.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-10\"> The jury found the defendant not guilty of failure to appear in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-173 (a) (1). The defendant also pleaded guilty to being a subsequent offender, as alleged in a part B information. In addition to imposing fines, the court sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of incarceration of two years and one day and one year of special parole.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
