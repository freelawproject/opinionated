Boyle, appeals from the modification of the conditions of his probation resulting in the imposition of a special condition that he claims is unrelated to the offense for which he is serving probation. Because there is no nexus between the modified condition and the charge for which the defendant is serving probation, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">The following factual and procedural history is relevant to the consideration of the defendant\u2019s appeal. On August 24, 2005, the defendant was charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a and failure to drive in the proper lane in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-236. The defendant entered into a plea agreement and pleaded guilty to the charge of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs. On April 5, 2006, pursuant to the plea agreement, the court sentenced the defendant to six months incarceration, execution suspended after thirty days, with eighteen months probation. The court also imposed conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>of probation that the defendant (1) participate in substance abuse evaluation, as well as testing, treatment or both, (2) participate in a victim impact panel, (3) not operate a motor vehicle without a valid driver\u2019s license, registration or insurance and (4) participate in 150 hours of community service to be completed within the first fifteen months of his probation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The defendant was released from incarceration and began serving probation on May 4, 2006. On July 28, 2006, the office of adult probation filed a motion seeking modification of the conditions of the defendant\u2019s release. Specifically, the probation officer assigned to the case requested that the defendant be required to review, sign and abide by all sexual offender conditions of probation to include sexual offender evaluation and any recommended treatment, polygraph examinations and Abel screens, which are specialized tests to determine a person\u2019s sexual interest in children, as deemed necessary by the office of adult probation. The request was based on the probation officer\u2019s discovery that the defendant had a 1997 conviction of sexual assault in the fourth degree stemming from an incident that occurred in 1995, that the defendant was listed on the state\u2019s sex offender registry and that a parole board evaluation conducted in 2001 rated the defendant\u2019s recidivism-sexual offense relapse risk as high and his dangerousness-severity of risk as severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">At the hearing on the request to modify the conditions of probation and to impose the sexual offender condition, the probation officer testified that his basis for making the request was the policy of the office of adult probation to do so out of an abundance of caution where the probationer had a prior sexual offense conviction and was still on the sex offender registry. The probation officer referred to no behavior on the part of the defendant during his probation that gave rise to this requested modification. The probation officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>testified, however, that because the use of alcohol was a factor in the defendant\u2019s past crimes, he believed it was necessary to make the recommendation in case the defendant started drinking again. In response to the court\u2019s inquiry as to how the condition of sexual offender evaluation was reasonably related to the defendant\u2019s current rehabilitation, the probation officer stated that he did not believe that it was \u201cso much related to his rehabilitation as much as it [was] to his supervision and the safety to the community as a probation department.\u201d The probation officer acknowledged that the defendant\u2019s conviction of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs had no sexual component, that he had no present indication that the defendant was using or abusing alcohol and that the defendant was enrolled in a substance abuse program in accordance with the terms of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In response, the defendant argued that if specific problems with alcohol arose in the future, the conditions imposed at sentencing relating to alcohol use were sufficient to address any such issue. The defendant further argued that the conditions regarding sexual offender treatment were completely unrelated to the charge of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs for which he is currently on probation. Additionally, the defendant contended that there was nothing to indicate any probability that he would commit a sexual offense while on probation, especially because it had been more than ten years since he had been convicted of the sexual assault charge and at least five years since he had been under supervision by the department of correction or office of adult probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">On August 7, 2006, the court granted the motion for modification and imposed a condition of probation requiring the defendant to review, sign and abide by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>all sexual offender conditions of probation, including sexual offender evaluation and any recommended treatment, polygraph examination and Abel screens as deemed necessary. In its memorandum of decision, the court stated that <em>State </em>v. <em>Pieger, </em>240 Conn. 639, 692 A.2d 1273 (1997), required the condition of probation to be reasonably related to the purposes of probation. Quoting broad language from <em>Pieger, </em>the court determined that any condition could be imposed if it would help serve the defendant\u2019s reformation. The court noted that the probation officer testified that alcohol was a common denominator in the defendant\u2019s criminal history and, in particular, that it \u201cfueled the conduct which resulted in his sexual assault conviction.\u201d The court concluded that the sexual offender condition was \u201creasonably necessary to rehabilitate the defendant and reasonably necessary to protect prospective victims.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">On appeal, the defendant contends that the additional condition requiring him to participate in sexual offender evaluation, treatment or both is improper because it is not related to his rehabilitation for the crime to which he pleaded guilty and for which he is currently serving probation. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">In order to determine whether the legislature intended to allow the imposition of such a condition of probation, we begin with the familiar principles of statutory construction. \u201cWhen construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextuai evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. . . . When a statute is not plain and unambiguous, we also look for interpretive guidance to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pasquariello </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos., </em>281 Conn. 656, 663-64, 916 A.2d 803 (2007). We first look to the language of the statute and to the general goals of probation in order to discern the intent of the legislature in enacting subdivision (17) of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-30 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-30 (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[w]hen imposing sentence of probation or conditional discharge, the court may, as a condition of the sentence, order that the defendant . . . (17) satisfy any other conditions reasonably related to the defendant\u2019s rehabilitation. ...\u201d The comment of the commission to revise the criminal statutes, which first proposed adoption by the legislature of our present criminal code more than thirty years ago, provides in relevant part as to \u00a7 53a-30: \u201cThis section sets out, as a kind of guideline, the general conditions that the court may impose on the sentence of probation .... The list is not intended to be exhaustive.\u201d Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, Penal Code comments, Connecticut General Statutes Annotated (West 2001) \u00a7 53a-30, commission comment. Thus, pursuant to \u00a7 53a-30 (a), a sentencing court may impose a variety of conditions to a sentence of probation that are aimed at rehabilitating the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>In viewing the general goals of probation together with the broad language of the statute, we conclude that the trial court has the broad authority and flexibility to impose conditions to reach the desired ends of rehabilitating the probationer. Thus, for example, the court has the authority to impose sexual offender treatment as a special condition of probation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cyr, </em>57 Conn. App. 743, 746-48, 751 A.2d 420, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 905, 755 A.2d 883 (2000). The court\u2019s authority, however, is not unbridled. In the exercise of its discretion, the court\u2019s imposition of a condition must reasonably relate to the purposes of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\u201cProbation conditions serve two primary purposes. [They] are meant to assure that the probation serves as a period of genuine rehabilitation and that the community is not harmed by the probationer\u2019s being at large. . . . Because probation is part of a criminal sentence, probation conditions often restrict the liberty rights of a probationer by imposing serious restraints on a probationer\u2019s life-style, associations, movements and activities. . . . Nevertheless, a condition of probation may diminish a probationer\u2019s liberty rights only to the extent necessary for his reformation and rehabilitation.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>33 Conn. App. 432, 448, 636 A.2d 852, cert. denied, 229 Conn. 906, 640 A.2d 117 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">\u201cWhen sentencing a defendant to probation, a trial court has broad discretion to impose conditions. . . . Nevertheless, this discretion is not unlimited, as statutory and constitutional constraints must be observed. . . . General Statutes \u00a7 53a-30 enumerates the conditions that the trial court may impose on a defendant.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>supra, 33 Conn. App. 447. Although the list of conditions set forth in \u00a7 53a-30 was meant to be illustrative, and not exhaustive, the gamut of potential conditions of probation to be imposed on a defendant is not unbounded. \u201cOn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>appeal, we review whether the trial court abused its statutory discretion in imposing a condition of probation.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\u201c[I]n determining whether a condition of probation [is proper] a reviewing court should evaluate the condition imposed under our Adult Probation Act in the following context: The conditions must be reasonably related to the purposes of the [Probation] Act. Consideration of three factors is required to determine whether a reasonable relationship exists: (1) the purposes sought to be served by probation; (2) the extent to which constitutional rights enjoyed by law-abiding citizens should be accorded to probationers; and (3) the legitimate needs of law enforcement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thorp, </em>57 Conn. App. 112, 116-17, 747 A.2d 537, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 913, 754 A.2d 162 (2000). In the present case, our focus is on the first factor, the purposes sought to be served by probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Here, the court relied primarily on <em>State </em>v. <em>Pieger, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 639, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Cyr, </em>supra, 57 Conn. App. 743, to support its conclusion that the condition of sexual offender evaluation was appropriate. On closer examination, however, neither <em>Pieger </em>nor <em>Cyr </em>supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion. In <em>Pieger, </em>the defendant was convicted of evading responsibility in connection with an accident in which he struck a pedestrian with his vehicle. The trial court required, as a condition of probation, that the defendant donate $2500 to the hospital in which the victim was being treated for severe injuries. On appeal, our Supreme Court affirmed the imposition of the condition because it was reasonably related to the defendant\u2019s rehabilitation, as it forced him to confront the harm his actions caused. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pieger, </em>supra, 650. Moreover, the court stated that \u201crequiring the defendant to make a donation to the hospital . . . was more rehabilitative than requiring the defendant to pay a fine because the donation had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number><em>a direct relationship to the accident and the injuries, </em>thereby advancing <em>the rehabilitative purpose of making the defendant accept his responsibility </em>for the accident.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. The court concluded that \u201cas long as the condition requiring monetary payment shares a nexus with the defendant\u2019s crime, as in this case, it is reasonably related to rehabilitation.\u201d Id., 651. The court further noted: \u201cIn the present case, the nexus shared by the defendant\u2019s crime and the imposed condition of making a donation is clear\u2014the donation is to be made to the hospital where the victim of the crime was treated. In future cases, however, express findings supporting the requisite nexus would alleviate any concerns on the part of a reviewing court.\u201d Id., 651 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In <em>Cyr, </em>the defendant was convicted of risk of injury to a child and prostitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cyr, </em>supra, 57 Conn. App. 745. The trial court imposed a condition of sexual offender treatment. The defendant failed to comply with that condition, and his probation was revoked. In his appeal challenging the revocation of probation, the defendant claimed that the trial court lacked authority to impose the sexual offender treatment as a condition of probation. This court disagreed and affirmed the revocation of probation, concluding that although the statute under which the defendant was convicted was not an enumerated offense <em>requiring </em>sexual offender treatment; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-30; the trial court nevertheless could legally impose such condition. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cyr, </em>supra, 747-48. Specifically, this court noted that the trial court imposed the condition only after it considered \u201cthe facts alleged in the risk of impairing morals of a child charges and concluded that given <em>the sexual nature and circumstances of the crimes for which the defendant was on probation, </em>and the fact that the victims were children, the sexual offender evaluation and treatment condition was reasonable, justified and <em>clearly related </em>to the defendant\u2019s rehabilitative needs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>and the protection of society.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 540 A.2d 679 (1988), in which the defendant had been convicted of robbery, he admitted that the robbery was committed so that he would be able to purchase drugs. Id., 154. One year into the defendant\u2019s probation, his probation officer determined that the defendant was involved with drugs again. Id., 155. As a result, a drug testing-urinalysis condition of probation was imposed and, after apositive urine test, the defendant\u2019s probation was violated. Id., 156-57. On appeal, our Supreme Court addressed the necessary connection between the added probation condition and rehabilitation for the offense that resulted in the underlying conviction. The court concluded: \u201cIt is simply unreasonable for the defendant, found guilty of robbery in the first degree intended to generate money to pay for drugs for himself, to believe that if, during the ongoing contact with the probation officer, the use of drugs was reasonably suggested by his conduct or appearance, he would never expect to be subject to some type of drug testing. . . . [T]he court was entitled to impose urinalysis testing. It clearly was reasonably related to the defendant\u2019s rehabilitation and to the goals of probation. It was a foreseeable consequence . . . .\u201d Id., 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Misiorski, </em>250 Conn. 280, 282-83, 738 A.2d 595 (1999), the defendant pleaded guilty to sexual assault in the fourth degree and public indecency in a case involving a mentally impaired victim. The trial court ordered, as a condition of probation, that the defendant undergo sexual offender testing, counseling and treatment. Id., 284. Subsequently, the office of adult probation informed both the court and the defendant that it intended to notify the defendant\u2019s neighbors and fellow bowling league participants of the defendant\u2019s conviction. The defendant objected, and the corut held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>a hearing to determine whether the office of adult probation had authority to impose such a condition. Id., 284-85. The court found that it did. On appeal, the Supreme Court concluded: \u201cNotification to the public was a reasonable component of the defendant\u2019s sexual offender treatment.\u201d Id., 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Conversely, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>55 Conn. App. 28, 739 A.2d 271 (1999), the defendant was convicted of risk of injury to a child, and this court held that it was not proper to impose as a condition of probation the payment of money into a fund to compensate the victim for presently unknown treatment costs. The court held: \u201c[These costs were] far too remote to be considered \u2018reasonably related to the offense\u2019 or \u2018easily ascertainable damages for injury\u2019 to be allowed under \u00a7 53a-28 (c).\u201d Id., 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>supra, 33 Conn. App. 434. the defendant was convicted of larceny and drug offenses. The trial court imposed as a condition of probation that the defendant must keep her house and children clean and that any child of hers younger than age thirteen could not be left unattended. Id., 446. On appeal, this court held that the imposition of these conditions of probation was improper because the \u201cconditions regarding cleanliness of the home and care and cleanliness of the children do not serve to rehabilitate or to reform the defendant because they do not relate to the defendant\u2019s behavior involved in her convictions for larceny and drug crimes.\u201d Id., 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">On the basis of the previously discussed case law, it is evident that in order for a condition of probation to be \u201creasonably related to the defendant\u2019s rehabilitation\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 53a-30 (a) (17),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> there must be a nexus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>between the condition of probation and the charge for which the defendant is serving probation. Such a requirement not only serves to rehabilitate a defendant on the basis of the crime committed but also protects the constitutional rights of the probationer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Here, the defendant pleaded guilty to operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs. There was no sexual component involved in this offense. Thus, the condition imposing sexual offender evaluation and treatment is not related to the offense for which the defendant is on probation. The court rationalized its imposition of sexual offender evaluation and treatment by stating that because alcohol was the common denominator in his criminal history, including his sexual offense from more than ten years prior, the added condition was reasonably related to the defendant\u2019s conviction of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs. The fact that alcohol may have been the common denominator in the defendant\u2019s criminal history might support the imposition of the requirement of alcohol counseling for any of his other crimes. Because the defendant\u2019s sexual conduct was not a common thread in the defendant\u2019s criminal history and was wholly unrelated to the defendant\u2019s present conviction, however, there is no logical nexus between the added condition of probation and the underlying offense of which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the court abused its discretion by modifying the conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>of the defendant\u2019s probation and imposing the requirement of sexual offender evaluation and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the motion for modification of the conditions of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">In this opinion McLACHLAN, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-30 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen imposing sentence of probation or conditional discharge, the court may, as a condition of the sentence, order that the defendant . . . (17) satisfy any other conditions reasonably related to the defendant\u2019s rehabilitation. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b540-8\"> The defendant also claims on appeal that the imposition of the sexual offender condition violates his constitutional rights because it renders his plea unknowing and involuntary and amounts to an additional punishment for a sexual offense that he committed more than ten years ago, an offense for which he has served his sentence. Because we agree with the defendant\u2019s first claim, we need not address his additional claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b541-7\">LAVINE, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ACT\">dissenting. \u201cSince probation is, first and foremost, a penal alternative to incarceration\u2014its objectives are to foster the offender\u2019s reformation and to preserve the public\u2019s safety\u2014a sentencing court must have the discretion to fashion those conditions of probation it deems necessary to ensure that the individual successfully completes the terms of probation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 168-69, 540 A.2d 679 (1988). The majority would reverse the judgment of the trial court \u201c[b]ecause there is no nexus between the modified condition [of probation] and the [conviction] for which the defendant [Kevin M. Boyle] is serving probation . . . .\u201d I disagree. Moreover, I think the majority improperly focuses on the modified condition\u2019s relationship to the <em>charge of conviction, </em>rather than its relationship to the appropriate purposes of probation, including \u201cthe legitimate needs of law enforcement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thorp, </em>57 Conn. App. 112, 117, 747 A.2d 537, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 913, 754 A.2d 162 (2000). In my view, the majority\u2019s conclusion undermines the clear purpose of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-30 (c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>In granting the motion for modification of probation filed by the office of adult probation, the court stated in its memorandum of decision:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cWhile the defendant\u2019s claim of remoteness, and a lack of overt connection between sex offender treatment and the underlying crime of operating [a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs] are relevant inquiries, the court is not persuaded that the requested modification is inappropriate. As noted previously, the defendant remains obligated to register as a sex offender until 2009. In enacting [General Statutes] \u00a7 54-102s, Connecticut\u2019s \u2018Megan\u2019s Law,\u2019 it was the legislature\u2019s intent to require sex offender registration as \u2018[in] response to concerns regarding the harm to society caused by sex crimes and the relatively high rate of recidivism among sex offenders\u2019 .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Misiorski, </em>250 Conn. 280, 292, 738 A.2d 595 (1999). . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u201cTherefore, the registration requirement is not only an express recognition that a danger to public safety exists, but also a recognition that it exists to such a degree that the public is entitled to be kept informed of the defendant\u2019s whereabouts. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">\u201cSaid [proposed] condition is reasonably related to the purposes of probation. Although the defendant is on probation for operating [a motor vehicle while under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs], the court observes that [the office of adult] probation is legitimately concerned about the nexus between the defendant\u2019s alcohol consumption and the conduct which resulted in his sexual assault conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\u201cThe court finds that the evidence and law support the conclusion that such a condition is reasonably necessary to rehabilitate the defendant and reasonably necessary to protect prospective victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\u201cTherefore, the request to modify the defendant\u2019s probation to include a requirement that he review, sign and abide by all sex offender conditions of probation, to include sex offender evaluation and any recommended treatment, polygraph examinations and Abel screens [which are specialized tests to determine a person\u2019s sexual interest in children] as deemed necessary by the office of adult probation is granted.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Both parties agree that the decision of the court is entitled to considerable deference and is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. \u201c[I]n modifying or expanding the conditions of probation to serve the ends of justice, the court\u2019s objective must be to impose special conditions that foster the offender\u2019s reformation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>as well as preserve the public\u2019s safety. The broad power to impose conditions permits insulating the individual from the conditions that led him into trouble. . . . The trial court therefore has broad discretion to modify or enlarge the conditions of probation, for good cause shown, at any time during the period of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u201cThe appropriate standard of review of a trial court\u2019s actions is whether the trial court abused its discretion. ... In determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling. . . . Reversal is required only where an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done. . . . There is no hard and fast rule by which an abuse of discretion may be determined but, in general, for an exercise of discretion not to amount to an abuse, it must be legally sound and there must be an honest attempt by the court to do what is right and equitable under the circumstances of the law, without the dictates of whim or caprice.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Medley, </em>48 Conn.

See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-28 et seq. Statutes authorizing probation, while setting parameters for doing so, have been very often construed to give the court broad discretion in imposing conditions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">\u201cProbation is, first and foremost, a penal alternative to incarceration\u2014its objectives are to foster the offender\u2019s reformation and to preserve the public\u2019s safety. For that reason, a sentencing court is afforded broad discretion to fashion those conditions of probation it deems necessary to ensure the individual successfully completes his term of probation. . . . When necessary, the sentencing court has discretion to impose conditions that impinge on otherwise inviolable rights. In determining whether a probation condition unduly intrudes on a constitutionally-protected freedom, a reviewing court evaluates the condition in the following context:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">\u201cThe conditions must be reasonably related to the purposes of the [Probation] Act. Consideration of three factors is required to determine whether a reasonable relationship exists: (1) the purposes sought to be served by probation; (2) the extent to which constitutional rights enjoyed by law-abiding citizens should be accorded to probationers; and (3) the legitimate needs of law enforcement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>787 F.2d 1182, 1185 (7th Cir. 1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pieger, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 647-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">\u201cThe success of probation as a correctional tool is in large part tied to the flexibility within which it is permitted to operate. ...

Within the permitted statutory conditions, the court may direct medical or psychiatric treatment, impose support obligations, require suitable employment, set housing restrictions, and order restitution. . . . Unlike these specific provisions of \u00a7 53a-30 (a), the terms of subdivision [17]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> are very broad. By allowing the trial court to impose <em>\u2018any other </em>conditions reasonably related to [the defendant\u2019s] rehabilitation\u2019 . . . the legislature authorized the court to impose any condition that would help to secure the defendant\u2019s reformation.

Id., 646-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">On July 28, 2006, Christopher J. Pribyson, the probation officer assigned to the defendant, filed a motion to modify the terms of the defendant\u2019s probation to require the defendant to review, sign and abide by all sex offender conditions of probation, to include sex offender evaluation and any recommended treatment, polygraph examinations and Abel screens as deemed necessary by the office of adult probation. The motion stated that the modification was necessary for the office of adult probation to supervise the defendant adequately in the community and to offer the most effective supervision for the safety of the community and the public at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Pribyson testified for the state in favor of the granting of the motion for modification. Pribyson has extensive experience in the supervision of sex offenders.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He explained to the court the manner in which the defendant\u2019s case came to his attention and the reason for his concerns. The defendant\u2019s file originally was assigned to the intake assessment referral unit. After the defendant\u2019s criminal history was noted, the file was transferred to one of the three sex offender probation officers in the office of adult probation. The court support services division\u2019s policy (policy), which was placed into evidence, required that the defendant be supervised by a specialized sex offender probation officer. Pribyson noted that the defendant was registered with the state police roll of sex offenders. Although he is a registered sex offender, the defendant had not been supervised as a sex offender by the office of adult probation during the last ten years.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The policy required that Pribyson file a motion for modification of the defendant\u2019s probation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>In response to the state\u2019s question as to whether there was anything specific to which he could cite that gave him a reason to request the modification, Pribyson testified: \u201c[Conversations with the [defendant] in how he related to me his past history with alcohol and reviewing the police reports in which alcohol was a huge risk factor, a dynamic risk factor. If he was to, you know, start to use [alcohol] again\u2014that was a situation in which the sex offenses occurred\u2014that would be a huge concern.\u201d He also testified that the defendant\u2019s 2001 evaluation for risk of reoffending stood out because it was at a high level, which Pribyson did not usually see.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The court specifically asked Pribyson why the evaluation was necessary and what it had to do with the defendant\u2019s reasonable rehabilitation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">\u201cThe Court: [W]hat is it about the defendant\u2019s present posture, based upon your training and experience and based upon his past history, that makes you feel that a sex offender evaluation and any follow-up treatment is reasonably related to his rehabilitation based upon the probation for the crime he\u2019s presently on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">\u201c[The Witness]: Presently, nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">\u201cThe Court: But you feel as though adding a condition of sex offender evaluation is reasonably related to his rehabilitation because of the\u2014-just the position of alcohol with his past crimes and the fact that the alcohol obviously was the basis for which he\u2019s presently on probation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes, and in reviewing the other police reports, the same types of behavior were exhibited in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>those incidents. Those incidents and those behaviors are the static factors that are involved and those won\u2019t change, and the dynamic risk factors involved medical\u2014his medical attention, his being sober. If those things were to change slightly, the whole situation could change drastically.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\">\u201cThe Court: Why do you think adding these conditions is reasonably related to his rehabilitation, why exactly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">\u201c[The Witness]: Starting with the evaluations, since the evaluation is from 2001, without having somebody who\u2019s qualified to do the evaluation and at least having an evaluation completed, I really don\u2019t have an idea if he should or shouldn\u2019t be in sex offender treatment. If they determine that he doesn\u2019t need to be in sex offender treatment then, you know, there\u2019s no reason to go on further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">\u201cThe Court: I mean, my direct question is, in other words, I understand what you\u2019re saying in terms of what the evaluation itself can tell you, but what I\u2019m asking you is, what is it about ordering a sex offender evaluation that you feel is reasonably related to his rehabilitation at the moment? In other words, is it based on your training and experience, looking at his past history</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">\u201c[The Witness]: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much related to his rehabilitation as much as it is to his supervision and the <em>safety to the community </em>as a probation department.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">The discretion of courts to impose additional conditions of probation is, of course, not without limits. <em>State </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>55 Conn. App. 28, 32-33, 739 A.2d 271 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>(1999). Imposing, or adding, conditions of probation should not be based on the personal preferences or idiosyncrasies of a probation officer or court, or some vague notion that the proposed condition is good for the probationer or society. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>33 Conn. App. 432, 446-48, 636 A.2d 852 (conditions of probation requiring defendant convicted of narcotics offense and larceny to provide for proper care and cleaning of home and prohibiting children younger than age thirteen being left alone without adult not reasonably related to the purposes of probation), cert. denied, 229 Conn. 906, 640 A.2d 117 (1994). Conditions of probation, whether imposed at the time of sentencing or after, must reasonably relate to the purposes of probation, i.e., rehabilitation of the offender and protecting society. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 168-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The mere existence of \u00a7 53a-30 (c), however, demonstrates that the legislature has concluded that there are instances in which conditions of probation, not contemplated at the time of plea or sentencing, ought to be added, subject to a finding of \u201cgood cause.\u201d See footnote 1. In this case, numerous factors supported the concern of the probation officer, and the ruling of the court, that sex offender evaluation, and possibly treatment, were warranted. They include (1) the defendant\u2019s status as a registered sex offender until 2009, (2) the 2001 sex offender evaluation, (3) the history of \u201calcohol fueled conduct\u201d testified about by Pribyson, including the fact that the defendant\u2019s 1997 conviction of sexual assault in the fourth degree was alcohol related, (4) Pribyson\u2019s conversations with the defendant, which confirmed, in Pribyson\u2019s judgment, the link between alcohol and criminal conduct, (5) the April 5, 2006 conviction of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a. The defendant\u2019s alcohol fueled conduct, in the context of all the facts in this case, provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>the necessary factual nexus between the proposed condition of probation and preserving public safety. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Repetti, </em>60 Conn. App. 614, 620-22, 760 A.2d 964 (approving probation officer\u2019s requirement that defendant refrain from use of alcohol as part of sex offender treatment), cert. denied, 255 Conn. 923, 763 A.2d 1043 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The majority cites the three-pronged test to be used by a reviewing court to evaluate the condition of probation imposed, i.e., (1) the purposes sought to be served by probation, (2) the extent to which constitutional rights enjoyed by law-abiding citizens should be accorded to probationers and (3) the legitimate needs of law enforcement. The majority then states that \u201c[i]n the present case, our focus is on the first factor, the purposes sought to be served by probation.\u201d The majority thus wholly ignores the third factor, \u201cthe legitimate needs of law enforcement,\u201d which informed Pribyson\u2019s judgment and was an integral part of the court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">A review of the cases indicates the consistent focus that has been placed on whether there is a sufficient relationship between the condition imposed, or sought to be added, and the purposes of rehabilitation. State v. <em>Pieger, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 648 (if it appears court reasonably satisfied terms of probation had beneficial purpose consistent with defendant\u2019s reformation and rehabilitation, order must stand). The majority nonetheless concludes that \u201cit is evident that in order for a condition of probation to be \u2018reasonably related to the defendant\u2019s rehabilitation\u2019 pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-30 (a) (17), there <em>must </em>be a nexus between the condition of probation and the <em>[conviction] </em>for which the defendant is serving probation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The cases cited by the majority, however, do not support this broad assertion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Of course, it often happens that conditions of probation will bear a direct relationship to the offense of conviction, e.g., a condition that the probationer convicted of using, or selling, controlled substances, not possess, or sell, any illegal substances or weapons. This does not mean that all probation conditions, in the wide range of cases in our courts, must stem directly from the offense of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Section 53a-30 (c) provides a mechanism for cases, such as this, in which postsentencing information or developments persuade a probation officer that permission should be sought to add an additional probation condition. The majority\u2019s approach would frustrate the purpose of the statute in cases in which information is not available, or known, or its significance not fully appreciated, at the time of the plea or the sentencing, but instead comes to light during the period of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The defendant also claims on appeal that the imposition of the sexual offender condition violates his consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>tutional rights because it renders his plea unknowing and involuntary and amounts to additional punishment for the sexual offense of which he had been convicted and for which he has served his sentence. Both of these arguments are without merit. The additional condition was added only after notice, a hearing and a full and fair opportunity to contest the matter. In accepting probation, the defendant accepted at the time of sentencing the possibility that the terms of his probation could be modified or enlarged in the future in accordance with the statutes governing probation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Thorp, </em>supra, 57 Conn. App. 121.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">In sum, I conclude that the evidence before the court demonstrated good cause to grant the state\u2019s motion to modify the defendant\u2019s probation to include the disputed condition. The defendant\u2019s probation officer had approximately five years of experience supervising between sixty and eighty sex offenders and followed the policy of the court support services division with respect to sex offenders who are on probation for other offenses. The defendant is required to register as a sex offender until 2009. There is a connection between the defendant\u2019s prior sexual offenses and his use of alcohol, which is the root of the current offense for which he is on probation, i.e., operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs. The more support programs that are in place, the less likely a probationer is to reoffend. Furthermore, the office of adult probation is charged, in part, with protecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>general public. Without a current sex offender evaluation, it is not known what, if any, services the defendant needs to avoid reoffending and what steps are necessary to protect the public. I conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by granting the motion to modify because the dual purposes of probation will be served by requiring the defendant to undergo sex offender evaluation at this time. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-30 (c) provides: \u201cAt any time during the period of probation or conditional discharge, after hearing and for good cause shown, the court may modify or enlarge the conditions, whether originally imposed by the court under this section or otherwise, and may extend the period, provided the original period with any extensions shall not exceed the periods authorized by section 53a-29.
