The sale finally took place on December 10, 2005, and the court, <em>Hon. Howard T. Owens, Jr., </em>judge trial referee, approved the sale on January 9, 2006. On January 23,2006, the intervening defendant filed a bankruptcy petition in United States Bankruptcy Court. On January 24, 2006, Diane L. Roman, did likewise. On January 26, 2006, the successful bidder filed a motion for return of deposit due to the bankruptcy filings. On January 30, 2006, notice of the court\u2019s January 9, 2006 rulings were mailed to the parties, but the committee\u2019s deed was held by the court in view of the bankruptcy proceedings. On February 10, 2006, the substitute plaintiff filed an objection to the return of deposit, and a motion to release the deed and set a closing date or forfeit the deposit. On April 3, 2006, after a hearing, the court, <em>Richards, J., </em>denied the motion for return of deposit and granted the motion to release the deed and set a closing date.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">On April 12, 2006, the intervening defendant filed an appeal, claiming in essence that Judge Richards had violated the stay provision of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Furthermore, he argued that he was prevented from appealing from the judgment approving the sale because the filing of the bankruptcy petitions stayed the appeal period. Following oral argument in this court, a review of the record disclosed that the petitions in bankruptcy had been dismissed in August, 2006, and the matters closed on October 4, 2006. No appeal has been filed challenging the judgment approving the sale.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\u201cMootness implicates subject matter jurisdiction, and, therefore, we will not review claims that are moot. . . . [T]he test for determining mootness is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>[w]hether the [appellant] would ultimately be granted relief .... The test, instead, is whether there is any practical relief this court can grant the [appellant]. . . . If no practical relief can be afforded to the parties, the appeal must be dismissed.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Jeremy M., </em>100 Conn. App. 436, 441-42, 918 A.2d 944 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u201cUnder Connecticut law, a judicial sale becomes complete and creates a legal right to obligations among parties when it is confirmed and ratified by the court.\u201d <em>Hartford Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>13 Conn. App. 239, 247, 536 A.2d 962, cert. denied, 207 Conn. 805, 540 A.2d 373 (1988). \u201cGenerally, once a court has approved the foreclosure sale and the applicable appeal period has elapsed, the mortgagor\u2019s right of redemption is extinguished and the court\u2019s jurisdiction to modify that judgment ends. See D. Caron &amp; G. Milne, Connecticut Foreclosures (4th Ed. 2004) \u00a7 9.01B, p. 203 (\u2018absent the possibility of an appeal from [the court\u2019s] determination, the approval of the sale generally operates to divest the owner of his equity of redemption and consequently places the property beyond the power of the court\u2019). Accordingly, after the sale is approved and the relevant appeal periods have expired, any action by the mortgagor to redeem should be dismissed as moot.\u201d <em>Wells Fargo Bank of Minnesota, N.A. </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>98 Conn.
