We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. The plaintiff was employed as a house painter by Marino\u2019s Painting. On June 30, 2003, he fell twenty-seven feet from a ladder while working on a house renovation project in New Canaan, suffering compensa-ble injuries to his right foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">New England Realty Enterprises, LLC (New England Realty), owned the premises at which the renovation work was being performed. Marino\u2019s Painting had been hired by Jeffrey Famham, acting on behalf of New England Realty. The town records of New Canaan listed the defendant\u2019s business, Gallagher Construction, as the general contractor for the renovation project. The plaintiff also observed the defendant giving instructions at the job site concerning the painting work and making payments to Marino\u2019s Painting for work performed on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Following his injury, the plaintiff filed claims for workers\u2019 compensation benefits against Marino\u2019s Painting who he claimed was Farnham, doing business as New England Realty, and the defendant. Neither Mari-no\u2019s Painting nor the defendant had workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage on the date of the plaintiffs injury. New England Realty did not defend against the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">A formal hearing was held before the commissioner on June 1, 2004. In a finding and award issued on May 24, 2005, the commissioner determined that Marino\u2019s Painting was hired by either Gallagher Construction or by New England Realty through Farnham. The commissioner further found that \u201c(1) the two individuals\u2014[the defendant] and Farnham\u2014either individually or as the principal in their respective entity\u2014procured work to be done on the premises where the [plaintiffs] injury occurred; (2) the work that Marino\u2019s Painting was to do on the premises is part of the trade or business of a subcontractor; and (3) either or both, [the defendant] and Farnham, controlled the premises in their representative or individual capacities.\u201d The commissioner concluded that the defendant, Gallagher Construction, Farnham and New England Realty were all principal employers under \u00a7 31-291 and, consequently, liable for all workers\u2019 compensation benefits not paid by Marino\u2019s Painting. The defendant appealed to the board, which affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The standard of review in workers\u2019 compensation appeals is well settled. \u201c[W]hen a decision of a commissioner is appealed to the review [board], the review [board] is obligated to hear the appeal on the record of the hearing before the commissioner and not to retry the facts. ... It is the power and the duty of the commissioner, as the trier of fact, to determine the facts. . . . [T]he commissioner is the sole arbiter of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses .... The conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. . . . We will not change the finding of the commissioner unless the record discloses that the finding includes facts found without evidence or fails to include material facts which are admitted or undisputed. . . . Similarly, [t]he decision of the [board] must be correct in law, and it must not include facts found without evidence or fail to include material facts which are admitted or undisputed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Brinson </em>v. <em>Finlay Bros. Printing Co., </em>77 Conn. App. 319, 323-24, 823 A.2d 1223 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The defendant first claims that the board improperly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s finding that he was a principal employer of the plaintiff. The defendant argues that the commissioner\u2019s finding failed to establish conclusively that he had hired Marino\u2019s Painting or that he had controlled the premises at which the painting work was performed, as required for liability to attach under \u00a7 31-291.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Pursuant to \u00a7 31-291, principal employer liability attaches \u201c[w]hen any principal employer procures any work to be done wholly or in part for him by a contractor, or through him by a subcontractor, and the work so procured to be done is a part or process in the trade or business of such principal employer, and is performed in, on or about premises under his control . . . .\u201d Section 31-291 involves three main elements: \u201cOne, the relation of the principal employer and contractor must exist in work wholly or in part for the former. Two, the work must be in, on or about premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>controlled by the principal employer; and three, the work must be a part or process in the trade or business of the principal employer.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hebert </em>v. <em>RWA, Inc., </em>48 Conn. App. 449, 453, 709 A.2d 1149, cert. denied, 246 Conn. 901, 717 A.2d 239 (1998). In this appeal, we are concerned with whether the defendant procured the work performed by Marino\u2019s Painting and whether he controlled the premises at which the work was performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">We note that our review of the defendant\u2019s claim is limited by the procedural posture of this case. Because the defendant did not file a motion to correct the factual findings of the commissioner, he is unable to challenge those findings now. See <em>Sellers </em>v. <em>Sellers Garage, Inc., </em>80 Conn. App. 15, 19, 832 A.2d 679, cert. denied, 267 Conn. 904, 838 A.2d 210 (2003); see also Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 31-301-4. We therefore are limited to determining whether the board\u2019s conclusions on the basis of those facts \u201cresult[ed] from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. . . . In other words, [tjhese conclusions must stand unless they could not reasonably or logically be reached on the subordinate facts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sellers </em>v. <em>Sellers Garage, Inc., </em>supra, 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The defendant contends that the first element of \u00a7 31-291 cannot be established absent a factual finding by the commissioner that he hired Marino\u2019s Painting, thereby creating a contractual relationship between him and Marino\u2019s Painting. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, \u00a7 31-291 does not require a contractual relationship. Rather, the statute simply requires a \u201cprocurement\u201d of work. As stated, to satisfy the first element of the statute, \u201cthe relation of the principal employer and contractor must exist in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>work wholly or in part for the former.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hebert </em>v. <em>RWA, Inc., </em>supra, 48 Conn. App. 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">In the present case, the commissioner\u2019s factual findings established a relationship of general contractor and subcontractor between the defendant\u2019s business, Gallagher Construction, and Marino\u2019s Painting. First, the commissioner found that the building permit issued by the town of New Canaan listed Gallagher Construction as the general contractor for the renovation proj ect. Further, the commissioner credited the plaintiffs testimony as to the role of Marino\u2019s Painting as a subcontractor, which he was free to do as the sole arbiter of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses. See <em>Brinson </em>v. <em>Finlay Bros. Printing Co., </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 323. Specifically, the commissioner found that the plaintiff observed the defendant giving instructions concerning the painting work as well as making payments to Marino\u2019s Painting. The commissioner determined that the plaintiff understood that he was working for Marino\u2019s Painting, which, in turn, was working for a company involving both the defendant and Famham. From this evidence, it reasonably can be inferred that Marino\u2019s Painting performed work in part for the defendant, thereby satisfying the first element of \u00a7 31-291.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The defendant further contends that the commissioner\u2019s finding failed to establish that he controlled the premises, as required for liability to attach under \u00a7 31-291. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">\u201cThe term \u2018control\u2019 in [the context of \u00a7 31-291] has a specific meaning. It is merely descriptive of the work area and is used instead of such words as \u2018owned by him\u2019 or \u2018in his possession\u2019 in order to describe the area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>in a more inclusive fashion. The emphasis is upon limitation of the area within which the accident must happen rather than upon actual control of the implements which caused the accident.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Alpha Crane Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Capitol Crane Co., </em>6 Conn. App. 60, 73-74, 504 A.2d 1376, cert. denied, 199 Conn. 808, 508 A.2d 769 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">In the present case, it reasonably may be inferred from the commissioner\u2019s factual findings that the defendant exercised the requisite control over the area in which the plaintiff was injured to qualify as a principal employer under \u00a7 31-291. As previously indicated, the commissioner found that the official town records listed Gallagher Construction as the general contractor. In addition, the commissioner credited the plaintiffs testimony that the defendant gave instructions concerning the painting work.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the board properly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s finding that the defendant was a principal employer of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">The defendant next claims that the board improperly concluded that the commissioner\u2019s finding was not void for uncertainty. The defendant specifically refers to the commissioner\u2019s factual findings that Marino\u2019s Painting was hired by either the defendant or Famham, acting on behalf of New England Realty, and that either or both the defendant and Famham controlled the premises. The cmx of the defendant\u2019s argument is that the commissioner\u2019s overall finding is void as a result of his alternative factual findings because the issue of liability remained undetermined. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">The defendant\u2019s argument that the commissioner\u2019s finding is void for uncertainty is unavailing because the commissioner imposed liability on <em>both </em>the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>and Famham in their individual and representative capacities as principal employers of the plaintiff. Specifically, the commissioner found that \u201c[the defendant], Gallagher Construction . . . Famham and New England Realty . . . are all principal employers . . . liable for all [workers\u2019 compensation] benefits to the extent not paid by Marino\u2019s Painting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">It is well established that multiple employers can be held liable as principal employers. \u201c[W]henever an injured employee of a subcontractor receives a compen-sable injury he may pursue his remedy against his immediate employer or any one or more principal employers as thus defined, or against all in one proceeding. Where there is an original contractor and a consecutive chain of subcontractors down to the workman receiving a compensable injury, each contractor in such chain and his immediate employer is a principal employer as to the injured workman . . . .\u201d <em>Palumbo </em>v. <em>Fuller Co., </em>99 Conn. 353, 365, 122 A. 63 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">We conclude that the board properly determined that the commissioner\u2019s finding was not void for uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">The decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-11\"> The commissioner found that the defendants William Gallagher, Gallagher Construction, Jeffrey Famham and New England Realty, LLC, were principal employers of the plaintiff and therefore liable for all workers\u2019 compensation benefits not paid by the defendant Marino Painting. Because only William Gallagher appealed to the compensation review board, we refer to him as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-6\"> The defendant second injury fund is the appellee in this appeal. The defendant did not have workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-355 (h), \u201c[w]hen a finding and award of compensation has been made against an uninsured employer who fails to pay it, that compensation shall be paid from the Second Injury Fund . . . .\u201d The plaintiff did not file briefs before the board or this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-291, titled \u201cPrincipal employer, contractor and subcontractor,\u201d provides in relevant part that \u201c[w]hen any principal employer procures any work to be done wholly or in part for him by a contractor, or through him by a subcontractor, and the work so procured to be done is a part or process in the trade or business of such principal employer, and is performed in, on or about premises under his control, such principal employer shall be liable to pay all compensation under this chapter to the same extent as if the work were done without the intervention of such contractor or subcontractor. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
