(act), and (2) he was not \u201cinjured while occupying a covered motor vehicle,\u201d as required to qualify for the underinsured motorist excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>tion to \u00a7 31-284 (a). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts. The plaintiff is an employee of Bragdon Auto Towing, LLC (company), a corporate entity that is wholly owned by the plaintiffs brother, Keith Bragdon. On or about January 21, 2001, the plaintiff was injured as a result of being struck by a motor vehicle operated by William Sweet. At the time of the collision, the plaintiff was loosening sand in a sander attached to the back of a truck owned by George Bunnell.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Because the accident occurred during the course of the plaintiffs employment with the company, the plaintiff received workers\u2019 compensation benefits in addition to compensation from Sweet\u2019s insurance carrier. On February 7, 2003, the plaintiff filed a seven count complaint, of which only the fourth count is at issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the fourth count, the plaintiff alleged that the amounts received from Sweet\u2019s insurance carrier were insufficient to compensate him fully for the injuries sustained in the accident. As a consequence, he alleged that he was entitled to recover under the terms of the underin-sured motorist policy issued by the defendant to the company. The defendant subsequently moved for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiffs claim did not fall within the parameters of \u00a7 38a-336 (f) and was therefore barred by the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision contained in \u00a7 31-284 (a). In a memorandum of decision issued on March 2, 2006, the court agreed with the defendant and, accordingly, rendered summary judgment in its favor. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">\u201cThe standards governing our review of atrial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>well established. Practice Book [\u00a7 17-49] provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ... In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue [of] material facts which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law ....</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">\u201cOn appeal, [this court] must decide whether the trial court erred in determining that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pepitone </em>v. <em>Serman, </em>69 Conn. App. 614, 618, 794 A.2d 1136 (2002). Because the trial court rendered judgment for the defendant as a matter of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">The plaintiff first argues that there is a genuine issue as to whether the underinsured motorist policy represented an agreement between himself and the company to provide him with additional remedies beyond those established under the act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court never ruled on the merits of this claim and therefore, we decline to afford it review.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>The record reveals that the plaintiff raised this issue in his memorandum of law in opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court, however, never addressed this argument in its memorandum of decision. Instead, it appears that the court rendered summary judgment solely on the ground that the plaintiff could not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 38a-336 (f) and was therefore barred by \u00a7 31-284 (a) from seeking recovery under his employer\u2019s underinsured motorist policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">As the plaintiff notes in his brief, it is unclear from the memorandum of decision whether the court failed to consider his argument or merely rejected it without comment. Yet, it was the plaintiffs duty to clarify the reason for the omission by filing a motion for articulation. See Practice Book \u00a7 66-5. As this court has stated previously, \u201c[a]n articulation is appropriate where the trial court's decision contains some ambiguity or deficiency reasonably susceptible of clarification. ... An articulation may be necessary where the trial court fails completely to state any basis for its decision ... or where the basis, although stated, is unclear.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fantasia </em>v. <em>Milford Fastening Systems, </em>86 Conn. App. 270, 283, 860 A.2d 779 (2004), cert. denied, 272 Conn. 919, 866 A.2d 1286 (2005). It is well settled that \u201c[t]his court is not bound to consider claimed errors unless it appears on the record that the question was distinctly raised . . . and was ruled upon and decided by the [trial] court adversely to the appellant\u2019s claim.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Durkin Village Plainville, LLC </em>v. <em>Cunningham, 97 </em>Conn. App. 640, 642 n.1, 905 A.2d 1256 (2006); see also Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. Furthermore, \u201c[i]t is the responsibility of the appellant to provide an adequate record for review. . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 61-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">In this case, the plaintiff has failed to satisfy his burden. Accordingly, we decline to review his claim. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number><em>Manifold </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>94 Conn. App. 103, 125, 891 A.2d 106 (2006) (\u201c[w]here the trial court\u2019s decision is ambiguous, unclear or <em>incomplete, </em>an appellant must seek an articulation ... or this court will not review the claim\u201d [emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Auric Answering Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Glenayre Electronics, Inc., </em>54 Conn. App. 86, 88, 733 A.2d 307, cert. denied, 250 Conn. 926, 738 A.2d 653 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The plaintiff next claims that his case falls within the parameters of \u00a7 38a-336 (f) because he was \u201cinjured while occupying a covered motor vehicle . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (f). Specifically, the plaintiff relies on the policy\u2019s extension of underinsured motorist coverage to anyone \u201coccupying a covered \u2018auto\u2019 or a temporary substitute for a covered \u2018auto.\u2019 \u201d With regard to that language, the plaintiff argues that touching the sander on the back of Bunnell\u2019s truck qualifies as \u201coccupying\u201d the truck. Furthermore, the plaintiff claims that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Bunnell\u2019s truck was a \u201ctemporary substitute for a covered \u2018auto\u2019 \u201d under the policy and could therefore be considered a \u201ccovered motor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 38a-336 (f). We need not examine whether the plaintiff was \u201coccupying\u201d the truck because we conclude that his argument concerning the truck\u2019s status as a \u201ccovered motor vehicle\u201d has been raised for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of the plaintiffs claim. In support of its motion for summary judgment, the defendant supplied the court with a copy of the insurance policy that it issued to the company. Included within the policy was a section entitled, \u201cItem Three: Schedule of Covered Autos You Own.\u201d Under that heading, the policy listed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>the year, make, model and vehicle identification numbers of three motor vehicles. Presumably on the basis of this section of the policy, the court determined that it was \u201can undisputed fact on the record that [the plaintiff] was not in physical contact with a vehicle insured under the Travelers\u2019 insurance policy issued to [the company].\u201d The court never considered whether, as a factual matter, Bunnell\u2019s truck might qualify as a \u201ctemporary substitute for a covered \u2018auto\u2019 \u201d and therefore, trigger coverage directly under the policy. After reviewing the record, it is apparent that the court never addressed that claim because the plaintiff failed to bring it to the court\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">\u201cIt is well settled that the trial court can be expected to rule only on those matters that are put before it. . . . With only a few exceptions . . . we will not decide an appeal on an issue that was not raised before the trial court. ... To review claims articulated for the first time on appeal and not raised before the trial court would be nothing more than a trial by ambuscade of the trial judge.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lawton </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>91 Conn. App. 698, 709 n.7, 882 A.2d 151 (2005). In this case, the plaintiff is arguing for the first time on appeal that he was injured while occupying a \u201ctemporary substitute vehicle\u201d under the policy. Furthermore, he has not sought review under any doctrine by which we may reach issues that were not brought to the attention of the trial court. As a consequence, we decline to address this claim in accordance with the long-standing rule that this court will not review arguments that were never raised before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-6\"> George Bunnell is also a plaintiff in the action; however, he is not a party to this appeal. We therefore refer in this opinion to Bragdon as the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\"> Besides Travelers, the original complaint named the following individuals and corporate entities as defendants: William Sweet, Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Company, Progressive Casualty Insurance Company, James RadgowsM, Helen Rajewski and Paul Botchis. This appeal involves only the summary judgment rendered in favor of Travelers. Accordingly, we refer in this opinion to Travelers as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b624-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (f) provides: \u201cNotwithstanding subsection (a) of section 31-284, an employee of a named insured injured while occupying a covered motor vehicle in the course of employment shall be covered by such insured\u2019s otherwise applicable uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b624-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAn employer who complies with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section shall not be liable for any action for damages on account of personal injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment . . . but an employer shall secure compensation for his employees as provided under this chapter ....
