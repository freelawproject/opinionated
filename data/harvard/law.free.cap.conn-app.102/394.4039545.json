No case of which we are aware has directly answered the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The writ of error claimed various alternative relief, namely, a reversal of the judgment of summary criminal contempt, the entry of judgment of not guilty or a new trial before a jury and a different judge, or a reduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>in the sentence imposed. The plaintiffs appellate brief sought vacation of the conviction. His reply brief sought dismissal of the \u201cmatter\u201d on the ground that subject matter jurisdiction was lacking for the judge\u2019s finding and punishment for summary criminal contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The first question is whether jurisdiction exists in this court to entertain the writ of error, as the appropriate vehicle for the claimed relief sought by the plaintiff on the facts of this unusual case. Whether we have jurisdiction to entertain the writ depends on our analysis of whether the trial judge properly conducted a summary criminal contempt proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 51-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The plaintiffs claim is that no subject matter jurisdiction existed to allow the judge to conduct a summary proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 51-33 when an information simultaneously alleged a violation of \u00a7 51-33a, a non-summary proceeding. We begin our analysis by stating the obvious. The court had the power, or jurisdiction, to hear the general class of case, a summary criminal contempt pursuant to \u00a7 51-33. The plaintiff conceded this at oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Subject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of a court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented to it. It exists if the court has the power to hear and deteimine cases of the general class to which the particular proceeding belongs. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>282 Conn. 1, 6-7, 917 A.2d 966 (2007); <em>Sastrom </em>v. <em>Psychiatric Security Review Board, </em>100 Conn. App. 212, 216-17, 918 A.2d902 (2007). If atribunal has the authority to decide the class of case, the issue of jurisdiction should be resolved in favor of its existence. <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Star Steel Structures, Inc., </em>96 Conn. App. 142, 150, 900 A.2d 42, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 914, 908 A.2d 539 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Subject matter jurisdiction should not be confused with the scheduling of a case, or its assignment to a particular judge, which may relate to a recusal of a judge for bias or prejudice or statutory incapacity, as provided in \u00a7 51-33a. The trial judge in this case had the power to conduct a summary criminal contempt hearing immediately, pursuant to \u00a7 51-33 or to postpone a criminal contempt hearing, pursuant to \u00a7 51-33a, if he deemed it necessary. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 1-16 through 1-19.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Recusal relates to the impropriety of a particular judge to listen to a particular case because of bias that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>places the judge\u2019s impartiality in question. <em>LaBow </em>v. <em>LaBow, </em>13 Conn. App. 330, 333-34, 537 A.2d 157, cert. denied, 207 Conn. 806, 540 A.2d 374 (1988). Recusal may also be statutory, as provided in \u00a7 51-33a and in the statute\u2019s amplification in Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 1-17 and 1-19. Recusal, the disqualification of a particular judge, is unrelated to jurisdiction, the power to hear a particular type of case.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">In this case, if \u00a7 51-33a applied, the recusal would be a mandatory statutory disqualification of a particular judge, unrelated to the general power of the Superior Court to hear that particular class of case. Here, the judge had jurisdiction to hear both \u00a7 51-33 and \u00a7 51-33a cases. The question for the judge was which statutory avenue to pursue, one resulting in a summary proceeding or the other in a postponement of the matter, to be heard by another judge. Because none of the conditions outlined in Practice Book \u00a7 1-17<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> applied, there was no reason for recusal, and the judge proceeded with a summary criminal contempt proceeding, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 1-16 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Before describing the facts that illuminate the case, we note that the plaintiff admits that no claim or motion for a continuance of the summary criminal contempt proceeding was made on the basis of the fact that the information charged a violation of \u00a7 51-33a, thereby arguably precluding a summary criminal contempt proceeding, pursuant to \u00a7 51-33. He correctly claims, however, that a jurisdictional argument may be raised at any time. See <em>Manifold </em>v. <em>Ragaglia, </em>94 Conn. App. 103, 117, 891 A.2d 106 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Certain facts are relevant to a determination of our jurisdiction to afford relief by way of a writ of error. The plaintiff was in court to argue his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas on the day the behavior occurred. The transcript reveals that immediately after the court denied the plaintiffs motion to withdraw his pleas, he struck his counsel, attorney Michael Isko, causing him to fall beneath the prosecutor\u2019s table in the courtroom. Prior to the denial of the motion, the plaintiff had complained to the court about the advice and performance of his counsel and had stated that he should be able to withdraw his plea because of \u201c [ineffective assistance of counsel . . . .\u201d The plaintiff had previously referred his complaint about his counsel to the statewide grievance committee. He told the court that his counsel was \u201cin direct violation of the attorney\u2019s oath and numerous, numerous rules of the professional conduct . . . .\u201d Immediately after striking his counsel, the plaintiff stated: \u201cFucking ass motherfucker. I\u2019m going to fuck your ass up, man. Let me go, man.\u201d The ensuing events and comments of the court are best described by quoting from the transcript.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>During the afternoon, on the same day, different counsel, Aaron J. Romano, a special public defender, appeared for the plaintiff. At that time, the plaintiff was willing to come into the courtroom of his own accord. Continuing with the matter, the judge noted that he had put certain observations on the record during the morning session when the behavior of the plaintiff occurred but did not elaborate then because the plaintiff and his counsel were not present.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>After the punishment was imposed by the court, the plaintiff was faced with a procedural dilemma with regard to his next step if he chose to contest his sentence of six months to serve in jail. If he filed a direct appeal, claiming that he was denied the rights to cross-examine and to present evidence and other guarantees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>of due process as provided for in nonsummary criminal contempt proceedings brought pursuant to \u00a7 51-33a, he risked dismissal on the ground that he should have brought a writ of error because he sought redress arising from a judgment of summary criminal contempt rendered pursuant to \u00a7 51-33. See <em>State v. Melechinsky, </em>36 Conn. Sup. 547, 550-51, 419 A.2d 900 (1980). If he opted to bring a writ of error, as he did, he risked dismissal of it by this court because he should have filed a direct appeal from the judgment of guilty in violation of \u00a7 51-33a, as stated in the judgment file. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Murray, 225 </em>Conn. 355, 623 A.2d 60, cert. denied, 510 U.S. 821, 114 S. Ct. 78, 126 L. Ed. 2d 46 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Paragraph three of the writ of error provides that the original charges underlying the proceedings during which the contempt was committed were two counts of solicitation to commit robbery in the first degree and assault in the first degree to which he had pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Paragraph seventeen states that the plaintiff \u201cclaims his right to this writ of error on the basis that [our Supreme Court] has held that the writ of error is the only means by which review of a judgment of summary criminal contempt may be obtained.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Paragraph 18 (g) states that the court \u201cerred in finding the [plaintiff] in criminal contempt in violation of ... \u00a7 51-33a where the proper procedure as delineated by the statute requires that charge to be tried by a different judge.\u201d Thus, the plaintiff simultaneously refers to both the judgment of summary criminal contempt, a violation of \u00a7 51-33, which had actually been rendered and the \u201cpaper\u201d judgment pursuant to \u00a7 51-33a, as stated in the judgment file.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">A writ of error is a separate and distinct review procedure, not to be confused with a statutory appeal. C. Tait &amp; E. Prescott, Connecticut Appellate Practice and Procedure (3d Ed. 2000) \u00a7 9.1. If there is a right to appeal, a writ of error should not be brought; id., \u00a7 9.3; Practice Book \u00a7 72-1 (b); but if a summary criminal contempt is found, there is no right to an appeal; see C. Tait &amp; E. Prescott, supra, \u00a7 9.4 (b); and a writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>error must be sought. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>259 Conn. 487, 494, 789 A.2d 979 (2002); <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>241 Conn. 569, 585, 698 A.2d 268 (1997); <em>Ullmann </em>v. <em>State, </em>230 Conn. 698, 703, 647 A.2d 324 (1994); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>222 Conn. 591, 595, 610 A.2d 1177; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>221 Conn. 498, 500, 605 A.2d 1350, cert. denied, 506 U.S. 875, 113 S. Ct. 216, 121 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1992); <em>In re Dodson, </em>214 Conn. 344, 346, 572 U.S. 328, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Dodson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>498 U.S. 896, 111 S. Ct. 247, 112 L. Ed. 2d 205 (1990); <em>Naunchek </em>v. <em>Naunchek, </em>191 Conn. 110, 113, 463 A.2d 603 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">A summary adjudication pursuant to \u00a7 51-33 is a punishment and must be immediate, peremptory and not subject to suspension by a full range of appellate review. <em>McClain </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>189 Conn. 663, 669-70, 457 A.2d 1072 (1983). If the contempt occurs in the presence of the court, there is no written charge or complaint, the court from necessity is its own judge of the contempt, and the punishment is not subject to the full range of claims ordinarily available on direct appellate review. Id.; see also <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>186 Conn. 256, 259, 440 A.2d 969 (1982). Summary criminal contempt proceedings, therefore, are not the functional equivalent of criminal prosecutions and do not require an information or any written charge. The summary nature of the proceeding is further exemplified by the fact that a review of such a proceeding may be had only by writ of error; see, e.g., <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 494; which need not be answered and does not require any pleadings in opposition. Practice Book \u00a7 72-3 (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Section 51-33 gives jurisdiction to a court summarily and immediately to punish contempts occurring in its presence when a person behaves contemptuously or in a disorderly manner, whereas \u00a7 51-33a serves a different puipose, namely, the need for a continuance in some instances, as outlined in Practice Book \u00a7 1-17, in which event, the matter should be tried by a different judge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number><em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 186 Conn. 260; see also <em>Mayberry </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>400 U.S. 455, 465-66, 91 S. Ct. 499, 27 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1971); Practice Book \u00a7 1-19. The two statutes overlap and allow a court either to resolve the matter summarily pursuant to \u00a7 51-33<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or to defer action in some instances pursuant to \u00a7 51-33a.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The former applies to proceedings conducted immediately or soon after the conduct has occurred and requires no information or written charge, whereas the latter applies to postponed proceedings, requiring the usual panoply of procedural safeguards and pleadings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 604; <em>Naunchek </em>v. <em>Naunchek, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 114-15 (discussion of difference between \u00a7\u00a7 51-33 and 51-33a).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Contempts may be civil or criminal; Practice Book \u00a7 1-13A (b); and may be adjudicated summarily or non-summarily. In the present case, the court clearly had jurisdiction to proceed under \u00a7 51-33 because the behavior was legally a contempt, the punishment was authorized and the judicial authority was qualified. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 500. If there is no need for immediate action, the judicial authority may postpone the matter, as provided in \u00a7 51-33a. Id., 514; see also Practice Book \u00a7 1-17. On the basis of our review of the transcript, we conclude that none of the conditions for deferral existed here. If the deferral is not mandated by \u00a7 51-33a or the rules of practice governing nonsummary criminal contempt, \u00a7 51-33 governs the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>contempt of court proceedings. <em>State </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 366. The two statutes coexist with jurisdiction to punish pursuant to either but do not logically allow the same contemnor to be guilty of both for the same behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Liston, </em>88 Conn. App. 599, 609, 870 A.2d 1137, cert. denied, 276 Conn. 911, 886 A.2d 425 (2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1220, 126 S. Ct. 1444, 164 L. Ed. 2d 143 (2006), an information charged the plaintiff with a violation of \u00a7 51-33a, and the judgment file stated that he violated that statute. <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Liston, </em>Conn. Appellate Court Records &amp; Briefs, January Term, 2005, Record pp. 7, 11. The <em>Higgins </em>court, after noting these facts, decided that the trial court nevertheless could proceed to punish the contumacious behavior summarily pursuant to \u00a7 51-33; <em>see Higgins v. Liston, </em>supra, 609 n.6; and upheld the summary criminal conviction after a review of the contemnor\u2019s writ of error. No claim was made in <em>Higgins, </em>as is made in this case, that the judgment file\u2019s recitation of a violation of \u00a7 51-33a created a lack of jurisdiction to decide the matter summarily or to review the summary criminal contempt by way of a writ of error. In <em>Higgins, </em>the writ of error alleged that the judge <em>was </em>personally embroiled and that \u00a7 51-33a required that a charge of a violation of that statute must be tried by a different judge. In the present case, the plaintiff concedes that there was no personal attack on the judge, and, further, we have concluded on the basis of the judge\u2019s remarks, that the judge intended to and did conduct a summary criminal contempt proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 51-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The <em>Higgins </em>decision resolved that a plaintiff does not have a due process right to be represented by counsel under the state and federal constitutions during a summary criminal contempt proceeding because the proceeding is not a criminal prosecution. Id., 613. \u201cWe will uphold a summary contempt conviction as long as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>the court that imposed the sentence possessed jurisdiction to do so.\u201d Id., 615. Despite the fact that the plaintiff in <em>Higgins </em>was charged with, and the judgment file indicated a guilty finding of, a violation of \u00a7 51-33a; <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Liston, </em>Conn. Appellate Court Records &amp; Briefs, January Term, 2005, Record pp. 7,11; the punishment he received, after a summary contempt proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 51-33, was upheld, after a review of his writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In the present case, the plaintiff, the prosecutor and the judge were aware that the summary criminal contempt proceeding was being conducted as though any punishment would be imposed pursuant to \u00a7 51-33 and the pertinent rule of practice. The judge, in fact, imposed a punishment in accordance with that statute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Summary criminal contempt is not a criminal offense requiring an information alleging the violation of a criminal statute. It is a unique, sui generis proceeding, not a criminal prosecution, with both statutory and common-law antecedents and not subject to the usual plethora of due process guarantees. When a proceeding is conducted as though it involved a particular legal theory with the knowledge and acquiescence of the parties and the judicial authority, the content of the judgment should be tested on that basis regardless of whether a complaining document alleged a different legal theory. See <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>215 Conn. 450, 457, 576 A.2d 1273 (1990), on remand, 24 Conn. App. 377, 588 A.2d 656 (1991), rev\u2019d, 222 Conn. 233, 610 A.2d 574 (1992); see also <em>Suffield Development Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>National Loan Investors, L.P., </em>97 Conn. App. 541, 563-64, 905 A.2d 1214, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 942, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>943, 912 A.2d 479 (2006). This is particularly the case when no complaining document was required at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">We use the <em>Higgins </em>holding and the civil case precedent<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to resolve the legal and procedural dilemma posed by the plaintiff in his writ of error. Here, there is a statutory variance between an unnecessary complaining document and a judgment file, and a judgment that was in fact rendered. No trial was ever held pursuant to the complaining document, and the judgment file erroneously refers to a violation as described in a complaining document for which no trial was ever held. We conclude, therefore, that the writ of error was the appropriate vehicle to attack the proceedings as conducted and that, accordingly, this court has jurisdiction to entertain the writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The plaintiff argues that he was denied due process of law because he was not allowed to cross-examine an adverse witness at the summary criminal contempt hearing and because he was denied a one week continuance to present \u201cacquitting-mitigating\u201d evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The principles governing such a hearing may be succinctly stated. The trial judge has wide discretion in evaluating the facts and circumstances; see <em>Ullmann </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 721; the decision of the judge to punish a contemnor quickly when the effective administration of justice requires an immediate judicial response cannot be overturned when there was no personal embroilment on the part of the presiding judge; <em>Naunchek v. Naunchek, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 117; the judge may punish the offender on his or her own motion, solely on facts within the judge\u2019s knowledge; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 599; no witnesses other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>the judge are required in proof of the contempt; <em>McClain </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 666; and the contemnor need not be represented by counsel during the \u00a7 51-33 hearing. <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Liston, </em>supra, 88 Conn. App. 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The plaintiff was represented by counsel but was not allowed to cross-examine an assistant state\u2019s attorney who had been permitted by the judge to testify as to what the assistant state\u2019s attorney saw at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s behavior, nor was the plaintiff allowed a one week continuance in order to resolve \u201cintention\u201d and \u201cany mental health issues\u201d arising from whether his medications were \u201cright\u201d or the \u201cright dose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The judge could have punished the plaintiff solely on facts within the judge\u2019s knowledge and did not need to allow others, such as the assistant state\u2019s attorney, to recount their observations. The transcript as quoted herein; see footnotes 8, 9; amply supports the judge\u2019s finding of contumacious behavior totally on the basis of his observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The one week deferral of proceedings, if granted, would have contravened the essence of the summary criminal contempt proceeding, namely, the necessity for a swift adjudication and resultant punishment for contemptuous or disorderly courtroom behavior. In view of the obstruction to the orderly administration of justice caused by the plaintiffs behavior, and witnessed by the judge, there was no reason for the deferral. None of the conditions listed in \u00a7 51-33a or Practice Book \u00a7 1-17 existed for a postponement of the proceedings. Furthermore, the judge had the opportunity to observe the plaintiffs mental condition to the time the plaintiff struck Isko and to hear the plaintiffs statements immediately after he knocked Isko down. The judge\u2019s observations were sufficient for him to gauge whether the plaintiff had the requisite intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>behave as he did. On the basis of the judge\u2019s observations, he could infer that the plaintiffs conduct was wilful, which constitutes the requisite intent for punishment of a contemnor pursuant to \u00a7 51-33. <em>In re Dodson, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Before the judge pronounced the sentence, he asked the plaintiff if there was anything he wanted to state for the record. The plaintiff used the opportunity to state why he did not like Isko and then to state that he had \u201cdeep mental health issues . . . ever since [he] dealt with this attorney.\u201d He stated: \u201cIsko should be here and my attorney should have\u2014my attorney representing me now also should have at least a chance to cross-examine him.\u201d When asked if there was anything else he wanted to say, the plaintiff continued to complain about Isko and when asked for the third time if there was anything else, the plaintiff stated: \u201cYeah, I want to apologize to the court, everybody who witnessed it, because it was uncalled for. It was rude. And it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d The judge asked for the fourth time if the plaintiff had anything else to say to which he responded, \u201cno . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The judge concluded that the plaintiff blamed Isko for his predicament rather than himself. Prior to the judge\u2019s finding the plaintiff guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of criminal contempt, the plaintiff continued to try to interject remarks about Isko while the judge was speaking. Other than a brief mention of his mental health condition as having been caused by Isko, the plaintiff did not indicate that his conduct was caused by anything other than his animosity toward his attorney.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The judge granted Romano\u2019s motion for a continuance of the sentencing hearing for the plaintiff, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>the judge denied any continuance of the summary criminal contempt hearing. The judge did not abuse his discretion by denying a continuance of a \u00a7 51-33 hearing. We agree with the court that no continuance, on the basis for which it was sought, was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Although the judgment file in this case recited a guilty finding by the court of a violation of \u00a7 51-33a in accord with the information, the judgment file is a clerical document and is not the judgment. <em>Lehto </em>v. <em>Sproul, </em>9 Conn. App. 441, 445, 519 A.2d 1214 (1987). The pronouncement by the court, in this case a finding of punishment pursuant to \u00a7 51-33, <em>is </em>the judgment. See id. Judgment occurs when sentence is pronounced. The judgment file memorializes the judgment and is prepared and signed subsequent to the rendition of judgment. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>158 Conn. 461, 466, 262 A.2d 166 (1969). In the present case, the judgment file was not signed by the judge. Because the judge had rendered judgment in accord with \u00a7 51-33, he would not have signed a judgment file indicating judgment rendered pursuant to \u00a7 51-33a. The judgment file is subject to a clerical correction to conform to what was, in fact, the judgment. <em>Jones Destruction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Upjohn, </em>161 Conn. 191, 200, 286 A.2d 308 (1971). Even if no judgment file was prepared, a judgment is valid if the parties are aware of the provisions of the judgment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>DeMartino </em>v. <em>Monroe Little League, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 271, 274, 471 A.2d 638 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">In this case, the judgment file reflects a clerical error and does not correctly state the statutory reference or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>the actual decision of the judge. As such, we must order it corrected. <em>Botass </em>v. <em>Botass, </em>40 Conn. App. 733, 739, 673 A.2d 129 (1996); <em>Cioffoletti </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>34 Conn.

During the luncheon recess, I called the public defender\u2019s office to talk to Mr. Isko, and I was advised by, I assume staff there, that Mr. Isko was gone for the day. It was then that I was advised . . . that Mr. Isko would not be in and that they were requesting that you [reference to Romano] appear for [the plaintiff]. At 2 p.m. or shortly thereafter, you did come to my chambers along with members of the prosecutorial staff and indicated that, either at that time or shortly thereafter, that the [plaintiff] did not want to appear in the courtroom, and I wasn\u2019t going to force him to <em>come </em>into the courtroom, and we discussed the circumstances and time flies, but it brought us to the 3:20 p.m. time, which it is now.

And upon speaking with [the plaintiff], there was some mental health issues that came to light during the course of my interview with him that he made me aware of. It\u2019s my understanding . . . that he is currently on some type of medicine that is supposed to modify or in some way affect his behavior and that he has been on several different medicines that have been changed during the course of his stay at the department of correction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>With that in mind, I believe that there may be some type of diminished capacity issue or defense that I would like to be able to, at the very least, investigate.

Both were facing forward. I didn\u2019t even see [the plaintiff] glance in the direction of Mr. Isko. In fact, I believe that [the plaintiff] was looking forward at the time. What I did see was suddenly, a sudden movement of his right arm, without any interaction between he and Mr. Isko, without any provocation that I could discern because they weren\u2019t even looking or interacting at the time; [the plaintiff] raise[d] his right arm, it appeared to me in a violent manner, and struck attorney Isko in the face .... I saw Mr. Isko fall to the ground on his backside behind the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s table. The [plaintiff] in my opinion did not turn to face Mr. Isko to deliver the blow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-10\">\u201cIt should be noted that the right hand of the [plaintiff], the one used to effectuate the blow, appears to be wrapped in Ace bandages.

It appeared to me that [he] resisted. A multitude of marshals, it could be five, six or seven were all around [the plaintiff], and they slowly shuffled [him] to the lockup. It\u2019s clear to me that the [plaintiff] was resistant. Apparently, pepper spray was administered by one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>or more of the marshals in the area of the lockup.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\">\u201cCertainly, this court was disrupted, not only by the behavior of [the plaintiff], but there was a residue of the pepper spray that emanated into the courtroom. And for virtually, if not all, a good substantial part of the morning session, the audience, the members of the public, and the staff and the court were coughing and having an effect from the pepper spray. This is all attributable to the [plaintiff]. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">\u201cThe court thought the interruption was such a grievous nature that the court considered ordering a recess till order could be restored. But the court upon reflecting thought it would be better if the court maintained the public in their seats and continue with the courtroom, the morning session. The Court did that. Certainly, the activity of [the plaintiff] merited a break in the proceedings and a recess. I elected not to have the recess. I thought that would be a surer way of maintaining the members of the public in their seats because it was clear to me everybody was aghast, and some members of the public stood up. They were shocked. . . . Also, as far as any disruption in the administration of justice, Mr. Isko left.....I infer from reasons of this assault. He didn\u2019t finish the cases he had. That is further interruption of the administration of justice for the day. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ajl-dedup-0\">\u201cMr. Vasquez, I find you guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of criminal contempt of this courtroom and that your conduct caused an obstruction to the administration of justice in the following ways: The disruption you created by assaulting in open court, in the well of the court, your attorney, is outrageous and egregious behavior. That, in and of itself, is sufficient to find a disruption in the administration of justice. There were fifty-seven people here in the audience alone. That certainly caused disruption not only to 1he court and the administration of the court\u2019s business in this day, but certainly in their business they had before the court. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-10\">\u201cPlus, the residual effect of the pepper spray and plus the fact that Mr. Isko could not complete his business, all contribute to\u2014any one of which would have been sufficient, an intentional disruption in the administration of justice of this court. The court is going to impose a sentence of six months, the maximum I can by law, to serve.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\"> See <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.
