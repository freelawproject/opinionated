We disagree and therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The victim,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who is deaf,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was bom in 1989. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>three separate occasions, the defendant<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> engaged in sexual acts with the victim against her will. First, the defendant touched the victim\u2019s breasts by licking and biting them in the spring of 2001, when the victim was about twelve years old. The defendant inserted his finger into the victim\u2019s vagina in the winter of 2001. In the late fall or early winter of 2002, the defendant licked the victim\u2019s vagina and forced her to perform oral sex on him. The defendant also caused his penis to come in contact with the victim\u2019s breasts. The defendant is the father of the victim\u2019s three younger half-sisters and was in a relationship with the victim\u2019s mother at all relevant times. The victim was fifteen at the time she testified and was reluctant to testify because it made her uncomfortable.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Allegations of the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse of the victim were reported anonymously to the department of children and families (department). Thereafter, police officers and a department employee went to the victim\u2019s home to investigate. As a result of their investigation, the victim was taken to the Yale-New Haven Hospital child sex abuse clinic where she was examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The defendant took the witness stand in his defense and testified that he had been a loving father to the victim. He also testified that the victim had fabricated the allegations against him because she was jealous about having to share family resources with her half-sisters or that her grandmother and uncle had encouraged her to make the allegations because of a dispute they had had with the defendant and the victim\u2019s mother. The defendant is proficient in American sign language, able to communicate with the victim and served as her communicator both within and outside of the family. The victim\u2019s mother had only a basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>command of American, sign language. We will address additional facts as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The defendant claims that he was denied the constitutional right to a fair trial due to prosecutorial impropriety that occurred during the examination of witnesses and closing argument. Specifically, the defendant claims that during final argument, the prosecutor improperly (1) appealed to the emotions of the jury, (2) vouched for the victim\u2019s credibility, (3) referred to facts that were not in evidence and (4) commented on the defendant\u2019s silence in response to questions from an investigating police officer. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">\u201c[T]he touchstone of due process analysis in cases of alleged [harmful] prosecutorial [impropriety] is the fairness of the trial, and not the culpability of the prosecutor. . . . The issue is whether the prosecutor\u2019s [actions at trial] so infected [it] with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. ... In determining whether the defendant was denied a fair trial ... we must view the prosecutor\u2019s [actions] in the context of the entire trial. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">\u201c[I]t is not the prosecutor\u2019s conduct alone that guides our inquiry, but, rather, the fairness of the trial as a whole. . . . We are mindful throughout this inquiry, however, of the unique responsibilities of the prosecutor in our judicial system. A prosecutor is not only an officer of the court, like every other attorney, but is also a high public officer, representing the people of the [s]tate, who seek impartial justice for the guilty as much as for the innocent. ... By reason of his [or her] office, [the prosecutor] usually exercises great influence upon jurors. [The prosecutor\u2019s] conduct and language in the trial of cases in which human life or liberty [are] at stake should be forceful, but fair, because he [or she] represents the public interest, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>demands no victim and asks no conviction through the aid of passion, prejudice or resentment. If the accused be guilty, he [or she] should [nonetheless] be convicted only after a fair trial, conducted strictly according to the sound and well-established rules which the laws prescribe.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fauci, </em>282 Conn. 23, 32-33, 917 A.2d 978 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">During trial, the defendant failed to object to the alleged instances of prosecutorial impropriety he raises on appeal. Nonetheless, we will review the claims because the keystone of \u201cappellate review of claims of prosecutorial [impropriety] is a determination of whether the defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial, and this determination must involve the application of the factors set out by [our Supreme Court] in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987).\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>269 Conn. 563, 573, 849 A.2d 626 (2004). \u201c[I]n analyzing claims of prosecutorial [impropriety], we engage in a two step analytical process. The two steps are separate and distinct: (1) whether [impropriety] occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that [impropriety] deprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. Put differently, [impropriety] is [impropriety], regardless of its ultimate effect on the fairness of the trial; whether that [impropriety] caused or contributed to a due process violation is a separate and distinct question . . . (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 572.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The defendant first claims that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the emotions of the jury by eliciting certain testimony from an expert witness and then using that evidence during final argument. To the extent that the defendant\u2019s claim concerns the testimony of an expert witness, it is an unpreserved eviden-tiary claim that is not reviewable because the defendant failed to object timely to the testimony. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>279 Conn. 139, 149-52, 900 A.2d 1276 (2006). To the extent that the claim focuses on the prosecutor\u2019s use of the evidence during final argument, we conclude that there was no impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The following facts are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim. The state called Lisa Kuntz, a licensed and school certified psychologist at the American School for the Deaf, to testify. She gave extensive testimony on the cognitive and language development of a deaf person and the culture of the world of the deaf, including testimony that \u201cstudies worldwide suggest that the fact of a disability places a child at 50 percent greater risk for being abused or neglected.\u201d The defendant did not object to the question posed by the prosecutor,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> nor did he move to strike the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">On appeal, the defendant claims that Kuntz\u2019 testimony improperly invited \u201cthe jury to believe the victim\u2019s testimony merely because the victim is disabled.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Although our Supreme Court has held that unpreserved claims of prosecutorial impropriety are to be reviewed under the <em>Williams </em>factors, that rule does not pertain to mere evidentiary claims masquerading as constitutional violations. The defendant has failed to bring to our attention any law that expert testimony related to the vulnerability of a disabled population is constitutionally improper. Thus, he has not removed the allegedly objectionable testimony from the realm of an evidentiary claim. Evidentiary claims do not merit review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A. 2d 823 (1989), because they are not of constitutional magnitude. \u201c[Rjobing garden variety claims [of an evidentiary nature] in the majestic garb of constitutional claims does not make such claims constitutional in nature. . . . Putting a constitutional tag on a nonconstitutional claim will no more change its essential character than calling a bull a cow will change its gender.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>99 Conn. App. 92, 99 n.6, 912 A.2d 1064, cert. denied, 281 Conn. 925, 918 A.2d 276 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The defendant may not transform an unpreserved evidentiary claim into one of prosecutorial impropriety to obtain review of the claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 279 Conn. 149. An appellate court \u201cshall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. . . . Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. . . . <em>PSE Consulting, Inc. </em>v. <em>Frank Mercede &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>267 Conn. 279, 335, 838 A.2d 135 (2004) (because review is limited to matters in record, court will not address issues not decided by trial court). In addition, [o]ur rules of procedure do not allow a [party] to pursue one course of action at trial and later, on appeal, argue that a path he rejected should now be open to him. ... To rule otheiwise would permit trial by ambuscade.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 149-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>2</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The defendant also claims that the prosecutor made repeated reference to Kuntz\u2019 testimony during opening and closing statements, thus arousing the emotions, particularly the sympathy, of the jury. In his brief, the defendant constructs his claim by isolating the following words used by the prosecutor: \u201cpowerless and vulnerable to multiple sexual assaults,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a \u201cvulnerable, young deaf girl,\u201d and the \u201ctrapped, difficult world of a deaf child with no speech,\u201d who was \u201cpowerless and vulnerable to multiple sexual assaults.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At oral argument, the defendant claimed that these repeated sympathetic references to the victim improperly appealed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the emotions of the jury and that the victim\u2019s disability was irrelevant to the crimes with which the defendant was charged. The state argues that the victim\u2019s disability was relevant to its theory of the case, i.e., that the defendant took advantage of her disability, especially in light of the fact that he was the person in the house who learned to use sign language and on whom the victim depended for communication. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">It has long been held that \u201c[a] prosecutor may not appeal to the emotions, passions and prejudices of the jurors. . . . When the prosecutor appeals to emotions, he invites the jury to decide the case, not according to a rational appraisal of the evidence, but on the basis of powerful and irrelevant factors which are likely to skew that appraisal. . . . Therefore, a prosecutor may argue the state\u2019s case forcefully, [but] such argument must be fair and based upon the facts in evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>266 Conn. 364, 394, 832 A.2d 14 (2003). Nonetheless, \u201cclosing arguments often have a rough and tumble quality about them, [and] some leeway 'must be afforded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the advocates in offering arguments to the jury in final argument. [I]n addressing the jury, [c]ounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Necaise, </em>97 Conn. App. 214, 229, 904 A.2d 245, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 942, 912 A.2d 478 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The facts are that the victim was a child at the time of the relevant events<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that she is deaf and unable to speak. She testified by using sign language through an interpreter. She was unable to pinpoint the exact time of the defendant\u2019s criminal acts; she was an embarrassed and reluctant witness. It was the prosecutor\u2019s responsibility during final argument to place all of this information in a reasonable context on the basis of the evidence. Assuming, without deciding whether Kuntz\u2019 testimony at issue was admissible, once the testimony was in evidence, the prosecutor was permitted to use it during final argument; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Arline, </em>223 Conn. 52, 59, 612 A.2d 755 (1992); for the jury to consider in reaching its verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>23 Conn. App. 712, 718, 584 A.2d 473, cert. denied, 217 Conn. 809, 585 A.2d 1233, cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1252, 111 S. Ct. 2894, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1058 (1991). This court previously has held that it was not improper for the prosecutor to refer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>the victim as vulnerable when the argument amounted to a reasonable inference from the testimony at trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>97 Conn. App. 719, 731, 906 A.2d 705 (2006) (victim mentally challenged), cert. denied, 281 Conn. 913, 916 A.2d 55 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">On the basis of the evidence and our review of the entire final argument,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we cannot say that the prosecutor\u2019s argument strayed beyond the evidence or the inferences the jury reasonably could draw from it. There was evidence that the defendant was the only person in the victim\u2019s family who was competent to use sign language, and he communicated for the victim. When the victim wrote a note to her mother about the abuse, the defendant intercepted it. Kuntz gave extensive testimony about the language acquisition of a nonhearing and nonspeaking person and how American sign language is linguistically different from English. Also, the evidence indicated that deaf children acquire the ability to think abstractly later than nondisabled children and that they have difficulty with the concept of time and need visual cues to track time. Defense counsel cross-examined the victim at length about the time the abuse occurred. Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s theory was that the victim falsely accused him of sexual abuse because she was jealous of her half-sisters and that her grandmother had put her up to it.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>The defendant would have us reverse his conviction on the basis of our Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>254 Conn. 290, 755 A.2d 868 (2000), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 545-46. Those cases axe distinguishable on the facts. \u201cAn appeal to the emotions of the jury may arise from the use of personal and degrading epithets to describe the defendant. . . . Although a prosecutor may argue that the evidence supports the defendant\u2019s guilt, he may not brand the defendant guilty with the use of such epithets.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>supra, 307. In <em>Williams, </em>\u201cthe prosecutor repeatedly engaged in character assassination and personal attacks on both the defendant and his key witness . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 546. The prosecutor in this case did not employ epithets to describe or brand the defendant or engage in character assassination of the defense witnesses during her opening or closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Finally, the fact that the court did not find anything amiss with the final arguments weighs heavily in our minds. See footnote 12. The court was present to hear and see the arguments and was able to observe the jury. As appellate courts repeatedly have said with respect to the credibility of a witness\u2019 words, a reviewing court cannot discern credibility on the basis of the words printed on a page. Words do not convey facial expressions, physical gestures and vocal intonation. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Calabrese, </em>279 Conn. 393, 403-404, 902 A.2d 1044 (2006). The same reasoning applies to our review of factually accurate statements isolated from the prosecutor\u2019s final argument. In this case, when asked, the court responded that it found nothing improper about the final arguments of either counsel. That presumably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>included appeals to the sympathy of the jury.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We have reviewed the record and determined that there was a basis in evidence for the prosecutor\u2019s referring to the victim as vulnerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the prosecutor vouched for the victim\u2019s credibility by (1) asking the jury: \u201cIs that something somebody would make up?\u201d and (2) eliciting inappropriate testimony from a hospital social worker. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\u201c[I]t is well established that the evaluation of [witnesses\u2019] testimony and credibility are wholly within the province of the trier of fact. . . . The prosecutor may not express his own opinion, either directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of witnesses. . . . Such expressions of personal opinion are a form of unsworn and unchecked testimony. . . . These expressions of opinion are particularly difficult for the jury to ignore because of the special position held by the prosecutor. . . . The jury is aware that he has prepared and presented the case and consequently, may have access to matters not in evidence . . . which the jury may infer to have precipitated the personal opinions. . . . While the prosecutor is permitted to comment upon the evidence presented at trial and to argue the inferences that the jurors might draw therefrom, he is not permitted to vouch personally for the truth or veracity of the state\u2019s witnesses.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Haity, </em>99 Conn. App. 375, 389, 914 A.2d 570 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The defendant claims that it was improper for the prosecutor to ask the jury, \u201cIs that something somebody would make up?\u201d We disagree and conclude that the use of a rhetorical question, such as this, is proper argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">We review the argument that the defendant claims is improper in the context in which it was used. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>278 Conn. 354, 364 nn.4-5, 897 A.2d 569 (2006). The prosecutor argued in part: \u201cWhat did she tell you in her visual language happened the third time that [the defendant] brought her into that southeast bedroom? She told you he molested her again. She told you that he forced her head down on his penis .... I do not have the words to describe her testimony, [but] you were here and saw. You were the witnesses to her visual language, to her looking at you and describing what she called the \u2018BJ.\u2019 When she did that, ladies and gentlemen, is she a believable, vulnerable, young deaf girl, or did you view her as a vengeful calculating person?</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">\u201cThe evidence speaks for itself. And what did she say happened when he forced her down on his penis? She said white stuff came out, and she told you here that, \u2018Well, gee, I know what it is now,\u2019 and she spelled it out. It\u2019s c-u-m. \u2018I did not know what it was then.\u2019 And what\u2019s the [corroboration] of that? Remember Leia Smith\u2019s testimony? Leia Smith from Yale, licensed clinical social worker . . . said that when this child was describing to her the forced fellatio, that the child said, \u2018white stuff came out.\u2019 Do you remember [what] Leia Smith told you she said? As Leia Smith was questioning her, the girl says, \u2018What was that stuff?\u2019 And Leia described her affect. She said she was dumbfounded. This is a trained professional social worker evaluating her. The kid was dumbfounded. Leia Smith said, \u2018Well, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>I paused. I tried to answer.\u2019 But you know, her job\u2019s to ask the questions, and she said this child was truly dumbfounded, \u2018What\u2019s that white stuff?\u2019 And, common sense, you know what the white stuff is, [and the victim] told you she now knows what it was. But on that day, and by the calendar, we know she underlined, it was in October, November or December of 2002 when he forced her head down on his penis; she didn\u2019t know what it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u201cWhat\u2019s a true test [of] credibility? It\u2019s when somebody tells something they really couldn\u2019t know or wouldn\u2019t experience from something else. Now, Leia Smith, could she fool her? Could she fool her that she\u2019s dumbfounded? Well, that\u2019s for you to decide. But think, because that wasn\u2019t the end of it. She told us she bled. She also said, \u2018Gee, there was only digital penetration the second time.\u2019 How does that all make sense? . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen, in the winter of 2002, you have a young girl in her mother\u2019s bedroom, who has been forced to commit fellatio, who for the first time experiences semen in a way that, the defense brought it out, she didn\u2019t want to learn about that stuff until she was eighteen years old. And what does she tell you she did? She tells you she went and brushed her teeth when it was over. <em>Is that something somebody would make up? </em>Is that something a kid would make up, or is that not the kind of act that, based on the evidence here, proves to you the credibility of this child, when she tells you what happened?\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">After reviewing the allegedly improper rhetorical question in the context of the final argument, we conclude that it was proper argument and that it did not amount to the prosecutor\u2019s vouching for the victim\u2019s credibility. \u201cA prosecutor may properly comment on the credibility of a witness where such comment reflects reasonable inferences from evidence adduced at trial.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>State v. Coney, </em>266 Conn. 787, 812, 835 A.2d 977 (2003). \u201cMoreover, [i]t does not follow . . . that every use of rhetorical language or device [by the prosecutor] is improper. . . . The occasional use of rhetorical devices is simply fair argument. . . . Nevertheless, the prosecutor has a heightened duty to avoid argument that strays from the evidence or diverts the jury\u2019s attention from the facts of the case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Haity, </em>supra, 99 Conn. App. 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Credibility frequently is the sole issue in cases of sexual abuse. A prosecutor may ask the jury to apply common sense and experience to determine credibility. <em>State </em>v. <em>Warholic, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 366. The question at issue was designed to prompt the jury to assess the issue of credibility that the prosecutor had presented in her opening remarks, that is, whether the victim was a vulnerable deaf child or a vengeful stepdaughter, as the defendant claimed. We conclude therefore that the prosecutor did not improperly vouch for the victim\u2019s credibility by asking the members of the jury: \u201cIs that something somebody would make up?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The defendant also claims that the prosecutor improperly elicited evidence as to whether the victim was vengeful from the social worker who interviewed her and then used that testimony in the closing argument to bolster the victim\u2019s credibility. Again, the state points out that the defendant did not object to the testimony at the time it was elicited and contends that the claim is not reviewable pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 279 Conn. 149-52. The state\u2019s argument has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">We first must determine whether the prosecutor elicited testimony from the witness that reflected on the victim\u2019s veracity. The following direct examination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Smith by the prosecutor forms the basis of the defendant\u2019s claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Now, can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, as part of your protocol, what, if anything, you\u2019re trained to do to observe to\u2014if anything\u2014to try to discern false reports?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">\u201c[The Witness]: Um, really, my training is focused on the fact-finding part of the interview and asking very open-ended questions, but in doing that I do look for consistency of what the child is telling me, if the child is able to give details. If the\u2014if the story the child is saying is coherent. Those are some things I look for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Okay. Now, in this case, can you tell us what, if any indications of vengeance you discerned] in the court of this interview?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">\u201c[The Witness]: I didn\u2019t see any vengeance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-9\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: And is that something you\u2019d be looking for if it was there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-10\">\u201c[The Witness]: I think I would be listening for that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: And, again, in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-12\">\u201c[The Witness]: I didn\u2019t hear anything or see anything like that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">We conclude that the prosecutor did not ask the witness to comment on the victim\u2019s veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-14\">\u201cA prosecutor may not ask any witness to comment on the credibility or veracity of another witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Beaulieu, </em>82 Conn. App. 856, 869, 848 A.2d 500 (2004), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 274 Conn. 471, 876 A.2d 1155 (2005). \u201cSeveral reasons underlie the prohibition on such questions. First, it is well established that determinations of credibility are for the jury, and not for witnesses. . . . Consequently, questions that ask a defendant to comment on another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>witness\u2019 veracity invade the province of the jury. . . . Moreover, [a]s a general rule, [such] questions have no probative value and are improper and argumentative because they do nothing to assist the jury in assessing witness credibility in its fact-finding mission and in determining the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u201cSecond, questions of this sort also create the risk that the jury may conclude that, in order to acquit the defendant, it must find that the witness has lied. . . . This risk is especially acute when the witness is a government agent in a criminal case. ... A witness\u2019 testimony, however, can be unconvincing or wholly or partially incorrect for a number of reasons without any deliberate misrepresentation being involved . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>259 Conn. 693, 707-708, 793 A.2d 226 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">We conclude, given the context in which the questions and answers occurred, that the prosecutor\u2019s examination of Smith was not a violation of the rule against asking a witness to comment on the credibility of another witness. The prosecutor asked the witness if she was trained to discern false reports of sexual abuse. Smith responded that her function was that of a \u201cfact finder\u201d but that she also looked for consistency in reporting and details. The prosecutor also asked Smith if, during the course of her interview with the victim, she saw signs of revenge or vengeance, as the defendant claimed. Smith testified that she did not. The question and response were predicated on Smith\u2019s role in the chain of medical treatment. Neither the question nor the answer concerned an assessment of the victim\u2019s credibility, although the jury was free to use the testimony in its assessment of the credibility issue before it\u2014whether the defendant sexually assaulted the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>or the victim falsely reported sexual abuse for reasons of vengeance, as the defendant claimed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">As we held with respect to the evidentiary issue in part I A 1, a defendant may not transmute an unpre-served evidentiary claim into one of constitutional proportions to obtain appellate review. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>supra, 99 Conn. App. 99 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The defendant\u2019s third claim of prosecutorial impropriety is that the prosecutor referred to facts outside the record to denigrate the victim\u2019s mother, who was the defendant\u2019s girlfriend, to cast him in a negative light to inflame the passions of the jury.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s claim is unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>In his brief, the defendant argued: \u201cIn her closing argument, the prosecutor referred to the testimony of Erlinda Games that the victim\u2019s mother had wanted to go to Georgia and leave the victim behind, inviting the jury to speculate as to the absence of the victim\u2019s mother at the trial: \u2018Erlinda Games told you why mom is not here.\u2019 . . . Erlinda Games had testified regarding the victim\u2019s mother, but had not stated in her testimony the specific reason for the victim\u2019s mother\u2019s absence at the trial.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">In its brief, the state brought the following testimony by Games to our attention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: After you finished at [the] Yale sexual abuse clinic, did you have another meeting in connection with this case that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: And what meeting was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">\u201c[The Witness]: I had a supervised visit between [the victim\u2019s mother] and the [victim] at the department of children and families.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-10\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Okay. And at this point, can you tell us what, if any, opportunity you had to talk with [the victim\u2019s mother]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-11\">\u201c[The Witness]: Well, I sat in for the entire visit, and I did speak with [the victim\u2019s mother].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>\u201c[The Prosecutor]: And was there a point where you called in someone else from [the] department of children and families?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">\u201c[The Witness]: I called in my supervisor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">\u201c[The Witness]: Because [the victim\u2019s mother] said she was leaving for Georgia, and she was leaving [the victim] behind.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The state also contends that the prosecutor\u2019s question concerning the whereabouts of the victim\u2019s mother has both a literal and figurative meaning. The literal meaning was that the mother had reported that she was going to go to Georgia without the victim. The figurative meaning was that she was absent from the victim\u2019s life in that she did not support her daughter when she reported the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse. In other words, the prosecutor sought to explain to the jury how difficult it was for the victim to come forward to report and testify about the defendant\u2019s abuse because her mother did not stand by her.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s argument did not incorporate facts outside the record, as the prosecutor asked the jury to draw reasonable inferences from the facts in evidence. The defendant\u2019s claim therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The defendant\u2019s last claim of prosecutorial impropriety is that the prosecutor brought to the jury\u2019s attention, both in questioning and in argument, the defendant\u2019s silence in the face of a police officer\u2019s informing him that the victim had accused him of sexual assault. The defendant\u2019s claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The state again has posited that the evidentiary portion of the defendant\u2019s claim with respect to his silence is not reviewable because he did not object to the line of questioning at trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 279 Conn. 149-52. As we did previously, we first must determine whether the claim is of constitutional magnitude or merely an evidentiary one. We conclude that the claim is of an evidentiary nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The following facts pertain to our determination. After he had spoken with the victim and Officer Brian Harte of the Ansonia police department had confirmed the substance of her claims of abuse, Officer Gerald Tenney of the Ansonia police department confronted the defendant. At the time of the confrontation, the defendant had not been apprised of his rights pursuant to <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966). Tenney testified without objection that he had questioned the defendant and had learned that the defendant had no problems with the victim and that he had been alone with her several times. When Tenney told the defendant of the victim\u2019s allegations, the defendant put his head down, did not look at Tenney and said nothing.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The prosecutor also addressed the subject of the defendant\u2019s silence on cross-examination when the defendant testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>\u201c[The Prosecutor]: And, in fact, when Officer Tenney accused you of child molestation you were silent, weren\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Now . . . you\u2019ve just been accused of molesting the person you say you considered to be your oldest daughter, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: And you\u2019re accused by a youth officer from the Ansonia police department?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: You can see where someone might expect you to say, \u2018Child molestation? No way?\u2019 You can see where somebody can expect that, wouldn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: You can see where somebody would expect you to say, \u2018My own daughter?\u2019 You can see where they\u2019d expect that, wouldn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-13\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-14\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: But your response, sir, was silence, wasn\u2019t it? Yes or no ... .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-15\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-16\">There is no dispute that the defendant was not in custody at the time of the questioning. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s claims with respect to the testimony cited are unpreserved evidentiary claims, which we will not review. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 279 Conn. 149-52. A defendant has not suffered a violation of due process at trial where his <em>pre-Miranda </em>silence is brought to the attention of the jury. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>208 Conn. 455, 466, 545 A.2d 1071 (1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1034, 109 S. Ct. 847, 102 L. Ed. 2d 979 (1989).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The defendant also argues that the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry constituted prosecutorial impropriety in violation of <em>this </em>court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>70 Conn. App. 29, 38, 797 A.2d 1 (2002) (prosecutor forced defendant to describe police witnesses as liars), rev\u2019d, 269 Conn. 563, 849 A.2d 626, after remand, 85 Conn. App. 811, 858 A.2d 876 (2004). The prosecutor in this case did not compel the defendant to call police witnesses or anyone else a liar. We also conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s examination of the defendant was unlike that of the prosecutor in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 541 n.7, 546 n.9, 547 nn. 10-12, in which the prosecutor resorted to vituperative name-calling and sarcasm.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Because the testimony concerned the defendant\u2019s silence in the face of the victim\u2019s allegations of sexual abuse, it was not improper for the prosecutor to use that evidence during final argument.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The prosecutor committed no impropriety by either inquiring into or arguing about the defendant\u2019s silence when the defendant was confronted by Tenney.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">We conclude, for all of the reasons cited, that there was no prosecutorial impropriety.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The defendant claims that the court abused its discretion by permitting a social worker to testify as to her interview with the victim under the medical treatment or advice exception to the hearsay rule embodied in \u00a7 8-3 (5) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s claim is not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>The following facts are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim. The state called Smith to testily about her interview with the victim following her physical examination. The defendant objected to Smith\u2019s testimony, claiming that she had not been disclosed as an expert witness. The prosecutor responded that Smith was not testifying as an expert but as an individual who provided medical treatment or advice to the victim. The court ruled that Smith was not testifying as an expert and that her report had been given to the defendant in a timely fashion. The defendant also objected to Smith\u2019s testimony on the basis of constancy of accusation evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Samuels, </em>273 Conn. 541, 871 A.2d 1005 (2005). The court concluded that Smith\u2019s testimony was being offered pursuant to the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule, not for constancy of accusation. The defendant did not object to Smith\u2019s testimony on the basis of the medical exception rule to the hearsay doctrine.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u201c[T]he standard for the preservation of a claim alleging an improper evidentiary ruling at trial is well settled. This court is not bound to consider claims of law not made at the trial. ... In order to preserve an eviden-tiary ruling for review, trial counsel must object properly. ... In objecting to evidence, counsel must properly articulate the basis of the objection so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>apprise the trial court of the precise nature of the objection and its real purpose, in order to form an adequate basis for a reviewable ruling. . . . Once counsel states the authority and ground of [the] objection, any appeal will be limited to the ground asserted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Calabrese, </em>supra, 279 Conn. 408 n.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The defendant did not object to Smith\u2019s testimony pursuant to the medical exception rule to the hearsay doctrine. The claim therefore is unpreserved. The defendant has not presented us with any analysis that would bring the claim within the realm of constitutional protection,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and we know of none. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>94 Conn. App. 72, 76-79, 891 A.2d 67, cert. denied, 278 Conn. 911, 899 A.2d 40 (2006). We therefore will not review the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The defendant\u2019s last claim is that the court improperly permitted the social worker to testify as to the victim\u2019s credibility. This claim is a reprise of the claim of prose-cutorial impropriety addressed in part I B 2. As noted previously, the defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s questions and did not move to strike Smith\u2019s testimony. This is an evidentiary claim that was not preserved at trial, and we therefore will not afford it review.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-10\"> The jury found the defendant not guilty of one count of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b448-11\"> Subsequent to oral argument in this court, our Supreme Court rendered its decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Fauci, </em>282 Conn. 23, 917 A.2d 978 (2007), in which it was held that the term \u201cprosecutorial impropriety\u201d is more appropriate than the traditional term \u201cprosecutorial misconduct.\u201d Id., 26 n.2.

You\u2019ve heard the evidence in this case, and now the question before you is a question of credibility. Is [the victim] a vulnerable, believable deaf child or is [the victim] a calculating, vengeful person? That\u2019s really what it comes down to after the evidence that you\u2019ve seen, the witnesses who you\u2019ve observed. You were able to see her testimony and the testimony of a number of state\u2019s witnesses, wherein she told you and related to you her victimization at the hands of the person who she called her stepfather.

A jury is presumed to follow the court\u2019s instruction unless there is a clear indication to the contrary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Negron, </em>221 Conn. 315, 331, 603 A.2d 1138 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b465-8\"> Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 67-10, the defendant indicated that <em>State </em>v. <em>Ritrovato, </em>280 Conn. 36, 905 A.2d 1079 (2006), was relevant to the issues in this appeal. We see no similarity between the issues in this case and the ones in <em>Ritrovato.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">The first issue in <em>Ritrovato </em>was whether the trial court improperly excluded evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual history that the defendant had proffered. The victim had testified on direct examination for the state that she was a virgin at the time of the defendant\u2019s sexual assault. Id., 44-50. Our Supreme Court concluded that the exclusion of the evidence in that case was a harmful <em>evidentiary error, </em>not one of constitutional magnitude. Id., 50. In this case, there is no claim that the court improperly excluded evidence offered by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">The second issue in <em>Ritrovato </em>was whether the prosecutor deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to due process by asking a counselor with Planned Parenthood of Connecticut, Inc., who had extensive experience with victims of sexual abuse, whether the victim in that case had been credible when describing the abuse she had alleged. The counselor responded, \u201c 'Oh, yes.\u2019 \u201d Id., 60 n.19. The prosecutor also made a single reference to the credibility of that testimony during closing argument to the jury. Id., 60-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">Again, we note that the prosecutor in this case did not ask any of the witnesses whether the victim was credible. The prosecutor also did not ask Smith to characterize the victim\u2019s testimony in violation of <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 702. Smith was asked whether she perceived any evidence of vengeance or revenge on the part of the victim, a question consistent with Smith\u2019s view of herself as a \u201cfact finder\u201d for purposes of medical treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b465-12\"> To place the alleged improper language in context, we quote the relevant portion of the prosecutor\u2019s final argument, which referred to Erlinda Games, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>a department employee who participated in the investigation of the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse of the victim: \u201cWas it easy for [the victim] to come in here and begin this testimony? And as you think about that, there may be another question that comes to your mind. Where\u2019s her mom? Erlinda Games told you. Erlinda Games went to court to get a neglect petition on the mom. Erlinda Games told you why mom is not here. Mom told Erlinda Games she wanted to go to Georgia and leave [the victim] behind. All of the evidence in this case\u2014[the defendant] is mom\u2019s boyfriend. [The defendant] considered himself in the role of mom\u2019s husband. So, ladies and gentlemen, common sense, common sense, where\u2019s mom? Erlinda Games told you. Mom, according to Erlinda Games, mom is ready to go without the victim.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b467-9\"> The commissioner of the department subsequently filed a neglect petition against the victim\u2019s mother with respect to the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b467-10\"> In support of the more figurative construction of the prosecutor\u2019s argument, the state has referred to the testimony of the two police officers who investigated the report of sexual abuse at the victim\u2019s home on January 17, 2003. Officer Gerald Tenney is a member of the Ansonia police department, its youth officer and a member of the Milford interdisciplinary task force on sexual assault. He received a referral from the department concerning the victim and arranged to meet Games at the victim\u2019s home to conduct an investigation. The victim\u2019s mother led the two to the victim\u2019s bedroom and told them that the victim could read lips and write answers to questions. The victim indicated to Tenney that the defendant had sexually assaulted her. During the interview, the victim asked to see her mother, who entered the room and communicated in sign language with the victim. While the victim was conversing with her mother, she was looking at Tenney and shaking her head, no. The victim\u2019s mother then told Tenney and Games that the victim\u2019s grandmother and uncle had put her up to the allegations of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">As is customary in such situations, a backup officer was sent to the victim\u2019s home during the investigation. Officer Brian Harte arrived after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Tenney\u2019s interview with the victim had begun. Coincidentally, Harte has a rudimentary knowledge of American sign language. Tenney asked Harte, therefore, to communicate with the victim to confirm or dispel what was written on a piece of paper. The victim also demonstrated physically to Harte what the defendant had done to her. As Harte was communicating with the victim, her mother entered the room and communicated in sign language to the victim. Although he could not follow the entire conversation, Harte determined that the victim and her mother disagreed. The victim indicated to Harte that she was afraid of the defendant and her mother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b469-5\"> The following exchange occurred during the prosecutor\u2019s examination of Tenney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: And can you tell us what, if anything, you said about why you were there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">\u201c[The Witness]: I asked him if he knew why we were there, and he had told me that he was told by other family members that he was supposedly sexually assaulting her, um, here at the house and at the grandmother\u2019s house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Okay, and what did you say?

Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976)], the United States Supreme Court held that the impeachment of a defendant through evidence of his silence following his arrest and receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings violates due process. The court based its holding on two considerations: First, it noted that silence in the wake of <em>Miranda </em>warnings is \u2018insolubly ambiguous\u2019 and consequently of little probative value. Second and more important, it observed that \u2018while it is true that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings contain no express assurance that silence will carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person who receives the warnings. In such circumstances, it would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.' <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 617-19. The court . . . reaffirmed <em>Doyle\u2019s </em>reasoning in <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>474 U.S. 284, 290, 106 S. Ct. 634, 88 L. Ed. 2d 623 (1986), in which it held that the defendant\u2019s silence following his arrest and receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings could not be used at trial to rebut his defense of insanity. The court reasoned: \u2018The point of the <em>Doyle </em>holding is that it is fundamentally unfair to promise an arrested person that his silence will not be used against him and thereafter to breach that promise by using the silence to impeach his trial testimony. . . .\u2019Id., 292. Consistent with this rationale, the court has concluded that use at trial of silence <em>prior </em>to the receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings does not violate due process. <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Weir, </em>455 U.S. 603, 102 S.

If you remember, he has told [Officer] Tenney, according to [Officer Tenney], \u2018no problems,\u2019 and then he comes in here and he says to you that both are correct: no problems and she\u2019s vengefully out to get him because her life is so miserably changed since three other kids came into the world. . . .
