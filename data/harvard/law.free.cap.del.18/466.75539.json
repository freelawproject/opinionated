That your petitioners are residents of New Castle Hundred, New Castle County and State of Delaware.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-10\">2. That your petitioners are and have been since the general election day in November, 1898, Road Commissioners for New Castle Hundred, New Castle County and State of Delaware.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-11\">3.

That the amount so levied, if collected, is amply sufficient to pay the amount due these relators as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-4\">10.

That your petitioners, by reason of the public necessities, are greatly embarrassed by reason of the neglect and refusal of the respondents as aforesaid, and aver that they are unable to perform their public duty and functions in connection with the public roads <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>of New Castle Hundred by reason of such neglect and refusal, and thereby a great injury and detriment has resulted to the citizens of the said hundred, and other citizens of this State, and especially to your petitioners as commissioners as aforesaid, inasmuch as thereby they have been hindered and prevented from performing the public duties by law required to be done by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-4\">Wherefobe, averring that there is no other adequate remedy in the premises, your petitioners pray this Honorable Court to issue a writ of peremptory mandamus of the State of Delaware, directed to the said The Mayor and Council of New Castle, and to the said James E. White, collector as aforesaid, commanding them and each of them as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-5\">That he, the said James E. White, collector as aforesaid, shall forthwith collect the taxes so levied and unpaid as aforesaid, and shall forthwith pay the same to the said The Mayor and Council of New Castle, and when so paid the said The Mayor and Council of New Castle may forthwith pay unto your petitioners, road commissioners as aforesaid, the said sum of six hundred dollars, together with interest thereon from the first day of November, A. D. 1898, etc.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b478-6\">Boyce, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"AyD\">This was a motion to quash the rule to show cause why a mandamus should not issue, and to dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Mandamus is a prerogative writ, and may be withheld or granted by the Court in the exercise of a reasonable discretion. If upon an application for the writ, a reasonable doubt exists, such as controls the judgment of the Court, it will be refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">In considering this application, we are confronted with a provision in the City Charter which makes the denial of the writ incumbent upon us. \u201cNo tax herein provided for shall be collected after the expiration of one year from the date of the warrant or precept for the collection of the same,\u201d is the language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>statute. And the tax for the enforcement of the collection of which the writ is sought, was levied and assessed, and the warrant for the collection of the same was delivered to the collector, more than one year ago. And it is therefore now beyond the power of the collector to collect the same by process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">There seems to be no dissent from the proposition that the law will not attempt to enforce a person to do a thing which by law it is impossible for him to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Our courts have decided that the writ will not be awarded when, if granted, it would prove nugatory and unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\n<em>Lurty vs. Hardcastle, et al., 1 Marvel, 476; McCoy, et al., vs. State ex. rel.
