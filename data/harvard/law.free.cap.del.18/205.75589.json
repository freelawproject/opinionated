Curtis, Esq.), came into Court and asked that the plaintiff be ordered to file a fuller bill of particulars, for. the following reasons: <em>First, </em>because three of the four items in the bill of particulars did not state the price or sum of money claimed for the particular items; <em>second, </em>because there were two common counts in the declaration and it did not appear to which of the said counts the bill of particulars applied, or whether it applied to <em>both; thirdt </em>because the items in the bill of particulars were not applicable to any of the counts in the declaration.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b215-7\">Lore, C.
