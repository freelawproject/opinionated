J.:\u2014Judge Spruance will announce the opinion of a majority of the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"b157-14\">Spruance, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"ARC\">The defendant, Emmet D. C. Hegeman, stands charged with violation of the act entitled \u201cAn Act to prevent tampering with legislative proceedings,\u201d passed May 13,1891.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-15\">\n<em>19 Laws of Delaware, Chap. 276.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-16\">Section 1 of this act provides, \u201c That whosoever shall wilfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>add to, alter, deface, erase, obliterate, mutilate, blot, blur, steal, hide, conceal, destroy or misplace, with intent to conceal, any bill pending before either branch of the General Assembly of this State, or any committee thereof, or any joint committee of the two Houses, shall be guilty of felony,\u201d &amp;c., and \u201c whosoever shall in like manner add to, alter, deface, erase, obliterate, mutilate, blot, blur, steal, hide, conceal, destroy, or misplace with intent to conceal, any act passed by the said General Assembly, shall be guilty of a like offense,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The indictment against the defendant contains two counts, the first of which charges that he \u201cdid, with intent to conceal, then and there unlawfully and feloniously add an endorsement to a certain bill, then and there known as Senate bill, number 62, entitled \u2018An Act Providing a Penalty for the violation of Section 17 of Article 2 of the Amended Constitution/ then and there pending before the Senate, one of the branches of the General Assembly of the State of Delaware, in the words and figures following, to wit,</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">1st Read. 2d Read.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">3-10-99</p>\n<p id=\"AKE\">Miss. Business.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Passed:</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">B. F. Sheppard,</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">3-13-99</p>\n<p id=\"ApP\">Passed:</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">B. F. Sheppard,</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">Clerk,</p>\n<p id=\"b158-14\">and did then and there and thereby commit a felony against the form of the act,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-15\">The second count differs from the first, only in the omission of the words \u201c with intent to conceal,\u201d and in the omission of the first three lines of the endorsement.'</p>\n<p id=\"b158-16\">It would be difficult to determine, in any aspect of this statute, for what purpose the words \u201c with intent to conceal \u201d were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>inserted in the first count, because there is nothing in connection with this particular class of offenses\u2014adding something to a bill \u2014which is in the nature of a concealment. Under the statute it is an offense to conceal a bill, or to misplace a bill with intent to conceal, but concealment has no proper application to the act charged, viz., adding an endorsement to a bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">It is a well settled rule that penal statutes are to be construed strictly. We must look to the statute to find out whether the offense charged is within the terms of .the statute, and if it is not, the prisoner cannot be tried under this indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Is the adding an endorsement to a bill, of the character specified in the indictment, one of the offenses enumerated in the act?</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">If it is so it must be because it is an addition to, or an alteration of a bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Our first inquiry must be, what is a bill? Webster\u2019s definition is, \u201cA form or draft of a law, presented to a legislature, but not enacted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Under our Constitution, after a bill has past both branches of the Legislature and received the approval of the Governor, it becomes a law j but until then, it is a bill\u2014a draft of a proposed law. This bill was precisely the same draft of a' proposed law, after, as before these endorsements were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">Indeed it is not charged in the indictment, that the bill was altered or that anything was added to the body of the bill, but that certain endorsements were added to the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">Were the endorsements set forth in the indictment or either of them, part of the bill ? The majority of the Court think they are not. The presence or absence of these endorsements, their truth or their falsity, did not make the bill in any respect different from what it was when it was first presented to the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">The Attorney-General furnished us with a very apt and appropriate definition when he said <em>\u201c </em>that endorsements on a bill are the minutes of the stages of its progress through the Legislature.\u201d Such endorsements are usually put on the back of a bill for con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>venience and identification, but fuller minutes of the progress of a bill are to be found in the journals. Would anyone contend that the journals of the respective Houses, as to the progress of the bill in its various stages, through the Houses, were parts of the bill, or that under this statute a man could be indicted for altering or adding to such journals ? Certainly not.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">We therefore hold that the offense charged is not within the provisions of the said statute, and that the indictment is insufficient and should be quashed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">Boyce, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b160-12\">Lobe, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ae\">(dissenting):\u2014What constitutes a bill depends in my judgment upon its condition at the particular time referred to.' A bill as originally introduced is subject to modification. Under legislative rules, and practice, while a bill is pending, it is added to by amendments and endorsements, from time to time, changing its meaning and showing its progress; when so added such amendments and endorsements become a part of that bill, each adding to its completion up to a certain point.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-15\">It is unquestionably true that the original draft is a bill when first introduced, then consisting of the paper on which it is written, and the writing itself, which includes the title and the text.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-16\">It is equally true that in its progress through the Legislature amendments are added, and when so added, whether written upon, attached to, or loosely placed within the original draft, they become a part of the bill at that stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-19\">In like manner, at every stage of its progress, under legislative rules and practice, there are added to the bill endorsements which show its condition from time to time, and constitute the original record of such progress. When so endorsed they become a part of the bill at each successive stage. Then the original bill, with such amendment and endorsements, is signed by the Speakers, and goes to the committee on enrollment and is the original record on which that committee acts and to which they refer, seeking cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>roboration only from the journal if any question be raised, the journals being secondary and usually made up from such endorsements.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The original form or draft of a law as presented to the Legislature may be so changed by amendments and endorsements during its pendency, as to retain scarcely a trace of the original draft. It is manifest, therefore, that the definition of a bill may not be confined to the original form or draft submitted to the Legislature; but relates to its condition at each and every specific time while it is pending before the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The very act under which this indictment is found uses this language: \u201cA bill, within the meaning of this act, shall be taken as pending from the time of its introduction until enrolled and signed by the Speakers of both Houses. It shall then be taken as and for an act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The very language of the act, therefore, contemplates the condition of the bill at every stage of its progress from its <em>\u201cintroduction\u201d </em>until it is \u201c enrolled and signed,\u201d and expressly covers its condition during all of that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The act says that \u201c whoever shall add to \u201d * * * \u201c any bill pending before either branch of the General Assembly of this State, or any committee thereof, or any joint committee of the two Houses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">This indictment, framed under the act, charges that the defendant \u201cdid unlawfully and feloniously add an endorsement to bill Ho. 62,\u201d etc. It charges that the defendant did add to a bill, and sets out specifically what was added, namely, an endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">It would seem, therefore, that the indictment is good, and that the offense therein properly and clearly charged is within the terms of the statute; unless we hold that the concrete word <em>bill </em>should be divided up into its several component parts of paper, writing, title, original draft, amendments, endorsements and signature, and that each must be separately mentioned in the statute defining the offense; in other words, that while the whole necessarily includes the parts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>yet that an indictment is not good unless the statute specifically sets out the respective parts. This surely is not tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The offense charged in this indictment, that is of making a false endorsement on the paper, so as to indicate that it had passed the Legislature, when in fact it had not so passed; is clearly within the evil sought to be remedied by the act of May 13, 1891, which is entitled <em>\u201c </em>An act to prevent tampering with legislative proceedings.\u201d It would also seem to be clearly within the language of that act under any fair and reasonable interpretation thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">While I endorse most heartily the well settled principle that penal statutes are to be construed strictly with all reasonable intendments in favor of the accused; I am not inclined to such a strict construction as to narrow a word which is concrete in its significance to one particular and separate part or phase of its meaning. It should be so construed as to embrace all its parts, and show actual conditions at the precise time of the alleged offense. Any other rule of construction would amount to judicial annulment of law, and give immunity to crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-14\">I am clearly of the opinion that the indictment is good and that the offense as charged in the indictment is within the terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-15\">A majority of the Court, however, think otherwise, and in pursuance of their judgment it is ordered that the indictment be quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
