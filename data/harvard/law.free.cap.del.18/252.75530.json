The first part of the said section provides that <em>no new charters </em>shall be granted, and <em>no old charters </em>be amended, renewed or revived, except by general law. It refers solely and exclusively to new corporations, or to old existing corporations to be amended, renewed or revived. It has nothing whatever to do or to say regarding old corporations <em>not amended, renewed or revived </em>under such general law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-7\"><em>(b) </em>That the said constitutional provision relative to forfeiture of charters, can by its plain words and intendment relate only to the forfeiture of charters <em>really granted </em>and not to cases where no charter ever existed. In the case before you, the information states that \u201cthey\u201d (the defendants) \u201cwithout lawful authority, and without any warrant, grant or charter, usurp, etc..\u2019\u2019 Thus it will be seen that so far as now appears to the Court, <em>these proceedings are not for the forfeiture of any charter, </em>but to oust individuals who pretend a charter never really in existence. The constitutional provision in question certainly does not cover such a case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-8\">(c) That even if both of the above propositions are incorrect, the General Assembly having failed to carry out the constitutional provision in question, so far as relates to old existing charters, not amended, renewed or revived under the general law, the old com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>mon law and the old statutes in this State continue in full and unimpaired force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-6\"><em>Section 18 of the Schedule, of the amended </em>Constitution, <em>p. 54, </em>provides that:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-7\">\u201c All the laws of this State existing at the time this Constitution shall take effect, and not inconsistent with it, shall remain in force, except so far as they shall be altered by future laws.\u201d This section, the fruit of an abundant caution on the part of our constitution framers, expressly continued the old common law and the old statute relating to informations before adverted to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AMA\"><em>(d) </em>That the constitutional provision in question relating to the forfeiture of charters is not self-operative or <em>self-executing ; </em>that it does not go into effect <em>proprio vigore, </em>but that it is simply addressed to the conscience of the Legislature.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-10\">The contention that said constitutional provision <em>ipso facto or per se repeals </em>the old common law and the old statute of this State regarding informations, must of necessity be based upon the claim that it is itself an existing law, not dependent upon legislative enactment. That this is not the law will be clearly seen from the following cases and authorities :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-11\"><em>Cooley\u2019s Constitutional Limitations, 98; A. &amp; E.

This supplementary act was passed May 25, 1897.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-7\">In the first place it must be noted that the pleas of defendants do not allege any acceptance of said act or any organization under it. The plea recites it by its title, but this is all. Even further than this the plea undertakes to set up an organization which must have taken place under the original act because it states that one hundred shares of stock were subscribed. This amount of subscription was all that was required under the original act, but under the supplementary act, Section 2, it is provided \u201cthat before any organization shall be effected as is provided by Section 2 of said original act, at least ten thousand dollars of the capital stock subscriptions therein authorized shall be fully paid in cash.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-8\">If defendants based their claim to exist by <em>merger </em>on this supplementary act, this subscription payment must have been averred, just as they did aver the payment of the amount required by the charter of the Dover and Bay Shore Company. If therefore, their title is through this supplementary act, their plea is bad, and if through the original act, it is still bad for the reasons foregoing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-9\">On examining the provisions of this supplementary act, however, it is apparent that the General Assembly of 1897, considered that no corporation ever had come into existence under the original act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-10\">It is plain from this provision that in the legislative mind no organization under the first act had ever taken place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-11\">If this be not sufficiently plain, however, Section 1, of the supplement' conclusively shows that any corporate existence under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the original act had then become extinct, because in that section the commencement of the construction of the railway is now fixed within six months of its enactment. This being more than six months after the date of the passage of the original shows that the railway had certainly not commenced within the time fixed by said original act, and therefore any supposed corporate existence must have <em>ipso facto </em>terminated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-5\">Bearing this fact in mind, consider <em>Section 1 of Article 9 of the amended Constitution </em>which provides that, \u201c No corporation shall be created, amended, renewed or revived by special act, but only by or under general law,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-6\">This constitutional provision was in full force and operation from the tenth day of June, 1897.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-7\">If then this Dover and Bay Shore Company never was created a corporation until November 4, 1897, and if its supposed creation was then effected by force and virtue of the special act referred to in the plea, is not this in direct violation of the constitutional provision just quoted ? Can any amount of ingenuity make it otherwise ? See the following cases exactly in point: <em>State ex rel.

If the question is to be passed upon by this Court, it can be raised in a subsequent proceeding. It is a very interesting question, and, from our investigation so far, a very nice question.

That the Dover and Milford and the Dover and Bay Shore Railway Companies were not organized (and therefore not created) until after the tenth of June, 1897, (the date of going into effect of the amended </em>Constitution) <em>and that therefore such creation was contrary to Section 1, Article 9, of said Constitution.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"194\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-7\">\n<em>II. That the alleged consolidation by which the Delaware Electrie Railway Company came into bei/ng, took place after said tenth of June, 1897; that the effect of this consolidation was the creation of a new corporation contrary to said constitutional provision ?</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"195\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-11\">\n<em>III. That neither of said two original companies had any power or authority to consolidate one with the other ; and that even if any such power or authority ever did exist, it was taken away by said constitutional provision.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"196\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-12\">Section 1, Article 9, is as follows: '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"197\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-13\"><em>\u201c </em>No corporation shall hereafter be created, amended, renewed or revived by special act, but only by or under general law, etc.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"198\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-14\">It will probably be contended that the true intendment of the provision is a restriction upon the Legislature merely; and that its meaning is\u2014no legislature shall <em>hereafter </em>pass any special act conferring corporate privileges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"199\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-15\">In reply, it is submitted, that such is not the language nor the words of said section.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"200\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number><em>Cooley\u2019s Constitutional limitations, (6th Edition), page 71, </em>and cases cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"201\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-5\">If then our contention be correct, and the inhibition in said section is against the creation of corporations except only by or under general law, let us consider the first point made on page 1 of this brief, namely:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"202\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-6\"><em>I. Thai the Dover and Milford and the Dover and Bay Shore Railway Companies were not organized (and therefore not </em>created) <em>until after June 10,1897, and that therefore such creation was contrary to Section 1, Article 9, of the amended Constitution.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"203\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-7\">The plea shows that the said two companies did not pretend to organize until after June 10, 1897, and it also shows that such pretended organization did not take place by or under general law. Now our contention is, that the organization is the creation of the corporation, and hence there was the creation of the corporation not by or under general law, after the adoption of the amended Constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"204\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-8\">It is submitted that the underlying principles in regard to corporate charters, are precisely those which govern private contracts in the ordinary affairs of life. The law governing corporate charters, so far as the State and the corporation are concerned, is not peculiar and to itself. It is simply the law governing ordinary contracts, laid down so often, and so firmly established by the Courts of this State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"205\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-9\">This was the whole and sole substance of the decision in the Dartmouth College case,\u2014the fountain head of American law upon this subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"206\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-10\">By <em>Sections 1 and 2 of Chapter 85, Vol. 20 Del.

The power attempted to be conferred is only to \u201c companies desiring to consolidate.\u201d Now the plea shows that the Dover and Bay Shore Company could not have accepted this amendatory power of consolidation until November, 1897, because until then it had no legal corporate existence. It follows then that this Dover and Bay Shore Railway Company attempted to amend its charter after June 10, 1897, contrary to <em>Section 1, Article 9 of the amended Constitution.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"238\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-6\">But it may be said that the power to consolidate expressed in the charter of the Dover and Milford Ry.

D. 1897, at which time the new Constitution of the State went into effect, and as therefore being prohibited by <em>Section 1, Article 9, of that Constitution, </em>which provides that \u201cNo corporation shall be hereafter created, amended, renewed or revived by special act, but only by or under general law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"246\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-6\">It is submitted that such was not the intention of the framers of the Constitution, and that the provision in question has no application.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"247\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-7\">It is a fundamental principle of the law of corporations, growing out of the nature of the corporation itself, which has been defined to be a portion of the royal prerogative in the hands of a subject, that by the common law a corporation could not be created without the king\u2019s consent, in other words, the consent of the sovereign power, a portion of which was thus delegated to the citizen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"248\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-8\">\n<em>2 Blackstone\u2019s Com., 472, et seq.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"249\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-9\">So in this country it has uniformly been held that a corporation can only be created by the legislature, in which, subject to constitutional restriction, all of the sovereign legislative power of the people is vested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"250\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-10\">\n<em>Thompson on Corporations, Secs. 35, 219, 315.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"251\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-11\">That the Legislature cannot delegate its power except where and when authorized by the Constitution of the State, is established in this State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"252\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-12\">\n<em>Rice vs. Foster, 4 Harr., 479.

Ency. of Law {2nd </em>Edition), <em>933, 934, </em>and cases in notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"257\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AMm\">When, therefore, the Constitution of the State provided <em>(Article 2, Section </em>1) that \u201c the legislative power of this State shall be vested in a General Assembly, which shall consist,\u201d etc., it gave to that General Assembly full legislative power, excepting as therein or otherwise restrained. It follows of necessity therefore that any provisions in our Constitution prescribing what may not be done by the Legislature, are to be construed as limitations upon this supreme legislative power, and can only be construed as such limitations from the very necessity of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"258\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ApF\">It cannot be doubted, therefore, that previous to the tenth day of June, A. D., 1897, the Legislature of the State of Delaware had the right and ample power to provide that the Dover and Milford Railway Company should have among the other powers given to it <em>at the time of its creation </em>the power to merge with any other corporation, and the power in such other corporation to merge with it. It will be remembered that this act was re-enacted on the twenty-sixth day of May, A. D. <em>1897.\u2014(Volume 20, Delaware Laws, 581). </em>So far then as legislative sanction was required for the consolidation \u2014and it is not denied that such sanction is necessary\u2014the Legislature had given it, had done everything which the Legislature could do, or was called upon to do, previous to the tenth day of June, A. D. 1897. It must therefore be manifest that the right to consolidate already existing, requiring no further action by the Legislature by way of creation, amendment, renewal or revival, cannot be affected by a constitutional limitation upon future action by the Legislature.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"259\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>It is said, however, that by consolidation a new corporation is formed having the franchises of the old corporations, and that the old corporations are extinct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"260\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\">It is submitted that this is in no sense the \u201c creation \u201d of a new corporation, as contemplated by the Constitution. <em>No legislative sanction was necessary ; the creative power was not called upon to create or recreate anything. </em>It was simply, to use the language of some of the cases, the flowing together of two streams, and the formation thereby of a stream composed of both.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"261\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">\n<em>Thompson on Corporations, Secs. 400, 8241.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"262\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-7\">As said by the Court in <em>Rice vs. Foster, supra page 491, \u201cA </em>law when passed by the Legislature is a complete, positive and absolute law in itself; deriving its authority from the Legislature, and not depending for the enactment of its provisions upon any other tribunal, body or persons.

Previous to its adoption corporations had been created, their charters amended, renewed and revived by special act. No corporation had ever created, amended, renewed or revived itself or any other corporation. There was no abuse of the latter kind to be remedied, and certainly no necessity for a constitutional provision to prohibit that which could not have been done theretofore or thereafter by any possibility. The evil to be remedied in the opinion of the framers of the Constitution was an evil theretofore existing, namely, the creation, etc., of corporations by the Legislature under special act.

J.:</author>\n<p id=\"AAJ5\">The main question raised by this demurrer, is whether the \u201c Delaware Electric Railway Co.,\u201d was organized and created in violation of <em>Section 1, Article 9, of the </em>Constitution, promulgated June 10, 1897; which provides that, \u201c No corporation shall hereafter be created, renewed or revived, by special act, but only by or under general law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">It is conceded that the Delaware Electric Railway Company, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>was formed by the union of the Dover and Milford Eailway Company, and the Dover and Bay Shore Eailway Company, under the terms of their special acts of <em>incorporation; </em>which acts were passed before June 10, 1897, and were in force at that date; but that all of the said corporations have been organized since that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Was such organization within the inhibition of the Constitution ?</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">This question was raised in the former argument in this case, and has been quite fully discussed in the argument just closed. After such examination and thought as we have been enabled to give to this subject in the short intervening time, we have reached the conclusion that such organization and creation is not within the constitutional inhibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Neither the reasoning nor the conclusions in the case of the <em>State vs. Dawson, 16 Ind., 40, </em>commend themselves to our judgment. The case bears upon its face, evidence of an effort to meet, what the Court designates as \u201c the policy that induced the prohibition.\u201d What that policy may have been does not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">The reasoning in the case of the <em>State vs. Roosa, 11 Ohio, 16, </em>which seems to differ from the Indiana case but little in principle but somewhat in the language of the respective constitutions, is much more satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">To adopt the construction of our Constitution asked for by the State would be to annul every living charter upon our statute books, which had been passed June 10, 1897, but under which no corporation had been had at that time; and that too by implication, in the absence of any express language to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Such a construction, again, is met by the well settled legal principle, that retroactive effect will never be given to any law unless such intent be clearly expressed. This doctrine has been again and again announced in our own courts. Such construction will not be given, in the language of <em>5 Hill, 221, </em>\u201cUnless in the latest act is plainly indicated an intention to abrogate it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Again, \u201c If the acts may well subsist together, the prior act is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>not repealed.\u201d Is it in anywise shown to the satisfaction of the Court in this case, that these prior charters with all their privileges, \u201cmay not well subsist\u201d with the provisions of <em>Section 1, Article 9 of the Constitution. </em>We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">For these and other reasons which we deem not necessary to specify, we conclude that the organization and creation of this company, as disclosed upon the plea in this case, is not within the inhibition of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">We have heretofore passed upon the power and authority of these two corporations to merge; and see no reason to reverse our ruling on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The demurrer is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The counsel for the State filed replications to defendant\u2019s pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">The defendants thereupon joined issue and the further hearing of the case was postponed on the application of the State until December 18th, on the ground of the absence of a material witness for the State. Mr. Hilles, on behalf of the defendants, on the above mentioned date asked leave to amend his pleas by inserting in place of the word \u201c first \u201d (being the last word of the fourteenth line on page 3 thereof) the word \u201c fourthso that that part of the plea would allege that 100 shares of the capital stock of the Dover and Milford Railway Company had been subscribed and ten thousand dollars had been paid in cash \u201c on or before the <em>first </em>day of November, A. D. 1897.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">Counsel for the State opposed the amendment at this stage of the proceedings and claimed that if allowed it should be on terms</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Lore, C. J.:\u2014We will allow the amendment and without terms. Wherever the date the \u201c first \u201d of November appears let it be changed to \u201c fourth \u201d of November, in both the pleas and the replications.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">How will you have the issues tried ?</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number><em>Mr. </em>Hilles:\u2014We would like to have a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Lore, C. J.:\u2014At the request of counsel for the respondent it is ordered by the Court that the issues of fact raised by the pleadings in this case be tried by a jury at the bar of this county.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\"><em>Mr. </em>Hilles:\u2014The burden being upon us, as I understand, to show the corporation, I take it we should open and close to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Lore, C. J.:\u2014You justify under a charter. The burden is upon you.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">During the progress of the trial the following questions were objected to and ruled upon :</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\"><em>Mr. Hilles </em>asked the witness John D. Hawkins, whether any money was paid in his presence at the meeting of the commissioners held in the witness\u2019 office on June 1, 1897, as subscription to the capital stock of the Dover and Milford Railway Company, and if so, how much.\u2014Objected to by counsel for the State on the ground that the commissioners themselves are the ones who should be called to prove that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Lore, C. J.:\u2014We think this is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">A. Yes sir, there were at that meeting two subscribers to the capital stock. One was Joseph Raspin and the other was myself. The other company having failed of its purpose on account of there being no payment on its capital stock, I prepared myself that day before the meeting to pay it in.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">Q. What did you do in pursuance of that preparation ?</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">Objected to by counsel for the State on the ground that if there is a book kept, the book is the best evidence of the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>of money, and the testimony sought to be introduced would be but secondary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Lobe, C. J.:\u2014The production of books is one mode of proving it; this is another.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">A. It was either ten thousand dollars or ten thousand five hundred dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Q,. On the bottom of the loose page which is in evidence, I notice a pencil memorandam,\u2014in whose handwriting is that memorandum ?</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">A. That is in my handwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Q. When was that made ?</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">A. On the afternoon of the day of the meeting of the commissioners\u2014sometimes here called incorporators.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">Q. What number of shares of stock of the Dover and Milford Railway Company had been subscribed for as appears on that subscription list ?</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">Objected to by counsel for State as not the best <em>evidence; </em>that the books admitted in evidence show the amount of the subscription to be one hundred shares and the defendants are seeking to vary that by paroi <em>testimony.\u2014Cook on </em>Corporations, <em>Vol. 1, Sec. 65.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">Lobe, C. J.:\u2014We understand that the defendants propose now to show by paroi testimony an additional subscription necessary to cover the $10,000 required by the act to be paid in before organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\"><em>Mr. </em>Hilhs:\u2014We propose to prove that there was a mistake in putting down the subscription for one hundred shares of stock,</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>when as a matter of fact two hundred shares of stock were subscribed and paid for.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Lobe, C. J.:\u2014We understand the proposition of the defendant is to prove by paroi evidence that there were enough shares of stock subscribed to cover this ten thousand dollar payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">You will notice that the first section of the act of 1895 provides for a suitable book for the subscriptions to the capital stock of the Dover and Milford Railway Company. That necessarily contemplates that those subscriptions shall be in a book provided for that purpose and of necessity the subscriptions must be in writing. In Section 2 of the act renewing the charter is this language : \u201c that before any organization shall be effected as provided by the second section of the original act\u201d (that is, the act of 1895), \u201cat least $10,000 of the capital stock subscriptions therein authorized shall be fully paid in cash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Our judgment is that this $10,000 must be paid upon subscriptions of the capital stock therein authorized and that these subscriptions must be made in the manner prescribed by the charter, in a subscription book for that purpose. You have produced here the subscription book, or what purports to be the same, and it shows upon its face signed by the parties who made them, subscriptions for 100 shares which at the par value of $50 per share would amount to $5000. You seek to vary that and establish by paroi that that is a mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">That is open to two objections: It is attempting to prove a part of the subscriptions to the capital stock of this corporation by paroi, when the charter prescribes that it shall be subscribed in a book for that purpose. The second objection is that you are seeking to vary written statements over the signatures of these respective parties by paroi testimony. We do not think it is permissible. There must be in writing upon the book (or something equivalent to it) sufficient to have enabled the defendants to have paid on those subscriptions ten thousand dollars prior to the organization. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>do not mean any particular book but it must be in writing,\u2014something coming within the provisions of the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Counsel for defendants thereupon stated that as it would be useless, under the ruling of the Court, to put in the remainder of their testimony, they would press the case no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\"><em>Edward </em>Ridgely:\u2014I now move the Court to instruct the jury to bring in a verdict for the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Lobe, C. J.:\u2014Gentlemen of the jury: Under the rulings of the Court and statements made by counsel for the respondents in this case, we instruct you that you are to return your verdict for the State of Delaware, at the relation of the Attorney-General in this case. You can only render a verdict for nominal damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Verdict for the State for six cents and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Whereupon the Court rendered the following judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-11\">\u201cAnd now to wit, this eighteenth day of December, A.
