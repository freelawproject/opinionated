At the trial the State proved that on the evening of January 4,1900, one John W. Ennis, while paying some money to a colored man in a store in Clayton, laid upon a safe in said store seventeen dollars in paper money, that he had no recollection of picking said money up, and on the following morning found it was not in his pocketbook where he had been keeping the same. That there were ten or twelve men in the store at the time, the defendant being among the number. That owing to information which he received he asked the defendant for the money, but was told by the latter that he did not have the same. The witness, Wells, who was a clerk in the store, testified that while he and the defendant were alone in the store, later in the same evening that the money was lost, he saw Stevens stoop and pick up something <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>near the safe, putting it in his inside pocket. That he could not say what it was, but that it was green and white. That he asked Stevens whether it was a one or a five and that Stevens said \u201cI don\u2019t know; I have not looked at it,\u201d and in the course of a subsequent conversation said: \u201cIf it is Jim Saxson\u2019s, he will get it; if not, the man who gets it will have it to prove.\u201d That the defendant later said to witness, \u201cDon\u2019t you go around and blab it to Jim \u201d (meaning Mr. Saxon, the proprietor of the store).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-5\">The defendant denied finding any money, and also denied having the conversation testified to by Wells.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b495-6\">Lore, C.

Y.), 94. People vs. Anderson, 14 Johns (N. Y.), 294; Reg. vs. Preston, 5 Cox Crim. Cases, 390; State vs. Roper, 3 Devereux (N.

But not every one who finds and keeps goods that are lost or laid down is innocent. The general rule governing such cases is this: if the finder knows who the owner of the lost chattel is, from any -marks upon it, or if from the circumstances under which it was found, the owner could have reasonably been ascertained, then the fraudulent conversion to the finder\u2019s use is sufficient evidence to justify the jury in finding a felonious intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">Should it be found, therefore, when a person picks up goods that have been laid down or lost, that he conceals them, that at the time he discloses a knowledge of the owner, and states that if they were the goods of a certain one, he would give them to him, and if they were the goods of anyone else they would have to prove it \u2014if it should be found that the articles so found when asked for were not disclosed, but concealed, and that the party taking the goods is actually talking to the owner of them and denies the possession of the goods, we charge you that in such a case it would not be a case of ordinary finding, but you should take into consideration all such circumstances attending the finding of the goods and say whether or not at the time of the alleged finding he intended to convert them to his own use. Such circumstances would be evidence from which you might reasonably infer felonious intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>The rule is well stated in <em>3 Greenleaf on Evidence, Sec. 159, </em>as follows: \u201cIf the finder knows who is the owner of the lost chattel, or if, from any mark upon it, or from the circumstances under which it was found, the owner could reasonably have been ascertained, then the fraudulent conversion of it to the finder\u2019s use is sufficient evidence to justify the jury in finding the felonious intent constituting a larceny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">You must determine from the evidence in this case whether this was an innocent taking of the goods; a finding of the same without any reasonable means of knowing the owner and under circumstances such as would not amount to a felonious taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Verdict, not guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
