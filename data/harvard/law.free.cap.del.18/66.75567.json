In the case of <em>Coyle vs. McIntyre, </em>7 <em>Houst., 44, </em>it was decided that a municipal corporation may be controlled and its constitution altered and amended by the government in such manner as the public interest may require, and that such legislative interference cannot be said to impair the contract by which the corporation was formed because there is in reality but one party to it; and that there is in fact no contract in any just sense of the word for the reason that public municipal corporations are not founded on contract. In view of such decision it is difficult to see how the consent of the city to an amendment to the charter could be of any consequence; such consent is not material.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b74-9\">2. In general, but not uniformly, it has been held that where the duty of control over the streets is imposed upon a municipal corporation, there is an implied liability arising from default in the performance of such duty. Such has been the construction given by the courts of this State to the charter of the City of Wilming<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>ton prior to the act of April 24, 1889. But if the statute either expressly or by necessary intendment, enacts that the corporation shall not be subject to liability, there is an end of the matter. The power to alter, modify or take away the liability of municipal corporations for injuries sustained from defective streets and sidewalks has been frequently exercised by State legislatures and sustained by courts.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b75-5\">3. There is no principle of constitutional law which prohibits the Legislature from granting to a city special privileges 'and immunities not enjoyed by all other cities in the State.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b75-6\">4. While the maxim, \u201c That where there is a wrong there is a remedy,\u201d is in general true, it is subject to qualifications and exceptions. If injuries have been sustained by reason of defective footways in a city, the party injured has no vested right to sue the city. The liability of the city arises not from any implied contract between the city and the person injured, but in the absence of statutory exemption, is implied by law from the duty imposed upon the city.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b75-7\">5. The act of April 24, 1889, is valid and constitutional in so far as it relieves the city of liability, even though that part of the act should be unconstitutional which purports to make property owners responsible for damages resulting from the defective condition of footways.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b75-8\">6.

Ewing and Sydney E. Ewing, his wife, against <em>\u2018 </em>The Mayor and Council of Wilmington,\u2019 to recover damages alleged to have been received by Sydney E. Ewing on the night of the eighteenth day of October, 1894, by stepping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>into an opening in the gutter-plate, which extended over a gutter in the sidewalk or pavement on the north side of West Ninth street, between Shipley and Orange streets, which opening existed, and was allowed to continue by reason of the negligence of the defendant. The plaintiffs contend, that there was across the pavement located on the north side of West Ninth street between Shipley and Orange streets, a gutter extending from the building to the curbstone on the street twelve feet in length, five and three-quarter inches wide and four inches deep, square in the bottom, which was covered by an iron gutter-plate being in two pieces and joining together about the centre of the pavement; that several inches of the gutter-plate next to the house, and a small piece next to the curbstone were broken off. That in the exercise of due care and diligence the said Sydney E. Ewing with her friend, Mrs. Dora Schultz, shortly after ten o'clock on the night of the eighteenth day of October, 1896, were walking over the said pavement, crossed by said gutter; that the night was dark, and no light sufficient to show an obstruction existing on said pavement, and while so passing over the same, the said Sydney E. Ewing stepped into an opening made by the slipping or sliding apart of the two sections of said gutter-plate, midway of said <em>pavement; </em>that the heel of her shoe passed through the opening made by the separation of the gutter-plates, into the gutter, some four inches deep, and thereby she sustained not only immediate, but permanent injuries of such a nature and character as to seriously affect her for life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\"><em>\u201c </em>It is contended on the part of the defendants, that there was no dangerous obstruction existing over said pavement by reason of said gutter-plate placed across said gutter and that if such existed, it was not occasioned by their fault or negligence. Defendants further contend that they are not responsible or liable for any injury that may occur to persons passing over the footways fronting the property .of private individuals, but that the owner is wholly responsible under the provisions of an act of Assembly passed the 24th of April, 1889, for any damage that may result to any per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>son by reason of any hole, excavation or obstruction in or upon such footway, or from any defective condition of such footway; provided such defects are not caused by the city or its authorized agents. The defendants contend that any defects that existed were not caused by it or its authorized agents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">\u201cHaving thus briefly stated the grounds upon which the plaintiffs claim a verdict at your hands, and the reason upon which the defendants claim there is no right of recovery, we now proceed to charge you as to the law which we think applies to this case, and to the law as laid down, you are to apply the facts, which it is your sole province to decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">\u201c The law in this State relative to the liability of a municipal corporation, such as the defendants in this case, with reference to negligence, by which an injury may occur, is so well settled that it !s hardly worth while to refer to the adjudicated cases, and I will only state the results. \u2019 Tis the duty of the Street and Sewer Department acting under such corporation, having entire jurisdiction and control within the limits of said city of the streets, squares, lanes, walks, or alleys thereof, (said jurisdiction and control to extend <em>\u2018 </em>from building line to building line \u2019) to keep the same in good repair and condition. They are bound to exercise due care and diligence that no dangerous holes, obstructions, or anything which may cause injury to persons, shall exist in the streets, pavements, lanes, or footways where the public have a right to travel night or day. They are not bound for any injury accruing from the act of God, as washouts from sudden storms; provided they have a reasonable time to repair, but if after a reasonable time and notice, they neglect, they are liable, and should a defect exist constituting danger in any street, footway, etc., and the same be not repaired in a reasonable time, the law presumes notice and the corporation would be liable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">\u201c Notice may be actual, as where it is by word or writing, of a dangerous place or obstruction in the streets, footways, etc., given to the corporation; or it may be constructive, as where a defect exists for an unreasonable time, it being the duty of the corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>to look after defects and remedy the same, it is presumed to know if such exist. The length of time to repair defects in streets, sidewalks, etc., would depend upon the extent of work to be done, but in one of our decisions two months is mentioned. The city is bound to keep in good and safe order and repair, the streets, sidewalks, etc., so that they may be reasonably safe for all persons to pass and repass, day or night. \u25a0 The city under its charter having assumed the duties and liabilities therein imposed, our courts by a long line of uniform decisions have clearly defined what those duties and Habilites are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">\u201c Having thus stated the law it becomes our duty to state to you what facts must be proved to your satisfaction by a preponderance of proof to enable the plaintiffs to recover.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\"><em>\u201c </em>You must be satisfied, that the injury occurred within this city on a pavement or footway in said city on which persons regularly pass at the time of injury, and was used as a public foot-way. That the said Sydney E. Ewing was using due care and diligence in passing over said footway. That the gutter-plate from default of proper fastening on the gutter, or from bad construction of the gutter, or want of repair, was dangerous in its character, and so remained for some two months, that the injuries complained of were the necessary consequences resulting from stepping into the opening occasioned by the separating of the sections of said gutter-plate, and that the said Sydney E. Ewing was, by stepping between said sections of said gutter-plate, hurt and injured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-7\">\u201c If, gentlemen, these facts be satisfactorily proved from the evidence produced in this case, your verdict should be for the plaintiff, inasmuch as it establishes a clear case of negligence on the part of the city as the decisions in our State clearly establish; but should you be satisfied from the evidence that Sydney E. Ewing was not using due care and diligence, recklessly and carelessly without proper caution, stepped in the opening between the said gutter-plates, she was guilty of contributory negligence and has no right to recover, it matters not as to the nature or character of the place. Again, if there was no dangerous place in the footway, if the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>plainant suffered no injury, your verdict should be for the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">\u201cWe must say to you in this connection, as to diligence and care in day time and night, the person is ever bound to use all necessary care and precaution to avoid danger, but in passing over your streets and sidewalks at night, he has a right to presume there are no hidden or secret dangers, and that streets or passages or foot-ways without warning may be traversed safely, and should one in the night step into a hole carelessly existing from want of diligence on the part of the city, the city would be liable, though such a danger existing in the day time one could see, and running into it would be contributory negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">\u201cWe have, thus far, gentlemen, spoken of the liabilities of the city corporation, with reference to the law heretofore as laid down by the decisions of our State courts, which as I have stated are uniform and agree with, in the main, the English and American decisions throughout this country, but we have come now to one other defence made in this case, arising by reason of a statute recently passed by the Legislature of our State, 24th of April, 1889. This statute did not exist, and has originated since the decisions have been made, defining the liabilities of the city by reason of certain injuries caused to persons by reason of city\u2019s negligence, as laid down by the courts. The defence contend that admitting all liabilities as laid down by the courts heretofore as to city in cases of negligence charged, it amounts to nothing, inasmuch as the recent act of the Legislature changes the liability of the municipal corporation of the city of Wilmington, and shifts from it all liability for damages occurring in cases mentioned in said act, on the owners of the premises fronting the place Where injury occurred. In other words, the defence say, and contend, that the meaning of said act is, that the said act has by its terms, meaning and effect, relieved the city from all damages to which it was admitted the city was heretofore liable, and placed the same upon the owner of the premises or property fronting upon any footway, etc., where injury has occurred. I think I have fairly stated the defence. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>plaintiffs say this law or amendment to charter, is unconstitutional, utterly in derogation of the powers conferred by charter of city and subversive of the imposition and liabilities imposed by charter. In order to determine this matter we must consider this act\u2014though the clause upon which defence relies appears to be inserted in another act, which in its meaning as to the clause relied on has no connection whatever with the spirit and meaning of said act\u2014we will, however, consider the said act as being separate and apart, and the question then comes, does said act relieve the city corporation from duties and liabilities heretofore imposed on it for which, our decisions say, it is liable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">\u201cThe act is in these words: \u2018The owner of any premises fronting upon any footways, shall be solely responsible for any damage that may result to persons or property by reason of any hole, excavation or obstruction in or upon said footways, or from any defective condition of such footways; provided, however, that such hole, excavation or obstruction or other defective condition of the footways aforesaid is not caused by the city or any of its authorized agents/</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">\u201c What does this act mean ? l\u00edo doubt the intention was to relieve the city of liabilities, which our courts say it had assumed and was bound for in damages. But can we so construe a statute which is in direct opposition to the meaning of the original to which it is really a supplement? We are to construe a charter, the charter of the City of Wilmington, not alone an act of Assembly; and in so doing whether it be the one or the other, the provisions of the Constitution, if they conflict, or are involved, must be taken into consideration to guide us to a proper consideration of this subject. The charter granted the City of Wilmington confers imposed duties and liabilities; it accepted the same, and for years has been acting thereunder, vested with the powers of taxation, and the courts have defined its powers and liabilities. Are they not fixed? The charter conveys rights, duties, obligations according to its special provisions, as ordered by the Constitution; by the charter or act of incorporation, the corporation received its life, breath and being; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>true \u2019tis the creature of the Legislature, the life-giving power, but it must conform to the provisions of the Constitution, else it would be void, but when consistent it speaks for itself. We say consistent with the Constitution; we are dealing with our own, not other states, to which I shall allude briefly hereafter. Our Constitution provides and reserves no right or power save to revoke. Now a charter, as in this case, or act of incorporation was granted, vesting (which can\u2019t be denied), certain imposed duties and <em>liabilities; </em>the city accepts, and then by a subsequent act of the Legislature seeks to limit the powers and liabilities defined and decided by the courts. Can this be done? You may say there are no vested rights and no impairing of contracts, which is expressly prohibited by the <em>Constitution; </em>but we think the duties imposed and the liabilities incurred, are co-extensive and equal to bind the city corporation. We consider that duties once imposed and liabilities incurred by accepting and acting under an act of incorporation, cannot be divested, save the right to alter or amend be in the Constitution, or it affirmatively appear that the city has expressly agreed to such amendment, and should an act be passed not having such exception inserted, the incorporators having accepted without such reservations, have no right to claim the benefit thereof. This position is well settled by the main case, called the \u2018Brooklyn\u2019 case, cited by the able counsel, Mr. Harman, presenting in it facts very much similar to this case; there the question arose as to the amendment of a charter which it was contended could not be altered, parties having accepted and acted on it, but the Court on appeal said and admitted, <em>aliunde </em>the Constitution it could not be, but inasmuch as the Constitution by its express terms allowed alterations and amendments, and as the same provisions were embodied in the charter, and so accepted, it could be amended. No decisions have been cited in any way controverting the general doctrine, that parties accepting an act of incorporation are bound and held to its provisions, unless there be a right to change or alter expressly set forth in its provisions, except cases where both parties expressly assent to such change. The cases cited by the able counsel for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>defense from Oregon and California have no relevance to this <em>case; </em>the Oregon case by express terms being governed by express statutes in that State, and the California case having reference to the city being joined with the county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\"><em>\u201c </em>Again, this act or amendment in no way repeals, amends or changes the duties devolving upon the corporation as defined by our courts with reference to its care and supervision of the streets, footways, alleys, etc., of this city, nor can any such intent be gathered therefrom; it vests or gives no right of control or repair to the owners whose properties lie on the footways except under the ordinance, the sole right to repair or make new yet remaining in the said corporation, and the said owners can only repair the pavements or gutters by the permission of the said corporation. How then can an act of the Legislature make liable the owner for injuries occasioned by reason of defects, not caused by reason of the owners, in the sidewalks and gutters thereon over which they have no control and if such defects be caused by the negligence of the corporation whose duty it is to keep them in proper repair. Judge Brewer in the Kansas case well says, \u2018There is outside of positive law, no natural obligation on the part of a lot owner to keep the street or sidewalk in front of his lot in good repair, and no liabilities for injuries resulting from a failure to do so; hence when the city has assumed the entire control of the matter, a failure to repair the sidewalk may be negligence on its part, but is not on the part of the lot owner who has been ousted from all control.\u2019 An existing duty or obligation is an essential and necessary prerequisite of an affirmation of neglect or failure to perform.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">\u201cWe have said it is the duty of this corporation to keep in repair the streets, sidewalks, etc., of the city, and if injury occurs to persons by reason of negligence of said corporation, in not so doing, it is liable; to enable it to discharge and perform this duty, having assumed the onus thereof it is invested with the power of taxation, and does levy and collect from its citizens (and there is no limit on this power) such sums as are necessary for the purpose The rate of taxation must be equal, but if property owners can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>held liable in damages for injuries that occur by reason of defects in sidewalks fronting their premises not occasioned by their fault, they would be not only unequally taxed, but also held liable for negligence or fault not of their own, but the negligence of the corporation in matters over which they were expressly excluded from any control, contrary to every legal and equitable principle. The true construction and meaning of the law is, that property owners shall be held liable and responsible for any acts done on sidewalks by them from which injury happens, but was never intended or meant in the slightest degree to shield or protect the city from any of its legal liabilities assumed under its charter, as has been well said. The city cannot transfer to private citizens that responsibility which for wise purposes of public policy, the law easts upon it, in reference to the care and safety of its streets and walks. This question involving the rights and liabilities of city corporations, as connected with the liabilities of private individuals, in case of injuries happening on streets and sidewalks, has given rise to numerous decisions, and apart from special statutes are uniform, and I will refer among the numerous cases to <em>40 Md., Flynn vs. Canton ; 16 Kan., Janson vs. City of Atchinson, </em>and <em>11 R. I., Hoeny vs. Spread.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-4\">\u201cWe therefore say to you, gentlemen of the jury, that this act of Assembly upon which the defence claim the plaintiff has no right to recover, is as far as this case is concerned unconstitutional and void and presents no defence to this action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">THE ORIGIN OF THE STATUTE.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">At the February term of the Superior Court of New Castle County, A. D. 1889, one William H. Robinson brought an action on the case against(The Mayor and Council of Wilmington\u2019 for injuries alleged to have been received by his slipping into a hole in a sidewalk in the city of Wilmington, and, though no evidence was adduced that the defective condition of said sidewalk was caused by the city or its agents, the said Robinson recovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>damages against said city in the sum of five thousand dollars.

Thus construed it would be an effort to hold him responsible for negligence where he was under no duty or obligation, and therefore could not be negligent. It would impose upon him the consequences of the wrongful act, or omission of another over whom he had no control. It would relieve the City of Wilmington <em>alone </em>among the municipalities of the State, <em>by special legislation, </em>from the consequences of its own unlawful act, or omission.

It is not denied that the Legislature may, within proper lines, impose duties upon individuals, which were unknown to the common law, but not having imposed such duty, it can impose no penalty for the failure to perform it. It can make no man responsible for negligence except <em>\u201c </em>according to the usual practice \u201d of the courts.

Ewing, one of the plaintiffs on the 18th of October, 1894, occasioned by defective iron gutter-plates covering a gutter extending from the adjacent property to the curb, across a certain footway or sidewalk in said city.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">It does not appear by whom said gutter-plates were placed in said sidewalk, but they had been there more than twenty years, and had been broken and out of repair for at least a year before the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The action is founded upon the alleged negligence of the city in not keeping the said gutter-plates and sidewalk in proper repair, and in suffering them to remain in an unsafe and dangerous condition. By Section 31, of the charter of the city, the Council was given power, \u201c to ascertain and fix the boundaries of streets^ * * * to repair and amend the same, and provide for the paving thereof; * * * to regulate and fix the ascent and descent of all streets; * * * to direct the paving of footways and to prescribe the width thereof.\u201d * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">The act of April 20th, 1887 <em>(18 Del. </em>Laws, <em>352), </em>created a Street and Sewer Department, and gave to it \u201c Entire jurisdiction and control within the limits of said city of the streets, * * * said jurisdiction and control to extend from building line to building line, * * * and the same rights and powers, and * * the same authority over the said streets,\u201d * * * as were theretofore \u201c held and exercised by the Council.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">The city charter further provided in substance as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">Section 119. That upon application of certain freeholders residing or holding property on any street, the Board of Directors of the Street and Sewer Department are authorized in their discretion to require the Street Commissioners to cause the footways of such street to be paved with such material as the case may require, and fix the curb stones agreeably to the ground plan and regulations of the city. Upon the completion of such paving and curb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>ing the same is to be measured by the chief engineer, and such measurement transmitted by him to said board; and said board is to have the cost and expense of such paving and curbing assessed upon the owners of property bordering or fronting on the street, according to the number of feet in the street line of such property; and such assessment is to be entered in a record book, and from the time of such entry such assessment is made a lien upon the lands and buildings fronting on such street. The said board is to have a transcript or such recorded assessments transmitted to the city auditor to be recorded in his office\u2014the said board is forthwith to present to each owner or person having charge of such property a bill for such expense so assessed to such owner\u2014and in default of payment within sixty days, provision is made for the collection of the same with costs by the sale of such property.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u201c Section 120.

Laws, </em>889\u2014being the last clause of Section 121 of the amended charter above recited, <em>\u201c </em>is, as far as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>this case is concerned, unconstitutional and void, and presents no defense to this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">To this charge, and refusal to charge as requested, the defendant excepted, and the assignment of errors covers these and other points in the charge not necessary now to be stated. The jury rendered a verdict against the defendant on which judgment was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">In the case of <em>Coyle vs. </em>McIntyre, <em>7 Houst., 44, </em>the Court of Errors and Appeals settled the law of this State as to the power of the Legislature over municipal corporations. It was there held that a municipal corporation is \u201ca body politic or corporate established by law to assist in the civil government of the State, with delegated authority to regulate and administer the local or internal affairs of a city, town or district which is incorporated \u201d * * * \u201c that such a corporation may be controlled and its constitution altered and amended by the government in such manner as the public interest may require. Such legislative interferences cannot be said to impair the contract by which the corporation was formed, because there is in reality but one party to it. There is in fact no contract in any just sense of the word, and public municipal corporations are not founded on contracts.\u201d * * V * * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\"><em>\u201c </em>The Mayor and Council of Wilmington is merely an agency instituted by the State for the purpose of carrying out in detail the objects of government. It is essentially a revocable agency. It has no vested (interest in) any of its powers or franchises. Its charter\u201d * * * \u201cis in no sense a contract with the State. It is subject to the control of the Legislature, who may enlarge or diminish its territorial extent or its functions, and may change or modify its internal arrangement or destroy its very existence at discretion\u201d * * * \u201c The Legislature can divest the Council of any and every power and authority it possesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">In view of this decision, it is difficult to see how the question of the consent of the city to the amendment of April 24, 1889, could have been of any consequence; but if such consent was ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>terial, as it certainly was not, it may be fairly inferred from the fact that this amendment is incorporated in the charter as contained in the <em>\u201c </em>Charter, Laws and Ordinances of the City of Wilmington,\u201d published by order of the council in 1893, and from the further fact that this amendment was urged and relied upon by the attorneys of the city as its principal defense to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The sole question necessary now to be considered is, whether that part of the said amendment which purports to relieve the city from liability for damages resulting from the defective condition of footways, except such as are caused by the city or any of its authorized agents, is constitutional and void ? For the purpose of this inquiry we may presume that the injury in this case was not, in the sense of the statute, <em>caused </em>by the city or any of its authorized agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Many of the cases cited in the argument were upon the construction of statutes imposing certain duties upon municipal corporations in respect to streets and sidewalks without expressly declaring the liability or non liability of the corporation in case of default in the performance of such duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The liability of a municipal corporation for injuries resulting from defective streets and sidewalks is either an express statutory liability or an implied liability. In general, but not uniformly, it has been held that where the duty of control over the streets is imposed upon a municipal corporation, there is an implied liability arising from default in the performance of such duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Such has been the construction given by the courts of this State to the charter of the City of Wilmington as it existed prior to the amendment of April 24, 1889, but these cases dealt only with the implied liability of the city under a charter which imposed upon it certain duties, and was silent as to its liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\n<em>Robinson vs. Wilmington, 8 Houst., 409; Anderson vs. Wilmington, 8 Houst., 516.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The charter, as it now is, and was at the time of the alleged injury in this case, is express as to the circumstances under which the city shall and shall1 not be liable. <em>\u201c </em>If,\u201d as is said in <em>Sherman </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>and Redjield on Negligence, Section 12j, \u201c </em>the statute, either expressly or by necessary intendment, enacts that the corporation shall not be subject to liability, there is the end of the matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The power to alter, modify or take away the liability of municipal corporations for injuries sustained from defective streets and sidewalks has been frequently exercised by State legislatures and sustained by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">In <em>Watson vs. Triff, 11 R. I., 98, </em>it was held that it was the duty of the city to keep its highways in safe condition, and that the city could not divest itself of its capacity to discharge that duty, either by contract or ordinance, <em>imless authorized by statute so to do.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\"><em>O\u2019Hara vs. The City of Portland, 3 Oregon, 525, </em>was an action against the city for injuries to the plaintiff occasioned by a defect in the sidewalk which it was the duty of the city to keep in good order. The amended charter of the city provided, that <em>\u201c </em>the city of Portland is not liable to any one for an injury to the person growing out of the condition of any streets.\u201d It was contended that this provision was unconstitutional and void. The Court sustained the constitutionality of the provision and held that the city was not liable to the plaintiff. <em>Rankin vs. Buckmam, et al., 9 Oregon, 253, </em>was an action against certain officers of the City of East Portland for injuries resulting from the alleged negligence of the defendants in not repairing a bridge. The charter of the city-exempted the city from liability from accidents occasioned by the defective condition of streets, etc., and made the officers liable by whose wilful act or gross negligence the accident is caused. The Court approved of the decision in <em>O\u2019Harra vs. The City of Portland, </em>exempting the city from liability, and sustained the provisions of the charter making the negligent officers liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\"><em>Templeton vs. Linn County, 22 Oregon 313, </em>was an action against a county for an injury resulting from a defective highway.

The cases of <em>O\u2019Harra vs. Portland </em>and <em>Rankin vs. Bucknan </em>were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>approved, and the Court say, \u201c If the Legislature can constitutionally take away both the common law and statutory right of action against a municipal corporation for an injury received from a defective highway, it certainly can withdraw the statutory remedy against a county.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">In <em>Nichols vs. City of </em>Minneapolis, <em>30 Minn., 545, </em>provisions of the charter of the city, that no action should be maintained against the city on account of injuries from defective condition of any street, sidewalk, etc., unless such action be commenced within one year, nor unless notice be given within thirty days stating the place and time of the injuries, and the intention to claim damages of the city, were held to be constitutional. In reference to municipal corporations, the Court say, \u201c Such corporations are creatures of the statute, and have such powers, duties and obligations as the statute gives or imposes. The Legislature is presumed to regulate these as in its opinion the needs and interests of the people within the prescribed territory required. In respect to liability for injuries by reason of defects in streets, the Legislature may impose it on the corporation or not as it deems most expedient; and it may prescribe the extent to which, or the conditions on which, it shall be liable, and the conditions on which the liability shall be enforced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">In <em>Van Vranken vs. City of Schenectady, 31 Hun., 516, </em>the provisions of the charter of the city, that the city should not be liable for injuries sustained by defective sidewalks unless <em>actual </em>notice of the defect be given to the council or superintendent of Streets, twenty-four hours before the injury, and that claims for injuries should be presented within three months, and actions brought within one year, were held to be constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">In <em>McNally vs. City of Cohes, 53 Hun., 202, </em>a provision of the city charter, that the city should not be liable in damages for injurie\u00e9 occasioned by a street or sidewalk being out of repair, unless <em>actual </em>notice of the defect be given to the council or superintendent of streets twenty-four hours before the injury, was held to be valid, and that without such <em>actual </em>notice there could be no recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>Gray vs. City of Brooklyn, 50 Barb., 365, </em>was an action against the City of Brooklyn for injuries sustained by reason of a street being out of repair. The charter provided that the city should not be liable in damages for the nonfeasance or misfeasance of the common council or any officer of the city, or appointee of the council, of any duty imposed on them, or any of them, by the statute, but that the remedy should be by <em>mandamus, </em>or other proceeding to compel the performance of duty, or action against the members of council or officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Held that this statute was a defense to the city.

The Court held that the injury was not caused by the act or neglect of the defendant officers. That the said provisions did not exempt the city from liability to discharge a duty resting on it which has not devolved upon one of its officers.

It will be time enough to consider these questions when they arise in an action in which they are material.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The plaintiffs have no vested right to sue the city, in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Such liability as is now sought to be enforced never arises from any implied contract between the city and the persons injured, but in the absence of statutory exemption it is implied by law from the duty imposed by law upon the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Before the happening of the accident in question, the city was relieved of such implied liability by the express term of the amendment of April 24, 1889, if such amendment is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">We know of no provision of the Constitution of this State or of the United States which this amendment violates. There is great danger in declaring a law unconstitutional because of its supposed conflict with some vague principle of constitutional law. In such cases courts are in danger of substituting their idea of what, the law should be for their judgment of what the law is. Caution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>should be exercised in declaring an act of the Legislature unconstitutional, and the presumptions are in favor of its validity. If after due consideration a reasonable doubt remains, it should be solved in favor of the act, and it should not be declared unconstitutional unless it be so, clearly and manifestly.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\n<em>Cooley\u2019s Const. Lims., 218 and 219.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The great burden imposed upon municipal corporations by their unrestricted liability for injuries occasioned by defective streets and sidewalks, has doubtless been the cause of the frequent modification or removal of such liability. The relief of the city from this unrestricted liability was obviously the main purpose and design of the Legislature in enacting this amendment, and this main purpose and design should not be defeated, even if the provision making the adjacent owners liable in certain cases should for any cause fail to be effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\"><em>\u201c </em>If a statute attempts to accomplish two or more objects and is void as to one, it may still be in every respect complete and valid as to the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">\n<em>Cooley\u2019s Const. Lims., 178\u2014181.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">From considerations of public policy, as to the sufficiency of which we have no right to determine, the Legislature has by an amendment of the charter of the City of Wilmington, limited the liability of the city to cases of defective condition of footways, <em>\u201c </em>caused by the city or any of its authorized agents,\u201d and we hold that the said limitation was within the power of the Legislature, that the said amendment, so far as this case is concerned, is constitutional and valid, and that the Court below erred in its charge to the jury and in its refusal to charge as stated above. The judgment below is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b114-10\">Peenewill, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApM\">(dissenting):\u2014I regret very much that I cannot agree with the majority of the Court in the conclusion they have reached in this case; while I have not considered it necessary to prepare any extended dissenting opinion, or give at much length the reasons which have led me to a different conclusion, I nevertheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>deem it proper to briefly state the position I have taken, and wherein I feel bound to differ from the majority of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">I am not prepared to say that it is not competent for the Legislature to relieve the municipality from liability for injuries caused by defective footways without placing the liability elsewhere, and while expressing no opinion on that question, yet I think it will be found upon examination that in almost every case, if not in every case, in which a city has been so relieved of such common law liability, it has been imposed upon certain officers of the city or other persons whose duty it was to repair such footways. And the provision, found in so many statutes, which exempts the city from liability unless certain notice is given, or claim is made or suit is brought, within a certain time, and which has been quite uniformly held to be constitutional, cannot be regarded as sustaining the validity of a statute which relieves the city from liability, because such a provision does not attempt to take away the remedy for such injuries, but only <em>to </em>regulate its use. This the Legislature unquestionably has the right to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">But the statute in question, and which this Court is called upon to consider and construe, seeks not only to relieve the city, but also to impose on the owner of the premises fronting upon the footways, the liability for all injuries caused by defects in such footways, provided the same are not caused by the city or its authorized agents. It becomes necessary, therefore, to inquire whether the statute is constitutional and valid in so far as it undertakes to impose such liability upon such owner; and if it be not constitutional and valid in that particular, whether it can be held to be constitutional in so far as it seeks to relieve the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">I am clearly of the opinion that at the time of the passage of this statute there was no duty resting upon the owner of the premises to repair the footways, but that such duty rested primarily and absolutely upon the city, which had not only the power to make the repairs, but was possessed with complete supervision and control over the footways, and had all the means, by taxation, assessment, and otherwise, to perform such duty. It is true that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>owner might make such repairs, but it was discretionary and not mandatory, and necessarily under the supervision and control of the municipality. Such owner was without the means and power possessed by the city in that behalf. It therefore not being the duty of such owner to repair the footways, it necessarily follows that it was not within the power of the Legislature to impose upon him a liability to third persons for injuries caused by the defective condition of such footways; for it is most elementary that such liability cannot be imposed where there is no negligence, and there can be no negligence in this sense when there is no obligation or duty. A statute which seeks to create a liability irrespective of negligence has been quite universally held to be invalid upon constitutional grounds, as well as repugnant to sound reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">But it is earnestly contended that even though the duty to repair did not rest upon the owner prior to the passage of the act which we are considering, yet it was placed upon him by this act which imposed the liability. It is urged that such duty was created or arose in some way by implication; that is, when the Legislature declared by this statute that the owner should be liable, it must have necessarily followed that the same statute raised the duty, because there could not be any liability in the absence of a duty. But such a process of reasoning I submit, is simply begging the question, and is in effect equivalent to saying that there must have been a duty, otherwise the enactment could not be constitutional. Besides, if the act that imposed the liability also necessarily created the duty, then there would be no meaning in the expression which is axiomatic, \u201cthere can be no liability when there is no duty,\u201d because the liability would always carry with it the duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Believing that the statute is unconstitutional in so far as it attempts to impose the liability on the owner of the premises, it remains only to inquire whether it can be held to be constitutional in so far as it would exempt the city from liability, assuming that it is competent for the Legislature to so exempt the city, and that a statute having that for its sole purpose would be constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Is the statute, in so far as it would relieve the city, so separable from, and independent of, that part which seeks to impose the liability on the owner, that the former can be held to be valid even though the latter be unconstitutional ? In this connection it is needful to keep clearly in mind the very language of the act, which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\"><em>\u201c </em>The owner of any premises fronting upon any footways shall be solely responsible for any damage that may result to persons or property by reason of any hole, excavation or obstruction in or upon such footways, or from any defective condition of such footways: Provided, however, that such hole, excavation or obstruction or other defective condition of the footways aforesaid is not caused by the city or any of its authorized agents.\u201d It will' be noted that the city is not expressly exempted by the terms of the statute, but only by implication, by making the owner solely responsible. The important question that arises is, did the Legislature, at the time of the enactment of the statute in question, intend to relieve the city of liability if the same could not be placed on the owner ? Or did the law-making body merely intend to shift the responsibility from the city to the owner ? If the latter, then it is inconceivable that it should have intended that the statute, in so far as it exempted the municipality should be operative even though the other part should be invalid. It must be remembered that prior to the passage of the statute the city was liable for such injuries as the Legislature sought to impose upon the owner, and it was even a common law liability. I submit that the very effort to impose the liability upon the owner clearly indicates that it was not the intention of the Legislature to take away entirely the remedy for such injuries; and it is a fair, nay an almost irresistible inference, that the law makers would not have taken away the remedy as against the city had they known |hat their act would leave the party injured absolutely remediless. \u201c The owner of the premises shall be solely responsible.\u201d The effect of that language, it is insisted, is to relieve the city which had been hitherto liable. There is nothing else in the act which could possible give the relief con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>tended for. Then if that provision\u2014\u201c The owner shall be solely responsible \u201d\u2014is held to be invalid, what is there left upon which the city can claim exemption from liability ? <em>Cooley </em>in his work on <em>Constitutional Limitations, pages 211 and 212, </em>says, \u201c If when the unconstitutional part of a statute is stricken out, that which remains is complete in itself, and capable of being executed in accordance with the apparent legislative intent, wholly independent of that which was rejected, it must be sustained. The difficulty is in determining whether the good and the bad parts of the statute are capable of being separated within the meaning of the rule.\u201d And if the objects sought to be accomplished \u201care so mutually connected with and dependent on each other, as conditions, considerations or compensations for each other, as to warrant the belief that the Legislature intended them as a whole, and if all could not be carried into effect the Legislature would not pass the residue independently, then if some parts are unconstitutional, all the provisions which are thus dependent, conditional or connected must fall with them.\u201d And in a note, page 212 of the same authority, the following language is used: \u201c It must be obvious, in any case where part of an act is set aside as unconstitutional, that it is unsafe to indulge in the same extreme presumptions in support of the remainder that are allowable in support of a complete act when some cause of invalidity is suggested to the whole of it. In the latter case, we know the Legislature designed the whole act to have effect, and we should sustain it if possible; in the former, we do not know that the Legislature would have been willing that a part of the act should be sustained if the remainder were held void, and there is a general presumption more or less strong to the contrary. While therefore in the one case the act should be sustained unless the invalidity is clear, in the other the whole should fall unless it is manifest the portion not opposed to the Constitution can stand by itself, and that in the legislative intent it was not to be controlled or modified in its construction and effect by the part which was void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">I do not believe the Legislature would have been willing that the act in question, in so far as it by implication relieved the city of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>liability, should be sustained if that part which imposed the liability on the owner were held void. In my opinion therefore the act is wholly unconstitutional and void, and accordingly I hold that the former liability of the city for injuries caused by the defective foot-ways is not in any wise affected thereby.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
