That the said Hugh C. Smith, John Shearer and Charles Shearer continued seized of the lands aforesaid in fee down to the time of the sale thereof by William Simmons, sheriff, hereinafter mentioned.

That in said action, the said Hugh C. Smith, John Shearer and Charles Shearer, the children and heirs at law of Charles Shearer, deceased, were not joined nor in any manner made parties to the action.

Reedy for $3,000, which sum of $3,000 came into the hands of William Simmons as sheriff, as aforesaid.
