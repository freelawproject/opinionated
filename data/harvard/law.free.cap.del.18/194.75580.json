D. 1899, before me, Lewis Basse, a Notary Public for the State of Delaware for New Castle County, personally comes Samuel D. Forbes, the defendant above named, who, being by me duly qualified according to law, deposes and says that he verily believes there is a legal defense to the whole of the cause of action in the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>suit, the nature and character of which defense is as follows, to wit: That on the twelfth day of July, A. D. 1897, the said George S. May, the mortgagee in the mortgage mentioned in the abstract filed in this cause, said date being after the date in the assignment of said mortgage to Sallie A. May, said assignee, but upwards of one month before the date of the recording of said assignment, acting as attorney in fact for and with due and lawful authority from the said Sallie A. May, said assignee, agreed with the said Samuel D. Forbes by an instrument in writing, duly executed under seal, that the said Samuel D. Forbes should have at least one year\u2019s notice before he should be called upon for the principal of the said mortgage ; that said agreement was executed and delivered by the said George S. May to the said Samuel D. Forbes; the said George S. May then and there, acting for, in the name and in behalf of the said Sallie A. May as and for her agreement with the said Samuel D. Forbes, and was binding upon the said Sallie A. May ; that the said Samuel D. Forbes had no notice before the bringing of this suit that he was to be called upon to pay the principal of said mortgage, and has not had the one year\u2019s notice before he was by said suit called upon to pay the principal of said mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-5\">\u201c Samuel D.
