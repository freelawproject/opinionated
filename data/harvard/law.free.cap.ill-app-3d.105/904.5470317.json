(Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 127, par.' 63b111a.) We reverse because the Commission\u2019s decision is against the manifest weight of the evidence. The following facts are material to our decision.</p> <p id=\"b927-10\" pgmap=\"927(142) 928(104)\">Starkey was employed as the claims manager of the Waukegan branch of the Illinois Department of Labor, Bureau of Employment Security (BES). In July of 1979 she was notified that she was being discharged based on the allegation that she processed a claim for unemployment benefits on behalf of her mother, Lillian McCoy, with knowledge that McCoy\u2019s claim was fraudulent. Starkey requested a hearing on the charges, and the Civil Service Commission appointed a hearing officer. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 127, par. 63blll.) The evidence presented to the hearing officer shows that Lillian McCoy went to the Waukegan BES office on September 10,1976, to apply for unemployment benefits under the Supplemental Unemployment Assistance (SUA) program. Starkey testified that, although it was not a regular part of her duties, she partially filled out a claims application for her mother and put this form in the pile of SUA applications. She told her mother to wait for a claims taker to call her so that the application could be completed and her eligibility evaluated. Without this shortcut, her mother would have had to wait in one line only to be told that she had to go to a line for SUA claimants at the other side of the building. After putting the partially completed application in the SUA pile, Starkey went back to her office. Starkey further testified that she did not know that McCoy was not eligible for the $2,028 in benefits she eventually received.</p> <p id=\"b928-3\" pgmap=\"928\">Although McCoy\u2019s application was processed without being completely filled out, Starkey\u2019s supervisor, Miles Paris, testified that in September of 1976 it was not unusual for uncompleted applications to be processed. The SUA program was new at the time, and as the hearing officer found, \u201c[I]n 1976, things were in a state of chaos at the Waukegan B.E.S. office.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b928-4\" pgmap=\"928\">In 1977, the Illinois Department of Law Enforcement (DLE) began an investigation of the Waukegan BES office, focusing on an employee named Marilyn Blye. Blye was Starkey\u2019s principal accuser at the hearing which resulted in this appeal. However, Blye was under indictment by the time the charges against Starkey were heard, and she did not testify against Starkey. Instead, Blye\u2019s unsworn and un-cross-examined \u201ctestimony\u201d was given through two DLE agents who testified that during the course of their investigation they interviewed Blye at the Waukegan police station and at the office of the State\u2019s Attorney. According to one of the agents:</p> <blockquote id=\"b928-5\" pgmap=\"928\">\u201c\u00ab # \u00bb i asked Marilyn Blye if there were any other employees in the local office in Waukegan who were involved in filing false claims. Blye replied that Josie Starkey had filed a false claim for her mother. She said that Josie Starkey brought the claim to her while she was at a computer terminal. She said she thought that Miss Starkey stated that her mother had not been working as listed in the claim.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b928-7\" pgmap=\"928\">Blye stated she thought, Blye thought, Starkey told her at the time that her mother had not been working as listed in the complaint.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote> <p id=\"b928-8\" pgmap=\"928\">Despite the fact that the agent initially testified that Blye merely reported what she \u201cthought\u201d was Starkey\u2019s knowledge of a fraudulent claim, the agent later gave a much more damaging version of Blye\u2019s statements. According to this second version of the agent\u2019s recollection, Blye said that Starkey admitted to Blye that McCoy\u2019s claim was fraudulent. The agent further testified that Blye said that Starkey showed her how to enter a fraudulent claim in the BES computer.</p> <p id=\"b928-9\" pgmap=\"928(12) 929(33)\">The testimony of the second agent was similar to the more damaging version of the first agent\u2019s testimony. However, the second agent also testified that Starkey had helped in the investigation of Blye, and that Blye believed that Starkey was responsible for Blye\u2019s own discharge.</p> <p id=\"b929-5\" pgmap=\"929\">At the close of the hearing, the hearing officer found that McCoy had not been entitled to the SUA benefits she received. \u201cIt is clear that a false claim was entered on behalf of claimant McCoy. It is not clear, however, that respondent Starkey participated in any way, except to a very small degree, in the processing of that claim.\u201d The \u201cultimate issue,\u201d as the hearing officer viewed the case, was whether Starkey knowingly participated in a scheme to defraud the State. Having had an opportunity to observe Starkey\u2019s demeanor while she testified, the hearing officer found that her testimony was truthful. Specifically, the hearing officer expressly found that \u201cStarkey\u2019s testimony is credible,\u201d and \u201cHer word is good.\u201d Moreover, the hearing officer found that: (1) Blye processed McCoy\u2019s partially completed application in an \u201cattemp[t] to please her supervisor [Starkey] by \u2018taking care of\u2019 her relatives\u201d; and (2) that Blye\u2019s statements to the DLE agents were motivated by her strong resentment toward Starkey.</p> <p id=\"b929-6\" pgmap=\"929\">Based upon his detailed 38-page report of findings and conclusions, the hearing officer concluded that the charges against Starkey had not been proved, and that she should be retained in her job.</p> <p id=\"b929-7\" pgmap=\"929\">After reviewing the record, but without having had an opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses, the Civil Service Commission stated that \u201cWe cannot accept the proposition that Respondent, an experienced employee, could have by happenstance processed a fraudulent claim for her mother. Respondent\u2019s defense is not credible.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Commission further concluded that the charges had been proved.</p> <p id=\"b929-8\" pgmap=\"929\">On appeal, Starkey contends (1) that the Commission lacked authority to discharge her because the charges were amended without being re-approved by the Director of the Department of Personnel, and (2) that the evidence is not sufficient to support the Commission\u2019s decision. The second issue is dispositive.</p> <p id=\"b929-9\" pgmap=\"929\">I</p> <p id=\"b929-10\" pgmap=\"929\">A. Standard of Review</p> <p id=\"b929-11\" pgmap=\"929\">Starkey argues that the Commission\u2019s findings are \u201cagainst the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d The Commission counters by arguing that there is \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d to support the finding that Starkey acted with knowledge that her mother was ineligible for the requested benefits.</p> <p id=\"b929-12\" pgmap=\"929(11) 930(103)\">Our first task is to determine the appropriate standard of review. Section 11 of the Administrative Review Act states that \u201cThe findings and conclusions of the administrative agency on questions of fact shall be held to be prima facie true and correct.\u201d (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 110, par. 274.) Rut, despite this presumption that the fact findings of administrative agencies are true and correct, it has been well-settled Illinois law that the findings of fact reached by administrative agencies must be based upon \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d Gibbs v. Orlandi (1963), 27 Ill. 2d 368, 371, 189 N.E.2d 233; Bruce v. Department of Registration &amp; Education (1963), 26 Ill. 2d 612, 622, 187 N.E.2d 711.</p> <p id=\"b930-5\" pgmap=\"930\">\u201cOn administrative review the issue is not whether the court approves the action taken by the administrative body but whether there was substantial evidence to support the decision.\u201d (Heft v. Zoning Board of Appeals (1964), 31 Ill. 2d 266, 270-71, 201 N.E.2d 364.) The supreme court explained, in Menning v. Department of Registration and Education (1958), 14 Ill. 2d 553, 558, 153 N.E.2d 52, that judicial review of administrative fact finding, under the Administrative Review Act, is comparable to the procedure used in determining whether there is \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d to support the judgment of a lower court. See also McCormick, Evidence sec. 352 at 847 (2d ed. 1972).</p> <p id=\"b930-6\" pgmap=\"930\">The \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d rule is the standard used for judicial review of administrative fact-finding in the Federal and in most State courts. (4 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise sec. 29.11, at 186 (1958).) Nevertheless, despite the line of Illinois cases which invoked the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, the supreme court, in 1974, expressly rejected use of the \u201c \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 standard as used in the Federal system for review of administrative matters.\u201d Basketfield v. Police Board (1974), 56 Ill. 2d 351, 358, 307 N.E.2d 371, appeal after remand (1979), 71 Ill. App. 3d 877, 390 N.E.2d 492.</p> <p id=\"b930-7\" pgmap=\"930(177) 931(32)\">Without mentioning or overruling the Illinois cases which have used the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, the court held that \u201c[u]nder the Administrative Review Act the permissible scope of judicial inquiry concerning factual determinations by administrative agencies has been limited to ascertaining if the agency decision was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. (Davern v. Civil Service Com. of Chicago, 47 Ill. 2d 469, 471-72, cert. denied, 403 U.S. 918.)\u201d (Basketfield v. Police Board (1974), 56 Ill. 2d 351, 358-59.) However, despite the fact that Davern is cited in support of the proposition that the sole test to be used in Illinois is the \u201cmanifest weight\u201d standard, the court held in Davern that courts \u201care limited to a determination whether the final decision of the administrative agency is just and reasonable in light of the evidence presented.\u201d 47 Ill. 2d 469, 471. See also Menning v. Department of Registration and Education (1958), 14 Ill. 2d 553, 561 (\u201c[T]his court is not bound to believe that facts in evidence establish a conclusion if the conclusion is not reasonable \u2022 * *\u201d); and Outboard Marine &amp; Manufacturing Co. v. Gordon (1949), 403 Ill. 523, 528, 87 N.E.2d 610 (each of the two tests referred to as justifying reversal of agency findings).</p> <p id=\"b931-3\" pgmap=\"931\"> Based on Basketfield, however, we conclude that the \u201cmanifest weight\u201d standard is the applicable standard for judicial review of administrative fact-finding in Illinois.</p> <p id=\"b931-4\" pgmap=\"931\">B. Review of the Entire Record</p> <p id=\"b931-5\" pgmap=\"931\">Section 11 of the Administrative Review Act provides that judicial review \u201cshall extend to all questions of law and of fact presented by the entire record before the court.\u201d (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 110, par. 274.) And section 9 specifies that the \u201centire record\u201d includes all the evidence that was presented to the administrative agency. (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 110, par. 272(b).) This means that \u201c[i]n examining the record, a reviewing court will and must look at all the evidence in opposition to the challenged finding as well as the evidence which tends to support it.\u201d Viera v. Illinois Racing Board (1978), 65 Ill. App. 3d 94, 100, 382 N.E.2d 462; accord, Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB (1951), 340 U.S. 474, 488, 95 L. Ed. 456, 467-68, 71 S. Ct. 456, 464-65.</p> <p id=\"b931-6\" pgmap=\"931\">We agree that, \u201cIt is hard to see how sensible judges could conceivably appraise the substantiality of evidence in a record without looking at the evidence on both sides, for evidence has significance only in a context, not in the abstract.\u201d 4 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise sec. 29.03, at 127 (1958).</p> <p id=\"b931-7\" pgmap=\"931\">Moreover, the \u201centire record of proceedings under review\u201d (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 110, par. 272(b)) clearly includes the findings of fact reached by the agency\u2019s hearing officer on the issue of testimonial credibility. (See 4 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise sec. 29.11, at 187 (1958).) \u201cSurely an examiner\u2019s report is as much a part of the record as the complaint or the testimony.\u201d Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB (1951), 340 U.S. 474, 493, 95 L. Ed. 456, 470, 71 S. Ct. 456, 467.</p> <p id=\"b931-8\" pgmap=\"931\">C. Review of Determinations of Testimonial Credibility</p> <p id=\"b931-9\" pgmap=\"931(121) 932(21)\"> Evidence which, by itself, may be sufficient to support an agency\u2019s findings of fact may be insufficient \u201cwhen the trial examiner has, on the basis of the witnesses\u2019 demeanor, made credibility determinations contrary to the Board\u2019s position.\u201d (Penasquitos Village, Inc. v. NLRB (9th Cir. 1977), 565 F.2d 1074, 1078; see also Kelley v. Murphy (1967), 20 N.Y.2d 205, 282 N.Y.S.2d 254, 229 N.E.2d 40.) When a hearing officer and an administrative agency reach contrary findings of fact, the hearing officer\u2019s findings should be given such deference \u201cas they merit within reason and the light of judicial experience.\u201d Adolph Coors Co. v. FTC (10th Cir. 1974), 497 F.2d 1178, 1184, cert. denied (1975), 419 U.S. 1105, 42 L. Ed. 2d 801, 95 S. Ct. 775; see also McDonald v. Department of Banking &amp; Finance (Fla. App. 1977), 346 So.2d 569, 579.</p> <p id=\"b932-3\" pgmap=\"932\">A hearing officer\u2019s finding of fact on the issue of testimonial credibility is entitled to a certain degree of deference \u201cfor the obvious reason that he or she \u2018sees the witnesses and hears them testify, while the Board and the reviewing court look only at cold records.\u2019 \u201d (Penasquitos Village, Inc. v. NLRB (9th Cir. 1977), 565 F.2d 1074, 1078; see also Michigan Employment Relations Com. v. Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Inc. (1974), 393 Mich. 116, 127, 223 N.W.2d 283, 289.) Therefore, the significance of the hearing officer\u2019s findings \u201cdepends largely on the importance of credibility in the particular case.\u201d Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB (1951), 340 U.S. 474, 496, 95 L. Ed. 456, 472, 71 S. Ct. 456, 469; see also Townsend v. Nelson (Minn. 1976), 242 N.W.2d 607, 608-09.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b932-4\" pgmap=\"932\">D. The Residuum Rule</p> <p id=\"b932-5\" pgmap=\"932\">An obiter dictum in Menning v. Department of Registration and Education (1958), 14 Ill. 2d 553, 558 (\u201c[T]he findings of an administrative agency * \u201d \u201d must rest upon competent evidence * \u201d *\u201d (emphasis added)) seems to indicate that Illinois follows the much criticized residuum rule. \u201cThe residuum rule requires a reviewing court to set aside an administrative finding unless the finding is supported by evidence which would be admissible in a jury trial.\u201d 2 Davis, Administrative Law Treatise sec. 14.10, at 291-92 (1958); see also Professor Davis\u2019 well reasoned criticism of the rule at 293-96.</p> <p id=\"b932-6\" pgmap=\"932\"> As applied to the facts of the present case, the residuum rule would require that we reverse the Commission\u2019s decision because it is based upon the \u201cincompetent\u201d hearsay statements attributed to Marilyn Blye. However, we conclude that the better reasoned rule is that hearsay which is not admissible in a jury trial may be sufficient to support the finding of an administrative agency, if more reliable evidence is not available, \u201cand if in the end the finding is supported by the kind of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in serious affairs.\u201d (NLRB v. Remington Rand, Inc. (2d Cir. 1938), 94 F.2d 862, 873 (per J. Learned Hand), cert. denied (1938), 304 U.S. 576, 82 L. Ed. 1540, 85 S. Ct. 1046.) \u201cHearing officers and agencies have adhered to this commonsense standard instinctively.\u201d McCormick, Evidence sec. 351, at 844 (2d ed. 1972).</p> <p id=\"b933-4\" pgmap=\"933\">II</p> <p id=\"AZqS\" pgmap=\"933\"> Despite the fact that the hearing officer found that \u201cStarkey\u2019s testimony is credible,\u201d the Commission \u2014 without having had an opportunity to observe her demeanor as a witness \u2014 simply rejected her \u201cdefense\u201d as \u201cnot credible.\u201d We conclude, however, that, in this case, the hearing officer\u2019s determination of testimonial credibility is entitled to deference. The charges against Starkey stand or fall based on the question of whether Starkey testified truthfully when she denied the alleged misconduct, or whether Blye\u2019s unsworn and un-cross-examined accusations were true. Since testimonial credibility is the crucial factual issue in this case, both logic and judicial experience require that courts give deference to the findings on the issue of testimonial credibility reached by the hearing officer who had an opportunity to evaluate the witnesses in person. The Civil Service Commission\u2019s arbitrary action in summarily rejecting Starkey\u2019s \u201cdefense\u201d as \u201cnot credible,\u201d after nothing more than its reading of a cold transcript, convinces us that the Commission failed to give Starkey a full and fair hearing. And, we conclude that the Commission\u2019s decision is against the manifest weight of the evidence which was presented to the Commission.</p> <p id=\"b933-6\" pgmap=\"933\">Any expertise which the Civil Service Commission has in the field of labor-management relations and any special knowledge which the Commission might have outside the record concerning the operation of the Department of Labor\u2019s Waukegan office, do not give the Commission any special ability or expertise in re-evaluating its hearing officer\u2019s findings on the issue of testimonial credibility. As a reviewing court, we are acutely aware of the inadequacy of \u201csecond guessing\u201d a trier of fact\u2019s findings on the issue of testimonial credibility based on a review of a cold transcript. Thus, it is fundamental that a reviewing court should give deference to the trier of fact\u2019s decision on the issue of the credibility of witnesses. See, e.g., People v. Walker (1978), 58 Ill. App. 3d 535, 538, 374 N.E.2d 880.</p> <p id=\"b933-7\" pgmap=\"933(133) 934(29)\">Furthermore, as an alternative basis for our decision in this case, we conclude that the inculpatory evidence presented below is not sufficient to support the Commission\u2019s decision. The Commission refers to the testimony from the DLE investigators detailing Marilyn Blye\u2019s unsworn and un-cross-examined accusations. But, we note that (a) Blye was the target of a criminal investigation at the time these statements were allegedly made; (b) Blye made the accusatory statements while being interviewed at a police station and at the office of a prosecutor; (c) Starkey cooperated with the agents who were investigating Blye; (d) Blye believed that Starkey was responsible for her discharge; and (e) one of the agents initially testified that Blye merely said she thought that Starkey admitted being guilty of fraud. We are simply unable to conclude that reasonable people would rely on this unsupported hearsay evidence in the conduct of serious affairs. Thus, Blye\u2019s unsworn and un-cross-examined accusations are not sufficient to support the Commission\u2019s decision.</p> <p id=\"b934-3\" pgmap=\"934\">In short we conclude that this vital piece of unsupported inculpatory evidence lacks sufficient probative value, and that the hearing officer\u2019s determination that Starkey\u2019s exculpatory testimony was truthful is a finding which is entitled to deference. Although we are not permitted to freely substitute our judgment for the one reached by the Civil Service Commission, it is fundamental that, as an appellate court, we are obligated to reverse a decision which is against the manifest weight of the evidence. The decision reached by the Civil Service Commission in this case is patently wrong, and it is, therefore, against the manifest weight of the evidence. Accordingly, the decisions of both the trial court and the Commission are reversed.</p> <p id=\"b934-4\" pgmap=\"934\">Because Starkey prays for reinstatement and the compensation provided for in section lib of the Personnel Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1979, ch. 127, par. 63blllb), we remand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p> <p id=\"b934-5\" pgmap=\"934\">Civil Service Commission reversed; circuit court reversed; cause remanded to the circuit court with directions.</p> <author id=\"b934-6\" pgmap=\"934\">MEJDA, J., concurring.</author> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b932-7\" pgmap=\"932\"> Because of our resolution of this case, we need not decide whether Starkey was improperly deprived of the right to cross-examine Marilyn Blye, the person whose hearsay accusations formed the basis for the Commission\u2019s decision. See, e.g., Erdman v. Ingraham (1967), 28 App. Div. 2d 5, 280 N.Y.S.2d 865 (respondent in administrative proceedings was improperly deprived of right to cross-examine his accusers because the agency fact-findings were based on an investigator\u2019s testimony about accusations made by persons who were not available for cross-examination).</p> </footnote> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b934-7\" pgmap=\"934\">PRESIDING JUSTICE SULLIVAN,</author> <p id=\"AaZ\" pgmap=\"934\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b934-8\" pgmap=\"934\">I disagree with the decision of the majority.</p> <p id=\"b934-9\" pgmap=\"934\">The majority held the Commission\u2019s decision was against the manifest weight of the evidence because of two conclusions \u2014 (1) that Blye\u2019s testimony inculpating Starkey \u201clacked sufficient probative value\u201d; and (2) that the Commission did not give proper deference to its hearing officer\u2019s conclusions \u201cthat Starkey\u2019s exculpatory testimony was truthful.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b934-10\" pgmap=\"934\">Neither of the majority\u2019s conclusions is supported by the record. First, while the majority finds that Blye\u2019s testimony was lacking in probative value, the hearing officer found that \u201cthe evidence of Marilyn Blye was the most probative gathered in this case\u201d and that \u201cthere is no reason to doubt the investigators\u2019 recantation of Blye\u2019s statement.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b934-11\" pgmap=\"934(83) 935(327)\">Furthermore, tenuous reasons are given by the majority in concluding that Blye\u2019s testimony was lacking in probative value. They are (1) Blye was the target of a criminal investigation at the time her statements were made; (2) Blye made the statements while being interviewed at a police station and at the office of an investigator; (3) Blye believed that Starkey was responsible for her discharge; (4) Starkey cooperated with agents who were investigating Blye; and (5) \u201cone of the agents initially testified that Blye merely said she thought that Starkey admitted being guilty of fraud.\u201d As to (1), there is nothing to indicate that Blye was the target of a criminal investigation. Investigator McDermott testified that at the time of the first interview with her, he and the other officers \u201cwere interested in claims that she may have been involved in which could have been false,\u201d and it was at the second interview that she was asked whether other employees were involved in filing false claims; as to (2) the place at which the interviews were had with Blye have no relevance whatsoever; as to (3), the fact that Blye believed Starkey was responsible for her discharge would only go to her credibility and has little significance because it was drawn by the majority from one statement to the investigator that she said Starkey was responsible for the loss of her job and at the same time told him that she was not out to get Starkey, and there is nothing else in the record indicating that Blye may have been resentful or which even remotely suggests that Blye\u2019s statements inculpating Starkey were untruthful; as to (4), there is nothing to indicate that Blye knew that Starkey had cooperated with anyone investigating her (Blye); and, as to (5), no agent testified, as stated by the majority, \u201cthat Blye merely said she thought Starkey admitted being guilty of fraud.\u201d The only testimony in this regard was from Investigator McDermott, who stated that during a second interview with Blye \u2014 when he asked her whether other employees were involved in filing false claims \u2014 she replied as follows: \u201c[T]hat Josie Starkey had filed a false claim for her mother. She said that Josie Starkey brought the claim to her while she was at the computer terminal. She said she thought that Miss Starkey stated that her mother had not been working as listed in the claim.\u201d McDermott testified also that:</p> <blockquote id=\"b935-5\" pgmap=\"935\">\u201cBlye stated that Starky [sic] brought the claim to her, and that Blye input it. Blye stated that she knew that Mrs. McCoy was not working as claimed, and Mrs. Starky [sic] just merely laughed. Starky [sic] repeated to Blye that to file a claim for unemployment compensation, which would be incorrect, a false claim, all that was needed was a social security number, and to put the wages in by affidavit. She also stated that Starky [sic] also told her that an address or addresses would be needed to which the employer\u2019s notices would be sent. These would be the employer\u2019s notices of the last employing unit, and the base period employer. She also stated that it was called an S.U.A. claim. Blye stated that just because the address was incomplete, did not mean that the notices to the employers would not go out. They would go out, but would be returned by the post office as undeliverable if the addresses were incomplete. I believe that was the extent of the conversation with Marilyn Blye at that time.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b935-6\" pgmap=\"935(9) 936(25)\">Investigator Tobias corroborated that testimony of McDermott, and the testimony of both investigators concerning the statements of Blye were admitted by the hearing officer under the declaration against interest exception to the hearsay rule.</p> <p id=\"b936-5\" pgmap=\"936\">In the light of the above, it appears clear that the reasons given by the majority do not support its conclusion that Marilyn Blye\u2019s inculpatory testimony lacked probative value.</p> <p id=\"b936-6\" pgmap=\"936\">The second conclusion given in support of the majority\u2019s decision was \u201cthat the hearing officer\u2019s determination that Starkey\u2019s exculpatory testimony was truthful is a finding which is entitled to deference.\u201d The record, however, discloses no finding that Starkey was truthful. Rather, after finding that a false claim was clearly entered on behalf of McCoy and that Starkey did not participate in the processing of that claim except to a very small degree, the hearing officer went on to find that Blye\u2019s statement \u201cindicated Starkey was actively engaged in the fraudulent scheme\u201d; that Blye \u201cindicated to the investigators that she and Starkey discussed how claims could be submitted fraudulently\u201d; and that Blye indicated that she held Starkey responsible for her (Blye\u2019s) losing her job. The hearing officer then concluded that \u201cfortunately for Starkey this [the resentment of Blye towards Starkey] absolves her [Starkey] of all liability.\u201d Thus, although the hearing officer found that McCoy\u2019s claim was clearly false and that Starkey had participated at least to a small degree, he absolved her of all liability because of a conclusion, reached by pure conjecture, that Blye\u2019s inculpatory statements were the result of resentment towards Starkey. Blye, of course, did not testify, and the only reference to possible resentment appears in the testimony of Investigator McDermott that Blye said that she was not friendly with Starkey because she thought Starkey was responsible for the loss of her job, but that she (Blye) never said she would get even with Starkey. This testimony could not support the finding of the hearing officer that Blye\u2019s resentment was so strong that it absolved Starkey of all liability.</p> <p id=\"b936-7\" pgmap=\"936\">It was only after this absolution that the hearing officer found that \u201cStarkey\u2019s testimony was credible,\u201d which is not a finding that her testimony was truthful, as Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 330 (5th ed. 1979) defines credible as \u201c[w]orthy of belief; entitled to credit.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b936-8\" pgmap=\"936(102) 937(51)\">Moreover, although concluding that the Commission did not give proper deference to a finding of the hearing officer, the majority gives no deference to the finding of the Commission that Starkey\u2019s defense was not credible even though its members are presumed to have broad experience in the field of labor-management relations. (See Penasquitos Village, Inc. v. NLRB (9th Cir. 1977), 565 F.2d 1074; NLRB v. Miller Redwood Co. (9th Cir. 1969), 407 F.2d 1366.) In this regard, Miller Redwood appears to be particularly significant. There, the trial examiner and the Board disagreed upon the employer\u2019s motive for discharging an employee. The court upheld the Board\u2019s position, stating \u201c[t]he disagreement related solely to the inferences to be drawn from the whole record and the proper application of the statute. In such a case, \u2018the presumptively broader gauge and experience of members of the Board have a meaningful role.\u2019 \u201d 407 F.2d 1366, 1369.</p> <p id=\"b937-4\" pgmap=\"937\">For a judgment of an administrative agency to be against the manifest weight of the evidence, it must appear that opposite conclusions are clearly evident; it is not enough that an opposite conclusion might be reasonable because, if the issue is merely one of conflicting testimony and credibility of witnesses, the agency\u2019s determination should be sustained. (Keen v. Police Board (1979), 73 Ill. App. 3d 65, 391 N.E.2d 190; Walker v. State Board of Elections (1979), 72 Ill. App. 3d 877, 391 N.E.2d 507.) Furthermore, while the majority cites Adolph Coors Co. v. FTC (10th Cir. 1974), 497 F.2d 1178, cert. denied (1975), 419 U.S. 1105, 42 L. Ed. 2d 801, 95 S. Ct. 775, for the proposition that where a hearing officer and a commission reach opposite results upon review of the finding of the former, the hearing officer\u2019s findings should be \u201cgiven such weight as they merit within reason and in the light of judicial experience\u201d (497 F.2d 1178, 1184), the majority does not discuss the application of the quoted language to the situation here. We note that it was also held in Coors that the findings of the hearing officer \u201care not sacrosanct and are not necessarily binding on the Commission or the court.\u201d 497 F. 2d 1178, 1184.</p> <p id=\"b937-9\" pgmap=\"937\">In any event, in its decision the Commission did not disagree with the finding that Starkey\u2019s testimony was credible; rather, it found her defense was not worthy of belief, stating that \u201ctaking the record as a whole it is clear that petitioner has proved the charges. We cannot accept the proposition that respondent, an experienced employee, could have by innocent happenstance processed a fraudulent claim for her mother. Respondent\u2019s defense is not credible.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b937-10\" pgmap=\"937(152) 938(271)\">The record discloses that a person seeking benefits was required to fill out an application form, to execute an affidavit of wages, and to furnish proof of those wages, which was done here by check stubs;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that wage information is then verified by mailing a copy of the affidavit to the employer; that this is accomplished by entering the affidavit of wages into the computer which generates the verification letter sent to the employer; that McCoy testified two forms were presented to her \u2014 one being an application which she said was filled out by Starkey and the other a form filled out by a person she did not know \u2014 but that she (McCoy) made no entries and did no writing on either form; and that both investigators testified Starkey told them she had prepared the application which was processed on behalf of McCoy, and Starkey made no denial of this testimony. Starkey testified that she only partially filled out the application of her mother; that she did not (1) place the mark in the dependent child\u2019s box \u2014 which gave her mother additional benefits, although there was no such child \u2014 ; (2) place the dash which appears in the place provided for the claimant\u2019s signature (the application was not signed); or (3) erase what appears to be her signature \u2014 \u201cJ. Starkey\u201d \u2014 at the bottom of the application. Starkey admitted that she wrote in both the name of H. Holmquist as her mother\u2019s employer in 1976 and the date of August 27, 1976, as her mother\u2019s last day of employment by the Holmquists. (The application was dated September 13, 1976.) She stated also that the address of the Holmquists was not written in the application by her, although she had also worked for them a few days that year. (The address does not appear on the form, and it should be noted that the failure to provide an address would prevent a certification letter being sent to an employer.) Moreover, Starkey said that she knew her mother should have signed the application and did not know why she had not done so, and that although Starkey testified at the hearing that she personally knew her mother had worked for the Holmquists until August 27,1976, the date she (Starkey) entered in the application as her mother\u2019s last date of employment by the Holmquists, it is clear that her mother did not work for them for at least 6 or 7 years prior to the date of the claim.</p> <p id=\"b938-5\" pgmap=\"938\">Thus, it was established that false wage information and false or nonexistent wage verification concerning McCoy must have been put into the computer, and from Blye\u2019s testimony that Starkey was actively engaged in the fraud scheme in that she came to her (Blye) with the application of McCoy and told her (Blye) to put it through the computer. The initials \u201cMB\u201d appearing at the bottom of McCoy\u2019s application are apparently those of Marilyn Blye, and the erased signature \u201cJ. Starkey\u201d is still discernible on the application. Having this and the other evidence received at the hearing, some of which is set forth above, the experienced members of the Commission found that her defense was not credible. The Commission found, in effect, that her defense of knowing nothing about her mother\u2019s false claim except that she filled out a portion of the application was not worthy of belief, and it appears to me that this conclusion is amply supported by the record. In any event, it cannot fairly be said that a decision opposite to that of the Commission is clearly evident.</p> <p id=\"b938-6\" pgmap=\"938\">In the light of the above, it is my belief that there is no record basis for the finding of the majority that the decision of the Commission was against the manifest weight of the evidence, and I would affirm the Commission\u2019s decision.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b937-11\" pgmap=\"937\"> The check stubs could not be found and were not introduced at the hearing.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
