The defendant, Jon Swebilius, was charged with possession of child pornography in the first degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 2007) \u00a7 53a-196d (a) and was arrested thirty-two days after the issuance of a warrant for his arrest and thirteen days after the expiration of the applicable five year statute of limitations for that offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant moved to dismiss the charge on the ground that the prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations because, he claimed, the delay in the execution of the warrant was unreasonable.

We granted the defendant's petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following question: \"Did the Appellate Court properly affirm the trial court's decision denying the defendant's motion to dismiss pursuant to ...\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   ... ?\" (Citation omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Swebilius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=318%20Conn.%20907\">\n    318 Conn. 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%20635\">\n    122 A.3d 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). We conclude that the Appellate Court incorrectly determined that a thirty-two day delay in the execution of an arrest warrant, where the warrant was executed after the expiration of the limitation period, is reasonable as\n   a matter of law such that the state was under no obligation to present evidence demonstrating that the delay was not objectively unreasonable and, therefore, excusable. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court with direction to remand the case to the trial court for a hearing on whether the delay in the execution of the warrant was reasonable under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following undisputed facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. On May 28, 2008, the Connecticut State Police executed a search warrant on room number 59 at the Meriden Inn, the defendant's place of residence at the time. During the search, the police seized thirty-four computer related items, which were submitted on the same day to the state forensic laboratory for analysis. The police did not receive the results of the forensic analysis until April 2, 2013, and another month elapsed before they secured a warrant for the defendant's arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The arrest warrant was issued on May 9, 2013, nineteen days before the expiration of the five year limitation period of General Statutes (Rev. to 2007) \u00a7 54-193 (b). A short time after the limitation period expired, the defendant contacted the state police seeking the return of the property seized from his residence on May 28, 2008. As a result of this inquiry, the defendant learned about the warrant for his arrest, and, on June 10, 2013, he voluntarily surrendered to the state police.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following his arrest, the defendant moved to dismiss the charge, claiming that, even though the arrest warrant had been issued within the statutory limitation period, the delay in its execution was unreasonable, and, therefore, the prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations. Prior to the hearing on his motion to dismiss, the defendant entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere subject to the trial court's ruling on the motion to dismiss. Thereafter, a hearing on that motion was held before the court,\n   <em>\n    S. Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J\n   </em>\n   . At the hearing, the defendant presented uncontested evidence that he had lived openly in Connecticut and was available for arrest throughout the five year limitation period. The state adduced no evidence. Following the hearing, the trial court found that the defendant \"was not elusive, was available in the area and did not evade at the time service was made.\" The court also found that the state police \"did not attempt execution of the [arrest] warrant before June 10, 2013, and only executed the warrant on that date upon the [defendant's] surrendering himself at the police barracks.\" Although the state presented no evidence as to the reasons for the delay in the execution of the arrest warrant, it argued that the delay was not unreasonable because of its short duration, because the defendant suffered no prejudice as a result thereof, and because there had been \"no showing\" by the defendant \"of any lack of due diligence\" on the part of the police in executing the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The trial court agreed with the state that the issuance of the arrest warrant, in this case, tolled the statute of limitations. Although it recognized that, under\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   , \"there is no per se approach as to what constitutes a reasonable time to execute a warrant,\" the court was unable to find \"that a period of time as [short] as [thirty-two] days would be considered unreasonable,\" noting that delays found by other courts to be unreasonable\n   typically involved significantly longer periods of time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the court concluded that, \"[a]lthough the police efforts might be characterized as [minimal] or nonexistent ... given the very short period of time that elapsed from the signing of the warrant to the execution of service, the police actions resulted in a timely commencement of prosecution.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming that the trial court improperly relied solely on the length of the delay in finding that the thirty-two day delay\n   was reasonable. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Swebilius\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=158%20Conn.%20App.%20418\">\n    158 Conn.App. at 419-20, 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=119%20A.3d%20601\">\n    119 A.3d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Appellate Court reasoned that\n   <em>\n    Kruelski\n   </em>\n   established that some delays may be so de minimis as to require no justification by the state, and that the thirty-two day delay in the present case fell into that category. See id., at 428,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=119%20A.3d%20601\">\n    119 A.3d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal to this court, the defendant argues that the Appellate Court's conclusion that the delay was sufficiently brief as to require no justification ignores this court's express rejection of a per se rule in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"498043\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/202/443/\">\n    202 Conn. at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=521%20A.2d%201034\">\n    521 A.2d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and this court's admonition therein that the failure to execute a warrant \"for even a short period of time\" might be unreasonable in certain circumstances.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=521%20A.2d%201034\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The defendant also argues that allowing the state to extend the statute of limitations without any showing of due diligence undermines the right of defendants to fair and timely notice of the charges against them, as well as the values of repose and finality embodied in such statutes. The defendant further contends that the Appellate Court's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Kruelski\n   </em>\n   was misplaced because, in that case, the police executed the arrest warrant on the day they received it, and, therefore, the court's conclusion that the delay was reasonable as a matter of law must be interpreted in light of those facts rather than as evidence that the court intended to create an exception to\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The state responds that, even if delays in the execution of a warrant require justification in all cases, regardless of the brevity of the delay,\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   places the burden on the defendant to prove that the delay\n   was unreasonable. Thus, when the defendant fails to produce evidence demonstrating that the police failed to act with due diligence in serving a warrant, the delay must be presumed to be reasonable. Accordingly, the state maintains that cases such as\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Soldi\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3408870\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/92/849/#p857\">\n    92 Conn.App. at 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=887%20A.2d%20436\">\n    887 A.2d 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which shift the burden to the state to justify delays in the execution of a warrant once the defendant meets his burden of establishing his availability for arrest during the relevant time period, are antithetical to the holding in\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   and should be overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We agree with the defendant that the Appellate Court incorrectly determined that some delays in the execution of an arrest warrant may be so brief as to be reasonable as a matter of law for the purpose of tolling the applicable statute of\n   limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We further conclude that the burden shifting framework that the Appellate Court applied in\n   <em>\n    Soldi\n   </em>\n   and other cases is fully consistent with\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   and properly allocates burdens between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   General Statutes (Rev. to 2007) \u00a7 54-193 (b) provides in relevant part that \"[n]o person may be prosecuted for any offense, except a capital felony, a class A felony or a violation of section 53a-54d or 53a-169, for which the punishment is or may be imprisonment in excess of one year, except within five years next after the offense has been committed. ...\" In\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"498043\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/202/443/\">\n    202 Conn. at 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=521%20A.2d%201034\">\n    521 A.2d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which the applicable time limitation for the misdemeanor offenses charged was\n   one year, this court was asked to determine whether the mere issuance of an arrest warrant within the limitation period was sufficient to commence a prosecution for purposes of \u00a7 54-193, thereby tolling the limitation period. In that case, the trial court had rejected the motion of the defendant, Ronald L. Crawford, to dismiss the charges as being beyond the statute of limitations when the arrest warrant for Crawford had been issued approximately two months after the commission of the charged offenses-well within the one year limitation period-but not executed for more than two years after the offenses were committed and more than one year after the expiration of the statute of limitations.

A reasonable period of time is a question of fact that will depend on the circumstances of each case. If the facts indicate that an accused consciously eluded the authorities, or for other reasons was difficult to apprehend, these factors will be considered in determining what time is reasonable. If, on the other hand, the accused did not relocate or take evasive action to avoid apprehension, failure to execute an arrest warrant for even a short period of time might be unreasonable\n   and fail to toll the statute of limitations.\" Id., at 451,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=521%20A.2d%201034\">\n    521 A.2d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, however, and because Crawford presented no evidence suggesting that the warrant in that case was not executed with due diligence, we were unable to conclude that the delay was unreasonable, and, accordingly, we upheld the trial court's judgment. See id., at 451-53,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=521%20A.2d%201034\">\n    521 A.2d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In light of the inadequacy of the record in\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   , we had no occasion to consider what kind of evidence a defendant must present to support a statute of limitations defense.

In\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   , we simply held that the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense in Connecticut, such that a defendant is required to present some evidence \"concerning the reason for the delay in the execution of the warrant ....\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"498043\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/202/443/\">\n    202 Conn. at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=521%20A.2d%201034\">\n    521 A.2d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Doing so allocates burdens efficiently by requiring each party to bring forth evidence uniquely within its knowledge. Such a burden shifting model is also consistent with the distribution of burdens with respect to other affirmative defenses in Connecticut, few of which\n   require a defendant to present affirmative evidence of matters beyond his personal ken.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   To dispense with\n   that model in the present case would needlessly impose a significant burden on the defendant-and the judicial system-when the state is in a far better position to determine what efforts were undertaken to ensure the defendant's prompt arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This burden shifting scheme also encourages diligence by law enforcement officials in providing timely notice of charges to defendants. Although we decline to specify the precise actions that they must undertake to serve a warrant with due diligence, or the precise timeline within which they must act, such officials must present some credible and persuasive factual basis for inaction when they fail to observe the statute of limitations. This requirement is consistent with the principle\n   that, when a judicial doctrine, \"for all practical purposes, extends the statute [of limitations] beyond its stated term,\" that doctrine \"should be applied in only limited circumstances ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Toussie\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12050514\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/112/#p115\">\n    397 U.S. 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 115,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12050514\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/112/#p115\">\n    90 S.Ct. 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12050514\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/112/#p115\">\n    25 L.Ed.2d 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970) ; see\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12050514\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/112/#p115\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (considering doctrine of continuing offenses).

See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Derks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=155%20Conn.%20App.%2087\">\n    155 Conn.App. 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 89-90, 95,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20A.3d%201157\">\n    108 A.3d 1157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (delay of nearly twelve years reasonable where defendant moved out of state), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20Conn.%20930\">\n    315 Conn. 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20A.3d%20432\">\n    110 A.3d 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). Indeed, typically, the defendant's evasive actions have been a significant or dispositive reason for the delay. See footnote 14 of this opinion. Consequently, these cases do not require us to conclude that shorter periods of delay are necessarily reasonable once a defendant has established his availability for arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, we agree with the defendant that a rule making some delays reasonable without any showing of due diligence is inconsistent with the purposes of statutes of limitations. As we have observed, such statutes serve several functions, among them \"(1) prevent[ing] the unexpected enforcement of stale and fraudulent claims by allowing persons after the lapse of a reasonable time, to plan their affairs with a reasonable degree of certainty, free from the disruptive burden of protracted and unknown potential liability, and (2) ... aid[ing] in the search for truth that may be impaired by the loss of evidence, whether by death or disappearance of witnesses, fading memories, disappearance of documents or otherwise.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    St. Paul Travelers Cos.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kuehl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343748\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/800/#p809\">\n    299 Conn. 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 809-10,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20A.3d%20852\">\n    12 A.3d 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) ; see also Model Penal Code and Commentaries, supra, \u00a7 1.06, comment, p. 86. It is precisely because of these concerns that we require statutes of limitations to be strictly construed in favor of the accused. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Whiteman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"501448\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/204/98/#p103\">\n    204 Conn. 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 103,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=526%20A.2d%20869\">\n    526 A.2d 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). Thus, although the precise length of any statutory limitation period is necessarily somewhat arbitrary, such statutes nevertheless reflect the will of the legislature that, at least in the absence of special or compelling circumstances, the limitation period shall serve\n   as a firm bar to prosecution. See, e.g., id., at 100,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=526%20A.2d%20869\">\n    526 A.2d 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (prosecution for sexual assault was barred when warrant was issued ten days after expiration of statute of limitations). It is also well established that statutes of limitations are not primarily concerned with demonstrable prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Woodtke\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4263171\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/130/734/#p740\">\n    130 Conn.App. at 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20A.3d%20699\">\n    25 A.3d 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, after the passage of the specified period of time, evidence of prejudice becomes less important than the virtues of predictability, repose, and societal stability.

We have concluded merely that, if the defendant can demonstrate his availability during the statutory period, the state must make some effort to serve the arrest warrant before the relevant statute of limitations expires, or to offer some evidence explaining why its failure to do so was reasonable under the circumstances. Indeed, in cases involving relatively brief delays, evidence of a legitimate need to prioritize competing public safety responsibilities may well be sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the dictates of\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   That fact\n   sensitive determination, however, is a matter properly within the reasoned judgment of the fact finder.\n   In the present case, the trial court relied solely on the length of the delay in ruling in the state's favor. As we have explained; see footnote 5 of this opinion; in doing so, the trial court effectively applied an incorrect legal standard. Because the standard employed by the trial court was incorrect, the state had no need to adduce evidence justifying the delay. Accordingly, on remand, the state must be afforded the opportunity to demonstrate that it made reasonable efforts to execute the warrant before the expiration of the statute of limitations or to explain why its failure to do so was reasonable under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the case to that court for further proceedings according to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The applicable statute of limitations is General Statutes (Rev. to 2007) \u00a7 54-193 (b), which provides in relevant part: \"No person may be prosecuted for any offense, except a capital felony, a class A felony or a violation of section 53a-54d or 53a-169, for which the punishment is or may be imprisonment in excess of one year, except within five years next after the offense has been committed. ...\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The arrest warrant states that 119 images and 30 video recordings appearing to depict child pornography were recovered from the defendant's storage media.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The trial court found that counsel for the defendant learned of the arrest warrant, by telephone, from the police on May 31, 2013.

But the court in that case provided no analysis supporting its conclusion, and nothing in the decision in that case indicates that the majority based its decision on any facts other than the length of the delay.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    More in line with the approach that we adopted in\n    <em>\n     Crawford\n    </em>\n    is the approach that the Kansas Court of Appeals took in\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Divers\n    </em>\n    , Kansas Court of Appeals, Docket No. 106312,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204794603\">\n     2012 WL 4794603\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (October 5, 2012), in which the court considered a twenty-four day delay between issuance and execution, including five days after the statute of limitations had expired.
