Brooks,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeal from the trial court's\n   rendering of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, the Commissioner of Revenue Services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court upheld the decision of the defendant to deny the plaintiffs' request for a refund of estate taxes paid by the estate of the decedent, Helen B. Brooks (decedent). On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court incorrectly concluded that the defendant had statutory authority to include in the decedent's gross estate the value of certain qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) in which the decedent enjoyed a life interest and levy an estate tax upon such property. The plaintiffs also assert that the defendant's construction of the statute resulted in a violation of the plaintiffs' due process rights. We disagree with the plaintiffs and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The material facts in this case are not in dispute. The decedent died on September 22, 2009, domiciled in Connecticut. She was predeceased by her husband, Everett Brooks (Everett), who died January 31, 2000. Everett was a resident of Florida at the time of his death. At that time, Florida and Connecticut each had an estate tax based on the amount of the federal credit allowed for state death taxes. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202011\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) ; General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 12-391;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20198.02\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 198.02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). Everett's will was probated in Florida. Pursuant\n   to Everett's will, two trusts were created to hold certain assets of the estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The decedent, acting as executor of Everett's estate, elected to qualify both trusts as QTIP marital deduction\n   trusts. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202056\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7) (2000). Pursuant to Everett's will, the decedent enjoyed a beneficial life interest in the assets of the trusts. Everett's will also granted the decedent a testamentary limited power of appointment to direct the remainder of the trusts among Everett's children. In the absence of such an appointment by the decedent, the principal of the trusts was to be distributed according to Everett's will. The trusts consisted of intangible personal property-namely, cash and publicly traded stocks and bonds. The decedent and Attorney Herbert J. Hummers were appointed trustees of the trusts. Hummers was given the power to invade the principal of the trusts for the benefit of the decedent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The decedent did not have the power to invade the principal of the trust. In or about 2002, the decedent moved to Connecticut and lived in the state continuously until her death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After the decedent's death, the plaintiffs timely filed a request for extension and made an estimated tax payment of $1,435,000. On November 4, 2010, the plaintiffs timely filed a Connecticut estate tax return for the decedent's estate that intentionally omitted the value of the trusts and claimed a refund in the amount of $988,827. The plaintiffs included a statement on the return asserting that the value of those assets was not properly includable in the Connecticut gross estate of the decedent. The defendant's audit division disallowed\n   the plaintiffs' request for a refund. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a timely appeal to the defendant's appellate division, which affirmed. The plaintiffs then filed a timely appeal from that decision to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-395(a)(1) and 12-554.

On cross motions for summary judgment, the trial court concluded that the assets of the trusts were properly included in the decedent's gross estate and, therefore, were subject to the estate tax. In addition, the trial court concluded that the imposition of the tax upon the estate did not violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. Accordingly, the trial court denied the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and granted the defendant's motion. The trial court then rendered judgment thereon in favor of the defendant. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n   \"Because the decision to grant a motion for summary judgment is a question of law, our review of the trial court's decision is plenary.\"\n   <em>\n    Dattco, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Transportation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488780\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/823/#p44\">\n    324 Conn. 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 44,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488780\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/151/823/#p44\">\n    151 A.3d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). \"On appeal, we must determine whether the legal conclusions reached by the trial court are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision of the trial court.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Cefaratti\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Aranow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485080\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/837/#p645\">\n    321 Conn. 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 645,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485080\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/837/#p645\">\n    138 A.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We begin by discussing the background of the federal tax concepts implicated in the present case. In 1981, Congress enacted \"the most dramatic and expansive\n   liberalization of the [m]arital [d]eduction in history.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Clayton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Internal Revenue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11294396\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/976/1486/#p1492\">\n    976 F.2d 1486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1492 (5th Cir. 1992). Such a feat was achieved in two ways. First, Congress provided for the unlimited marital deduction. Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, Pub. L. 97-34, \u00a7 403 (a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20Stat.%20301\">\n    95 Stat. 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202056\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Federal law did not, however, previously allow for the deduction of terminable interests.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Clayton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Internal Revenue\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 1492. Mindful of rising divorce and remarriage rates, Congress created an exception to the general rule against allowing a deduction for the interspousal transfer of terminable interests so that a decedent may exert more control over the ultimate disposition of certain assets while still financially providing for the surviving spouse with such assets unburdened by front end taxation. See id., at 1492-93 and n.26. Thus, the concept of QTIP was born. Id., at 1493.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Federal tax law currently operates by granting the marital deduction to the first to die spouse in the amount of the value of certain property, subject to certain qualifications, so long as the first to die spouse gives a beneficial life interest in such property to the surviving spouse.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202056\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In order to ensure that the\n   property does not pass to the remainder\n   beneficiaries untaxed, the federal tax code imposes a tax upon the happening of two events. During the life of the surviving spouse, any disposition of a qualifying life interest in property is treated as a transfer of the remainder interest in such property for purposes of the gift tax. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202519\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   To the extent that the surviving spouse did not make any inter vivos disposition of any qualifying life interest in property, the entire value of the property in which the surviving spouse enjoyed a qualifying life interest is included in his or her gross estate and is treated as property passing therefrom. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202044\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In short, a fictional\n   transfer occurs from the first to die spouse to the surviving spouse, and a second fictional transfer occurs upon the death of the surviving spouse to the remainder beneficiaries. We note that, in the present case, it is undisputed that the assets contained within the trusts established pursuant to Everett's will were properly included in the decedent's federal gross estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   First, we address the plaintiffs' claim that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-391(c)(3),\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   the assets contained within the trusts are not includable in the decedent's gross estate. Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that the relevant federal estate tax provisions have been incorporated into the state estate tax provisions and, therefore, the assets contained within the trusts form part of the decedent's state gross estate only if the state allowed a deduction with respect to the transfer of such property to the decedent following Everett's death. The defendant claims that such an interpretation of \u00a7 12-391(c)(3) is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the provision-namely, that the gross estate for state estate tax purposes is the same as the gross estate for federal estate tax purposes. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiffs' claim implicates a matter of statutory construction. Our standard of review for statutory construction\n   claims is well established. \"When construing a statute, [the court's] fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.... In other words, [the court seeks] to\n   determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply.... In seeking to determine that meaning ... [General Statutes] \u00a7 1-2z directs [the court] first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered....

The plain language of the statute requires nothing more than the gross estate as reported on the federal estate tax return. The construction urged by the plaintiffs would result in a value of the gross estate for state estate tax purposes that would differ from the value of the gross estate for federal estate tax purposes. Specifically, looking at whether Connecticut deducted the value of a QTIP trust from the estate of the first to die spouse in order to ascertain whether such assets are to be included in the state gross estate of the surviving spouse would not be \"for federal estate tax purposes.\" General Statutes \u00a7 12-391(c)(3). Thus, according to \u00a7 12-391(c)(3), if assets are included in a decedent's federal gross estate, they are included in his or her state gross estate as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In addition, this construction is buttressed by \u00a7 12-391(f)(2), which provides: \"An election under said [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202056\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7) ] may be made\n   <em>\n    for state estate tax purposes\n   </em>\n   regardless of whether any\n   such election is made for federal estate tax purposes. The value of the gross estate shall include the value of any property in which the decedent had a qualifying income interest for life for which an election was made under this subsection.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, the legislature has created a separate state QTIP election and inclusion provision. Construing \u00a7 12-391(c)(3) to require the state to have first granted a deduction for the value of a QTIP trust from the gross estate of the first to die\n   spouse in order to properly include the value of such in assets in the gross estate of the surviving spouse would, in essence, create a state QTIP election by incorporation that would render a separate election under \u00a7 12-391(f)(2) superfluous. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Revenue Services\n   </em>\n   , supra, 324 Conn. at 309,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488859\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/152/488/#p307\">\n    152 A.3d 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"statutes shall not be construed to render any sentence, clause, or phrase superfluous or meaningless\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Accordingly, we conclude that the plain language of the statute, when read in context with other related provisions, clearly provides that the assets contained within the trusts at issue are includable in the decedent's gross estate pursuant to \u00a7 12-391(c)(3) because they were included in the decedent's gross estate for federal estate tax purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Not advancing a textual basis for their construction of the provision, the plaintiffs rely principally upon case law for their claim that the federal estate tax code is incorporated into \u00a7 12-391(c)(3). At first blush, our holding in\n   <em>\n    Berkley\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gavin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"545457\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/253/761/#p772\">\n    253 Conn. 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 772-75,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=756%20A.2d%20248\">\n    756 A.2d 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), would appear to strongly support the plaintiffs' position in the present case. In\n   <em>\n    Berkley\n   </em>\n   , the issue was whether the phrase \"as determined for federal income tax purposes\" in the statute defining adjusted gross income; General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 12-701 (a) (19); \"means as determined in accordance with federal income tax methodology, or as reported on a taxpayer's federal income tax return.\"\n   <em>\n    Berkley\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gavin\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 772,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=756%20A.2d%20248\">\n    756 A.2d 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In essence, the incorporation of the federal tax benefit rule resulted in a \"\n   <em>\n    Connecticut\n   </em>\n   tax benefit rule ....\" (Emphasis in original.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20111\">\n    Id., at 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=756%20A.2d%20248\">\n    756 A.2d 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Sullivan, J.\n   </em>\n   , dissenting).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is precisely the\n   interpretation the plaintiffs seek in the present case-namely, that the inclusion of a QTIP marital deduction trust in a decedent's state gross estate requires the state to have granted a corresponding deduction to the estate of the first to die spouse. Justice Sullivan, in his dissent in\n   <em>\n    Berkley\n   </em>\n   , pointed out that the result reached by the majority in that case was inconsistent with the plain language of the statute because such a modification of Connecticut adjusted gross income was not \"for federal income tax purposes ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

Indeed, as a result of the holding in\n   <em>\n    Berkley\n   </em>\n   , the legislature subsequently clarified the definition of adjusted gross income by adding the phrase \"and as properly reported on such person's federal income tax return.\" Public Acts, Spec.

Sess., June, 2001, No. 01-6, \u00a7 36 (stating legislative intent).\n   To construe the provision defining gross estate in the present case to incorporate the federal estate tax code would result, as Justice Sullivan pointed out in\n   <em>\n    Berkley\n   </em>\n   , in a construction inconsistent with the plain language of the relevant statute. We conclude, especially in light of the principles of \u00a7 1-2z, which was not in effect when\n   <em>\n    Berkley\n   </em>\n   was decided, that incorporation of federal tax statutes into our statutory provisions should be determined in the first instance with reference to the plain meaning of \u00a7 12-391(c)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Next, we disagree with the plaintiffs' contention that our holding in\n   <em>\n    New York Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Doubleday\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1561841\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/144/134/#p145\">\n    144 Conn. 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 145,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.2d%20192\">\n    128 A.2d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1956), incorporated all provisions of the federal estate tax into our estate tax code.

See Public Acts 2005, No. 05-251, \u00a7 69. The decedent's estate is being taxed under the present, stand-alone estate tax, not the pick up tax. Accordingly, we construe the present estate tax statute anew, unbound by this court's construction of a substantively different and inoperative tax statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In sum, we conclude that the value of the QTIP marital deduction trusts at issue in the present case are included in the decedent's gross estate for Connecticut estate tax purposes because those assets are included in the decedent's gross estate for federal estate tax purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We next address the plaintiffs' claim that \u00a7 12-391 does not permit the defendant to tax the assets contained within the QTIP marital deduction trusts because the decedent did not own the property subject to the tax. In particular, the plaintiffs claim that the statutory language in effect at the time of the decedent's death;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   General Statutes (Rev. to 2009) \u00a7 12-391(d)(3) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   limits the authority of the defendant to impose a tax upon intangible personal property to only such property owned by the decedent and that, therefore, the assets contained within the trusts at issue are not taxable. The defendant claims that No. 13-247, \u00a7 120, of the 2013 Public Acts (P.A. 13-247), and No. 14-155, \u00a7 12, of the 2014 Public Acts (P.A. 14-155), clarified the original intention of the legislature with respect to the meaning of the relevant provision and, therefore, applies retroactively. Specifically, P.A. 13-247, \u00a7 120, amended \u00a7 12-391(d)(3) to, inter alia, replace the words \"owned by the decedent\" with \"included in the gross estate of the decedent,\" and P.A. 14-155, \u00a7 12, expressly declared the legislative intent of P.A. 13-247, \u00a7 120, to be \"clarifying in nature and applicable to all open estates.\" The defendant points to the legislative history of both acts in support of his claim. The plaintiffs counter that, notwithstanding the legislature's belated attempt in P.A. 14-155 to declare its intent regarding the amendments, P.A. 13-247 amounted to a substantive change to the law that can only be applied prospectively. As evidence, the plaintiffs point to the effective date of January 1, 2013, contained in P.A. 13-257, \u00a7 120. The plaintiffs further claim that if \u00a7 12-391(d)(3) were construed in accordance with its plain meaning, it would be evident that the amendment amounted to a substantive change. The plaintiffs also dispute that the legislative history is sufficient to support the conclusion that the amendment was clarifying in nature. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We begin by discussing the legal standard we apply in determining whether the legislature intended statutory\n   amendments to be clarifying in nature. \"We presume that, in enacting a statute, the legislature intended a change in existing law....

Section 12 of P.A. 14-155 provides in relevant part: \"It is the intent of the General Assembly that the amendments made by section 120 of public act 13-247 to subsections (d) and (e) of section 12-391 of the general statutes, as amended by this act, are clarifying in nature and apply to all open estates.\" The plaintiffs concede that such expressions of legislative intent are often taken\n   as conclusive evidence of original legislative intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Nevertheless, the plaintiffs rightfully point out that, when the legislature enacted P.A. 13-247, \u00a7 120, it made\n   the provision applicable to the estates of decedents dying after January 1, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs argue that the express declaration of intent to clarify should not be given effect because it directly conflicts with the effective date of P.A. 13-247, \u00a7 120, and there is no other evidence that the legislature intended that amendment to be clarifying. Contrary to the plaintiffs' claim, the legislative history of P.A. 13-247, \u00a7 120, does support the conclusion that the amendatory language was, in fact, clarifying in nature. To be sure, the legislative history is scant, but it points in favor of the defendant. Senator John W. Fonfara, in response to a question from Senator L. Scott Frantz, remarked that the revision to the estate tax statute is \"technical and is consistent with how we've always implemented this procedure so it doesn't change the way Connecticut has implemented this provision previously.\" 56 S. Proc., Pt. 17, 2013 Sess., p. 5459.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   We have previously\n   recognized that testimony\n   in which amendatory language is described as technical tends to support the conclusion that the legislature intended the language to be clarifying. See\n   <em>\n    Greenwich Hospital\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gavin\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"913202\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/265/511/#p520\">\n    265 Conn. at 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=829%20A.2d%20810\">\n    829 A.2d 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, it is not disputed that the claims made by the plaintiffs in the present case, as well as other taxpayers, were the impetus behind P.A. 13-247, \u00a7 120. Thus, the amendment \"invokes the principle of statutory construction that [i]f the amendment was enacted soon after controversies arose as to the interpretation of the original act, it is logical to regard the amendment as a legislative interpretation of the original act ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Blasko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"498060\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/202/541/#p558\">\n    202 Conn. 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 558,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=522%20A.2d%20753\">\n    522 A.2d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Caron\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"546507\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/222/269/#p279\">\n    222 Conn. 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 279,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=610%20A.2d%20584\">\n    610 A.2d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, the plaintiffs claim that the plain meaning of the term \"owned by\" in General Statutes (Rev. to 2009)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00a7 12-391 operated as a substantive limitation on the state's authority to levy the estate tax on certain property included in the gross estate. Thus, according to the plaintiffs, notwithstanding the legislature's declaration of intent in P.A. 14-155, \u00a7 12, the amendatory language in P.A. 13-247, \u00a7 120, broadened the class of intangible personal property subject to the estate tax and, thereby, effected a substantive change to the law that must be applied prospectively. We acknowledge that, at some point, a change in the law is so substantial that, no matter how forcefully the legislature expresses its intent to clarify, the change must be regarded as substantive. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Blasko\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"498060\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/202/541/#p558\">\n    202 Conn. at 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=522%20A.2d%20753\">\n    522 A.2d 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[t]he legislature could not, even by extensive protestations of legislative intent, convert an act that is truly curative into one that is effectively clarifying\"). Nevertheless, the plaintiffs have failed to persuade us to discount the clear expression of legislative intent in the present case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, this is not a case in which the legislature \"attempt[ed] to clothe a retroactive substantive change in clarifying garb by, for example, attempting to 'clarify' the meaning of a statute to mean\n   something different from a court's repeated and consistent interpretation of the same statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Connecticut National Bank\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Giacomi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"69257\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/242/17/\">\n    242 Conn. 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 44 n.33,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=699%20A.2d%20101\">\n    699 A.2d 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). Furthermore, it is far from clear that the ordinary meaning of \"owned by\" furnished the proper statutory construction when that language was operative. A narrow construction of the phrase \"owned by\" would arguably operate to prevent the state from ever levying the estate\n   tax upon any qualifying life interest-whether the property is included in the gross estate because the decedent held a federally qualifying life interest in a trust under \u00a7 12-391 (c) (3) or a state qualifying life interest under \u00a7 12-391 (f) (2)-because, as the plaintiffs urge, the surviving spouse did not\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   the trust assets in which he or she enjoyed the life interest. Thus, we reject the plaintiffs' claim that the amendment effected such a significant change to the law that the only conclusion to be drawn, notwithstanding a declaration of express legislative intent to the contrary, is that the change was substantive. The effective date indicated in P.A. 13-247, \u00a7 120, is an outlier among all the evidence that points to the conclusion that the amendatory language was clarifying in nature. Accordingly, we conclude that P.A. 13-247, \u00a7 120, is clarifying in nature and, therefore, necessarily applies retroactively to the decedent's estate in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The plaintiffs also claim that retroactive application of the amended statute to the estate of the decedent would result in a violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.

Accordingly, we reject the plaintiffs' claim that the retroactive application of the amendment to the decedent's estate violates due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Lastly, we address the issue of whether, at the death of the decedent, a transfer of the assets contained within the QTIP marital deduction trusts occurred such that it was proper to levy the estate tax based on the value of those assets. By its terms, the Connecticut estate tax is a tax \"imposed upon the\n   <em>\n    transfer\n   </em>\n   of the estate of each person who at the time of death was a resident of this state.\" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 12-391(d)(1)(B). The plaintiffs claim that no transfer occurs at the death of a life beneficiary of a QTIP marital deduction trust; rather, a \"deemed\" or \"fictional\" transfer occurs in order to collect the tax that was deferred when the actual taxable transfer was made at the death of the first to die spouse. In other words, because Connecticut did not defer imposition of the estate tax upon Everett's actual transfer of assets into the trusts when he died in Florida, it cannot now properly tax the \"fictional\" transfer of those assets from the decedent's estate. As a result, according to the plaintiffs, the imposition of the estate tax on the decedent's estate in the present case results in an impermissible tax upon an out-of-state transfer in violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. The defendant\n   claims that the Connecticut estate tax is properly levied upon the transfer of the QTIP trust assets at the decedent's death. The defendant maintains that a transfer can be characterized by the\n   shift in legal relationships to property occasioned by death, and a tax on such shifts is a proper excise tax within the state's taxing authority. In turn, because the decedent was a domiciliary of the state at her death, the defendant maintains that imposing the tax on this transfer comports with the due process clause. We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The underlying basis for the assets of these trusts being included in the decedent's gross estate is that those assets qualified as QTIP under the federal tax code. See part II of this opinion. But in order to be very clear, we set aside the fictions of the QTIP provisions. The defendant seeks to levy the estate tax on certain assets in which the decedent enjoyed a life interest. The issue that we must resolve is whether the defendant may impose the estate tax based on the value of trust assets in which a decedent enjoyed only a life interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As an initial matter, it is clear that the legislature intended \"transfer\" to be construed as broadly as possible. As the discussion in part II of this opinion demonstrates, the legislature intended for all property in the federal gross estate to be included in the state gross estate. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-391(c)(3). Second, as the discussion in part III of this opinion demonstrates, \u00a7 12-391(d)(3), as amended, reveals a clear legislative intent to calculate and levy the estate tax upon all intangible personal property included in the gross estate to the greatest extent permitted by the federal constitution. It would be illogical for the legislature to have called for the inclusion of QTIP marital deduction trusts in the gross estate of the decedent, but also have intended a narrow definition of \"transfer\" that would operate to prevent the defendant from levying the tax on the value of such property. Accordingly,\n   \"transfer\" must be construed to embrace the shifting in relationships to property attendant to the death of a life beneficiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The crux of the plaintiffs' statutory claims in the present case is that the defendant's construction of the estate tax statute results in the imposition of an unconstitutional tax upon the decedent's estate. The plaintiffs are correct \"that this court has a duty to construe statutes, whenever possible, to avoid constitutional infirmities ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734112\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/287/237/#p245\">\n    287 Conn. 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 245,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=947%20A.2d%20307\">\n    947 A.2d 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=555%20U.S.%20970\">\n    555 U.S. 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20S.%20Ct.%20464\">\n    129 S.Ct. 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=172%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20328\">\n    172 L.Ed.2d 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). \"[W]hen called [on] to interpret a statute, we will search for an effective and constitutional construction that reasonably accords with the legislature's underlying intent.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=172%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20328\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Accordingly, we turn to the issue of whether this construction of the estate tax statute is constitutionally infirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We first set forth the appropriate standard of review. \"With respect to a statutory challenge on constitutional grounds, [a] validly enacted statute carries with it a strong presumption of constitutionality, [and] those who challenge its constitutionality must sustain the heavy burden of proving its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt....

In order to effectuate social and economic policy, legislators have crafted ever more complex tax laws than\n   those that simply tax the transfer of title to property at death. For example, one court described the concept of QTIP as one that had been invented by Congress \"[o]ut of thin air and from whole cloth,\" noting that \"[i]f unlimiting the [m]arital [d]eduction was a flight into the wild blue yonder, Congress truly slipped the surly bonds of earth with the advent of QTIP.\" (Footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Estate of Clayton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Internal Revenue\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11294396\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/976/1486/#p1492\">\n    976 F.2d at 1493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Connecticut, too, seeks to impose the estate tax when federally qualified terminable interest property leaves the marital unit, irrespective of whether this state, another state, or no state deducted the value of that property from the taxable estate of the first to die spouse. \"Nothing can be less helpful than for courts to go\n   beyond the\n   <em>\n    extremely limited restrictions\n   </em>\n   that the [c]onstitution places upon the states and to inject themselves in a merely negative way into the delicate processes of fiscal [policymaking].

The Office of Legislative Research, in its bill analysis, described P.A. 13-247, \u00a7 120, as follows: \"[1] Makes technical changes to how estate taxes are calculated for Connecticut residents who have estate property in other states. This conforms to current Department of Revenue Services. [2] Provides, for both resident and nonresident estates, that the state may calculate and levy the tax to the fullest extent permitted by the [United States] [c]onstitution.\" Office of Legislative Research, Bill Analysis for House Bill No. 6706, \"An Act Implementing Provisions of the State Budget for the Biennium Ending June 30, 2015 Concerning General Government,\" (2013), \u00a7 120, available at https://www.cga.ct.gov/2013/BA/2013HB-06706-R00-BA.htm (last visited May 4, 2017). The testimony regarding P.A. 13-247, \u00a7 120, was limited to two questions. The first question, from Senator Kevin C. Kelly, related to the first point listed in the bill analysis. 56 S. Proc., supra, pp. 5457-58. Senator Fonfara responded that \"the section makes a correction that goes back to the decoupling of the state tax from the federal tax and ... preserves the current tax treatment of real and tangible property, which Connecticut has jurisdiction to tax.\" Id., p. 5458. Next, Senator Frantz inquired about the second point listed in the bill analysis as follows: \"In the description of that bill, it says it provides for both residents and nonresident estates that the state may calculate and levy the tax to the fullest extent permitted by the [United States] [c]onstitution. May I ask ... what the fullest extent ... permitted by the [United States] [c]onstitution is?\" Id., p. 5459. We understand the second point in the bill analysis as pertaining to, inter alia, \u00a7 12-391 (d) (3). The purpose set forth in the bill analysis was served by amending (d) (3) by substituting the phrase \"owned by\" with \"included in the gross estate of,\" and adding the following language: \"The state is permitted to calculate the estate tax and levy said tax to the fullest extent permitted by the [c]onstitution of the United States.\" P.A. 13-247, \u00a7 120. The changes ensured that the state could continue to levy the tax to the greatest extent permitted by the federal constitution, which according to Senator Fonfara is how the state has always implemented the estate tax; 56 S. Proc., supra, p. 5459; without the risk that a court would strictly construe the phrase \"owned by\" thereby statutorily narrowing the class of intangible personal property in the gross estate upon which the state could levy the tax. Thus, we understand Senator Fonfara's response to Senator Frantz' question to implicate all changes to \u00a7 12-391 (d) (3), including the amendatory language at issue in the present case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The plaintiffs' claim that the fact that the trial court did not first construe the original statutory language before concluding that the amendatory language was clarifying in nature amounted to an abdication of judicial responsibility resulting in a violation of the plaintiffs' right to separation of powers is wholly without merit. First, we note that the plaintiffs have failed to fully develop this argument. Specifically, the plaintiffs have failed to cite to a single separation of powers case or to explain how their claims fit into our separation of powers doctrine. We briefly observe that, the trial court, in reaching its conclusion, cited the legislative history of P.A. 13-247, cited the express statement of legislative intent in P.A. 14-155, and noted that the amendatory language did not amount to a substantial change in the law. Resolution of the question of whether amendatory language is clarifying in nature does not first require full statutory construction of the original language or a predicate finding of ambiguity. See\n    <em>\n     Middlebury\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Dept. of Environmental Protection\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5730920\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/283/156/#p174\">\n     283 Conn. at 174\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=927%20A.2d%20793\">\n     927 A.2d 793\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Rather, courts apply the multifactor test set forth and applied in this opinion. Indeed, the plaintiffs essentially concede this point in their reply brief by citing\n    <em>\n     Middlebury\n    </em>\n    . In short, there was nothing improper about the trial court's analysis of this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The plaintiffs claim that the fact the decedent had an ownership interest in the property was integral to the United States Supreme Court's analysis in\n    <em>\n     Fernandez\n    </em>\n    .
