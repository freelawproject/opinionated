Additionally, the plaintiff's claims that the court erred in failing to certify a question to our Supreme Court, and improperly considered two separate motions to dismiss are without merit. There is no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
