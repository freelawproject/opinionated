(\"Fluor Daniel\"), SCANA Corporation (\"SCANA\") and South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Company (\"SCE &amp; G\") (collectively \"Defendants\") alleging that the termination of their employment on July 31, 2017, was in violation of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202101\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 2109 (the \"WARN Act\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is before the court by way of a Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure filed by SCANA and SCE &amp; G (together \"SCANA Defendants\"). (ECF No. 69.) In their Motion, SCANA Defendants generally argue that dismissal is appropriate because they \"were not, as a matter of law, Plaintiffs' employer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) Plaintiffs oppose the Motion in its entirety because \"the Complaint sufficiently alleges SCANA [Defendants] w[ ][ere] a joint employer of the terminated employees.\" (ECF No. 71 at 40.) For the reasons set forth below, the court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   SCANA Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND RELEVANT TO INSTANT MOTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case arises out of the decision on July 31, 2017, to stop all construction at the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station (\"VC Summer\") in Jenkinsville, South Carolina. (ECF No. 41 at 2 \u00b6 4.) As a result of that decision, approximately 5,000 employees were laid off who had been working and/or receiving assignments at VC Summer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 \u00b6 23.) Until their respective terminations, Pennington worked for Fluor Daniel at VC Summer as a Heavy Equipment Operator and Lorenz was employed by Westinghouse Electric Company LLC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (\"WEC\") as a Project Manager. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that in 2008, SCANA Defendants entered into an agreement with WEC for the purpose of constructing \"two AP-1000\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   nuclear reactors known as VC Summer 2 and 3.\" (ECF No. 41 at 6 \u00b6 31.) Plaintiffs allege that as the general contractor \"WEC was generally responsible for the design, manufacture, and procurement of the nuclear reactor, steam turbines, and generators.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 \u00b6 34.) Plaintiffs further allege that in or around 2015, Fluor Corporation was brought in as a subcontractor to WEC to \"provide staffing for craft (manual labor) employees and [ ] take primary responsibility for on-site construction\" to include \"responsibility for the craft, field engineers, and project controls personnel including the costs and scheduling of personnel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 38.) At the same time, WEC \"generally accepted liability for the cost overruns on the Summer Project, by agreeing to build it for a 'fixed-price' at SCANA [Defendants]' option,\" which option was exercised in May 2016 thus \"capping [ ] costs for the Summer Project at close to $14 billion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39, 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs next allege that \"[i]n early 2017, WEC experienced cash shortfalls related to the Summer Project and a deepening liquidity crisis,\" which eventually led to WEC and its subsidiaries fil[ ][ing] [ ] voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the Southern District of New York\" on March 29, 2017. (ECF No. 41 at 8 \u00b6\u00b6 44, 45.) Plaintiffs allege that as a result of WEC's bankruptcy \"SCANA [Defendants] became financially accountable for the ongoing costs and plan of completion\" for the VC Summer Project. (ECF No. 71 at 10.) Moreover, Plaintiffs assert that SCANA Defendants took over complete control of the VC Summer Project as demonstrated by the following post-bankruptcy conduct:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 \"SCANA [Defendants] began paying Fluor's payroll directly to Fluor\" (ECF No. 41 at 10 \u00b6 57);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 SCANA Defendants \"reassigned Fluor and WEC employees in a line of supervision interspersed with SCANA's own managers to whom Fluor and WEC employees would report at various levels\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 \u00b6 61);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 \"SCANA [Defendants]'[ ] ground-level overseers attended all significant construction events, such as crane lifts and major concrete placements, and they attended the continual meetings across the site that took place throughout the day between Fluor and WEC and their respective crews dealing with the operational nuts-and-bolts of the constructions tasks\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 \"SCANA [Defendants]'[ ] input into day-to-day operations became proactive, intrusive, and decisional, in keeping with its assumption of CEO-type control and leadership\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 \u00b6 72);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 \"SCANA [Defendants'] field monitors, who had previously been silent, became vocal in directing Fluor/WEC personnel\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 \"SCANA [Defendants] gave specific orders and directions concerning virtually all facets of the project, including\n   construction, and safety-particularly concerning anything that would cause a delay or add cost\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 SCANA [Defendants] used their authority to \"set the levels of craft personnel needed to perform assignments\" or determine whether to hire highly skilled employees for specialized jobs (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14 \u00b6\u00b6 76, 77, 80);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 SCANA [Defendants] controlled the work schedules of employees of WEC and Fluor to include whether they worked overtime, the number of overtime hours, their days off or days designated as holidays (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 \u00b6\u00b6 82-84); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 SCANA [Defendants] provided the facilities, equipment, tools [heavy construction equipment] and materials necessary to complete the work (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 85, 86).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that after SCANA Defendants gained control of the VC Summer Project, they recognized by \"at least March 2017, [that] mass layoffs and shutdowns were almost inevitable at the Summer Project in mid-summer.\" (ECF No. 41 at 17 \u00b6 91.) Subsequently, on July 31, 2017, SCANA Defendants sent WARN Act correspondence to the Director of Business Services for the South Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce containing the following relevant information:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   This notice is provided in compliance with the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act and regulations promulgated thereunder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   SCANA, the parent company of SCE &amp; G, has decided to stop the construction of both Unit 2 and Unit 3 and file a petition for approval of abandonment with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. Unfortunately, this process is expected to involve immediate, total, and permanent termination of the new nuclear construction project at VC Summer Nuclear Station, .... This complete termination of the construction project will affect 617 SCE &amp; G employees and a currently unknown number of employees of affiliated companies that provide administrative support to the project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The separations are expected to begin on: September 30, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (ECF No. 9-4 at 2.) Also on July 31, 2017, Plaintiffs allege that their employers were told by SCE &amp; G \"to cease work on the project immediately\" resulting in the immediate termination of Plaintiffs' employment. (ECF No. 41 at 17 \u00b6\u00b6 95-96.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As a result of the foregoing, Pennington filed a putative class action Complaint in this court against Defendants Fluor Corporation, Fluor Enterprises, Inc. and SCANA on August 8, 2017, alleging violation of the WARN Act. (ECF No. 1.) In his Complaint, Pennington sought to represent \"all other similarly situated former employees, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202104\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5) and Fed.

P. 23(a), who worked at, reported to, or received assignments from one of Defendants' Facilities and were terminated without cause on or about July 31, 2017, and within 30 days of that date, or were terminated without cause as the reasonably foreseeable consequence of the mass layoffs and/or plant closings ordered by Defendants on or about July 31, 2017, ....\" (ECF No. 1 at 3-4 \u00b6 16.) Pennington further alleged that Fluor Corporation, Fluor Enterprises, Inc. and SCANA knowingly failed to give their employees at least 60 days prior notice of termination of their employment as required by the WARN Act. (ECF No. 1 at 2 \u00b6 3.) On October 25, 2017, Pennington filed an Amended Class Action Complaint, which provided additional WARN Act allegations and added Timothy Lorentz as Plaintiff and Fluor\n   Daniel and SCE &amp; G as Defendants. (ECF No. 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On December 4, 2017, SCANA Defendants filed the instant Motion to Dismiss. (ECF No. 69.) Thereafter, on December 29, 2017, Plaintiffs filed opposition to the Motion to which SCANA Defendants filed a Reply in support of dismissal on January 12, 2018. (ECF Nos. 71, 78.) On February 14, 2018, the court heard argument from the parties on the pending Motion. (ECF No. 85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

More specifically, SCANA Defendants assert that Plaintiffs' allegations do not demonstrate \"common ownership amongst the co-Defendants,\" \"common directors or officers,\" the exercise by SCANA Defendants of \"de factor control over Fluor or Westinghouse,\" a \"unity of personnel policies,\" or \"a plausible inference of dependency of operations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In this regard, SCANA Defendants assert that Plaintiffs' \"allegations do not support a plausible inference that SCANA or SCE &amp; G became so entangled with the other co-defendants' operations that they together constitute a single employer under the WARN Act.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)

(ECF No. 71 at 26-40.) As a result, Plaintiffs assert that SCANA Defendants Motion should be denied or, in the alternative, Plaintiffs should be allowed leave to replead.

The WARN Act defines an employer as \"any business enterprise that employs-(A) 100 or more employees, excluding part-time employees; or (B) 100 or more employees who in the aggregate work at least 4,000 hours per week (exclusive of hours of overtime); ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202101\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). An integral part of the parties' dispute is whether the determination regarding SCANA Defendants' status as Plaintiffs' employer should be made pursuant to a single employer or joint employer concept in relation to the other Defendants and WEC. Upon consideration of the foregoing, the court observes that Plaintiffs clearly allege a single employer theory of liability in the Amended Complaint (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 41 at 2 \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6; 3 \u00b6 7; 19 \u00b6 103; and 22 \u00b6 118), but then argue joint employer status in their Opposition to SCANA Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 71 at 7, 20, 22, 22 n.2 &amp; 25.) Therefore, because the pending Motion to Dismiss challenges the legal sufficiency of the Amended Complaint's allegations, the court is compelled to apply the single employer concept in its analysis.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mylan Labs., Inc. v.

Nevertheless, this court is not without persuasive guidance. Specifically, the WARN Act regulations set forth the following five non-exclusive factors that can be used to determine if WARN liability should be imposed on an entity: (i) common ownership, (ii) common directors and/or officers, (iii) de facto exercise of control, (iv) unity of personnel policies emanating from a common source, and (v) the dependency of operations.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20639.3\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 639.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pearson v.

Using the aforementioned WARN Act factors, the court considers below whether Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint contains allegations that state a claim against SCANA Defendants for violation of the WARN Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    1. Common Ownership\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The common ownership factor \"inquires as to whether a parent or related entity directly owns a separate corporate entity.\"\n   <em>\n    Guippone v.

Upon review, the court observes that there are no allegations in the Amended Complaint that SCANA Defendants have a direct ownership interest in WEC or Fluor Defendants. Accordingly, the common ownership factor disfavors allowing Plaintiffs to continue this action against SCANA Defendants under the WARN Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    2. Common Directors and/or Officers\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The common directors and/or officers factor \"ordinarily looks to whether the two nominally separate corporations: (1) actually have the same people occupying officer or director positions with both companies; (2) repeatedly transfer management-level personnel between the companies; or (3) have officers and directors of one company occupying some sort of formal management position with respect to the second company.\"\n   <em>\n    Pearson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11108190\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/247/471/#p490\">\n    247 F.3d at 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs admit that they \"do not allege there were 'common directors and/or officers.' \" (ECF No. 71 at 26 n.3.) Thus, this factor also disfavors allowing Plaintiffs to continue this action against SCANA Defendants under the WARN Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    3. De Facto Control\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The de facto control factor is concerned with \"whether one company was the decision-maker responsible for the employment practice giving rise to the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Garner v.

That is exactly the case here, where the basis for Plaintiffs' WARN Act claims is that SCANA Defendants made the decision to effect a mass layoff with no regard for the statutory warning time. More specifically, Plaintiffs allege that SCANA Defendants (a) knew \"from at least March 2017, mass layoffs and shutdowns were almost inevitable\"; (b) \"sent a WARN Act notice to the South Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce\"; (c) \"informed Fluor and Westinghouse of its decision to abandon the project ... [and] asked them to cease all work on the project immediately\"; (d) \"stopped paying the cost of employing over 5,000 employees on the site\" and (e) \"controlled the decision to terminate all the employees on the site without advance notice.\" (ECF No. 41 at 17 \u00b6\u00b6 91, 93, 95 &amp; 96.) Assuming that they are true, these allegations of SCANA Defendants' de facto control weigh strongly in favor of allowing Plaintiffs to continue this action against\n   SCANA Defendants under the WARN Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    4. Unity of Personnel Policies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The unity of personnel policies factor \"is analogous to the aspect in the federal labor law test concerning 'centralized control of labor operations,' \" and includes such elements as \"centralized hiring and firing, payment of wages, maintenance of personnel records, benefits and participation in collective bargaining.\"\n   <em>\n    Vogt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9228358\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/318/136/#p140\">\n    318 F.Supp.2d at 142-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Upon review, the court observes that there are numerous allegations in the Amended Complaint positing that SCANA Defendants controlled day-to-day personnel policy and labor decisions after WEC declared bankruptcy. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 41 at 14 \u00b6\u00b6 76, 77, 80 &amp; 15 \u00b6\u00b6 82-84.) Plaintiffs further allege that SCANA Defendants \"controlled the decision to terminate all the employees on the [VC Summer] site without advance notice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17 \u00b6 96.) Because \"[i]n the context of the WARN Act, the decision to effect a mass layoff is the single most important personnel policy,\"\n   <em>\n    Vogt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9228358\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/318/136/#p140\">\n    318 F.Supp.2d at 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court is persuaded that this factor weighs strongly in favor of allowing Plaintiffs to continue this action against SCANA Defendants under the WARN Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    5. Dependency of Operations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The dependency of operations factor \"addresses three areas of overlap between related corporations; (1) sharing of administrative or purchasing services, (2) interchanges of employees or equipment, or (3) commingled finances.\"\n   <em>\n    Guippone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202077189\">\n    2010 WL 2077189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (citation omitted). Upon review, the court observes that Plaintiffs' allegations specify that after WEC's bankruptcy, there was an interrelation between SCANA Defendants and the other Defendants as it relates to employees and equipment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 41 at 15 \u00b6\u00b6 85-86 &amp; 13 \u00b6\u00b6 73-74.) Assuming these allegations to be true as the court is required to do under Rule 12(b)(6), the court finds that the dependency of operations factor weighs slightly in favor of allowing Plaintiffs to continue this action against SCANA Defendants under the WARN Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   After considering the WARN Act factors in the context of the allegations in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint, the court concludes that the factors of unity of personnel policies, de facto control and dependency of operations weigh in favor of allowing Plaintiffs to continue this action against SCANA Defendants under the WARN Act, and outweigh the countervailing factors of common ownership, common directors and/or officers. Therefore, SCANA Defendants are not entitled to dismissal of this matter pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
