While our gratitude is ultimately ineffable, the Court still begins by recognizing the Parties in this case for their many years of sacrifice and labor. The Court thanks Sharonell Fulton, Cecelia Paul, Toni Lynn Simms-Busch, Catholic Social Services (\"CSS\"), the City of Philadelphia, the Department of Human Services (\"DHS\"), and the Commission on Human Relations for their individual sacrifices and contributions in service of Philadelphia's children and its families. As witnesses called to testify in this case have made clear, fostering children is challenging\n   work, but challenging work that can form part of a full and good life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Until recent events, the Parties have had a fruitful relationship; a relationship that has benefited Philadelphia's children in immeasurable ways. For this reason, the Court would prefer that the Parties seek out some compromise to their current dispute without court intervention. Creative problem solving through concerted and thoughtful discourse without court intervention is often the best method to avoid what may appear to the parties, or to other persons in the public, to be harsh legal results. Still, when parties place a matter before the Court, the Court must act pursuant to its obligations under the law. Accordingly, the Court turns to the legal matter presented in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the Court are Plaintiffs' Motion For A Temporary Restraining Order And Preliminary Injunction (\"Injunction Motion\") (ECF No. 13),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City Of Philadelphia's Memorandum Of Law In Opposition To Plaintiffs' Motion For Temporary Restraining Order And Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 21), Proposed Intervenors' Memorandum of Law, Or, In The Alternative, Amicus Brief, In Opposition To Plaintiffs' Motion For A Temporary Restraining Order And Preliminary Injunction (\"Amicus Brief\") (ECF No. 34);\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants' Proposed Findings Of Facts And Conclusions Of Law (ECF No. 45), and Plaintiffs' Proposed Findings Of Fact And Conclusions of Law (ECF No. 46). Upon careful consideration of the foregoing and all the evidence presented by the Parties in their written submissions and the evidentiary hearing held on June 18, 2018, June 19, 2018, and June 21, 2018, for the reasons explained below, Plaintiffs' Injunction Motion (ECF No. 13) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 17, 2018, Plaintiffs asserted sixteen causes of action against Defendants related to, among other things, Defendants' suspension of referrals of new children to Plaintiffs' care and Defendants' alleged violations of Plaintiffs' religious and free speech rights.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1;\n   <em>\n    but see\n   </em>\n   Mem. of Law Supp. Pl.s' Injunction Mot. 8 (asserting that CSS \"filed a complaint in this Court on May 16, 2018\"). Nineteen days later,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on June 5, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their Injunction Motion seeking a court order to compel Defendants to resume referrals of children to Plaintiffs' care in advance of the June 30 expiration of Plaintiffs' current services contract with Defendants under which Plaintiffs provide various professional services in exchange for public funds. In view of the urgency of the matter, the Court set an expedited briefing schedule and ordered an evidentiary hearing. Jun. 6, 2018 Order, ECF No. 11. Less than two\n   weeks later, on June 18, 2018, the Court held an evidentiary hearing. The hearing concluded on June 21, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

CSS's Services Contract With DHS And Philadelphia\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   It is an intractable tragedy that children in our community are sometimes unable to remain in their own homes. Pennsylvania has, in response to this tragic reality, charged individual county agencies with the duty of establishing a system to address the well-being of these children consistent with the best interests of each child. Jun. 19, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 152:18-24 (Figueroa). In Philadelphia County, the county agency charged with this duty is DHS. In performing its duty, DHS contracts with a number of private foster care agencies. Jun. 18, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 87:2-4 (Ali). Presently, DHS has contracts with thirty private foster care agencies. Jun. 19, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 155:14-16 (Figueroa). Each of these private foster care agencies is expected to provide foster care services consistent with a services contract with DHS.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Jun. 19, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 162:2-12 (Figueroa) (indicating that CSS's services, as a foster agency, are provided under contract with DHS and Philadelphia); Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 12:15-16 (Figueroa)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (indicating that Bethany Christian Services, another foster agency, has a contract similar to the services contract between DHS and CSS).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In November 2015, DHS and CSS entered into Contract Number 16-20030 (\"Services Contract\") for certain professional services. Decl. of James Amato Ex.

A, ECF p. 39 of 52, ECF No. 13-3 (identifying the Services Contract as a \"Professional Services Contract ... for Department of Human Services Contracts\"). As provided in the Statement of Purpose section of the Services Contract, the Services Contract was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   made and entered into between Catholic Social Services (the Provider) and the Philadelphia Department of Human Services (DHS), and sets forth the services for general, kinship, and teen parent/baby resource home care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Decl. of James Amato Ex. A, ECF p. 27 of 52, ECF No. 13-3. Under the Scope of Services section of the Services Contract, CSS was to ensure that, among other things, resource caregivers (foster parents) would be \"screened, trained, and certified by the Provider [CSS].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Decl. of James Amato Ex. A, ECF p. 28-29 of 52, ECF No. 13-3. The Services Contract reiterates that \"[t]he specific issue to be addressed by [CSS] is to recruit, screen, train, and provide certified resource care homes.\" Decl. of James Amato Ex. A, ECF p. 28 of 52, ECF No. 13-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   CSS was to provide the services set forth under the Scope of Services section of the Services Contract in accordance with certain criteria, including criteria under Section 3.21 of the Services Contracts' General Provisions and Article XV: Additional Representations and Covenants of Provider Relating to Certain Applicable Laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Section 3.21 limits the reasons that CSS may refuse to provide the services required under the Services Contract. Section 3.21 provides that CSS:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   shall not reject a child or family for Services based upon the location or condition of the family's residence, their environmental or social condition, or for any other reason if the profiles of such child or family are consistent with Provider's Scope of Services or DHS's applicable standards as listed in the [Services Contract], unless an exception is granted by the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee, in his/her sole discretion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Decl. of James Amato Ex. B, ECF p. 14 of 39, ECF No. 13-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Article XV of the Services Contract further limits the reasons that CSS may refuse to provide the services required under the Services Contract by incorporating into the Services Contract various laws, ordinances, regulations, and executive orders. In particular, Article XV incorporates provisions of the Philadelphia Fair Practices Ordinance relating to non-discrimination and serving all-comers who\n   might seek services from CSS. Article XV stipulates that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   .... Provider further represents, warrants and covenants that ... Provider is in compliance with the laws, ordinances, regulations and executive orders described below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   15.1 Non-Discrimination; Fair Practices.

C, ECF p. 18-19 of 39, ECF No. 13-5 (emphasis added). In the event of CSS's breach of its covenant under Article XV, DHS and Philadelphia would be permitted \"in addition to any other rights or remedies available under this Contract, at law or in equity, [to] suspend or terminate this Contract forthwith.\" Decl. of James Amato Ex. C, ECF p. 19 of 39, ECF No. 13-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In exchange for \"the Services and Materials being provided under\" the Services Contract, DHS and Philadelphia agreed to \"set the amount of compensation payable to [CSS] for the current contract term at [$19,430,999.00].\" Decl. of James Amato Ex. A, ECF p. 15 of 52, ECF No. 13-3. Despite this lump sum amount, as a matter of practice, payment to CSS was made on a per diem basis pegged to the number of children under its care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 11:4-7 (Figueroa) (testifying that many contractors are paid on a per diem basis); Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 139:20-24 (same) (Figueroa). That CSS was receiving significant public funds to perform its public service functions under the Services Contract is underscored by Section 3.30 of the General Provisions that provides \"[CSS] shall identify the Department as a funding source in all literature, documents[,] reports or pamphlets which Provider publishes develops or produces in connection with this Contract.\" Decl. of James Amato Ex. B, ECF p. 21 of 39, ECF No. 13-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   CSS and DHS proceeded under the Services Contract without dispute until March 2018, when DHS learned that it is CSS policy to not serve all-comers. In particular, it is CSS policy to refuse service to same-sex couples CSS services under the Services Contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. March 2018: DHS Learns Of CSS's And Another Foster Agency's Refusal To Comply With Services Contract's All-Comers Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On or about March 9, 2018, DHS Commissioner Figueroa came to believe that\n   two of the foster care agencies with which DHS contracts, CSS and Bethany Christian Services, have policies that deny their publicly-funded services to married same-sex couples. Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 3 (Figueroa) (testifying that on March 9, 2010, a reporter contacted Figueroa and that Figueroa's discussions with the reporter led Figueroa to believe that CSS and Bethany Christian Services had certain policies of refusing service to same-sex couples). Jun. 19, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 164 (Figueroa). Commissioner Figueroa formed this belief after discussions with a\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Inquirer\n   </em>\n   reporter who called Figueroa seeking comment ahead of the publication of an article on two DHS foster care agencies that reportedly maintained policies that would effectively permit these agencies to refuse services to same-sex couples. Jun. 19, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 164 (Figueroa). After Commissioner Figueroa's discussion with the reporter, Figueroa contacted Bethany Christian Services, CSS, various DHS's faith-based foster care agencies, and a nonfaith-based agency to determine what those agencies' policies are in connection with serving same-sex couples. Jun. 19, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 164:16-165:4 (Figueroa); Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 103:6-9 (testifying that Figueroa contacted a nonfaith-based foster care agency).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Commissioner Figueroa's phone call with James Amato at CSS provided greater clarity regarding what services CSS refused to provide to same-sex couples and why CSS refused to provide those services. Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 3:18-24 (Figueroa). James Amato explained that there were two services that CSS would not provide to same-sex couples: (1) CSS would not certify same-sex couples as prospective foster parents even if the couples were otherwise eligible foster parents under state regulations, and (2) CSS would not provide a same-sex couple with a home study as part of a same-sex couple's application for adoption. Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 3:18-24 (Figueroa);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Jun. 19, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 55:7-20 (Amato) (testifying that Commissioner Figueroa and another DHS officer asked Amato whether CSS would complete a home study for \"a same-sex couple or individual\" and that Amato confirmed that CSS would not complete such a home study for a couple and would only provide a home study for an individual if that individual was committed to living single). Amato explained that CSS would not provide these services on religious grounds. Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 3:18-24 (Figueroa). Amato recalled that DHS \"said to me that you are discriminating. I said that I am following the teachings of the Catholic Church.\" Jun. 19, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 55:22-25 (Amato).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On March 13, 2018, the\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia Inquirer\n   </em>\n   published an article titled\n   <em>\n    Two Foster Agencies in Philly Won't Place Kids with LGBTQ People\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The article recounted an incident in which a married same-sex couple traveled to a Bethany Christian Services informational event for prospective foster parents. On arrival, a Bethany Christian Services employee told the couple their attendance at the event would be a waste of time because Bethany Christian Services maintained a policy of refusing to serve same-sex couples.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Jun. 19, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 164:5-10 (Figueroa). In the same story, the\n   <em>\n    Inquirer\n   </em>\n   reported that a representative for CSS confirmed that CSS maintained similar policies of refusing to serve same-sex couples.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On March 15, 2018, after meeting with James Amato and CSS's legal counsel in person, Commissioner Figueroa \"decided that it was in the best interest [of children] to close intake, so that [Figueroa] could look more deeply into\" CSS's and Bethany Christian Services's policies. Jun. 19, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 166:6-21 (Figueroa); Figueroa Decl. \u00b6 32, ECF No. 20-6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Jun. 18, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 96:2-3 (Ali) (testifying that, to Ali's knowledge, Commissioner Figueroa herself decided to close CSS's intake of new referrals). That day, Philadelphia City Council separately passed its own resolution authorizing the Committee on Public Health and Human Services to \"investigate [DHS] policies on contracting with social services agencies that either discriminate against prospective LGBTQ foster parents and allow non-LGBTQ foster parents to discriminate against children.\" City Council Resolution No. 180252 at 2, ECF No. 10-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On March 27, 2018, Deputy Commissioner Ali emailed various community umbrella agencies-responsible for case management activities-to communicate that foster agencies should \"refrain from making any foster care referrals to Bethany Christian Services and [CSS],\" but \"[i]f you have questions about a case, please contact me by phone or email.\" Ex. 1-E 3, ECF No. 10-12. Deputy Commissioner Ali further communicated that DHS is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Committed to the safety and stability of children in our care and must consider the needs of the children and youth\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     currently\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   served by foster families licensed by these organizations. Our goal is to minimize placement disruptions, and to ensure that a child's ability to reunify or to continue an adoption process is not delayed because of placement disruption.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Ex. 1-E 3, ECF No. 10-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Doe Foster Child # 1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs spent some time at the evidentiary hearing exploring a situation involving a minor child identified as Doe Foster Child # 1. Plaintiffs point to the situation involving Doe Foster Child # 1 as an \"example of the harm that has resulted from the City's intake closure.\" Pls.' Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law 27, ECF No. 46. The circumstances surrounding Doe Foster Child # 1 are, as is often the case for children in foster care, complex. The Court notes, however, that by the time of the evidentiary hearing, DHS and CSS, working together, successfully obtained a Philadelphia Family Court order permitting Doe Foster Child # 1's removal from a different living situation and then placement with a CSS-certified foster parent. Ali Decl. \u00b6 60, ECF No. 20-1. Through the concerted efforts of DHS and CSS staff, the situation involving Doe Foster Child # 1 is now resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Still, Plaintiffs contend that the situation with Doe Foster Child # 1 would not have occurred but for DHS's closure of CSS's intake of new referrals, while DHS and Philadelphia contend that Doe Foster Child # 1's unique situation was resolved in a timely manner considering the complexity of the case. As a factual matter, the situation with Doe Foster Child # 1 is unlikely to occur again given that DHS and CSS are both now fully aware that exemptions from the intake closure have been and continue to be granted consistent with the best interests of individual children.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Jun. 19, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 84:2-9 (Amato) (testifying that he is aware that DHS will grant exceptions in some cases for placements with Catholic Social Services when such placements are in the best interests of the child); Jun. 19, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 86:8-11 (Amato) (testifying that CSS has, in fact, sought out and received placements for children despite the intake closure when placements were in the best interests of the child).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Current Effects Of Closure Of CSS Intake Of New Referrals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In response to Plaintiffs' claims that CSS's intake closure has and will continue to negatively affect foster children, DHS offered evidence showing that the closure of CSS's intake of new referrals has had little or no effect on the operation of Philadelphia's foster care system. DHS Commissioner Figueroa testified that CSS's intake closure \"has not resulted in a rise in children placed in congregate care.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 86:4-87:9 (Figueroa). Further, Figueroa testified that CSS's intake closure \"has not resulted in a rise in children staying in DHS's childcare room.\" Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 86:4-87:9 (Figueroa). Figueroa's testimony was based on her review of \"weekly data\" that Figueroa receives from DHS's \"performance and technology team that ... have ... detailed data.\" Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 86:16-87:11 (Figueroa).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   That the effects of closing CSS's intake have been small relative to size and breadth of the Philadelphia foster care system is, unfortunate, but unsurprising given Commissioner Figueroa's explanation that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Kids are abused every day. They are neglected every day. They end up in [DHS's] placement, in [DHS's] care, because their families can't care for them. We are incredibly fortunate that we have foster care agencies, but it's not a one to one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 93:23-94:7 (Figueroa). The number of cases and idiosyncrasies of each child involved in each case means that the mere fact that there are empty, available foster homes does not equate to fewer children in congregate care. Figueroa explained that assuming that \"availability [at any one foster agency] [will] reduce the [use of] congregate care is an over [simplification] of the complication of our work.\" Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 93:23-94:7 (Figueroa). That the negative effects of closing CSS's intake have been relatively slight is also supported by the reality that, as of the evidentiary hearing date, at least three foster agencies had intake closures in place and the foster system nevertheless remained stable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 5:14-15 (Figueroa) (testifying that \"I have closed intake in other circumstances for other providers.\"); Jun. 21, 2018 Tr. 8:24-25-9:1 (Figueroa) (testifying that the week before, DHS also closed intake for another agency); Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 12:9-21 (Figueroa) (testifying that Bethany Christian Services's intake remained closed as of June 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Defendants' Preference To Continue Work With CSS And Offer Of New Contracts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   DHS and Philadelphia have explicitly stated a preference for continuing their relationship with CSS, despite CSS's religious nature, so long as CSS complies with its contract responsibilities.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 9:18-24 (Figueroa) (indicating that DHS would prefer to continue contracting with CSS); Jun. 19, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 120:7-11 (Amato) (testifying that DHS and Philadelphia were clear that they did \"not plan to agree to any further referrals to CSS ... absent assurances that CSS is prepared to adhere to contractual obligations\"). Indeed, DHS and Philadelphia manifested their preference to continue working with CSS by offering CSS two different renewal services contracts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 10:1-10 (Figueroa). The first contract would be a renewal on the same terms as CSS's current Services Contract. The second contract\n   would be an alternate services contract to provide financial support to CSS even if CSS could not agree to certify same-sex couples consistent with the all-comers provisions of the standard services contract.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 10:5-10. Such alternate contracts have been provided to other foster care agencies in the past to ensure the best interest of foster children.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 10:20-11:16 (Figueroa). That Defendants have offered two contracts to CSS despite the Parties' present dispute shows Defendants' strong desire to keep CSS as a foster care agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

In 2006, for example, in the wake of Massachusetts's legalization of same-sex marriages, Catholic Charities in Boston shut down its foster care agency after it unsuccessfully sought permission from Massachusetts to withhold its services from legally married same-sex couples.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In 2010, Catholic Charities in Washington, DC, like Catholic Charities in Boston, ended its foster care program in response to Washington, DC's legislation to legalize same-sex marriage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, \"Catholic Charities' caseload of 43 children and 35 foster families was transferred, along with seven staffers, to the Bethesda, Md.-based National Center for Children and Families so as not to disrupt client care.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In 2011, Catholic Charities in Illinois sued, among others, the State of Illinois after the State indicated that it would not renew its foster care contract with Catholic Charities because Catholic Charities' \"failure to provide services to unmarried cohabiting couples was in direct violation of\" state law.

The Sangamon County Circuit Court granted the State's Cross Motion for Summary Judgment on grounds that Catholic Charities had no cognizable right to a state government services contract. The court reasoned that Catholic Charities did \"not have a legally recognized protected property interest in the renewal of its contracts for foster care and adoption services.... [and] [t]he fact that [Catholic Charities] have contracted with the State to provide foster care and adoption services for over forty years does not vest the Plaintiffs with a protected property interest.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203655016\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After the Sangamon County Circuit Court's decision, Catholic Charities in Illinois ended its foster care and adoption services and agreed to transfer \"more than\n   1,000 foster care children and staff to other agencies in their regions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In 2006, in contrast to the decisions by Catholic Charities in Boston, Washington, DC, and Illinois to end its foster care services, Catholic Charities in San Francisco chose to end its full service adoption agency to avoid providing services to same sex couples, but otherwise planned to \"provide staff and financial resources to connect needy children to adoptive parents,\" and formally collaborate with other adoption agencies who can provide full services to all-comers without violating San Francisco's anti-discrimination efforts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Against this backdrop, the Court turns to the Parties' legal arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

In entering into the Services Contract, CSS agreed to the provisions enumerated under Article XV. CSS explicitly \"represent[ed], warrant[ed], and covenant[ed] that ... [CSS was] in compliance with.... the Fair Practices Ordinance.\" Decl. of James Amato Ex. C, ECF p. 18-19 of 39, ECF No. 13-5.

The resolution of this issue turns on two questions: (1) whether CSS's scope of services includes the provision of certification and home visits in connection with certification in the first instance, and (2) if so, whether those services fall within the meaning of a public accommodation under the Fair Practices Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

In agreeing to perform the Scope of Services under the Services Contract, CSS agreed to \"recruit, screen, train, and provide certified resource care homes.\" Decl. of James Amato Ex. A, ECF p. 28 of 52, ECF No. 13-3. Indeed, CSS's obligation to recruit, screen, train, and certify resource caregivers is emphasized elsewhere in the Scope of Services. Decl. of James Amato Ex. A, ECF p. 28-29 of 52, ECF No. 13-3 (providing that \"resource caregivers are screened, trained, and certified by [CSS]\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Decl. of James Amato Ex. A, ECF p. 27 of 52 n.1, ECF No. 13-3 (providing under the \"Statement of Purpose\" that \"Provider Staff is responsible for recruiting and certifying foster and kinship homes\"). The Court concludes that CSS's certification of prospective foster parents and CSS's provision of home studies \"to assure [that prospective foster parents] are qualified and well prepared for the responsibility of foster care\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   are services that CSS agreed to provide under the Services Contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Having determined that certification and home studies are services that CSS was hired to provide under the Services Contract, the Court turns to whether these services constitute \"public accommodations\" under the Fair Practices Ordinance such that CSS's provision of these services must be rendered in accordance with the all-comers, anti-discrimination provision of the Fair Practices Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

CSS is a \"licensed\" \"provider\" under the Services Contract.

The plain language of the Fair Practices Ordinance likewise supports a finding of neutrality. The Fair Practices Ordinance makes no reference to religion except that it, again, prohibits service providers from discriminating on the basis of religion. Philadelphia Fair Practices Ordinance \u00a7 9-1106, Chapter 9-1100 of the Philadelphia Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The legislative history and intent of the Fair Practices Ordinance similarly supports a finding of neutrality. Philadelphia City Council first enacted the Fair Practices Ordinance in 1963 long before the present dispute between the Parties. Philadelphia City Council amended the Fair Practices Ordinance in 1982, thirty-six years before the events relevant to this case, to broaden the scope of its inclusion policy to protect Philadelphians on the basis of, among other things, sexual orientation. Indeed, the Legislative Findings section of the Fair Practices Ordinance explained the reasons for its enactment. The Fair Practices Ordinance provides that Philadelphia's population:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Consists of people of every race, ethnicity, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, ancestry, age, disability, marital status, and familial status.... [and] [d]iscrimination in places of public accommodation causes embarrassment and inconvenience to citizens and visitors of the City, creates breaches of the peace, and is otherwise detrimental to the welfare and economic growth of the City.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00a7 9-1101. The history and text of the Fair Practices Ordinance provide no basis to conclude that the Fair Practices Ordinance has as its object the infringement of religious rights. Accordingly, the Fair Practices Ordinance, as incorporated by the Parties into the Services Contract, is neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Services Contract and the Fair Practices Ordinance are also generally applicable. In this case, the Services Contract was, in fact, applied generally. The general applicability of the Services Contract and Fair Practices Ordinance is not only evident from the text of the Services Contract, but also from the actions DHS and Philadelphia took in this case. First, the Services Contract and Fair Practices Ordinance do not \"proscribe particular conduct only or primarily when religiously motivated;\" they proscribe only CSS's ability to turn away qualified Philadelphians on the basis of particular character traits without regard to secular or religious reasons.\n   <em>\n    Lighthouse Inst. for Evangelism, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5639034\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/253/#p275\">\n    510 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   275 (citing\n   <em>\n    Tenafly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11404389\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/309/144/#p165\">\n    309 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   165 ). Among the character traits that CSS may not consider when refusing to serve qualified Philadelphians are \"perceived\n   race, ethnicity, color, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, disability, marital status, source of income, familiar [sic] status....\" Article XV, \u00a7 15.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As applied in this case, the Services Contract and Fair Practices Ordinance were, in fact, implemented in a general manner. Not only has DHS confirmed that it would not permit any foster agency under contract, faith-based or not, to turn away potential foster parents for the foster parents' characteristics under the Services Contract and Fair Practices Ordinance, DHS also closed intake of new referrals by CSS and Bethany Christian Services for the same reason. This evidence supports the conclusion that DHS and Philadelphia are not applying the Services Contract or the Fair Practices Ordinance to target particular religious denominations for any religious reason.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Having concluded that the Services Contract and Fair Practices Ordinance are apparently facially neutral and generally applicable and appear to have been neutrally and generally applied in this case, the Court concludes that Defendants' enforcement of the Services Contract and Fair Practices Ordinance is rationally related to a number of legitimate government objectives. While the standard for rational basis review is well known, it bears repeating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Under rational basis review, '[a] statute is presumed constitutional, and the burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it, whether or not that basis has a foundation in the record.' .... The regulation must be reasonable and not arbitrary and it must bear 'a rational relationship to a [permissible] state objective.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    Lighthouse Inst. for Evangelism, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5639034\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/253/#p275\">\n    510 F.3d at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation omitted). While not directly applicable to the local contracting practices at issue in this case, the imposition of contractual conditions in government services contracts has a long and well-established history. Indeed, the courts, in reviewing federal contracts, have frequently upheld conditions placed on contractors through federal executive orders.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Exec. Order No. 8802, 6 F.R. \u00a7 3109 (Jun. 25, 1941) (requiring \"[a]ll contracting agencies of the Government of the United States ... include in all defense contracts ... a provision obligating the contractor not to discriminate against any worker because of race, creed, color, or national origin\" even before the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964); PA Exec. Order 2016-05 (Apr. 7, 2016), https://www.governor.pa.gov/executive_orders/executive-order-2016-05-contract-compliance/ (prohibiting \"discrimination by reason of race, gender, creed, color, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression\" in the \"award, selection, or performance of any contracts or grants issued by Commonwealth agencies\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Here, Defendants have at least six permissible governmental objectives that are furthered by seeking CSS's compliance with the Services Contract. First, DHS and Philadelphia have a legitimate interest in ensuring that when contractors agree to terms in a government contract, the contractors adhere to those terms. Second, DHS and Philadelphia have a legitimate interest in ensuring that when its contractors\n   voluntarily agree to be bound by local laws, the local laws are enforced. Third, DHS and Philadelphia have a legitimate interest in ensuring that when they employ contractors to provide governmental services, the services are accessible to all Philadelphians who are qualified for the services. Fourth, in the context of foster care and adoption, DHS and Philadelphia have a legitimate interest in ensuring that the pool of foster parents and resource caregivers is as diverse and broad as the children in need of foster parents and resource caregivers. Fifth, DHS and Philadelphia have a legitimate interest in ensuring that individuals who pay taxes to fund government contractors are not denied access to those services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sixth, DHS and Philadelphia have an interest in avoiding likely Equal Protection Clause and Establishment Clause claims that would result if it allowed its government contractors to avoid compliance with the all-comers, nondiscrimination provisions of the Fair Practices Ordinance by discriminating against same-sex married couples.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   That Defendants have legitimate objectives in this case is clearer still in view of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455288,3644465\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/661/\">\n    561 U.S. 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455288,3644465,3644245,12455285\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/2971/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455288,3644465\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/661/\">\n    177 L.Ed.2d 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the decision in\n   <em>\n    Teen Ranch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8920298\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/389/827/\">\n    389 F.Supp.2d 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In this case, DHS and Philadelphia are in much the same position as the law school in\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   and, like the law school in\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   , they may permit government contractors to express what the contractors wish but may also insist that their contractors adhere to contractual obligations to serve all-comers and not discriminate. To permit a contractor to avoid a contractual provision requiring the contractor to accept all those who seek their services unilaterally would\n   permit what the Supreme Court explained could not be permitted in\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In this case, as in\n   <em>\n    Teen Ranch\n   </em>\n   , context matters. In\n   <em>\n    Teen Ranch\n   </em>\n   , the district court aptly drew a distinction between cases involving essential government benefits such as unemployment compensation or the ability to hold office, and \"a state contract for youth residential services, which is not a public benefit.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8920298\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/389/827/\">\n    389 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   838 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Summary Judgment Order 2,\n   <em>\n    Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Springfield, et al. v.

Here, CSS seeks, as the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Teen Ranch\n   </em>\n   sought, a government services contract on terms that it deems acceptable, but unlike those cases where the government withheld essential benefits on religious grounds, CSS is not entitled to a government services contract to perform governmental work.

Br. 17, ECF No. 13-2. In support of their claim of targeting, Plaintiffs point to (1) anti-Archdiocese of Philadelphia and anti-Archbishop of Philadelphia comments made by the Mayor of Philadelphia to show that DHS and Philadelphia intentionally sought to penalize CSS for its religious beliefs and exercise, and (2) the purported selective, discretionary enforcement of \"laws or legal instruments in a way that burdens conduct for religious reasons but not secular reasons.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Pls.' Br. 21, ECF No. 13-2. Plaintiffs draw too strong a conclusion from the Mayor's comments and misapprehend the way in which \"secular exemptions\" might show a government's actions are not neutral or generally applied so as to trigger strict scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   First, contrary to Plaintiffs' contentions, the Mayor's comments do not support the conclusion that DHS targeted CSS for its Catholic beliefs because (a) there was insufficient evidence at the preliminary injunction phase to show that the Mayor had any influence in DHS's decisions in this case, thereby rendering the comments irrelevant to these proceedings, and (b) even comments the Mayor made relating to Catholicism do not demonstrate targeting in light of the fact that DHS also closed Bethany Christian Services's referrals intake, a non-Catholic agency, that similarly would not comply with its obligation to serve all-comers under its foster agency contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Plaintiffs cite four comments involving the Mayor of Philadelphia that purportedly show that DHS closed CSS's intake due to CSS's Catholic beliefs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, Plaintiffs cite a nearly three-year-old\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia Magazine\n   </em>\n   article about then mayoral candidate Jim Kenney in which Kenney appeared critical of policies of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and the Archbishop of Philadelphia, but appeared otherwise approving of Pope Francis, Catholic sisters, and other Catholic orders and programs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Plaintiffs cite a nearly two year old\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Inquirer\n   </em>\n   article in which Mayor Kenney was quoted as saying that Philadelphia Archbishop Chaput's guidelines on the implementation of a Catholic text,\n   <em>\n    Amoris Laetitia\n   </em>\n   , were \"not Christian.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, Plaintiffs cite a March 16, 2018 comment by the Mayor where the Mayor stated \"we cannot use taxpayer dollars to fund organizations that discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation or because of their same-sex marriage status.... It's just not right.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fourth, Plaintiffs cite a May 7, 2018 letter indicating that the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations was investigating CSS's policy of turning away certain persons based on their status as\n   same-sex and married at \"the request of the Mayor.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (initial) Injunction Motion Ex. 1-G (sealed), ECF No. 10-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Plaintiffs rely too heavily on these four citations to draw a sweeping conclusion that CSS has suffered impermissible hostility at the hands of the Mayor. The evidence submitted at the three-day evidentiary hearing is insufficient to draw the conclusion Plaintiffs would have the Court draw. There was no evidence to show that the Mayor directed DHS to close CSS's intake of new referrals or to insist that CSS comply with its contractual obligation to serve all Philadelphians.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jun. 19, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 166:6-21 (Figueroa) (testifying that Commissioner Figueroa herself \"decided that it was in the best interest [of children] to close intake, so that [Figueroa] could look more deeply into\" CSS's and Bethany Christian Services's policies); Figueroa Decl. \u00b6 32, ECF No. 20-6 (same); Jun. 18, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 96:2-3 (Ali) (testifying that, to Ali's knowledge, Commissioner Figueroa herself decided to close CSS's intake of new referrals); Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 108:11-13, 108:18-20 (Figueroa) (testifying that Commissioner Figueroa did not know the Mayor's views on CSS when Figueroa met with CSS, nor did Figueroa \"discuss cutting off intake with the Mayor's office\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   That DHS made its own decision to close intake is supported by the fact that DHS has closed intake for other foster care agencies in the past for a number of reasons and, thus, intake closure is a relatively unremarkable DHS administrative action that may be taken to address a number of agency concerns.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 5:14-15 (Figueroa) (testifying that \"I have closed intake in other circumstances for other providers.\"); Jun. 21, 2018 Tr. 8:24-25-9:1 (Figueroa) (testifying that the week before, DHS also closed intake for another agency). In short, there is insufficient evidence in the record to show that the Mayor was involved in DHS's decision to close CSS's and Bethany Christian Services's intake of new referrals. Therefore, the Mayor's comments are irrelevant to this case and cannot support Plaintiffs' claim of religious hostility and intentional targeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Each of Plaintiffs' four citations purportedly showing DHS's intentional targeting of CSS on religious grounds cannot support Plaintiffs' conclusion for a number of other reasons. Plaintiffs' first two citations are three and two years old, respectively. The events that precipitated this case occurred in March 2018. These first two citations, as a matter of timeliness, if not substance, are irrelevant. Plaintiffs' third citation to the Mayor's comment that \"we cannot use taxpayer dollars to fund organizations that discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation or because of their same-sex marriage status.... It's just not right\" is, by its plain terms, not about religious views, but about whether publicly funded service providers may refuse to serve all Philadelphians, including those that are in same-sex marriages. Plaintiffs' fourth citation, to a May 7, 2018 letter in which the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations indicated that the Commission would undertake an investigation, in part, at the request of the Mayor, was sent after DHS made an independent decision to close CSS and Bethany Christian Services's intake. The letter, therefore, cannot support a conclusion that the Mayor was involved in DHS's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Plaintiffs also have pointed to Commissioner Figueroa's statement at the May 15 meeting between DHS officers and CSS management that \"it would be great if we listened to the teachings and the words of our current Pope Francis\" as another ground on which to rest its targeting and preference allegations. Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g\n   Tr. 106:1-3 (Figueroa). As with the Mayor's comments, Plaintiffs draw too broad a conclusion from the Commissioner's statement. The fact remains that DHS closed intake for both CSS and Bethany Christian Services, a non-Catholic organization. This fact undercuts Plaintiffs' position that DHS has targeted CSS for its Catholic beliefs. Further, Commissioner Figueroa's words themselves are unclear whether references to \"we\" and \"our current Pope Francis\" were references to her own beliefs as a Catholic who was educated by the Jesuit order, or as a representative of DHS. Jun. 19, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 149:5-18. As cautioned by Justice Sotomayor, the Court will not engage in judicial psychoanalysis on these facts.\n   <em>\n    Trump v.

City of Newark\n   </em>\n   , provides the framework for determining whether the government is impermissibly providing secular exemptions to a regulation, and not providing comparable religious exemptions to the same regulation in violation of the First Amendment.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11586043\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/359/#p364\">\n    170 F.3d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Fraternal Order of Police\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit considered a police department regulation that prohibited its officers from wearing beards to maintain uniformity among the officers.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11586043\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/359/#p364\">\n    170 F.3d at 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The focus of analysis must be on whether the government exempts activities that would violate\n   <em>\n    the policy at issue\n   </em>\n   for secular reasons, but not for religious reasons. Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Fraternal Order of Police\n   </em>\n   , the focus was on the police department's provision of a secular exemption\n   <em>\n    from the no-beard policy\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Here, the policy at issue is the fair practice provisions of CSS's Services Contract, that is the all-comers, nondiscrimination provisions. The question is whether DHS grants exemptions to the fair practice provisions of foster agency contracts for secular reasons, but denies CSS an exemption for religious reasons thereby evidencing an impermissible governmental value judgment that secular motivations for violating fair practice provisions are more important than religious motivations. The answer to this question is no. There is no evidence in the record to show that DHS has granted any secular exemption to the requirement that its foster care agencies provide their services to all comers. Plaintiffs have not alleged, nor have Plaintiffs presented, any evidence that DHS has granted exemptions to any secular agency to permit a secular agency to refuse its services to all comers in contravention of\n   any fair practices provisions of any foster services contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The purported secular exemptions to which Plaintiffs point to show religious targeting are not, in fact, exemptions to the fair practices requirements and, as such, cannot be considered evidence of targeting. CSS complains that DHS has permitted \"referrals of families for a variety of secular reasons, including proximity, expertise in caring for medical needs, expertise in addressing behavioral needs, ability to find foster placements for pregnant youth, expertise working in a 'kin care' program, and other specialties or areas of focus.\" Pls.' Br. 21, ECF No. 13-2. These \"secular reasons,\" however, are not exemptions from fair practices requirements. DHS permits agencies to \"refer\" prospective foster parents to specialty agencies equipped to handle certain special needs, but nowhere is there evidence in the record that DHS permits agencies to refuse to provide their services to prospective foster parents in violation of the fair practices policies contained in government contracts or local law.

Pls.' Br. 13, ECF No. 10-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Assuming that providing foster care to children constitutes a fundamental religious exercise, the next question under RFPA analysis is whether holding CSS to its obligations under the Services Contract, in particular its obligation to provide its services to all-comers in accordance with the Fair Practices Ordinance, substantially burdens CSS's provision of foster care to children. The Court concludes that CSS's provision of foster care to children is not substantially burdened in this case because CSS is not reasonably likely to show by clear and convincing evidence that its fundamental religious exercise has been substantially burdened under any of the four definitions of \"substantial burden\" provided under RFPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Requiring CSS's compliance with the terms of the Services Contract does not: constrain or inhibit CSS from conduct or expression mandated by its religious beliefs, curtail CSS's ability to express adherence to CSS's religious faith, deny CSS a reasonable opportunity to \"provide foster care to children,\" or compel CSS to engage in conduct or expression that violates a \"specific tenet\" of CSS's religious faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Resolution of the issue of \"substantial burden\" requires the Court to focus on what precisely CSS has been asked to do in this case and whether doing it necessarily results in a conflict with CSS's religious beliefs. CSS has been asked, and indeed CSS agreed when it entered into the Services Contract, to serve all persons who seek CSS's services consistent with the all-comers provisions of the Fair Practice Ordinance. Compliance with the all-comers provisions would, as discussed above, require CSS to provide certification services to prospective parents regardless of, among other things, religion, race, marital\n   status, sexual violence victim status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or age. CSS contends that compliance with the all-comers provision of the Services Contract necessarily compels it to engage in \"conduct and expression contrary to Catholic teaching,\" in particular, Catholic teaching about marriage. Pls.' Br. 14, ECF No. 10-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   CSS contends that the provision of certification services for same-sex couples would require CSS to express its religious approval of same-sex relationships in contravention of Catholic teaching about marriage. This is not the case. To illustrate this point, if, for example, CSS were to certify a couple where one spouse is previously divorced, CSS's certification would not suggest that CSS approved of divorce as a religious matter. In short, CSS was hired to provide a scope of services to the citizens of Philadelphia that is narrower than CSS contends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The Services Contract requires CSS to \"recruit, screen, train, and provide certified resource care homes\" consistent with the all-comers provisions of the Fair Practices Ordinance Decl. of James Amato Ex. A, ECF p. 28 of 52, ECF No. 13-3. The Services Contract does not require CSS to do anything in connection with prospective foster parents but certify prospective foster parents as meeting state guidelines for foster care. CSS is imbuing its certifications with meaning that is not required or compelled by the Services Contract. The Services Contract does not require CSS to express its religious approval or disapproval of persons seeking out its services. The Services Contract does not require CSS to do or say anything else in connection with CSS's religious views.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   With this understanding in mind, the Court concludes that DHS has not and is not constraining Plaintiffs' ability to engage in the provision of foster care to children by imposing on CSS a contractual condition that would require CSS to violate its religious beliefs or curtail CSS's ability to express its religious beliefs. In essence, if CSS provides its services consistent with the minimal requirements of the all-comers provisions of the Fair Practices Ordinance, then CSS may continue to provide foster care to children. This does not constitute a substantial burden on CSS's religious exercise of providing foster care to children. As to the individual Plaintiffs, as discussed in detail below and in connection with the irreparable harm prong, the individuals are not constrained by Defendants' actions in connection with CSS in their fostering of children because the individual Plaintiffs are, as they always have been, entitled to be foster parents with any of the thirty foster care agencies with whom DHS has contracted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Free Speech Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Plaintiffs allege two claims under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. First, Plaintiffs allege that the services CSS provides under the Services Contract relating to certification of prospective foster parents are services for which CSS is not paid, therefore, by requiring CSS to provide certifications DHS is compelling CSS to engage in unpaid for speech. Second, Plaintiffs contend that DHS and Philadelphia retaliated against CSS for CSS's comments published in the March 13\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia Inquirer\n   </em>\n   article in violation of the Free Speech Clause. The Court rejects both claims. First, in hiring CSS to perform services under the Services Contract, DHS and Philadelphia did not seek to create a forum for private speech nor did they seek to promote speech at all. Rather, DHS contracted for specific services relating to DHS's responsibility of providing foster care services to the citizens of Philadelphia, including certification services and home visits for prospective\n   foster parents.

The Services Contract is not intended here, in contrast to the Legal Services Corporation Act in\n   <em>\n    Legal Servs. Corp.\n   </em>\n   , to create a forum for private speech or to facilitate private speech. CSS and its sister agencies were hired to perform governmental\n   functions for DHS and Philadelphia. That CSS's services under the Services Contract parallel many of DHS's own, provides support for the conclusion that CSS is performing governmental work, including the dissemination of governmental messages. For example, CSS is required under the Services Contract to recruit prospective foster parents, and, in fact, CSS has recruited prospective foster parents in much the same way that DHS has recruited prospective foster parents.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Jun. 18, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 65:14-19 (testifying that she saw television commercials soliciting prospective foster parents) and Foster Care &amp; Adoption Services, https://cssphiladelphia.org/adoption/ (last visited Jul. 1, 2018) (advertising CSS's foster care and adoption services to members of the public through a website)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Jun. 18, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 101:19-101:2 (Ali) (describing phone bank recruiting event) and Jun. 19, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 161:23-162:1 (Figueroa) (describing recruitment as a general foster-care responsibility). That CSS's work under the Services Contract was governmental in nature, is further supported by the fact that the Services Contract stipulated that written materials published by CSS relating to services rendered under the Services Contract were to identify DHS as a funding source. CSS's work under the Services Contract is, thus, an extension of DHS's own work and CSS's speech, to the extent any is required under the Services Contract, constitutes governmental speech under\n   <em>\n    Legal Servs. Corp.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   As CSS's speech, to the extent any is required under the Services Contract, constitutes governmental speech, DHS is permitted to \"take legitimate and appropriate steps to ensure that its message,\" that foster care services in Philadelphia are provided to all Philadelphians consistent with the all-comers provision of the Fair Practices Ordinance, was and is \"neither garbled nor distorted by\" CSS.\n   <em>\n    Legal Servs. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505810\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/533/\">\n    531 U.S. at 541-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505810\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/533/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Plaintiffs rely on\n   <em>\n    Cradle of Liberty Council, Inc. v.

First,\n   <em>\n    Cradle of Liberty\n   </em>\n   is not binding on this Court. Second,\n   <em>\n    Cradle of Liberty\n   </em>\n   is otherwise not persuasive because the facts at issue in that case are not analogous to the facts at issue here.\n   <em>\n    Cradle of Liberty\n   </em>\n   concerned a Boy Scout troop that was using a city-subsidized building to carry out youth activities, all while refusing membership to prospective gay Boy Scouts. The City attempted to change the Boy Scout troop's general policy on membership for prospective gay Scouts by conditioning the lease of the building on a policy change. Ultimately, the district court concluded that the City could not use the lease to change the tenant Boy Scout troop's general policies when the policies were not related to the use of the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The critical difference between\n   <em>\n    Cradle of Liberty\n   </em>\n   and this case is that in\n   <em>\n    Cradle of Liberty\n   </em>\n   , the City attempted to use a lease agreement to change a tenant's policy that was unrelated to the lease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3549568\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/851/936/#p948\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3549568\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/851/936/#p948\">\n    at 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (providing that the City had informed the tenant that \"it had to completely abandon its practice of denying membership to homosexuals,\n   <em>\n    even in contexts unrelated to the subsidized building\n   </em>\n   \"). In this case, by contrast, Defendants' insistence that CSS serve all-comers consistent with the Services Contract is central to the purpose of the Services Contract. Defendants have not conditioned CSS's Services Contract on CSS changing its activities, views, opinions outside the context of the Services Contract. CSS may\n   continue to refuse its private services to same sex couples outside the confines of the Service Contract and outside of CSS's role as a DHS foster care agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

There is no evidence that it was CSS's viewpoint, as opposed to CSS's verbal and written confirmation that its policies directly conflicted with the Services Contract, that motivated DHS to close CSS's intake of new referrals. Even if CSS's engagement in protected activity, namely CSS's commenting to the\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia Inquirer\n   </em>\n   about CSS's policies in connection with a public services contract, was a substantial or motivating factor for DHS's alleged retaliation, the Court concludes that DHS would likely prevail in establishing that it would have taken the same action had CSS not spoken with the\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia Inquirer\n   </em>\n   about its policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   For purposes of this analysis, the Court assumes that CSS's statements to the\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia Inquirer\n   </em>\n   and the publication of those statements constitute constitutionally-protected activity. Assuming that CSS has engaged in constitutionally-protected activity, the next analytical step is determining whether CSS's protected activity was a substantial or motivating factor in the alleged retaliatory action. While CSS would have the Court conclude that the evidence in the record shows that DHS closed CSS's intake of new referrals\n   <em>\n    because of CSS's viewpoint\n   </em>\n   as communicated to the\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia Inquirer\n   </em>\n   , in fact, the evidence shows that DHS closed CSS's intake of new referrals because CSS confirmed that its policies violate CSS's contractual obligations under the Services Contract.

Accordingly, the decision in\n   <em>\n    Keeton\n   </em>\n   demonstrates that a plaintiff lodging a First Amendment retaliation claim must establish a causal link between the alleged retaliation and that plaintiff's alleged protected activity.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Briscoe v.

CSS misperceives the closure of its intake as having to do with its viewpoint in the same way the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Keeton\n   </em>\n   misperceived \"her viewpoint-based objections to [the university's] officials' actions with viewpoint discrimination.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3860789\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/664/865/\">\n    664 F.3d at 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although CSS expressed its position on same-sex relationships, it was not that expression that motivated DHS's actions.

In addition to testimony that DHS would not permit any agency to refuse service to qualified Philadelphians protected by the all-comers provisions of the Fair Practices Ordinance, perhaps the strongest evidence that DHS would have taken the same course of action even in the absence of CSS's purported protected activity is the fact that DHS, indeed, took the same course of action in connection with Bethany Christian Services-who also made comments to the\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia Inquirer\n   </em>\n   , that has similar policies in contravention of its services contract.

The Court disagrees because these alleged harms are either not present on these facts or are otherwise not irreparable for purposes of preliminary injunction analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The first two harms to which Plaintiffs point are harms that would occur only if Plaintiffs First Amendment rights have been violated. As the Court explained at length above, Plaintiffs are unlikely to prevail on the merits of their First Amendment claims. Accordingly, while a loss of First Amendment freedom may be considered irreparable\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   these alleged harms are not present on the facts before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Plaintiffs' third alleged irreparable harm is the possibility that CSS, without a new government services contract, may lay off staff or shut down its operations. It is hornbook law that the \"irreparable harm requirement is met if a plaintiff demonstrates a significant risk that he or she will experience harm that cannot adequately be compensated after the fact by monetary damages ... this is not an easy burden.\"\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

Evidence shows that CSS is compensated by DHS under the Services Contract and that CSS is paid on a per diem basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of James Amato Ex. A, ECF p. 15 of 52, ECF No. 13-3; Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 11:4-7 (Figueroa) (testifying that many contractors are paid on a per diem basis); Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 139:20-24 (same) (Figueroa); Jun. 19, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 41:5-6 (Amato) (testifying that CSS \"subsidized [foster care] services to the tune of $3.8 million\"). Given the Parties' familiarity of their financial relationship, the Court concludes that CSS's possible harm in the form of lost revenue under the Services Contract can be quantified and may be fully compensable through money damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Plaintiffs have also not established the imminence of their financial collapse in the absence of injunctive relief because CSS has testified that it also has foster care contracts with Montgomery County, PA and Bucks County, PA. Jun. 19, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 89:3-9 (Amato). There are also interim financial arrangements that are available to CSS. DHS Commissioner Figueroa explained that in the past, when foster care agencies have shut down, DHS, in fact, has provided temporary funding to those foster care agencies to ensure smooth transitions of their staff, foster parents, and the children. Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 10:23-11:9 (Figueroa). Accordingly, the economic harms to which Plaintiffs point in support of injunctive relief are insufficient to meet the exacting standard of irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Plaintiffs' fourth alleged irreparable harm is the purported inability of CSS-certified foster parents to continue providing foster care services if CSS closed its operations and the foster parents were forced to transfer to other agencies. To prove this point, Plaintiffs called each of the four individual plaintiffs in this case to testify to the harms that they would expect to suffer if CSS closed its operations. Ms. Simms-Busch testified that if CSS closed its foster program that she, as of the time of the hearing, had \"no idea\" how she or her foster children would be impacted. Jun. 18, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 52:16-23 (Simms-Busch). Ms. Simms-Busch also was unsure whether she could or could not transfer to another foster care agency. Jun. 18, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 53:2-7 (Simms-Busch). Ms. Paul likewise was unsure what impact CSS's closure would have on her ability to provide foster care and was unsure whether she could or could not transfer to another foster care agency. Jun. 18, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 63:11-25 (Paul). Ms. Fulton was similarly unsure what impact CSS's closure would have on her provision of foster care, though she would be emotionally devastated. Jun. 18, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 68:20-23 (Fulton). Each of the individual plaintiffs expressed that CSS's closure would be emotionally burdensome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   While transferring to another agency may be difficult, uncertain, and emotionally challenging, transferring to other agencies is neither impossible nor unlikely to be successful. Decl. Kimberly Ali \u00b6\u00b6 27-29, ECF No. 20-1 (explaining the process by which resource parents transfer from one agency to another); Decl. Kimberly Ali \u00b6\u00b6 34-36, ECF No. 20-1 (describing how Lutheran Children and Family Service of Eastern Pennsylvania's voluntary closure was handled and explaining that there were no significant issues in transferring families to other agencies). The Third Circuit, although acknowledging how individuals can suffer mental anguish in connection with litigation, has held that emotional difficulty alone cannot justify the imposition of an injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit concluded that even where the denial of injunctive relief would force patients to switch doctors and medical providers and that such a switching of doctors would prove \"emotionally draining\" and could present some medical risk, such harms were not the type of irreparable harm \"contemplated by the preliminary injunction standard.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11470200\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/475/#p484\">\n    204 F.3d at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Third Circuit continued stating that \"injunctions will not be issued merely to allay the fears and apprehensions or to soothe the anxieties of the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11470200\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/475/#p484\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11470200\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/475/#p484\">\n    at 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, in the event CSS closes its operations, the individual plaintiffs and other non-party CSS-certified resource parents may transfer to other agencies and continue using their skills to provide foster care to children, even though such transfers may be challenging.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs argue that in the event CSS closes its operations, the number of children in congregate care living situations will increase or the number of children in DHS's overnight foster care room will increase. As provided above, in connection with the factual background of this case, DHS has shown that the closure of CSS's intake of new referrals has had little or no effect on the operation of Philadelphia's foster care system. DHS Commissioner Figueroa testified that CSS's intake closure \"has not resulted in a rise in children placed in congregate care.\" Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 86:4-87:9 (Figueroa). Further Commissioner Figueroa testified that CSS's intake closure \"has not resulted in a rise in children staying in DHS's childcare room.\" Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 86:4-87:9 (Figueroa). Figueroa's testimony was based on her review of \"weekly data\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   that Figueroa receives from DHS's \"performance and technology team that ... have ... detailed data.\" Jun. 21, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 86:16-87:11 (Figueroa). To the extent CSS closes its operations, it would not be the first foster agency to do so in Philadelphia. Decl. Kimberly Ali \u00b6\u00b6 34-36, ECF No. 20-1 (explaining that Lutheran Children and Family Service of Eastern Pennsylvania closed its operations in March 2016 and its over 100 foster children were transferred to other foster agencies over a three-month period). Plaintiffs have not established with sufficient evidence that irreparable harm in the form of increased use of congregate care or the DHS overnight foster care room will result absent an injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Balancing Of The Harms And The Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   As the Court has concluded that Plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of their claims and have presented insufficient evidence of irreparable harm, the Court need not spend undue time analyzing the remaining two factors of the preliminary injunction standard-balancing of the equities, and the public interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reilly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276310\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/173/#p180\">\n    858 F.3d at 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing that the first two factors of the preliminary injunction standard are gateway factors).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   In connection with the balancing of harms prong of the analysis, Defendants called Frank Cervone as an expert to testify to the harms that might occur if the Court granted injunctive relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Parties disagree on whether Cervone's testimony should be considered for a variety of reasons. The Court, however, need not, and has not relied on Cervone's testimony in deciding the Injunction Motion, and therefore, the Court will not address the Parties' arguments on the propriety of Cervone's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Here, even in the absence of Cervone's testimony, the balance of the equities tilts in favor of Defendants. If the Court were to grant Plaintiffs' Injunction Motion, the Court would, in essence, cast aside DHS's and Philadelphia's reasonable objectives in seeking the enforcement of the Services Contract and the Fair Practices Ordinance incorporated into the Services Contract. As discussed in connection with Plaintiffs' claim under the Free Exercise Clause, Defendants' interests in this case are manifold, but at a minimum, include six important governmental objectives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   First, DHS and Philadelphia have a legitimate interest in ensuring that when contractors agree to terms in a government contract, the contractors adhere to those terms. Second, DHS and Philadelphia have a legitimate interest in ensuring that when its contractors voluntarily agree to be bound by local laws, the local laws are enforced. Third, DHS and Philadelphia have a legitimate interest in ensuring that when they employ contractors to provide governmental services, the services are accessible to all Philadelphians who are qualified for the services. Fourth, in the context of foster care and adoption, DHS and Philadelphia have a legitimate interest in ensuring that the pool of foster parents and resource caregivers is as diverse and broad as the children in need of foster parents and resource caregivers. Fifth, DHS and Philadelphia have a legitimate interest in ensuring that individuals who pay taxes to fund government contractors are not denied access to those services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Sixth, DHS and Philadelphia have an interest in avoiding likely Equal Protection Clause and Establishment Clause claims that would result if it allowed its government contractors to avoid compliance with the all-comers, nondiscrimination provisions of the Fair Practices Ordinance by discriminating against same-sex married couples.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Granting an injunction in the face of the foregoing legitimate interests would be in direct conflict with the balance of harms and the public interest. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the balance of harms and the public interest militate in favor of denying the Injunction Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, and having considered all four factors implicated by the preliminary injunction standard, Plaintiffs' Amended Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 13) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . An appropriate Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    On June 7, 2018, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction because of the Parties' concern that the initial Motion may not have adequately protected the privacy interests of certain minor children identified in the initial Motion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Jun. 20, 2018 Order, ECF No. 32 (dismissing as moot and sealing the initial Motion). Accordingly, unless otherwise noted, the Court's references to the Injunction Motion are references to Plaintiffs' Amended Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (ECF No. 13).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    On June 18, 2018, the Court accepted the Intervenors' Opposition Brief as an amicus brief. The Court's acceptance of the Amicus Brief is memorialized by order dated June 20, 2018.

While the religious affiliation of the minister writing the clergy letter does not matter, Amato explained that the receipt of a clergy letter on behalf of a prospective foster parent is an absolute condition to CSS's certification of that prospective foster parent. Jun. 19, 2017 Hearing Tr. 95:12-16, 95:21-23 (Amato). It appears, therefore, that CSS will not certify prospective foster parents who are religious but whose religious exercise does not include a relationship with a minister, prospective foster parents who choose not to associate with any religious tradition, or prospective foster parents who associate with a religious tradition that does not have religious ministers willing or able to provide a clergy letter. This evidence is disconcerting to the Court because it raises serious constitutional as well as contractual questions. Among other things, this policy appears to contravene CSS's contractual obligations under its contract with DHS under Section 4.1(k). Section 4.1(k) prohibits CSS from discriminating against individuals based on the individuals' religious beliefs. Section 4.1(k) provides that CSS:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n    shall inform all individuals to whom Services are provided, whether directly or indirectly, of the following: \"The Philadelphia Department of Human Services' selection of a faith-based provider of social services is not an endorsement of the Provider's religious character, practices or beliefs. No Provider of social services may discriminate against you on the basis of religion, a religious belief or your refusal to actively participate in religious practices.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-210\">\n    Decl. of James Amato Ex.
