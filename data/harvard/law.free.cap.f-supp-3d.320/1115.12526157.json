Dkts. 50, 52. For the reasons stated below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Problem of Pollution from Stormwater Runoff in Los Angeles\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When rain falls on undeveloped land, water is absorbed by vegetation, soaked up\n   by the ground, and filtered by both. On the other hand, when rain falls on impervious surfaces like concrete and asphalt, water cannot reach the soil and vegetation that slow and filter its flow. Instead, it becomes runoff. The impervious surfaces that increase runoff are often concentrated in urban areas. High population density and activity in these areas generate elevated levels of pollutants that collect on roadways, parking lots, roofs, and other impervious surfaces. When rain falls on these surfaces, it mobilizes pollutants that have accumulated there. These pollutants travel with the runoff as it flows into storm sewer systems and waterways. This urban stormwater pollution is a leading cause of water pollution in the Los Angeles area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Dominguez Channel is a Los Angeles waterway that begins as an underground storm drain and continues as an open channel before flowing into the Los Angeles Inner Harbor. One million people live in the Dominguez Channel watershed, including many who use the Channel and the Harbor for recreation. The Harbor provides habitat for hundreds of species, including birds, sea lions, dolphins, and fish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Los Cerritos Channel begins as a concrete-lined channel before becoming a tidal estuary. It drains into the Alamitos Bay, and from there into the Pacific Ocean. A path runs along part of the Channel. The Channel is home to a marina and a popular fishing spot. The watershed provides an overwintering site for many species of birds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Dominguez and Los Cerritos Channel watersheds are both heavily polluted by stormwater runoff. In particular, the water quality of the Dominguez Channel watershed is impaired by a variety of pollutants, including zinc and copper. The freshwater portion of the Los Cerritos Channel is similarly impaired by zinc and copper pollution. The water quality of both watersheds is expected to remain impaired by pollution, especially zinc and copper pollution, for years to come. Metals like zinc and copper have acute and chronic impacts on aquatic life. The pollution also makes these waterways unsafe and unenjoyable for people who live, work, and play nearby.

The Clean Water Act's Regulation of Pollution from Stormwater\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 1972, Congress passed a series of sweeping amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948, and as a result of these substantial amendments, the statute became known as the Clean Water Act.\n   <em>\n    Nw.

Due to EPA's slow pace in regulating stormwater discharges in particular, in 1987, Congress amended the section governing NPDES permits to expressly require EPA to issue NPDES permits to regulate these discharges.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201342\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p) ; 132 Cong. Rec. S16425 (daily ed. Oct. 16, 1986) (statement of Sen. Stafford) (\"EPA should have developed this program long ago. Unfortunately, it did not.\"). Thus, stormwater discharges that travel through storm sewers are point source discharges subject to NPDES permitting requirements.\n   <em>\n    Envtl. Def. Ctr., Inc. v.

Congress limited this exemption by carving out five categories of stormwater discharges, including \"[a] discharge for which the Administrator or the State, as the case may be, determines that the stormwater discharge contributes to a violation of a water quality standard or is a significant contributor of pollutants to waters of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201342\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p)(2).

In California, EPA has authorized the State Water Resources Control Board to implement the NPDES permitting program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   California has taken steps to control impacts from stormwater discharges. Principal among these efforts are California's municipal separate storm sewer systems (\"MS4s\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   permits throughout the Los Angeles area, where more than 85 municipalities are covered. The MS4 permits regulate the discharge of stormwater into the receiving waters that Plaintiffs seek to protect, contain limitations that prohibit discharges that cause or contribute to violations of water quality standards, and use water quality driven planning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiffs' Administrative Petitions and the Present Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   EPA's stormwater regulations provide that any person may petition the agency \"to require a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ('NPDES') permit for a discharge which is composed entirely of storm water which contributes to a violation of a water quality standard.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20122.26\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(2). Pursuant to that regulation, Plaintiffs submitted two petitions to EPA Region 9, which oversees Clean Water Act compliance in California. The petitions involved two different Los Angeles-area watersheds: (1) the Dominguez\n   Channel and Los Angeles/Long Beach Inner Harbor watershed, and (2) the Los Cerritos Channel and Alamitos Bay watershed (collectively, \"the watersheds\"). Cirino Decl., Ex. A at 1 (Dominguez Pet.), Ex. B at 1 (Los Cerritos Pet.), Dkt. No. 39-2. Plaintiffs' petitions requested that EPA make a determination that currently unpermitted stormwater discharges from privately-owned commercial, industrial, and institutional (\"CII\") sources are contributing to violations of water quality standards in the watersheds, and therefore require NPDES permits pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201342\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p).\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The petitions provided evidence that stormwater discharges from commercial, industrial, and institutional sources are impairing water quality in both watersheds. Dominguez Pet. at 12-23; Los Cerritos Pet. at 12-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On October 17, 2016, EPA denied Plaintiffs' petitions to require NPDES permits. Dkt. 39-2. (\"Dominguez Pet. Denial\" and \"Los Cerritos Pet. Denial\" collectively \"Pet. Denials\"). EPA concluded that stormwater discharges from CII sources were \"contributing to water quality impairments\" at the watersheds. Dominguez Pet. Denial at 16; Los Cerritos Pet. Denial at 17. Nevertheless, EPA concluded that requiring permits was unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   EPA analyzed Plaintiffs' petitions in light of the following factors: (1) the likelihood of exposure of pollutants to precipitation at sites identified in Plaintiffs' petitions; (2) the sufficiency of the available data on which to make a determination that stormwater discharges from those sites contribute to a violation of water quality standards; and (3) whether other federal, state, or local programs adequately address the known stormwater discharge contribution to a violation of water quality standards. Cirino Decl. Exhibit C at 5-16, Exhibit D at 5-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   EPA concluded that the first two factors were satisfied. Specifically, EPA stated that \"the pollutants of concern are exposed to stormwater at CII sources and that there are sufficient data available to demonstrate that stormwater discharges are contributing to water quality impairments in the [Watersheds].\" Dkt. 39 at 7. With respect to the third factor, EPA concluded that existing programs are underway to adequately address the impairments. This conclusion primarily relied on NPDES permits that have been issued to MS4s in the watersheds, operated or controlled by municipalities. The EPA also cited to three other permits to show that adequate programs exist: a statewide NPDES permit for the California Department of Transportation, a statewide general permit for industrial facilities, and a statewide permit for small MS4s. None of these permits regulate the CII sources in the watersheds which were the subject of Plaintiffs' petitions, leaving these stormwater discharges unregulated. Because of the existing NPDES permits, EPA refused to require the permits Plaintiffs' petitions requested and it denied the petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs subsequently sent EPA notice of their intent to sue the agency for its failure to regulate the sites. On May 8, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a complaint in this Court, alleging (1) a failure to perform a nondiscretionary duty under the Clean Water Act pursuant to the Clean Water Act's citizen-suit provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) ; and (2) in the alternative, arbitrary and capricious agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 83-91.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On November 2, 2017, this Court granted in part and denied in part EPA's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims. Dkt. 46. The Court dismissed Plaintiffs' claim under the Clean Water Act's citizen-suit provision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Clean Water Act's citizen-suit provisi\n   on,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), provides a limited waiver of sovereign immunity for citizen suits alleging EPA's failure \"to perform any act or duty under this chapter which is not discretionary.\" If EPA has failed to perform a nondiscretionary duty, \"[t]he district courts shall have jurisdiction, without regard to the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties ... to order the Administrator to perform such act or duty[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1365(a). In its order, this Court concluded that EPA had discretion to decide whether or not to require NPDES permits for stormwater. Because the citizen-suit provision only provides for such suits where a plaintiff seeks to enforce a\n   <em>\n    non\n   </em>\n   discretionary duty, the Court dismissed Plaintiffs' citizen-suit claim.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Before the Court is Plaintiffs' claim against EPA under the APA. Plaintiffs argue that EPA's denial of its petitions was arbitrary and capricious for two reasons: (1) the text of the Clean Water Act requires EPA to engage in the NPDES permitting process for the stormwater it has determined contributes to a water quality violation and (2) in denying Plaintiffs' petition, EPA considered an improper factor in its denial. The Court also evaluates Plaintiff American Rivers' standing, as a result of EPA's contention that American Rivers lacks standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As explained below, the Court concludes that EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying Plaintiffs' permits and leaving the stormwater discharges at issue unregulated. First, where, as here, EPA has determined that a stormwater discharge contributes to a violation of a water quality standard, the Clean Water Act requires\n   EPA to either (1) engage in the NPDES permitting process for the discharge at issue or (2) prohibit the discharge. An additional basis for concluding that EPA's denial of Plaintiffs' petition was arbitrary and capricious is that EPA considered a factor divorced from the text of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

But EPA implies that if the Administrator declines to require permits for such discharges, then EPA may leave those discharges unregulated.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201342\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    This second interpretive step is incorrect. As explained, the text of the statute indicates that EPA must either require permits or leave the discharges subject to \u00a7 1311(a)'s total proscription on the discharges.

Rather, in EPA's view, \u00a7 1342(p)(2)(E) sets forth a prerequisite that must exist-stormwater discharge contributing to a violation of water quality standards-before EPA\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    exercise its discretion to issue permits. The Clean Air Act set up a similar statutory structure: criterion that triggers regulation. In\n    <em>\n     Massachusetts v.

Similarly here, EPA's decision not to regulate was impermissible because it was based on a factor divorced from the statutory text.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
