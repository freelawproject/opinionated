On one hand, FOIA desires \"to ensure an informed citizenry, vital to the functioning of a democratic society, needed to check against corruption[,] and to hold governors accountable to the governed.\"\n   <em>\n    NLRB v. Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178611\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/214/#p242\">\n    437 U.S. 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 242,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178611\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/214/#p242\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178611\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/214/#p242\">\n    57 L.Ed.2d 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978).

When defendant did not comply with plaintiff's request immediately, plaintiff filed this suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1. Defendant since has produced more than\n   2,000 pages of documents about GTMO's closure. Defendant now moves for summary judgment, arguing that its response achieves the balance FOIA desires (Doc. 21). Plaintiff argues that the court should deny the motion because defendant has conducted an insufficient search, withheld documents impermissibly, and produced insufficient information to fulfill one of plaintiff's requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For reasons explained below, the court grants defendant's motion in part and denies it in part. After reviewing the parties' submissions, the court concludes that no genuine dispute of material fact exists that defendant failed its FOIA obligations except for five documents, which the court will review\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   to determine if defendant properly withheld some information. After discussing the facts governing this motion, the court explains its reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In 2002, the U.S. government began detaining combatants captured in the Middle East. The base has been the source of controversy and in 2009, President Obama signed an Executive Order directing defendant to research the feasibility of closing GTMO and transferring detainees to, among other places, the U.S. mainland. Exec. Order No. 13,492,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%204%2C897\">\n    74 Fed. Reg. 4,897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 4,898 (Jan. 22, 2009). Soon after that order, defendant tasked the Office of Detainee Policy (\"ODP\") to lead this research. The ODP is a department within the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense and is the lead office within defendant for detainee policy. When ODP began working on the GTMO closure plan, it required all employees to save emails about that plan in a separate folder in their email boxes and place any documents about the closure plan in a designated folder on the ODP's shared drive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 16, 2015, plaintiff sent defendant a FOIA request. Plaintiff asked defendant to produce information created between December 26, 2013, and December 16, 2015, about:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (a) the implementation of [President Obama's Executive Order], concerning the disposition of individuals detained at [GTMO] and the closure of the detention facilities located there;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (b) the transfer or potential transfer to the United States mainland of individuals currently detained at [GTMO];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (c) site visits to military bases or detention facilities in Kansas or any other State as part of, or related to, an effort to find a facility to house individuals currently detained at [GTMO];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (d) the modification or construction of any military base or federal or state-owned prison, penitentiary, or other detention facility for the purpose of housing individuals currently detained at [GTMO];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (e) any assessment of the suitability of any location at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, or elsewhere within the State of Kansas, as a site for potentially housing individuals currently detained at [GTMO];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (f) surveys or questionnaires regarding potential transfer sites on the United States mainland for individuals currently detained at [GTMO];\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (g) any expenditures of funds related to (a) through (f), including any travel or personnel costs related to surveying potential transfer sites on the United States mainland for individuals currently detained at [GTMO]; [and]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (h) the legal basis for any violation of the funding restrictions Congress has imposed [preventing the federal government from spending money on activities related to GTMO's closure].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Doc. 1-1 (FOIA Request) at 2-3. The parties made two modifications to plaintiff's request. First, plaintiff agreed to change (a) so that it included only information about the possible relocation of GTMO detainees to Kansas. Doc. 1-3 (FOIA Modification Email) at 2. Second, plaintiff agreed to modify (g) so that it included only information about expenditures defendant incurred traveling to and surveying potential GTMO detainee relocation sites.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%204%2C897\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Shortly after the parties agreed to these modifications, President Obama released his GTMO closure plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant did not comply with plaintiff's request immediately. So, on July 22, 2016, plaintiff filed this suit, claiming that defendant had a duty under FOIA to release the information plaintiff sought. After plaintiff filed this suit, defendant initially produced a one-page document addressing plaintiff's modified request (g). On November 15, 2016, defendant provided non-classified system documents responsive to plaintiff's request. After that, defendant released the responsive classified documents on a rolling basis, delivering the last set of documents in March 2017. In all, defendant has produced more than 2,000 pages of responsive documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Search Process\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As noted above, before defendant received plaintiff's FOIA request, the ODP had segregated emails and documents about GTMO's closure. When defendant began searching for the information that plaintiff had requested, defendant determined that ODP was the only agency with relevant information because it led President Obama's GTMO closure plan development. And it coordinated all communications between the relevant governmental agencies. So, defendant concluded, any information stored outside ODP would duplicate information it possessed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Three ODP employees then began the search process. They started in ODP's shared drive and the emails ODP had saved when it started the GTMO closure project. They also searched ODP's classified and unclassified system using the search terms \"Kansas, Colorado, Charleston, Florence, Leavenworth, Brig, BOP, USDB, CONUS, and closure.\" Doc. 22-1 (Herrington Decl.) \u00b6 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, they scanned 20 paper documents that ODP had produced during the GTMO closure project.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%204%2C897\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%204%2C897\">\n    \u00b6 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After redacting what ODP thought it should withhold, defendant released the documents to plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate if the moving party demonstrates that \"no genuine dispute [about] any material fact\" exists and that it \"is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). When applying this standard, the court views the evidence and draws inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    Nahno-Lopez v.

To\n   prevail on a summary judgment motion in a FOIA case, \"the defending agency has the burden of showing that its search was adequate and that any withheld documents fall within an exemption to FOIA.\"\n   <em>\n    Whitson v. U.S. Forest Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274039\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/253/1133/#p1139\">\n    253 F.Supp.3d 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1139 (D.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant asks the court to grant summary judgment against plaintiff's claim, arguing that it has complied fully with its FOIA obligations. Plaintiff opposes this request for three reasons. First, plaintiff argues that defendant conducted an inadequate search. Second, plaintiff asserts that defendant improperly exempted certain portions of the documents it released. And last, plaintiff argues that defendant has failed to produce adequate information to satisfy its request for information about the expenditures defendant incurred surveying possible GTMO detainee relocation sites. The court addresses these arguments in the next three subsections, below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Adequacy of the Search\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff first quarrels with the adequacy of defendant's search.

When it conducted its search, ODP used three of its employees. They started their search by looking in a folder on ODP's shared drive where ODP had centralized all documents about GTMO's closure. They also asked other ODP employees to move all emails they saved about GTMO's closure to a folder created in response to plaintiff's FOIA request. Finally, they electronically searched ODP's system using the search terms \"Kansas, Colorado, Charleston, Florence, Leavenworth, Brig, BOP, USDB, CONUS, and closure.\" Herrington Decl. \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff takes exception to two aspects of defendant's search: where defendant searched and how it searched.

Here, \"detain\" is extremely broad because ODP leads defendant's policy formulation on detainees. Herrington Decl. \u00b6 5. Any search for the word \"detain\" thus likely would produce a vast load of unresponsive documents. And defendant has explained that \"transfer\" and \"survey\" are not terms unique to the GTMO closure process, which is why defendant chose not to use those terms. Herrington Decl. \u00b6 8.

In its affidavit, defendant explained, \"All of the documents addressed herein have been carefully reviewed for reasonable segregation of non-exempt information, and, following a line-by-line review, it has been determined that no further segregation of meaningful information in the withheld documents can be made without disclosing information warranting protection under the law.\" Herrington Decl. \u00b6 28. Plaintiff illuminates no part of the record-except for the five documents discussed below-that would create doubt in a reasonable person's mind that defendant failed its FOIA obligation to segregate non-exempt information. Defendant thus has satisfied its general burden to produce segregable, non-exempt information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Defendant's Broad Use of Exemption 5\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Plaintiff next argues that defendant improperly invoked Exemption 5 because it broadly asserted this exemption. Plaintiff contends that this broad use of Exemption 5 created two problems. First, plaintiff argues that defendant invoked Exemption 5 broadly to hide that it actively was planning to move GTMO detainees to the U.S. mainland. This effort to hide its activities, plaintiff argues, undermines FOIA's goals. This argument is farfetched. Nothing suggests that defendant tried to hide its plan to move GTMO detainees to the U.S. mainland. Indeed, President Obama issued a public executive order directing defendant to research plans to move GTMO detainees to the continental United States. And later, he published a plan to close GTMO. The summary judgment facts establish the information defendant withholds under Exemption 5 is deliberative material that it produced before it reached a final decision. Exemption 5 protects this kind of information-except for five documents described later in this Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Integrity Comm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706153\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/501/1215/#p1226\">\n    501 F.3d at 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So, plaintiff fails to create a genuine issue of material fact that defendant has abused this exemption to hide its plans to move GTMO detainees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Second, plaintiff argues that defendant's use of a broadly based Exemption 5 response creates a genuine issue whether defendant properly could assert this exemption at all. Doc. 27 at 20. But this assertion, without more, cannot preclude summary judgment against plaintiff's FOIA claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Al-Turki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347048\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/175/1153/#p1169\">\n    175 F.Supp.3d at 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If the plaintiff can 'offer nothing more than opinion and speculation' regarding the content of the government's sworn declarations, he 'does not undermine the deference normally accorded to an agency.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3878345\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/962/130/#p140\">\n    962 F.Supp.2d at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal bracket omitted) ) ). And the court would expect Exemption 5 to apply to at least some of the documents plaintiff requested because plaintiff's request expressly focused on information created before President Obama released his GTMO closure plan. Any responsive documents are, by definition, predecisional. The only question remaining is whether the document is deliberative. As the court explains below, defendant has justified adequately that the documents it withheld are deliberative-except for five documents. The court thus rejects plaintiff's arguments that defendant failed to justify its exemptions generally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Plaintiff describes the document as one analyzing costs from 2014. Defendant argues that it took those costs into consideration when making projections about GTMO's closure and \"which costs to consider in that analysis or the estimates used in those calculations, are as essential to the deliberative process as the recommendations themselves.\" Herrington Decl. \u00b6 19.

Plaintiff specifically argues that defendant improperly invoked Exemption 5 because it gave no reason for asserting it. And 7(E) and 7(F) don't apply, plaintiff says, because defendant has justified their use improperly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Documents 77 and 78 consist of a series of charts. Doc. 22-1 (\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index) at 51-52. All but two are entitled \"GTMO Closure Major activities list with associated costs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535430\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/861/1114/#p1122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The other two are entitled \"Summation w/ all comms data preserved.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535430\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/861/1114/#p1122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant invoked Exemptions 5, 7(E), and 7(F) together for all the charts, arguing that they contain \"[l]aw enforcement records slide[s] detailing costs of detention logistics.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535430\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/861/1114/#p1122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The court first addresses plaintiff's argument that defendant never justified its use of Exemption 5. Plaintiff incorrectly claims that defendant never gave a reason it invoked Exemption 5. While the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index contains no explanation immediately following the words \"(b)(5)\"-the statutory designation of Exemption 5-defendant provides its justification, described above, after it invoked Exemptions 7(E) and 7(F). It is evident this explanation clearly applies to Exemption 5 as well because defendant grouped these exemptions together. Defendant simply saved space in the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index by giving one explanation for all its exemptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Turning to plaintiff's arguments about Exemptions 7(E) and 7(F), the court agrees with plaintiff. Law enforcement costs do not implicate the harms 7(E) and 7(F) are designed to protect. Costs, without copious amounts of detail, cannot disclose law enforcement techniques, procedures, or guidelines in a way that could allow someone to circumvent the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7)(E). Nor would the disclosure of costs put anyone's life or physical safety in danger.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 552(b)(7)(F). Indeed, the court can find no case where a court protected information about costs under Exemption 7(E) or 7(F). Defendant cited none. In contrast, though, the court concludes that defendant properly redacted this information under Exemption 5. As discussed above, Exemption 5 protects an agency's cost estimation.\n   <em>\n    Quarles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5863392,11645009\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/893/390/\">\n    893 F.2d at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And these charts involve cost estimations because they list costs for closing GTMO-an event that hasn't occurred yet. So, this information falls within Exemption 5's protection and defendant properly withheld it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    v. Classified Document 101B (Bates 1463-65)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Document 101B is an information memo. Doc. 22-1 (\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index) at 54. Defendant withheld portions of it because it contained a \"discussion on closure plan for detention facility.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5863392,11645009\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/893/390/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because the memo is entitled \"Information Memo,\" plaintiff argues, Exemption 5 does not apply.

Plaintiff-as it did when attacking document 101B's withholding-argues that Exemption 5 cannot protect information memos.

Classified Document 234 (Bates 2363-64)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Document 234 redacts the name of an agency or person-it's unclear from the document which it is-who was involved in planning a survey visit to a potential GTMO replacement site. Defendant claims the identity of the persons or agencies involved with a decision can show an agency's deliberation process. But defendant never elaborates on how disclosing this name could reveal defendant's deliberation process. The court agrees that the identity of those involved might reveal an agency's deliberation process, but it cannot conclude on the current record that disclosing this name will reveal its deliberative process. Indeed, courts sometime require federal agencies to disclose the identity of all participants in a discussion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Dep't of Energy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n    617 F.2d 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 868 (D.C.

So, it cannot rule that no genuine issue of material fact exists whether defendant properly invoked Exemption 5 for document 234. The court thus orders defendant to produce document 234 for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review. With its\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   production, defendant may also file a supplemental affidavit.

Once defendant files its supplemental\n   affidavit, plaintiff will have 14 days to file a response. The court will not allow a reply. The court will defer a final ruling on this document until after its\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the document in a supplemental order on the Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    viii. Classified Document 241 (Bates 2377-79)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Finally, plaintiff argues that defendant improperly supported its use of Exemption 5 to withhold parts of document 241. Document 241 is a scanned paper document entitled \"GTMO Closure Major activities list with associated costs.\" Doc. 22-1 (\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index) at 74. Like documents 77 and 78, defendant invoked Exemptions 5, 7(E), and 7(F) together and gives a single explanation why they apply.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The justification, defendant contends, is that document 241 has \"[l]aw enforcement records slide[s] detailing costs of personnel and guard force.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Much like documents 77 and 78, the court concludes that this explanation, which provides defendant's rationale for using all the invoked exemptions, is sufficient to justify defendant's use of Exemption 5. Because document 241 details the costs associated with closing GTMO, the withheld information is an estimated cost that falls within the deliberative process privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Quarles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5863392,11645009\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/893/390/\">\n    893 F.2d at 392-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    C. GTMO Transfer Expenditures\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   With its last argument, plaintiff contends that the court should deny defendant's motion because defendant omitted information about defendant's travel expenses to survey possible relocation sites for GTMO detainees, which plaintiff requested. In its response to this request, defendant provided a one-page chart that lists three locations that defendant surveyed: Fort Leavenworth, Kansas; Charleston, South Carolina; and Florence, Colorado. Doc. 27-1 at 1. Defendant lists air fare, per diem, and incidentals for each trip.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5863392,11645009\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/893/390/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Plaintiff claims that defendant has withheld cost data about other locations that it surveyed. Plaintiff highlights Mr. Herrington's Declaration, where he explains that defendant \"provided a one-page interim response to [plaintiff's request for an expenditure report on travel to possible relocation sites], consisting of a document summarizing [defendant's] costs incurred from\n   <em>\n    certain\n   </em>\n   site surveys....\" Herrington Decl. \u00b6 11 (emphasis added). And, plaintiff argues, a series of slides defendant produced in this request create a suspicion that defendant considered other sites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Defendant has clarified its affidavit and the slides. Its clarification explains that, in the end, it recommended 13 sites for possible relocation. Doc. 30-1 (Herrington Supp. Decl.) \u00b6 4. But it only surveyed sites at the three locations listed in the chart.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5863392,11645009\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/893/390/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   So, what Mr. Herrington meant to say in the original declaration was that though defendant considered other sites, it only visited the three locations listed in the chart. With this clarification, the court concludes that defendant has fulfilled its obligation to report GTMO relocation survey expenses. That defendant considered other sites does not contradict defendant's assertion that it only traveled to three locations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hull\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3830988\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/1174/#p1177\">\n    656 F.3d at 1177-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that summary judgment is proper in a FOIA case when the record does not contradict the agency's affidavits and no evidence exists that the agency acted in bad faith). Defendant thus fulfilled its FOIA obligations to respond to plaintiff's request for information about the GTMO relocation survey expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   For reasons explained above, the court grants defendant's Motion for Summary\n   Judgment (Doc. 21) in part and denies it in part. The court concludes that defendant fulfilled its duties under FOIA except for unclassified document 18 (Bates 57), 100 (Bates 153-56), 129 (Bates 333), 141 (Bates 421-24), and classified document 234 (Bates 2363-64). The court lacks sufficient information to decide if defendant properly exempted the information those documents contain. So, the court orders defendant to produce unclassified documents 18, 100, 129, 141 and classified document 234 for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review within 14 days of this Order's entry. Defendant, if it chooses, also must file a supplemental affidavit within 14 days of this Order's entry. Defendant must confine its supplementation to the issues the court raised in this Order. Plaintiff will have 14 days to respond to defendant's supplemental affidavit. The court will not allow a reply.
