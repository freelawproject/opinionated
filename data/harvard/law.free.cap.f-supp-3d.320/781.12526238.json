Rather than resolving this categorical question, the Court held only that ATS suits may not proceed against foreign corporations. In reaching that conclusion, the Court explained that there is a general reluctance to create a private right of action where, as in the ATS, there is no explicit statutory right of action and that this principle should \"apply with particular force in the context of the ATS\" because of the foreign policy concerns implicated by ATS suits.\n   <em>\n    Jesner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611257\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1386/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1402-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

[Dkt. No. 812] 12. Under CACI's reading of\n   <em>\n    Jesner\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court \"change[d] the way a court must analyze claims asserted under [the] ATS for purposes of subject-matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Specifically, CACI argues\n   that\n   <em>\n    Jesner\n   </em>\n   \"makes clear\" that courts must undertake \"an\n   <em>\n    independent inquiry\n   </em>\n   akin to a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   'special-factor analysis' \" before allowing an ATS claim to proceed and that, under this framework, plaintiffs have the burden of showing that allowing their claims to proceed would not infringe on appropriate separation of powers and would \"further the principal objective of the ATS,\" which is to \"prevent foreign entanglements and international friction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. Although this Court has serious doubts about whether\n   <em>\n    Jesner\n   </em>\n   established this kind of analysis,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   assuming for the\n   sake of argument that CACI has correctly framed the appropriate ATS inquiry after Jesner, plaintiffs have nevertheless made the required showing and their claims will not be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Beginning with CACI's argument that plaintiffs' claims infringe on separation of powers, the Fourth Circuit has already recognized that allowing these claims to proceed does not impermissibly interfere with the political branches. First, in its 2014 decision addressing extraterritoriality under\n   <em>\n    Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petrol. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/\">\n    569 U.S. 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), the Fourth Circuit concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-19\">\n   Indeed, we observe that mechanically applying the presumption [against extraterritoriality] to bar these ATS claims would not advance the purposes of the presumption. A basic premise of the presumption against extraterritorial application is that United States courts must be wary of international discord resulting from unintended clashes between our laws and those of other nations. In the present case, however, the plaintiffs seek to enforce the customary law of nations through a jurisdictional vehicle provided under United States law, the ATS, rather than a federal statute that itself details conduct to be regulated or enforced. Thus, any substantive norm enforced through an ATS claim necessarily is recognized by other nations as being actionable. Moreover, this case does not present any potential problems associated with bringing foreign nationals into United States courts to answer for conduct committed abroad, given that the defendants are United States citizens.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   We likewise note that further litigation of these ATS claims will not require unwarranted judicial interference in the conduct of foreign policy. The political branches already have indicated that the United States will not tolerate acts of torture, whether committed by United States citizens or by foreign nationals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-21\">\n   The plaintiffs do not appear to have access to federal courts under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 (TVPA), presumably because they did not suffer injury under actual or apparent authority, or color of law, of any\n   <em>\n    foreign\n   </em>\n   nation. Nevertheless, the TVPA's broad prohibition against torture reflects Congress's recognition of a distinct interest in preventing the United States from becoming a safe harbor (free of civil as well as criminal liability) for a torturer or other common enemy of mankind. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that Congress has authorized the imposition of severe criminal penalties for acts of torture committed by United States nationals abroad. The Supreme Court certainly was aware of these civil and criminal statutes when it articulated its \"touch and concern\" language in\n   <em>\n    Kiobel\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The ATS provides: \"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1350.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The factual background and procedural history of this litigation are described in detail in\n    <em>\n     Al Shimari v.

In\n    <em>\n     Jesner\n    </em>\n    , the Supreme Court appears to have applied this approach to ATS claims against foreign corporations, determining that the substantial international relations problems caused by such suits provided a clear reason to avoid exercising jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611257\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1386/\">\n     138 S.Ct. at 1406-07\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    CACI's reading of\n    <em>\n     Jesner\n    </em>\n    as requiring an independent inquiry where the burden is on a plaintiff to show that its claims do not infringe on separation of powers and affirmatively promote the purposes of the ATS seems to run headlong into this substantial body of precedent explaining that the general rule is that once jurisdiction is established, it must be exercised. Instead, the better reading of\n    <em>\n     Jesner\n    </em>\n    's interpretation of\n    <em>\n     Sosa\n    </em>\n    appears to be that the federal courts should abstain from exercising jurisdiction under the ATS in the exceptional case when the defendant presents a clear justification to do so, as the Arab Bank did in\n    <em>\n     Jesner\n    </em>\n    . Nevertheless, because plaintiffs' claims survive even under CACI's proposed framework, the Court need not decide whether CACI has appropriately interpreted\n    <em>\n     Jesner\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    <em>\n     Al Shimari v.

This doctrine is a narrow exception to the judiciary's general obligation to decide cases properly brought before the courts. Although most military decisions are committed exclusively to the executive branch, a claim is not shielded from judicial review merely because it arose from action taken under orders of the military.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n    ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    We turn now to consider the district court's treatment of the second\n    <em>\n     Taylor\n    </em>\n    factor, which asks whether a decision on the merits of the claim would require the court to question actual, sensitive judgments made by the military. The district court concluded that the plaintiffs' claims were non-justiciable under this second\n    <em>\n     Taylor\n    </em>\n    factor. The court explained that it was unequipped to evaluate whether the use of certain extreme interrogation measures in the theatre of war was appropriate or justified. In the court's view, adjudicating the plaintiffs' claims would impinge on the military's authority to select interrogation strategies and rules of engagement. Debates existing within the executive branch at that time regarding the propriety of certain aggressive interrogation tactics reinforced the court's conclusion.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    We conclude that the above analysis that the district court conducted was incomplete. In addressing the second\n    <em>\n     Taylor\n    </em>\n    factor, the district court erred in failing to draw a distinction between unlawful conduct and discretionary acts that were not unlawful when committed.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    The commission of unlawful acts is not based on military expertise and judgment, and is not a function committed to a coordinate branch of government. To the contrary, Congress has established criminal penalties for commission of acts constituting torture and war crimes. Therefore, to the extent that the plaintiffs' claims rest on allegations of unlawful conduct in violation of settled international law or criminal law then applicable to the CACI employees, those claims fall outside the protection of the political question doctrine. On remand, the district court must first segregate such justiciable claims in its analysis before proceeding to determine whether any claims alleging conduct that was not unlawful implicated sensitive military judgments under the second prong of\n    <em>\n     Taylor\n    </em>\n    .\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    In reaching this conclusion, we emphasize the long-standing principle that courts are competent to engage in the traditional judicial exercise of determining whether particular conduct complied with applicable law. Accordingly, when a military contractor acts contrary to settled international law or applicable criminal law, the separation of powers rationale underlying the political question doctrine does not shield the contractor's actions from judicial review.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <em>\n     Al Shimari v.

Accordingly, the Court has already determined, and it is the law of the case, that adjudication of plaintiffs' claims does not impermissibly infringe on the political branches and plaintiffs have met the first prong of CACI's proposed two-part test.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Turning to the purpose of the ATS, which CACI describes as \"prevent[ing] foreign entanglements and international friction,\" CACI Mem. 4, the Court concludes that plaintiffs have shown that adjudication of their claims is consistent with this purpose. As the Supreme Court has explained, Congress enacted the ATS in 1789 in the wake of two \"notorious episodes involving violations of the law of nations,\" each of which involved American nationals engaging in tortious conduct against foreign ambassadors.\n    <em>\n     Kiobel\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/\">\n     569 U.S. at 120\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/\">\n     133 S.Ct. 1659\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . At the time, neither the federal courts nor the state courts had jurisdiction over tort suits for violations of the law of nations, which left both ambassadors without an adequate civil remedy resulting in significant international tension.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    As a result, Congress enacted the ATS to \"ensur[e] the availability of a federal forum where the failure to provide one might cause another nation to hold the United States responsible for an injury to a foreign citizen.\"\n    <em>\n     Jesner\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611257\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1386/\">\n     138 S.Ct. at 1397\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Based on this history, the ATS was originally intended to apply to situations where a foreign citizen was the victim of an international law violation committed by an American national. The reasoning behind the ATS was that the failure to provide an adequate remedy to an aggrieved alien could cause significant international tension with that alien's country or even lead that country to attempt to hold the United States or the American citizen responsible. In\n    <em>\n     Jesner\n    </em>\n    , this purpose militated against allowing the claims to proceed because that case involved foreign plaintiffs suing a Jordanian corporation for injuries sustained in the Middle East, and Jordan considered the \"litigation to be a 'grave affront' to its sovereignty.\"\n    <em>\n     Jesner\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611257\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1386/\">\n     138 S.Ct. at 1407\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . By contrast, the lawsuit before this Court involves foreign plaintiffs suing an American corporate defendant, which fully aligns with the original goals of the ATS: to provide a federal forum for tort suits by aliens against Americans for international law violations. Moreover, because CACI is an American, rather than a foreign, corporation, there is no risk that holding CACI liable would offend any foreign government.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    Lastly, unlike in\n    <em>\n     Jesner\n    </em>\n    and in the other ATS cases discussed by the\n    <em>\n     Jesner\n    </em>\n    Court, neither the United States government nor any foreign government has expressed any objection to this litigation or appeared as an\n    <em>\n     amicus\n    </em>\n    to express any concern with the Court's exercise of jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims. Indeed, the United States is currently a party in this lawsuit and abstained from filing any brief in support of CACI's suggestion of a lack of subject matter jurisdiction,\n    which indicates that the United States does not believe that there are significant foreign-relations problems implicated by allowing plaintiffs' claims to proceed. Accordingly, the Court's exercise of jurisdiction over the claims in this litigation is consistent with the purposes of the ATS, and does not conflict with either the holding or reasoning in\n    <em>\n     Jesner\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    II. CONCLUSION\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    For the reasons stated above, without conceding that CACI has correctly interpreted\n    <em>\n     Jesner\n    </em>\n    , plaintiffs have met both prongs of CACI's proposed test and CACI's suggestion of a lack of subject matter jurisdiction will be denied by an appropriate Order to be issued with this Memorandum Opinion.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-46\">\n     Indeed, after one of the incidents, which involved the Secretary of the French Legion, the French Minister Plenipotentiary \"lodge[d] a formal protest with the Continental Congress and threaten[ed] to leave the country unless an adequate remedy were provided.\"\n     <em>\n      Kiobel\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/\">\n      569 U.S. at 120\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/\">\n      133 S.Ct. 1659\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-47\">\n     The Court believes that it is necessary to underscore this distinction between\n     <em>\n      Jesner\n     </em>\n     and the present lawsuit. In\n     <em>\n      Jesner\n     </em>\n     , the question presented by the petition for a writ of certiorari, on which the circuits were and are split, involved whether the ATS categorically forecloses corporate liability, regardless of whether the corporation in question is foreign or domestic. In spite of this broad question presented, the Supreme Court's holding is explicitly confined to foreign corporations, and the focus of the Court's analysis involved the role of the political branches in conducting foreign relations. The vast majority of the circuits to have considered the question have adopted a rule allowing ATS claims to proceed against corporate defendants,\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n     Pet. for a Writ of Certiorari at 3, 14-16,\n     <em>\n      Jesner\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611257\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1386/\">\n      138 S.Ct. 1386\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , and\n     <em>\n      Jesner\n     </em>\n     's careful limiting of the analysis and holding suggests to this Court that the\n     <em>\n      Jesner\n     </em>\n     Court did not intend to disturb this\n     <em>\n      status quo\n     </em>\n     with respect to domestic corporations.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
