Instead, the Court focuses on the motion by counsel for defendant Nassau County to re-open discovery at this point in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 246.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the February 13, 2018 Motion Hearing/Status Conference, Plaintiff's counsel\n   advised the Court that he had been served by Nassau County's counsel just the day before with a purported demand for production of documents directed to the Internal Affairs Unit (\"IAU\") of the Suffolk County Police Department.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   February 13, 2018 Civil Conference Minute Order [DE 241]. Plaintiff's counsel also stated that he was made aware that Nassau County's counsel was attempting to serve deposition notices for two members of the Suffolk County Board of Review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff objected on both counts. The Court informed Nassau County's counsel that discovery was closed and had been for some time. Consequently, if counsel intended to pursue this issue, the Court informed him that he would have to file a motion seeking to re-open discovery and meet the threshold criteria for establishing good cause as to why such relief should be granted at this juncture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     THE PARTIES' CONTENTIONS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Counsel for Nassau County, Christopher Clarke, Esq., asserts that the County should be permitted the additional discovery sought here because the \"discovery demand and deposition subpoena mirror plaintiff's subpoena served upon Nassau IAB Detective Distler which resulted in Nassau's motion to quash filed on June 15, 2015.\" DE 246. In 2015, Nassau County argued that the IAU materials sought by the plaintiff were privileged and not subject to disclosure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Attorney Clarke, based upon the February 5, 2018 decision issued by this Court denying Nassau's motion to quash and directing that Detective Distler be presented for deposition, he proceeded to (1) serve demands on Suffolk County for its Internal Affairs Unit documents relating to this case and (2) serve a subpoena to depose Suffolk's lead investigator.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Attorney Clarke maintains that discovery is ongoing and not closed and that \"there has been no delay from Nassau in seeking this discovery ... and no realistic concern of any delay in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff's counsel opposes the motion, pointing out that this case was commenced some six years ago and that after \"years of discovery, the day before the parties appeared before Judge Joseph F. Bianco on February 13, 2018 to have a summary judgment motion schedule set, Nassau advised that it intended to depose\n   <em>\n    an\n   </em>\n   investigator from the Suffolk IAB...\" DE 250. Counsel further argues that defendant Nassau County received back in September 2015 the audio-recordings of the Suffolk IAU interviews which it is now purportedly seeking in its first document request. Plaintiff's counsel adds that \"[i]n fact, these were produced\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   Mr. Clarke's office started representing Nassau, and plaintiff utilized transcripts of these recordings during numerous depositions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ultimately, plaintiff's counsel argues that Nassau County had ample opportunity to pursue the evidence it now seeks during the multi-year course of discovery. Plaintiff maintains that Nassau County has not shown the requisite good cause to justify the re-opening of discovery at this late date and has not met the six-part test articulated by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Pharmacy Inc. v.

In fact, the parties had a schedule in place for briefing summary judgment motions when the instant issue arose. Plaintiff does not contest this fact.

Whether the Motion Is Opposed\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   There is no question that plaintiff vigorously opposes defendant Nassau County's motion to re-open discovery. Nassau County's counsel here attempts to limit the sphere of consideration to defendant Suffolk County as the repository of the documents at issue. DE 246. Specifically, Attorney Clarke states that \"the test should be resolved in Nassau's favor because Suffolk ... has not objected to the discovery demands at issue and has agreed to accept service of Nassau's subpoena and has confirmed via email that Sergeant Lynch is available for deposition as noticed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204415263\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Suffolk County's sudden change of heart and new-found willingness to cooperate-contrary to its earlier posture regarding any disclosure of Nassau County's IAU Report-is not the deciding factor here. There is no such limitation in the second prong of the standard set out in\n   <em>\n    Pharmacy, Inc.\n   </em>\n   and Nassau County's counsel has provided no case law supporting this myopic and disingenuous view. Consequently, plaintiff's emphatic opposition to the relief sought by the Nassau County defendants results in this factor favoring the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Prejudice to the Non-moving Party\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant Nassau County's counsel points out that the only non-moving party to claim prejudice is the plaintiff and \"that objection is limited only to meritless concerns of delay.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204415263\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to Attorney Clarke, \"[s]ince Suffolk has not objected, has accepted service and confirmed attendance, relevance and discoverability are moot issues, and delay is not a concern.\" The Court disagrees. Delay may not be a concern to Nassau County, but it is of understandable concern to the Plaintiff. Likewise, Suffolk County's about-face and willingness to assist Nassau County at this juncture are irrelevant to the analysis of this third prong of the test for re-opening discovery. There is no doubt that re-opening discovery will cause plaintiff to incur costs and expenses associated with reviewing documents which Nassau County is requesting as well as preparation for and attendance at requested depositions of the Suffolk County investigators responsible for the IAU Report. Moreover, if defendants are permitted to conduct depositions, new information will likely be disclosed which the plaintiff has had no opportunity to explore and/or rebut. The prejudice to the Plaintiff here is not only the further postponement of this six-year old case, but the toll on the memories of witnesses as this case lags. As a result, the Court finds that this factor slightly favors the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Diligence of Defendant Nassau County and Foreseeability of Need\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Second Circuit has emphasized that \"a finding of 'good cause' depends on the diligence of the moving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11469130\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/326/#p340\">\n    204 F.3d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 340 (2d Cir. 2000). The diligence and foreseeability factors here weigh against defendant Nassau County. The real issue here boils down to the strategic decision Nassau County's counsel made in 2015 not to seek the discovery currently at issue here because doing so, in counsel's reasoning, would have run contrary to the litigation position the County had taken, namely, that its own Internal Affairs documents were privileged and not discoverable. This was a calculated risk and decision which\n   the County undertook knowingly and freely. A review of some of the chronology of this case is warranted in order to place into context Nassau County's current contentions on this motion.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 At the April 6, 2012 Initial Conference, the Court addressed the respective Internal Affairs Unit Reports as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff's counsel seeks the Internal Affairs Reports prepared by the respective police departments in both counties. With regard to Nassau County, Attorney Ferguson stated that the police department has 18 months from the date of the underlying incident to complete the report and, consequently, Nassau has four more months for completion of that report. Counsel for Suffolk County will get back to me expeditiously with a response as to the timeframe in which Suffolk expects to finish its report. After some discussion regarding the case law addressing production of internal affairs reports, I stated to counsel that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     this production would likely be required\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , even in redacted form, solely to the respective parties in this case for purposes of this litigation only, and subject to a duly executed Stipulation and Order of Confidentiality.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's counsel stated that he was reserving his right to take depositions of the authors of the respective reports once they are completed\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   Counsel for Suffolk County stated that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     he did not see any purpose in examining the authors of the report when the report itself contains statements of witnesses\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , etc. I advised counsel that we will see where this issue takes us as the case progresses and that, once again, the parties have an obligation to confer in good faith under Local Civil Rule 37.3 to try to resolve any discovery disputes before seeking Court intervention.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   DE 13 (emphasis added). As this Order reflects, the productions of the respective Internal Affairs Reports from both Counties were an issue from the very first appearance of the parties before the Court. It was clear from the outset that plaintiff's counsel intended to depose the authors of the respective reports and at least one party, Suffolk County, objected. At that time, among other deadlines, the Court set the fact discovery cut-off at November 30, 2012.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11469130\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/326/#p340\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; DE 14.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 Both IAU Reports were taken up again at the August 23, 2012 Status Conference.

With regard to the still pending Internal Affairs Reports, counsel for the Suffolk County defendants stated that in communicating with Suffolk County Police Department, he was advised that the report is still being worked on, but that it is expected to be completed in the short-term. Suffolk's counsel will continue to meet and confer with plaintiff's counsel regarding the disclosure of the contents of the report... With regard to the Internal Affairs Report of the Nassau County Police Department, I noted that the 18 month preparation period is expiring this month. However, Attorney Ferguson stated that he does not know when the report will be completed but that he has been advised the report is being worked on.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I have directed counsel for the Nassau County defendants and the Suffolk County defendants to discuss with plaintiffs's counsel any issues they have regarding the disclosure of the reports to plaintiff's counsel once\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     they are completed, subject to a Stipulation and Order of Confidentiality\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . If the parties are unable to work out any disclosure issues, then plaintiff's counsel may apply to the Court for relief. Counsel for the Suffolk County defendants did note that he has provided some materials which are included in the IA Report to plaintiff's counsel while the report is still awaiting completion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   DE 31 (emphasis added). Because of additional issues which had arisen in the case, the Court also extended fact discovery for an additional 90 days to February 28, 2013. DE 32.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 In Plaintiff's December 14, 2012 letter motion [DE 52] to compel production from defendant Nassau County, plaintiff challenged Nassau County's response to Document Request No. 1 of plaintiff's second request for production of documents and things. The Court points out that in its response,\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Nassau County states that its IAU Report was produced to all other parties on September 7, 2012\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 At the February 5, 2013 Status Conference, since the Suffolk County IAU Report still had not been served, I directed counsel for Suffolk County to speak with those preparing the report and report back to the Court at the earliest possible time the projected date for completion and service of that Report. DE 61. Based on the number of depositions the parties were contemplating, as well as some issues obtaining records from non-parties, the Court extended the fact discovery deadline once again, up to and including June 28, 2013.\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     The parties were put on notice that this date would not be further extended\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11469130\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/326/#p340\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 By letter dated February 8, 2013, counsel for the Suffolk County defendants advised the Court that the anticipated date for completion of the IAU Report was March 15, 2013.

DiLeonardo's counsel requested an Order directing the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office to return the IAU Report and to provide the names of all individuals who viewed the report and its contents.

DE 241. At that time, plaintiff's counsel advised that he had been given a copy of a demand served by Nassau County's counsel for the production of documents from the Suffolk County Internal Affairs Unit as well as deposition notices for two members of the Suffolk County Board of Review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   At the outset, the Court addresses some of the wording utilized by Nassau County's counsel in the motion. For example, counsel states that the Court \"authorized Nassau to move to re-open discovery\" and \"authorized Nassau to file a motion to re-open discovery for the purpose of the limited disclosure sought from Suffolk....\" DE 246. The reality is that the Court did not \"authorize\" anything-it\n   <em>\n    permitted\n   </em>\n   Nassau to make the motion, pointing out that counsel had to show good cause for the failure to timely request the information now sought-effectively by prevailing on the six-part test to re-open discovery under existing Second Circuit case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The docket entries set forth here show a number of things relevant to the Court's consideration of this motion. It is clear, for example, that plaintiff originally sought the IAU Reports from both Nassau and Suffolk Counties in early 2012. At the April 6, 2012 Initial Conference, plaintiff's counsel reserved his right to take the depositions of the authors of those Reports as soon as they were completed. Consequently, the parties were aware from the outset that plaintiff attached great significance to these Reports. Ironically, counsel for the Suffolk County defendants objected at that time to any deposition of the author of the subject SCPD IAU Report-a position which has shifted most recently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Nassau County IAU Report was provided to all parties on September 7, 2012. By contrast, the Suffolk County Police Department continued to delay completion and/or production of its IAU Report for more than four years, although counsel for the Suffolk defendants did produce some materials utilized in the Report while awaiting completion of the Report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a September 23, 2013 Status Report to the Court, plaintiff's counsel stated that despite the lack of completion of the Suffolk IAU Report, the parties agreed to\n   resume depositions of the remaining Suffolk defendants, subject to a reservation of rights to conduct supplemental depositions limited to any new information contained in the Suffolk IAU Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   After appearing in the case as new counsel for defendant Deputy Chief Hunter on December 6, 2013, Attorney Frank Schroeder filed a letter dated May 7, 2014 requesting a fourth extension of the discovery deadline to get up to speed and noting that the parties still had not received the Suffolk County IAU Report. Schroeder noted that there would likely be a need for additional discovery once the Report was available. Four months later, in September 2014, Attorney Clarke came into the case as substituted counsel for the Nassau County defendants and requested a fifth extension of the discovery deadline, which Judge Bianco granted for 60 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   On December 23, 2014, plaintiff's counsel informed the Court that the depositions of all Suffolk County defendants had been completed, but that the Suffolk IAU Report had still not been provided. As a result, the Court granted a sixth extension of the discovery deadline. Then, after being advised at a motion hearing on May 20, 2015 that the Suffolk IAU Report had still not been provided to the parties-more than three years after this case had been commenced and more than two years after the County represented that the Report would be issued by March 15, 2013-the Court directed that the Report was to be in the hands of the parties by July 6, 2015 or the Court would take further action to address the failure to comply. The Court granted a seventh extension of discovery and set a deadline of September 8, 2015 to complete all fact depositions. That deadline was extended for the eighth time to December 11, 2015 due to the unfortunate personal circumstances of plaintiff's counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In his April 21, 2017 letter to the Court, plaintiff's counsel advised that the attorneys for both Nassau and Suffolk Counties had agreed to an expert discovery schedule on the limited issue of plaintiff's toxicology expert. The Court approved the expert discovery schedule which concluded expert discovery by September 14, 2017. On July 21, 2017, counsel for Nassau County requested an extension of the deadline for expert rebuttal reports and depositions based on counsel's bereavement circumstances. The Court granted the request, as it did the later September 11, 2017 request for an extension sought by counsel for defendant Hunter. The Court set the extended deadline for expert discovery at October 27, 2017. On January 17, 2018, plaintiff's counsel submitted a letter request for a pre-motion conference to Judge Bianco for purposes of making a motion for summary judgment. Judge Bianco set the briefing schedule in place on February 13, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Given the totality of these circumstances, the Court finds that the Nassau County defendants were not diligent in pursuing the discovery they now seek. Attorney Clarke does not contest the fact that all of the defendants had copies of the audio recordings of the Suffolk IAU interviews before he even came into the case in 2014. Thus, all of the parties knew to a large extent the contents of witness statements and what, if anything, would be necessary for the defense of the case as to those statements. Consequently, the Nassau County defendants had ample opportunity to pursue this particular evidence for several years during the regular fact discovery period, both through their prior counsel and their current counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Although Nassau County's counsel insists throughout his motion that \"discovery is not closed,\" repeating that mantra does not make it so. The fact discovery deadline\n   had been extended more than nine times as detailed above and the posture of the case at the time of the February 13, 2018 conference belies defendants' argument. Expert discovery had been completed and the parties had been given a schedule by Judge Bianco for briefing summary judgment motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Attorney Clarke's repeated attempts to minimize the significance and impact of the choices he made on behalf of his clients on these issues in 2015 and thereafter is unavailing. For example, arguing that the discovery demand and deposition subpoena he served on Suffolk County in February 2018 simply \"mirror plaintiff's motion to quash filed on June 15, 2015\" [DE 246] misses the point-plaintiff's motion was\n   <em>\n    filed timely in 2015\n   </em>\n   . Nassau's counsel knew well this was an issue in 2015 and logic dictated that there was a 50-50 chance that the motion to compel the Distler notes and deposition would be granted. Nassau's counsel made the strategic decision to assert arguments that the materials subpoenaed from Nassau County at that time were privileged and not subject to disclosure. The SCPD IAU Report was not hidden or unknown to the Nassau County defendants or any other party for that matter. The relevance of the Report and the potential need for the Report were certainly foreseeable. Counsel for Nassau County had every opportunity to argue in the alternative on his motion to quash the Distler notes and deposition testimony, to move to reserve his clients' rights and options if the Court ultimately denied the motion, or to seek a stay until the motion was decided. He did none of those things. Litigation strategy is often based on a calculated risk. Counsel undertook that risk here. That decision has consequences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   With expert discovery completed and a briefing schedule in hand for summary judgment motion practice, the contention of Nassau County's counsel that fact discovery was still ongoing lacks candor. Defendants' counsel is a seasoned litigator and knew exactly what the case status was on June 15, 2015, let alone February 13, 2018. Moreover, the Court made clear that with the\n   <em>\n    exception\n   </em>\n   of the Court's rulings on certain outstanding discovery motions, fact discovery had long been closed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The demand by Nassau County's counsel was not one of those exceptions. Creating a unique interpretation of the fact discovery deadline and attempting to place the onus on the Court rather than take responsibility for the strategic decision counsel made some two years earlier does not excuse counsel's failure to deal with this issue in a timely manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The fifth factor assesses the foreseeability of the need for additional discovery in light of the time allowed for discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pharmacy, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204415263\">\n    2008 WL 4415263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3. A reasonable litigator could have and should have foreseen the need for the discovery now sought in the event the Court denied the motion to quash the subpoena for Sgt. Distler's notes and deposition. As noted previously, plaintiff's counsel made clear in the very first discovery conference with the Court the significance of the IAU Reports from both Nassau and Suffolk Counties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court further points out that defendants' counsel made no attempt to obtain any permission or authorization from the Court before serving the February 2018\n   demands and deposition notices now at issue. Instead, counsel made an end-run, presumably in anticipation (or hope) that plaintiff's counsel would not balk at the late service out of time. Counsel's persistence that \"fact discovery is on-going in this matter\" [DE 246] is crucial to his justification for these actions. The reality, however, is that there is no justification. The circumstances in which counsel finds himself are of his own making. Distilled to their essence, the arguments here seek to absolve the Nassau County defendants from accountability for the litigation strategy they elected in 2015. Having considered these facts, the Court finds that the Nassau County defendants were not diligent in pursuing this discovery despite the foreseeability that the discovery could lead to relevant evidence. Consequently, this factor favors the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Likelihood of Relevant Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Nassau County's counsel maintains that \"the two separate, independent investigations of the police officers conducted by the separate law enforcement agencies is undeniably relevant....\" DE 246. However, counsel never states with any specificity why the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     SCPD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   investigation is relevant, except to refer broadly to \"plaintiff's multiple claims of conspiracy between various defendants....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204415263\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead, Nassau's counsel relies on the fact that the Court found relevant the notes and potential deposition testimony of Sgt. Distler and believes the Court should draw the same conclusion regarding the SCPD investigator's information, even though the Court has never seen it. The Court is not in a position to do so without more information, although the Court does not doubt that some of the information may be pertinent. For these reasons, this factor is neutral as to both sides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Balancing the Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Court does not condone the Nassau County defendants' actions here with regard to the lack of diligence in seeking the discovery which is the subject of this motion. However, the Court also finds that under Second Circuit case law, the circumstances of this case do not warrant the \"drastic remedy\" of preclusion of this discovery.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Torres v.

Defendants' motion to reopen discovery is therefore granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Having considered the relevant factors, the Court reluctantly finds that discovery should be re-opened for a limited purpose. Notwithstanding the delinquency of the Nassau County defendants, as unsatisfactory as it is, a trial date has not been set and the prejudice to the plaintiff can be offset to a degree here. Moreover, \"such prejudice [does] not outweigh the other factors.\"\n   <em>\n    Sci.

Unlike the instant case, this Court found that the discovery sought was not foreseeable, was directly relevant to the plaintiff's claim for damages, was diligently sought, and was not prejudicial to the non-movant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    In a February 8, 2013 letter to the Court, counsel for the Suffolk County defendants advised that the anticipated date for completion of Suffolk's IAU Report was March 15, 2013. Obviously, that did not occur and the Report was delayed for several additional years.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    It is significant to note that less than a month before, on January 17, 2018, plaintiff's counsel submitted a letter to the Court stating that \"no other fact or expert discovery remains pending.\" DE 235. On that basis, counsel asked for a final conference. No other party filed a response to DE 235, including any objection, opposition, or refutation of the accuracy of that statement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
