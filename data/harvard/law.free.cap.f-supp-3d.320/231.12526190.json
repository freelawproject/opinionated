Mattei was convicted of assault with intent to rape and assault and battery in the Massachusetts County Superior Court sitting in and for the County of Essex on September 16, 2011. Mattei has filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He asserts two claims: (1) his rights to confrontation were violated by restrictions on the cross-examination of a substitute DNA analyst, and (2) the trial judge erred in restricting defense counsel's cross-examination of a police witness.
