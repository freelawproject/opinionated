For the following reasons, Defendant's Motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This employment discrimination case arises from Plaintiff Gloria Terrell's allegations that her employer, Defendant Main Line Hospitals, Inc. (\"MLHI\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   terminated her employment as an operating room (\"OR\") secretary at Lankenau Hospital (\"Lankenau\") based on her age. Plaintiff's Complaint alleges that MLHI terminated her in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20621\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 634, and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (\"PHRA\"), 43 Pa. Stat. &amp; Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 951-963. (Compl., ECF No. 1.) Defendants contend that Plaintiff was terminated for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, specifically, because she twice accessed information regarding a co-worker, in violation of MLHI's policies relating to patient privacy and in violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether the proffered reason for her termination was pretextual, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    1. Plaintiff's Position And Responsibilities\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff was born in 1955 and began her employment at Lankenau in 1974 as a nurse's aide. (CSMF \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3, 4.) Plaintiff subsequently became an Instrument Room Technician and then an OR secretary, the position that she held for more than thirty-five years until her termination in 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6.) At the time of the events relevant to this lawsuit, there were two other OR secretaries at Lankenau, Barbara Hawkins and Linda Robinson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6.) Hawkins had worked as an OR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   secretary for more than ten years, and Robinson had worked in the OR for approximately six months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) As an OR secretary, Plaintiff's duties included setting up the OR schedule, calling for patients, sending for blood and medications, patient billing, maintaining office supplies, setting up patient charts, and ordering staff uniforms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Plaintiff also was responsible for training Robinson, who described Plaintiff as very well informed about the OR secretary position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10; Robinson Dep. 12, SMF Ex. G and CSMF Ex. 4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff and the other OR secretaries self-scheduled with respect to arranging coverage among themselves if one of them was unable to work a scheduled shift. (CSMF \u00b6 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   OR secretaries use a system called \"SIS\" to electronically schedule surgeries. (CSMF \u00b6 12.) They can also access patient demographics-such as name, date of birth, social security number, phone number, emergency contact information, and insurance information-through an electronic database called \"Invision,\" but they cannot access medical charts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-27; SMF \u00b6 4.) During the time period relevant to this action, Plaintiff and the other OR secretaries were supervised by Administrative Coordinator Andrea Ledford and Nurse Manager Annette Frawley. (CSMF \u00b6\u00b6 48, 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    2. MLHI's Privacy And Disciplinary Policies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   MLHI is subject to the regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA to protect the privacy, security, and confidentiality of health information. (SMF \u00b6 5.) MLHI has implemented a number of policies and employee training programs related to the protection of confidential information and the disciplinary consequences of confidentiality violations. (SMF Exs. J, K, L, M, Q, R, S; CSMF Ex. 8.) For example, MLHI's Confidentiality Policy provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [A]ll employees ... are required to maintain the confidentiality of all privileged information. Privileged information consists of, but is not limited to, data that can be communicated verbally, electronically, or in hard copy regarding the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1. Patient information (e.g., diagnosis, content of medical records)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   3. Employee information (e.g., salary, demographics)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (SMF \u00b6 5, Ex. J.) The accompanying Confidentiality Statement requires employees to agree that they \"will only access information on patients/employees about whom I have a business need to know.\" (SMF Ex. J.) The Statement also includes an employee acknowledgement that \"any unauthorized access to, use of or disclosure of privileged information or any other confidential information concerning a current or past patient or employee ... may result in immediate discharge from employment with [MLH].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   MLHI requires employees to undertake annual HIPAA compliance training and testing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) MLHI's Compliance Program materials define Protected Health Information (\"PHI\") as \"any information that is identifiable to a patient,\" including, name, address, email address, date of birth, and insurance and other financial information. (CSMF \u00b6 42, Ex. 8.) The materials\n   state that patients must authorize the disclosure of their PHI unless it is needed for treating the patient, for payment for treating the patient, or for health care operations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43, Ex. 8.) Employees are also instructed that they must \"[a]ccess only the information you need to do your job,\" and \"[u]se the information to perform your job only.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 8.) The training states that employees have the same HIPAA privacy rights as other patients. (SMF \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff participated in HIPAA training annually while employed by MLHI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Although Plaintiff undertook the training, she testified that she felt rushed to complete it during her work day, and she would sometimes skip ahead to the test without fully reading through the preceding materials.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Terrell Dep. 113-16, 132-33, 137-38, SMF Ex. A and CSMF Ex. 1.) When she answered test questions incorrectly, she would then go back and review the related training material more carefully. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, Plaintiff understood that she was only permitted to access patient information as needed to perform her job. (Terrell Dep. 125-126; SMF \u00b6 11; Pl.'s Resp. to SMF \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In April 2016, MLHI implemented a privacy monitoring system called \"Fair Warning.\" (SMF \u00b6 13.) Using algorithms, Fair Warning monitors and analyzes instances of access to patient records to identify any that lack a legitimate business purpose. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) When Fair Warning detects a potentially suspect instance of employee access to patient records, it sends an email to the employee's manager to determine whether there was a legitimate business need for the access. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15; CSMF \u00b6 47.) If the manager does not identify a legitimate business need, the matter is referred to MLHI's Human Resources (\"HR\") department for investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   MLHI's Code of Conduct and Behaviors that Undermine a Culture of Safety (\"Code of Conduct\") provides examples of conduct that can lead to disciplinary action, including termination. (SMF Ex. K.) These include: \"[u]nauthorized release/disclosure/access of confidential information,\" \"[u]nauthorized and/or non-business related access, use or disclosure of electronic protected health information,\" and \"[u]nauthorized and/or inappropriate use of MLH information system resources.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Code of Conduct further provides that violations \"will lead to Performance Management action, up to and including termination of employment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   MLHI's Performance Management Policy generally provides four color-coded levels of discipline: (1) performance expectations review (blue); (2) performance coaching (yellow); (3) corrective intervention (orange), and (4) termination (red). (SMF Ex. Q.) The policy directs managers to intervene \"early in the development of [a] performance and/or behavioral concern to help the employee recognize and correct the deficiencies,\" but notes that \"[t]here may be circumstances ... in which immediate termination ... is warranted.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Under this policy, circumstances warranting termination include \"[w]hen the issue is serious in nature,\" and \"[w]hen the issue is either an egregious first time occurrence or a repeat occurrence of a behavioral or code of conduct violation.\" (Id.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   MLHI also has specific disciplinary guidelines for HIPAA/privacy violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Employee Sanction Guidelines for HIPAA/Security Violations (\"HIPAA Sanction Guidelines\"). (SMF Ex. R.) The HIPAA Sanction Guidelines divide violations into four categories, each with mitigating and contributing factors and possible sanctions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The four categories are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (1) accidental or inadvertent violation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (2) failure to follow established privacy/security policies and procedures;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (3) deliberate or purposeful violation without harmful intent; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (4) disclosure or use of PHI for illegal purpose or unauthorized public disclosure of PHI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Examples of category 3 violations include \"[a]ccessing PHI outside the scope of job duties (to compare coworker workloads, learn about clinical operations)\" and \"[c]hecking on a coworker, family member or neighbor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The possible sanctions for a category 3 violation are orange (corrective action) or red (termination).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; CSMF \u00b6 86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Lankenau employees who violate HIPAA are not automatically terminated, and the level of discipline imposed depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. (CSMF \u00b6 92; Papa Dep. 11, SMF Ex. B and CSMF Ex. 2.) Lankenau's HR Director, Greg Papa, testified that the performance management program \"is not meant to be progressive. It's meant to assign the performance management action that best fits the situation.... [I]f someone's act is egregious, we could go right to termination, or if it's deliberate or some other circumstance.\" (Papa Dep. 60-61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    3. Circumstances Of Plaintiff's Termination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   MLHI terminated Plaintiff after the second of two instances in which she used the Invision system to access the phone number of her co-worker, Hawkins. (CSMF \u00b6\u00b6 13-24, 33-38, 52-70.) The first instance occurred on the morning of Monday, August 15, 2016, when Plaintiff and Robinson were the OR secretaries on duty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15.) The OR was particularly busy that morning, and the SIS system was not working, which required Plaintiff and Robinson to manually organize cases and schedule surgeries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 16.) Hawkins was scheduled to work later in the day, but because she had called out of work at the end of the previous week, Plaintiff, Robinson, and their supervisor, Ledford, were unsure whether Hawkins would be in for her shift. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Even though it was Plaintiff's birthday, she volunteered to cover Hawkins' shift if she wasn't coming in. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Ledford asked Plaintiff to find out if Hawkins was coming in, and Plaintiff looked unsuccessfully for the OR employee phone list that was normally kept on a clipboard in the unit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-23.) When Plaintiff could not find the phone list, she obtained Hawkins' phone number from Invision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) According to Plaintiff, she told Ledford she had used Invision to get Hawkins' number, and Ledford said \"okay.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) According to Plaintiff,\n   the scheduling problems and volume in the OR that day prevented her from calling Hawkins before 11 a.m., the time by which Hawkins was required to call out if she were not coming to work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.) Because Hawkins was conscientious about timely calling out and she had not done so by 11 a.m., Plaintiff assumed Hawkins would be in and did not call her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32; SMF \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The second instance occurred on August 22, 2016, after an orderly told Plaintiff and some OR colleagues that there had been an early morning shooting in an area that Plaintiff knew was near Hawkins' residence. (CSMF \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.) Plaintiff wanted to call Hawkins to see if she was okay and able to come in for her shift, and, because the phone list was still missing, she again looked up Hawkins' number in Invision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.) Plaintiff then considered that Hawkins might be sleeping and decided not to call her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) It is undisputed that Plaintiff did not save Hawkins' phone number or disclose it to anyone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Approximately six months before these incidents, Plaintiff had completed computer-based training, followed by a test, regarding information security awareness. (SMF \u00b6\u00b6 11-12; Pl.'s Resp. to SMF \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.) The training explained that MLHI is a HIPAA-covered entity, that it requires the protection of PHI, and that patient data is only to be accessed for a business-related reason. (SMF \u00b6 11; Pl.'s Resp. to SMF \u00b6 11.) Plaintiff believes that she had a business reason for accessing Hawkins' record on both occasions, because she wanted to determine if Hawkins would be coming in for her shift. (Terrell Dep. 168; SMF \u00b6\u00b6 73-74; CSMF \u00b6 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Fair Warning system flagged Plaintiff's August 15, 2016 access of Hawkins' Invision record and sent an email to Frawley asking whether Plaintiff had a work-related reason for the access. (CSMF \u00b6\u00b6 52-53; SMF \u00b6 41.) On August 25, 2016, Frawley replied \"No!!!!\". (SMF \u00b6 42.) After receiving the Fair Warning alert, Frawley notified Lankenau HR Manager Allison Bennett of the August 15 incident and advised Bennett that Plaintiff had no work-related reason for accessing Hawkins' records. (SMF \u00b6\u00b6 44-45.) Frawley later testified that because Hawkins had not been an inpatient and had not been in the OR, Frawley \"knew that there was absolutely no reason that there would have been a need for [Plaintiff] to go into [Hawkins'] record.\" (Frawley Dep. 24-25, SMF Ex. F and CSFM Ex. 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Bennett, Frawley, and perioperative nursing director Josetta Shaw began an investigation, and while it was ongoing, they learned that Plaintiff had accessed Hawkins' Invision records a second time, on August 22. (SMF \u00b6\u00b6 46-47.) On August 25, 2016, Bennett and Frawley met with Plaintiff, who admitted that she had accessed Hawkins' Invision records twice to get her phone number-the first time, to see if she was coming in for her shift; and the second time, to see if she was okay and able to come in for her shift. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48; Pl.'s Resp. to SMF \u00b6 48.) Bennett and Papa also met with Hawkins to determine whether she had given Plaintiff permission to access her records. (SMF \u00b6 52.) Frawley and Papa testified that Hawkins said she had not given Plaintiff permission to access her\n   records and that Hawkins was upset about the access. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On August 30, 2016, Fair Warning sent Bennett a report categorizing Plaintiff's accessing of Hawkins' records as \"snooping,\" describing the severity as \"high,\" and stating that the incident was not reportable to the government. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57; CSMF \u00b6\u00b6 56-57.) Bennett met with Frawley and Shaw, both of whom recommended that Plaintiff be terminated. (SMF \u00b6 59; CSMF \u00b6\u00b6 65-67.) Before a MLHI employee may be terminated, the HR Manager must submit a Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendation (\"SBAR\") report. (SMF \u00b6 60.) Bennett prepared the SBAR, which recommended termination, and sent it to Papa for his consideration. (CSMF \u00b6\u00b6 67-68, Ex. 18.) Papa agreed with the recommendation, and Plaintiff was terminated on September 9, 2016. (SMF \u00b6 62; CSMF \u00b6 70.) Plaintiff's termination was also reviewed and approved by Lankenau's President and its Senior Vice President of Human Resources. (SMF \u00b6 68.) Plaintiff was replaced by a 39-year-old woman hired from outside of MLHI. (CSMF \u00b6\u00b6 71, 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Bennett prepared a Performance Management Record for Plaintiff's termination, which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Gloria accessed co-workers medical record on two separate occasions. It was determined by her department manager and acknowledged by Gloria-there was no business need for her to access co-workers information. Under MLH's Fair Warning and HIPAA policy this is a gross violation of that policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (CSMF Ex. 19; SMF \u00b6 69.) Bennett, Papa, and Frawley agreed that Plaintiff's violation fell within category 3 of the HIPAA Sanctions Guidelines: \"Deliberate or purposeful violation without harmful intent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (CSMF \u00b6 83; Papa Dep. 63-64; Frawley Dep. 36; Bennett Dep. 36-37, SMF Ex. C and CSMF Ex. 15.) According to Defendants, Plaintiff's accessing of Hawkins' records constituted the following types of improper conduct that can warrant termination:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   19. Unauthorized release/disclosure/access of confidential information; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   40. Unauthorized and/or non-business related access, use or disclosure of electronic protected health information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (Papa Dep. 58-59; SMF Ex. K; CSMF \u00b6 87.) Defendants determined that Plaintiff's termination was warranted under MLHI's Performance Management Policy because \"the issue [was] serious in nature,\" and \"the issue [was] either an egregious first time occurrence or a repeat occurrence of a behavioral or code of conduct violation.\" (Papa Dep. 61-62; Bennett Dep. 35; SMF Ex. Q.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff filed an internal appeal of her termination. The termination was subsequently upheld by Lankenau's Vice President of Patient Services. (SMF \u00b6 70, Ex. T.) In connection with this case, Plaintiff contends that she \"witnessed other younger OR employees access demographic information of co-workers through Invision and not be disciplined, including OR Administrative Coordinator Josh Kirkpatrick sometime after 2015 (a phone number), and Mary Getty (an address).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (CSMF \u00b6 89.) Plaintiff also claims that Robinson told her that she had used Invision to check the age of an employee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90.) All three of these employees denied Plaintiff's allegations and the implication that\n   they improperly accessed patient records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Defendants assert that they had no knowledge or notice of these alleged incidents, which were not identified through the Fair Warning monitoring system nor brought to the attention of the Human Resources Department by Terrell or any other source. (Defs.' Resp. to CSMF \u00b6\u00b6 89-90; Bennett Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3, CSMF Ex. A.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    4. Defendants' Handling Of Other HIPAA/Privacy Violations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As noted above, in April 2016, MLHI began using the Fair Warning system to electronically detect HIPAA/privacy violations. (SMF \u00b6 13.) Prior to the implementation of Fair Warning, MLHI's tracking of HIPAA/privacy violations was primarily anecdotal and required manual review of electronic patient records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendants' records reflect that since 2009, and excluding Plaintiff, nine individuals have been terminated from Lankenau for HIPAA violations. (SMF \u00b6\u00b6 82; CSMF Ex. 25.) Three of the terminations involved \"co-worker snooping,\" in which the employee accessed a patient-co-worker's records in Invision or Smart Chart\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   without permission from the patient-employee. (SMF \u00b6\u00b6 82-83; CSMF \u00b6\u00b6 93-96, Ex. 25; Papa Dep. 34-38.) The individuals terminated for co-worker snooping, and their birth years are: \"T.M.\"-1983; \"R.C.\"-1956; and \"M.K.\"-1968. (SMF \u00b6 82; CSMF Ex. 25.) The other terminations involved \"celebrity snooping.\" (SMF \u00b6\u00b6 82-83; Papa Dep. 31-34.)

The Fair Warning system alerted MLHI that Plaintiff had accessed Hawkins' records, and there is no suggestion, nor any evidence, that MLHI or any of Plaintiff's supervisors targeted her for discipline, or that age was a factor in the Fair Warning algorithms used to flag Plaintiff's access of Hawkins' records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   MLHI's Confidentiality Policy and Code of Conduct treat patient and employee demographic information as confidential; permit employee access to that information only for a business-related purpose; and specifically prohibit \"[u]nauthorized release/disclosure/access of confidential information\" and \"[u]nauthorized and/or non-business related access, use or disclosure of electronic protected health information.\" (SMF Ex.

Contrary to her training, Plaintiff contends that at the time, she did not believe her accessing of Hawkins' records was a HIPAA violation. She now understands that doing so violated MLHI's HIPAA/confidentiality policies, and that \"[l]ooking for information on my co-worker[,] [r]egardless of whether it's medical records, room number, age, birth date, phone number, address, any of that would be co-worker snooping.\" (Terrell Dep. 140, 164-65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiff contends that her termination was a violation of MLHI's disciplinary policies, and that \"termination was not warranted here given the benign data accessed by Plaintiff.\" (Pl.'s Opp. Br. 11.) Plaintiff also suggests that termination was unwarranted because it was not preceded by lesser progressive sanctions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.)

In an effort to support this contention, Plaintiff points to the MLHI records regarding other employees who were disciplined for improper records access since the implementation of Fair Warning. These records, outlined in the factual background above, simply do not reflect disparate treatment of age-protected employees and cannot support a reasonable inference of pretext. To the contrary, the records show that of the nine employees who were terminated for co-worker or celebrity snooping without permission, at least three were younger than 40 years old, and four were younger than Plaintiff. (Def.'s Mot. Ex. U.) Similarly, the evidence reflects that more than half of the fourteen employees who were\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   terminated\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     were\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   age-protected. Moreover, the conduct of the non-terminated employees is not closely comparable to Plaintiff's since those employees either had permission to access the records or, in one instance, the improper access involved an unknown individual and resulted from the employee's failure to log off of the electronic system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As noted above, Plaintiff also claims to know of three other specific instances when one of her younger co-workers accessed employee patient records and was not terminated. However, Plaintiff's unsubstantiated assertions are the only evidence of these alleged incidents. The employees involved in these alleged incidents all denied that they engaged in any improper access of patient records. Moreover, even assuming that these employees accessed records as Plaintiff contends, there is no evidence that MLHI had any knowledge or notice of these incidents. Under these circumstances, Plaintiff's self-serving allegations of disparate treatment are insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of pretext.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Irving v.
