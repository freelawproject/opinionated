The plaintiff claims that he submitted \"research documents\" to the United States Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand in 2003. More than 13 years later, he submitted a FOIA request for his own documents. The State Department conducted an extensive search and informed the plaintiff that it found no responsive records. The defendant now moves for summary judgment on the ground that it conducted a reasonable search, and has met its obligations under FOIA. For the following reasons, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 12, 2016, the plaintiff made a FOIA request to the State Department for research materials that he claims he submitted to the U.S. Embassy in 2003.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 25 \u00b6 1; ECF No. 24-1 at 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff explained in his request that on four separate occasions between January 2003 and August 2003, he delivered his research materials regarding the Iraq War to the U.S. Embassy. (ECF No. 25 \u00b6 2; ECF No. 24-1 at 1.) In a response dated October 25, 2016, the State Department explained that it had assigned a case number to his request and would notify him when responsive documents had been identified. (ECF No. 25 \u00b6 3; ECF No. 24-1 at 3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On November 21, 2016, the plaintiff appealed to the State Department, claiming that it had failed to respond to his FOIA request (ECF No. 25 \u00b6 5; ECF No. 24-1 at 6); on December 8, 2016, the State Department responded that it was still processing the plaintiff's request (ECF No. 25 \u00b6 6; ECF No. 24-1 at 7),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and thus, the plaintiff's appeal was not appropriate. On March 31, 2017, the State Department sent the plaintiff a letter informing him that it had completed its search for the requested documents, and that there were no responsive documents. (ECF No. 25 \u00b6 38; ECF No. 24-1 at 8.) On December 27, 2016, the plaintiff brought this action seeking the requested documents under FOIA. (ECF No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The State Department's Search\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The State Department reviewed the plaintiff's request and determined that the following offices or record systems might have responsive documents: the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, which advises the Secretary of State on matters in North Africa and the Middle East (ECF No. 25\n   \u00b6 12); the U.S. Embassy; the Retired Records Inventory Management System; and the State Archiving System. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs (\"NEA\"), an NEA Area Management Officer who was knowledgeable about the plaintiff's FOIA request determined that the requested records could be in the Office of Regional and Multilateral Affairs (\"RMA\") or the Office of Iraq Affairs. (ECF No. 25 \u00b6 13.) The Officer identified these offices as potential sources because the RMA coordinates NEA briefing materials for the State Department concerning the Near East, and the Office of Iraq Affairs monitors developments in Iraq. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Individuals at both offices searched electronic files using the search terms \"Wen Dong Zhao,\" \"Wen,\" \"Dong,\" \"Zhao,\" and \"Iraq War,\" so that the searches would find documents if they included any one of these terms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15; ECF No. 24 \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.) The offices also searched Iraq War paper files from January 2003 through August 2003. (ECF No. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.) Neither office located any responsive documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the U.S. Embassy, the Consul General and an Information Management Officer determined that the Regional Security Office (\"RSO\") and the Engineering Service Center (\"ESC\") might have responsive records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Staff members searched the RSO electronic files using the search terms \"Wen Dong Zhao,\" \"Zhao Wen Dong,\" \"Wen,\" \"Dong,\" and \"Zhao.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21; ECF No. 24 \u00b6 21.) The ESC also searched its electronic files, using the same search terms except for \"Zhao Wen Dong.\" (ECF No. 25 \u00b6 24.) Both offices searched their paper files for responsive documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 24.) These searches were not limited by date and applied to records from 2002 and later. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 24.) The RSO's and ESC's searches yielded no documents responsive to the plaintiff's FOIA request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Retired Records Inventory Management System (\"RIMS\") tracks retired records and allows analysts to search the content of the retired files' manifests and locate particular documents in retired file boxes. (ECF No. 25 \u00b6 27.) A State Department analyst who was familiar with the plaintiff's request searched RIMS using the terms \"Zhao\" in conjunction with \"Bangkok,\" \"Wen Dong Zhao,\" \"Zhao Wen Dong,\" and \"Darryl N. Johnson\" for documents dated January 1, 2003 through August 31, 2003. (ECF No. 25 \u00b6 28.) This search identified seven boxes of retired paper files, which were manually reviewed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) No responsive materials were located. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The State Archiving System (\"SAS\") enables searches of millions of records that include official copies of the following: correspondences with the White House, members of Congress, and other federal agencies; cables between the State Department and Foreign Service posts; position papers and reports; interoffice memoranda and memoranda of conversations; diplomatic notes; and retired records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.) These records are generally fully text searchable, and for those that are not-usually older documents-SAS searches the text of a reference index. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.) An analyst well-versed with SAS and familiar with the plaintiff's FOIA request applied the search terms \"Wen Dong Zhao;\" and \"Zhao\" in conjunction with \"Bangkok\" on documents dated January 1, 2003 through August 31, 2003. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) Again, the search yielded no responsive documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The State Department would have considered the plaintiff's unsolicited research materials \"information involving no administrative action, policy decision, or special compilations or research;\" the materials\n   were \"temporary\" records, which were likely destroyed 90 days after receipt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-36; ECF No. 23 at 13; ECF No. 28 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate only if the parties' submissions show that there is \"no genuine dispute as to any material fact,\" and that the movant is therefore \"entitled to judgment as matter of law.\" Fed.

The Clerk is respectfully directed to enter judgment in favor of the defendant, dismissing this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The plaintiff faxed this identical FOIA request to the State Department again on November 2, 2016. (ECF No. 25 \u00b6 4; ECF No. 24-1 at 5.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The plaintiff does not dispute the facts detailed in the defendant's 56.1 statement (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 32); thus, under Local Civil Rule 56.1(c), the facts in the 56.1 statement are deemed admitted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The plaintiff denies that he received the October 25, 2016 letter, but does not deny that the State Department responded. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 3.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The plaintiff denies that the State Department sent the December 8, 2016 response. (ECF No. 32 \u00b6 6.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The plaintiff does not give any specifics about the content of this slogan. The plaintiff states in his affidavit that: \"America uses 'Saddam Hussein was dead and they didn't need to give their life [sic] to Saddam Hussein anymore' as the advertisement\" (ECF 27-1 \u00b6 16), but does not clarify whether this \"advertisement\" is the slogan referenced in the brief. Even assuming it is, the plaintiff does not identify particular search terms other than \"Saddam Hussein,\" which he already asserts should have been a term.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The State Department does not deny that the plaintiff delivered the research materials to the U.S. Embassy, but submits that the materials were likely destroyed under the governing recordkeeping protocol. (ECF No. 28 at 5.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Stein has been the Director of the Office of Information Programs and Services of the State Department since January 22, 2017. (ECF No. 24 \u00b6 1.) He is the State Department official \"immediately responsible for responding to requests for records\" under FOIA.
