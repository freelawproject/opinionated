COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In September 2017, plaintiff Sarah Pleznac filed this putative class action against her former landlord, Equity Residential Management, L.L.C. The gist of Pleznac's complaint is that Equity perpetrated a \"bait-and-switch\" scheme that fooled her and other tenants into paying higher rents than they expected, and that it retaliated against her for complaining about its practices. Equity seeks to dismiss all of Pleznac's claims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), contending that she has failed to adequately plead several of her claims and that others are time-barred. The Court will grant Equity's motion with respect to some of Pleznac's claims and deny it for others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Equity is an S &amp; P 500 company that owns and manages hundreds of apartment buildings around the country, including several in the District of Columbia. Ms. Pleznac lived in one of its D.C. properties, 3003 Van Ness, from 2013 to 2017. According to Pleznac, Equity's scheme unfolded as follows: Sometime in January 2013, she saw an apartment advertised at 3003 Van Ness for $1,693 per month. Interested, Pleznac contacted Equity's rental office and applied to lease the apartment. Equity drew up a lease and told her that the District's rent-control statute applied to the property, meaning that rent could only rise by the amount of the increase in the Consumer Price Index (\"CPI\") plus an additional two percentage points. Pleznac signed the lease and moved in.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   But Pleznac claims that, throughout this process, Equity obfuscated that the advertised rent was heavily discounted: the lease included a so-called \"rent concession\" of some $1,000 per month from the \"base rate.\" To Pleznac's apparent surprise, when her yearlong lease was set to expire, she was notified that her rent would rise by 2% over the CPI multiplied by the higher base rate-not by the lower discounted rate-resulting in a significant hike. Equity then used the threat of that higher rent-combined with the \"great expense\n   and inconvenience\" of moving after just one year-to \"coerce[ ]\" her to sign several subsequent one-year leases with rents higher than she expected when she signed the initial lease. Notice of Removal Ex. A (\"Compl.\"), ECF No. 1, \u00b6 52. She alleges that Equity treated thousands of its tenants similarly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pleznac claims that Equity's practices violated the District of Columbia Consumer Protection Procedures Act (\"CPPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2028-3904\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 28-3904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and amounted to a breach of contract, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and fraud. She also alleges that, when she and other tenants complained about Equity's practices, the company retaliated by filing frivolous lawsuits against them for nonpayment of rent. It would also report false information to credit reporting agencies-including that the tenant had been evicted and that she owed Equity overdue rent-and then refuse to correct those knowingly false reports after tenants contested them. In Pleznac's view, these suits against tenants amounted to malicious prosecution. And the false reports to credit agencies were both defamatory and contrary to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a federal statute that requires entities that relay information to consumer reporting agencies to diligently investigate disputed credit-related information and promptly correct any errors,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pleznac initially filed suit in D.C. Superior Court, but Equity removed the case to federal court. The Court upheld the removal over Pleznac's objection, finding that the case was removable under the Class Action Fairness Act because it involved over 100 potential class members and put at least $5 million at issue. Op. &amp; Order, ECF No. 19, at 4-5 (May 8, 2018).

Pleznac admits that she had notice of Equity's allegedly deceptive actions when it presented her with a notice in September 2013 showing what her rent would be if she renewed her initial lease. Equity straightforwardly contends that, because that date was more than three years before Pleznac filed her complaint in September 2017, her claims are time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pleznac insists, however, that her claims remain viable because Equity committed a \"continuing tort\" against her,\n   which included some tortious acts within the limitations period. The continuing tort doctrine allows recovery for extended harms that began outside of the applicable limitations period. Under District of Columbia law, the doctrine applies only where a plaintiff suffers \"(1) a continuous and repetitious wrong, (2) with damages flowing from the act as a whole rather than from each individual act, and (3) at least one injurious act ... within the limitation period.\"\n   <em>\n    Beard v.

The doctrine applies only where the claimed \"injury might not have come about\n   <em>\n    but for the entire course of conduct\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    John McShain, Inc. v. L'Enfant Plaza Props., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8043481\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/402/1222/\">\n    402 A.2d 1222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1231 n.20 (D.C. 1979) (emphasis added). For example, D.C. courts have held that certain subterranean encroachments onto someone else's land are \"continuous,\" such that a plaintiff can seek redress for any damage caused by the encroachment within the limitations period even if he first became aware of the encroachment outside of the limitations period.\n   <em>\n    L'Enfant Plaza East, Inc. v. John McShain, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7966672\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/359/5/#p6\">\n    359 A.2d 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 6 (D.C. 1976). But that sort of case is a rare exception to the general rule that, when a plaintiff suffers an identifiable legal wrong and experiences \"[a]ny appreciable and actual harm flowing from the [defendant's] conduct,\" her claim accrues at that moment.\n   <em>\n    Beard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9391700\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/790/541/#p547\">\n    790 A.2d at 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hendel v.

The fact that an\n   <em>\n    injury\n   </em>\n   continues into the limitations period-or even that new and unexpected injuries arise-does not allow her to sue for the initial wrong that occurred outside the limitations period. This is why the D.C.

There is no way to read her complaint as alleging harm that materialized\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   through Equity's course of conduct as a whole. Quite the contrary, the nature of her claims show that she seeks redress for discrete, identifiable instances of alleged deception with continuing consequences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wallace v. Skadden, Arps, Meagher &amp; Flom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11708647\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/715/873/#p882\">\n    715 A.2d 873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 882 (D.C. 1998) (rejecting that multiple \"defamatory statements were all part of a single continuing course of conduct,\" even where plaintiff alleged that the statements \"cumulatively led to her discharge from employment\"). Specifically, Pleznac claims that Equity violated the CPPA by:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 misrepresenting or failing to state a material fact-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the actual rent being charged;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 advertising or offering apartments without the intent to sell them as advertised;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 making a misleading representation concerning the reasons for its price reductions or the price in comparison to its own price at a past or future time;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 falsely stating the reasons for offering or supplying the rent discount; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 making or enforcing unconscionable lease terms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Compl. \u00b6 73. Similarly, Pleznac's fraud claims rest on allegations that Equity fraudulently induced her into signing a lease (Count 7); fraudulently concealed the actual, pre-concession rent (Count 8); and fraudulently misrepresented how the District's rent-control statute would apply to her lease (Count 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Thus, under Pleznac's own legal theories, Equity violated the law when it advertised the apartment with its lower, post-concession rent and when it misled her about the application of the rent-control statute. What followed was not a series of \"injurious act[s]\" for purposes of the continuing tort doctrine, but rather\n   <em>\n    notice\n   </em>\n   of the purported deception (through the September 2013 renewal notice) and\n   <em>\n    subsequent injuries\n   </em>\n   attributable to being \"trapped\" by the initial deception, Compl. \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On the latter point, Pleznac urges that after receiving the 2013 renewal notice, she agreed to renew her lease for several yearlong terms, and that some renewals occurred within the limitations period. She contends that the high transaction costs of moving, combined with Equity's threat of increasing her rent based on the pre-concession price, forced her to do so. In her view, each renewal therefore makes up part of an ongoing injury. But her own arguments belie this characterization. She explains that \"the initial deception involving the first rent concession\n   <em>\n    begins the cycle\n   </em>\n   of trapping victims, and the cycle is perpetuated\n   <em>\n    by each subsequent renewal lease\n   </em>\n   .\" Pl.'s Opp'n Mot. Dismiss at 8 (emphasis added). In other words, Pleznac admits that she viewed each renewal as causing \"appreciable\" harm stemming from the initial deception. And because she first renewed her lease in January 2014-over three years before she filed suit- her claims based on any initial deception are necessarily untimely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To be sure, even though Pleznac's claims do not come within the continuing tort rule, that does not necessarily mean that she is barred from seeking relief based on the subsequent lease renewals. It could theoretically be the case that the renewals were independent acts of deception rather than mere injuries flowing from the initial misrepresentations or omissions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kyriakopoulos v. George Wash. Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3465005,10528085\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/866/438/\">\n    866 F.2d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 447 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (\"If ... a university committee of five members considers a professor's application and issues a report libeling him, and subsequently does so again as part of a grievance proceeding several years later, the later actions are actionable even though they constitute a repetition of the earlier contract\n   breach and libel.\"). But Pleznac nowhere alleges that these subsequent renewals were\n   <em>\n    themselves\n   </em>\n   deceptive or fraudulent. (It is indeed hard to see how any renewals after January 2014 could be characterized as\n   <em>\n    deceptive\n   </em>\n   , given that Pleznac admits she was fully aware of Equity's approach to calculating rent increases by September 2013.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   At bottom, because Pleznac admits learning of the alleged deception and experiencing some resulting injury over three years before filing her complaint, she cannot recover for that deception under the CPPA or through claims for fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Beard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9391700\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/790/541/#p547\">\n    790 A.2d at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

At least one court in this district has held that, where a plaintiff plausibly alleges that they notified a reporting agency of a dispute, the plaintiff need not allege with particularity that the reporting agency in turn notified the furnisher.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Equity's motion to dismiss is therefore granted with respect to Pleznac's claims under the CPPA (Count 1) and for defamation (Count 3), fraud (Counts 7-9), and punitive damages (Count 10). Equity's motion is denied with respect to her claims under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (Count 2) and for breach of contract (Count 4), malicious prosecution (Count 5), and intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count 6). A separate order accompanies this memorandum opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The logical conclusion of Pleznac's argument helps show why it must be rejected. What if Pleznac had signed a lease with rent concessions 30 years ago and, a year later, was presented with a notice showing that her rent was going to double? Suppose she then reluctantly signed yearlong leases for the next 30 years, aware that she had been deceived but feeling trapped from moving out. Could she bring a fraud claim today based on the decades-old deception simply because she had renewed her lease within the past three years? Under her theory of continuing torts, the answer would be yes. That cannot be the law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Pleznac points out that she seeks to represent a class of tenants who were deceived by the alleged scheme within three years before she filed suit. She contends that, by definition, some of these class members were harmed within the three-year limitations period. But if a plaintiff's claim is time-barred, the fact that she seeks to represent a class of in-time claims cannot can save her.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     E.
