Rather, the relevant inquiry presupposes that the defendants prevail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Should the First Circuit Court of Appeals find that the stipulation is insufficient to satisfy an essential element of section 666, the defendants' conviction cannot stand.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
