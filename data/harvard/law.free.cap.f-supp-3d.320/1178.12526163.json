At the first step in the\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   inquiry, the Court must consider whether the \"plain focus of the claims is on an improvement to computer functionality itself.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282681\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1327/#p1335\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282681\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1327/#p1335\">\n    at 1336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Uniloc argues that the asserted claims of the '229 Patent improve the functioning of the computer by allowing computer and network resources to be freed when the move/copy operation is paused and by preventing duplicative action by retaining the data that has already been copied or moved. While the method asserted could arguably improve the functioning of a computer, the asserted improvement is not the focus of these claims. Unlike the claims in\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   , which were directed to a means for configuring computer memory, the claims in the '229 Patent are directed to a method of copying and moving data; the improvement in computer function is a bi-product of the method, not its goal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Uniloc also cites to the holding in\n   <em>\n    Synchronoss Techs., Inc. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Synchronoss\n   </em>\n   , the claims at issue were directed on their face to a specific improvement to computer functionality, a more efficient mechanism for synchronizing data between systems connected to a network. While an aspect of that mechanism involved an update that circumvented the need to recopy all data, similar to the claims at issue here, this similarity does not make the claims analogous. Here, the claims are directed at the abstract concept of pausing in the middle of copying information without deleting the progress already made and simply continuing to copy the information after the pause ends.

Specifically, Uniloc points to the manner in which the claim dictates how the \"pause\" in the move/copy operation should occur. Independent Claim 1 recites reading a portion of data from a source file, reading that portion to the target file, and then pausing the copying in response to a user request. After the operation is resumed, the second portion of the data is read and written. Dkt. # 1 Ex. B. Uniloc fails to show how the specific arrangement of steps leading to the pause in the move/copy operation are inventive or different from prior art approaches to pausing move/copy operations. As noted by Big Fish, in every copying operation, information must first be read before it written or copied. A \"first portion\" of information is read and written before a \"second portion\" of information can be read and written. Specifying that the data to be copied or moved be \"portioned\" is not sufficiently transformative as to change the claim into more than requiring a generic computer to perform generic computer functions. Therefore, as the '229 Patent claims are directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to the '229 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    The '228 Patent\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Patent-Ineligible Concept\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The '228 Patent claims a \"method of applying service to a computer program that is to be executed at a remote location connected to a central computer site of a computer network.\" Dkt. # 1 Ex. A. This method centralizes service of repairs and upgrades for customers at remote locations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924463\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/1341/#p1349\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Independent Claim 1 of the '228 patent claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A method of applying service to a computer program that is to be executed at a remote location connected to a central computer site of a computer network, the method comprising the steps of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   interactively receiving a request for a computer program service from a customer at a remote location interface with optional service incorporation instructions of the remote location customer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   providing the received request for service over the computer network to a service facility at the central computer site;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   determining the components of the requested service at the central computer site; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   providing the results of the requested service over the computer network\n   back to the customer at the remote location interface.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Big Fish represents that Independent Claim 1 of the '228 Patent is subject to the same arguments and it representative of the other independent claims. Independent Claims 18 and 47 recite the same limitations as Independent Claim 1 in a \"computer network system\" and using a \"program storage device readable by a machine at a central computer site.\" Dkt. # 1 Ex. A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Big Fish argues that the '228 Patent claims the abstract idea of providing customized service to customers at a central site, analogizing the method claimed to the provision of repair services at a car service center. Dkt. # 22 at 10. Uniloc argues that the Patent does not claim an abstract idea because it does not merely recite a method for providing customers service at a central site, it recites a method for providing customers individualized service remotely over a computer network. Therefore, the method addresses a challenge specific to computer technology. However, Independent Claim 1 appears to simply recite steps for providing service to a customer: 1) receiving a request for a service from a customer with optional additional customer-specific instructions; 2) relaying the request to a service facility; 3) determining the components needed for the requested service; and 4) providing the service to the customer. While an aspect of this provision of service is the fact that it occurs remotely through use of a computer, and the service is the furnishing of executable code, it is still at base a method of providing customized service to customers from a central site. This is a regular business practice that is simply implemented by a computer. The dependent claims of the '228 Patent are equally directed to the same abstract idea, providing further limitations related to providing service to the customers, i.e. presenting a customer with a report of a product's service history, providing service at an alternative site connected to the central site (\"slave site\"), or providing a menu of service options to the customer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Uniloc further argues that the '228 Patent is not directed to an abstract idea because it discloses technical improvements specific to the way central computers provide software updates to remote customer locations. Specifically, that it claims a method of providing service that is more efficient than previous methods because service research and application of service are performed at the central site. Dkt. # 1 Ex. A. The specific update to the program (or the product), instead of a new version of the entire program, is sent to the remote location from the central site. This prevents remote locations from having to maintain source code copies of whole programs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924463\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/1341/#p1349\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, merely improving the efficiency of the abstract idea of providing customized service from a central site is the equivalent of \"relying on a computer to perform routine tasks more quickly or more accurately,\" which the Federal Circuit has found is insufficient to render a claim patent eligible.\n   <em>\n    OIP Techs., Inc. v.

Uniloc provides no convincing argument that the claims are directed to an actual technological improvement and not merely an improvement in efficiency or speed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Inventive Concept\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Similar to its argument with regards to the claims of the '229 Patent, Uniloc argues that the claims of the '228 Patent recite an inventive concept because they recite a \"particular arrangement of\n   elements as a technical improvement over previous methods or processes.\" Dkt. # 52 at 20. However, Uniloc provides almost no further explanation or argument to explain that contention, merely stating that \"the claims are significantly more than the theoretical abstract idea and the ordered combination of the claim limitations transform into a particular, practical application of that theoretical idea.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055438\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/1363/#p1367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Uniloc further states that the elements recited in Independent Claim 1 include limitations that are \"beyond what is well understood and conventional in the software support in distributed systems,\" specifically, \"software maintenance at remote nodes using facilities of a central site.\" Uniloc provides no further explanation as to how the elements of the claims at issue do more than implement the abstract idea and transform it into \"significantly more,\" or how the use of a central site for software maintenance is an inventive concept. As the '228 Patent claims an abstract idea and lacks an \"inventive concept\" sufficient to transform the claimed subject matter into a patent-eligible application of that idea, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to the '228 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
