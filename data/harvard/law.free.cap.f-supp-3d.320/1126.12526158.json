Plaintiff Alan Freas, Jr. (\"Freas\") opposed the motion on July 16, 2018, (Doc. No. 49), and BMW filed a reply on July 23, 2018. (Doc. No. 50.) The Court held a hearing on the matter on August 1, 2018. Timothy Whelan appeared for Freas, while Michael J. Hurvitz appeared for BMW. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

BMW is the North American subsidiary of a major international luxury car manufacturer, and does business in Las Vegas, Nevada, among other places. (Doc. No. 33-1, Defendant's Statement of Facts, at \u00b6 1.) On March 12, 2014, when Freas was living in Nevada,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   he purchased a certified used 2011 BMW 740i (\"the Vehicle\") from BMW for a total financed price of $61,624.11.

No. 49-2, Plaintiff's Statement of Facts, at \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Freas alleges that \"since the sale, the car has been plagued by ongoing defects, including problems with the brakes, HVAC system, electrical system, and engine.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.) The Vehicle's chief defect is \"an ongoing engine performance problem,\" whereby the Vehicle experiences \"a loss of power and the illumination of the check engine light\" during use, and cannot travel faster than \"40 miles per hour or so.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.) Freas submitted the Vehicle for servicing eight times at BMW locations in Las Vegas from 2014 to 2016, and an additional three times at BMW locations in Southern California from 2016 to 2017. (Doc. No. 33, MSJ, at 3-4.) The Vehicle has been out of service for more than sixty cumulative days since its purchase. (Doc. No. 49-2 at \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(Doc. No. 33.) Freas disputes each of BMW's legal arguments, and asserts that his lay testimony combined with the large number of unsuccessful service attempts could convince a trier of fact that BMW breached express and implied warranties by delivering him a defective vehicle. (Doc. No. 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As explained below, the Court agrees with BMW that Nevada law controls Freas' Magnuson-Moss claim. However, the Court concludes that: (i) Freas was not required to engage in an informal dispute settlement process before filing this suit; (ii) Freas' express warranty theory is not barred by any provision of Nevada's Lemon Law; and (iii) there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether BMW breached the implied warranty of merchantability created by Nevada's Uniform Commercial Code.

Informal Dispute Settlement Procedure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act provides that if a warrantor establishes \"an informal dispute settlement procedure which meets the requirements of the [Federal Trade] Commission's rules\" and \"he incorporates in a written warranty a requirement that the consumer resort to such procedure before pursuing any legal remedy under this section respecting such warranty, then (i) the consumer may not commence a civil action ... under ... [the Act] unless he initially resorts to such procedure[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202310\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). BMW maintains an informal dispute settlement procedure (the Better Business Bureau's AUTO LINE program) in Arkansas, California, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Virginia. (Doc. No. 49, Exh. 1, PageID 677.) BMW argues that the Court should dismiss this suit because Freas did not resort to the AUTO LINE program in California before filing. (Doc. No. 33 at 17-18.) Freas counters that he was not required to use AUTO LINE because BMW failed to provide proper notice of the program in its warranty booklet. (Doc. No. 49 at 15-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court rejects BMW's position for two reasons. First, BMW failed to comply with the Federal Trade Commission's regulations in seeking to require Freas to make use of the AUTO LINE program. Federal law provides that a \"warrantor shall disclose clearly and conspicuously at least the following information on the face of the written warranty:\"\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Freas apparently lived in Las Vegas, Nevada until sometime in the fall of 2016, when he moved to San Diego. (Doc. No. 33-1 at \u00b6 4.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    In its notice of removal, BMW asserts that the Court possesses both diversity jurisdiction and original jurisdiction under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4.) Because the complaint is silent as to the value of the Vehicle and the amount of damages sought, the Court ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefing addressing whether the amount in controversy in this suit is at least $50,000, as required by Magnuson-Moss,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202310\">\n     15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(1)(B), (3)(B), and $75,000, as required by the federal diversity statute,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1), (b). (Doc. No. 19.) The parties' submissions make clear that Freas is seeking to recover at least the approximately $61,000 he paid for the Vehicle, and thus the Court concludes that subject matter jurisdiction exists under Magnuson-Moss. The Court takes no position as to whether diversity jurisdiction also exists.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The Court grants BMW's unopposed request for judicial notice of the alternative dispute resolution program it maintains in California. (Doc. No. 33-2.) The Court sustains Freas' evidentiary objections where valid, and otherwise overrules them. (Doc. Nos. 48, 49-3, 49-4.) The Court reminds the parties that any evidence they seek to introduce at trial must be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, regardless of whether the Court has adverted to such evidence in this Order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    In this context, a warranty is an \"express or implied promise that something in furtherance of the contract is guaranteed by one of the contracting parties; esp[ecially], a seller's promise that the thing being sold is as represented or promised.\" Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014).

Assuming that there are relevant differences between California and Nevada law in this area, Nevada has a much more significant relationship to this dispute, and its laws would be more greatly impaired if they were not applied. The Vehicle was sold in Nevada to a then-Nevada-resident, and was serviced eight times in Nevada as compared to only three in California. The most significant connection that California has to this dispute is that Freas is now a California resident, a fact that is relatively inconsequential when compared to this suit's greater contacts with Nevada.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    (1) A statement of the availability of the informal dispute settlement mechanism;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    (2) The name and address of the Mechanism, or the name and a telephone number of the Mechanism which consumers may use without charge;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    (3) A statement of any requirement that the consumer resort to the Mechanism before exercising rights or seeking remedies created by Title I of the [Magnuson-Moss Warranty] Act; together with the disclosure that if a consumer chooses to seek redress by pursuing rights and remedies not created by Title I of the Act, resort to the Mechanism would not be required by any provision of the Act; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    (4) A statement, if applicable, indicating where further information on the Mechanism can be found in materials accompanying the product, as provided in \u00a7 703.2(c) of this section.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20703.2\">\n     16 C.F.R. \u00a7 703.2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b). \"If the warranty is included as part of a longer document, such as a use and care manual,\" the phrase \"[o]n the face of the warranty\" means \"the page in such document on which the warranty text begins.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20703.2\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 703.1(h)(2).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Here, it is undisputed that BMW's written warranty begins on page 26 of its 2011 7 Series Service and Warranty Information Booklet.
