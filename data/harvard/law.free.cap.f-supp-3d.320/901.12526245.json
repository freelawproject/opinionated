Its authority with regard to actions taken on behalf of the plan is set forth in the Riverbend plan. It does not have the authority to deny claims on behalf of the plan, nor did it. It did not exercise actual control over the Riverbend plan and made no decision to deny the initial claim or the appeal filed by [Plaintiff] relating to the October 2, 2015, alleged injury. SIS advised the Riverbend plan administrator with regard to the scope of the Riverbend plan and its coverage, but the decision to deny [Plaintiff's] October 2, 2015, claim was done by the Riverbend Plan and not SIS. As a third part [sic] administrator, SIS refers all disputed claims to the plan administrator for resolution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Emails between SIS and the Riverbend CC show that SIS offered opinions as to whether Plaintiff was eligible for benefits under the Plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the email from SIS to Riverbend CC on December 17, 2015, SIS explained that it did not believe that Plaintiff was eligible for benefits under the Plan, and asked how Riverbend CC wanted to handle the claim, inquiring whether it wanted to pay Plaintiff's claim or deny it under the Plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Riverbend CC responded that it decided to deny Plaintiff's claim under the Plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 10, 2016, the manager of the Riverbend CC, Wynn Chapman (\"Chapman\"), stated that there was no new information that would warrant a change in position as to the denial of Plaintiff's claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Chapman explained that Riverbend CC decided to therefore reaffirm the denial of benefits under the Plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his deposition, Chapman explained that SIS reviewed the medical records, that he relied on their evaluation of\n   the records, and that the medical records were not personally reviewed by the Riverbend Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Jakhar testified that she was told that the Riverbend Defendants did a \"thorough\" job of investigating Plaintiff's claims and that they undertook their own investigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jakhar explained that SIS took \"direction and information\" from the Riverbend Defendants and that it did not \"make any determinations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jakhar also testified that Riverbend \"was adamant that [Plaintiff's injury] was not an on-the-job accident and that this was related to the diabetes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Initial Denial\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On November 3, 2015, Plaintiff signed and submitted a claim to SIS, seeking the Plan's benefit based on his toe injury and subsequent amputation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 15, 2016, his claim was denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   The denial explained that Plaintiff's injury was not covered for several reasons: (1) it was not the result of an accident; (2) medical treatment due to illness was not covered by the plan; and (3) Plaintiff's injury was not immediately reported to his supervisor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Denial on Appeal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On July 12, 2016, Plaintiff filed an appeal, which was denied on August 12, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the affirmation decision, Chapman reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The ERISA plan provides for treatment of bodily injury solely and independently of all other causes that results from a covered accident.

However, there is no evidence demonstrating that SIS had discretion over the decision to deny Plaintiff benefits. While SIS's role in recommending denial of the claim certainly played into the plan administrator's decision, SIS did not have the authority to make the ultimate decision on the award of benefits. Emails between SIS and the Riverbend Defendants demonstrate that the plan administrator made the final decision in this case. Jakhar explained that the plan administrator directed SIS and that SIS made no determinations. Plaintiff has not raised a fact issue on this point; therefore, SIS cannot be held liable for the wrongful denial of benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     ERISA Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   ERISA permits a person who was denied benefits under an employee benefit plan to challenge that denial in federal court.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B).

Ins. Code \u00a7 1701.062. This section rendering discretionary clauses unenforceable applies to policies including those for \"accident or health insurance.\" Tex. Ins. Code \u00a7 1701.002(1)(A). In this case, the Plan \"provides payment for medical care, salary continuance, and certain death and dismemberment benefits arising from accidental injuries within the course and scope of employment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Plan covers health care in the event of an accident on the job, it clearly falls under Texas Insurance Code \u00a7 1701.002(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Under Texas Insurance Code \u00a7 1701.062(b), discretionary clauses are defined as clauses \"includ[ing] a provision that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (1) purports or acts to bind the claimant to, or grant deference in subsequent proceedings to, adverse eligibility or claim decisions or policy interpretations by the insurer; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (2) specifies:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (A) that a policyholder or other claimant may not contest or appeal a denial of a claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (B) that the insurer's interpretation of the terms of a document or decision to deny coverage or the amount of benefits is binding\n   upon a policyholder or other claimant;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   (C) that in an appeal, the insurer's decision about or interpretation of the terms of a document or coverage is binding; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (D) a standard of review in any appeal process that gives deference to the original claim decision or provides standards of interpretation or review that are inconsistent with the laws of this state, including the common law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Texas Insurance Code \u00a7 1701.062(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The discretionary clause in the Plan in this case stated, in relevant part: \"The action of the Plan Administrator in exercising all of the rights, powers, and authorities set out in Article IV, when performed in good faith and in its sole judgment, shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   This clause qualifies as a discretionary clause under Texas Insurance Code \u00a7 1701.062(b)(1), as it purports to bind the claimant to decisions made by the plan administrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In interpreting \u00a7 1701.062 of the Texas Insurance Code, the Fifth Circuit explained that it found it to \"only render[ ] discretionary clauses unenforceable\" and it did \"not attempt to prescribe the standard of review for federal courts in ERISA cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Ariana M. v.

Therefore, the court will review the denial of Plaintiff's benefits de novo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The parties do not dispute the fact that Plaintiff had the pre-existing condition of diabetes before he fell on October 2, 2015. What is in dispute in this case is what caused Plaintiff's toe to require amputation. There are many versions of the incident that emerge from the investigation and medical records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For example, during the investigation, multiple employees reported that Plaintiff only received an injury to his hand. Plaintiff's supervisor's statement reflected that he offered medical treatment for Plaintiff's hand which was refused. The supervisor also stated that Plaintiff told him that his medical issues were related to his diabetes. The medical records also provide various renditions of the incident. In his visit with\n   Dr. Blick, Plaintiff complains that he fell at work. However, when speaking with Dr. Rees, Plaintiff denied any trauma relating to his foot condition. When he sought treatment at the Houston Methodist Sugar Land Hospital, the records reflected that Plaintiff reported that his toe problem happened when he was at home. However, he also reported that he fell at work that caused a wound in his toe. These varying accounts raise a fact issue on what actually happened on October 2, 2015, and it is unclear from the records the origin of the gangrenous toe. The court will not make the factual determination of causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff contends that this fact question militates the outcome of the pending motions, and focuses much of his argument on what Defendants did wrong-namely, not providing him immediate medical treatment and arguing that the Riverbend Defendants did not properly review the medical records. Plaintiff also argues that his accident, not the diabetes, caused his foot condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   However, as the Riverbend Defendants point out in their motion, the exceptions to the Plan clearly exclude coverage for Plaintiff's claim. The provision on infections states that bacterial infections received in the scope of employment are covered only \"independent and in the absence of any underlying sickness, disease or condition including, but not limited to, diabetes.\" This provision clearly carves out coverage for infections that occur when diabetes is present. There is no dispute in this case that Plaintiff had a history of diabetes and had diabetes when the October 2, 2015 accident occurred. This exception to coverage is dispositive of Plaintiff's wrongful denial of benefits claim. Summary judgment should be granted for the Riverbend Defendants on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
