(Docket No. 14, Ex. 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The CAPECO Agreement created a \"Plaintiff Attorney Group\" for the parties to prosecute collectively claims arising from the October 2009 explosion at the Caribbean Petroleum Corporation tank farm in Bayam\u00f3n, Puerto Rico. (Docket No. 14, Ex. 1 at p. 1.) The Agreement stipulated that all parties \"shall commit to actively participate\" and \"fully cooperate with one another for the common benefit\" of the claimants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Parker Waichman Alonso agreed to advance the \"[c]apital expenditures necessary to fund the prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Agreement sets forth a process by which to reimburse the parties' expenses and distribute attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The parties agreed to first, reimburse member firms' capital expenditures, and second, allocate fees to reimburse out of pocket expenses \"that [were] not for specific cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The parties agreed to share the remaining fees among themselves equally.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In February 2016, Parker commenced this action, contending that the defendants \"unilaterally terminated the CAPECO Agreement\" without reimbursing Parker for its \"capital contributions,\" or distributing \"the net amount of attorney's fees to which [Parker] is entitled under the CAPECO Agreement.\" (Docket No. 1 at p. 5.) Parker allegedly \"invested the sum of $188,586.50 in capital expenditures necessary for the prosecution,\" including $86,499.39 in advertising for the joint venture. (Docket No. 186 at p. 2.) Parker also purportedly \"invested a substantial amount of 'man hours' in attorneys and paralegal time\" to prosecute the claims. (Docket No. 93 at p. 3.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Parker sought specific performance of the CAPECO Agreement and, alternatively, recovery pursuant to the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In July 2017, the Court found that the CAPECO Agreement is unenforceable and dismissed Parker's specific performance claim.\n   <em>\n    Parker Waichman LLP v.

(Docket No. 201;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 186 &amp; 187.) The defendants claim that \"a number of [Parker's] additional purportedly uncontested facts ... were supported by an affidavit, a deposition transcripts [sic] and various unauthenticated documents,\" which are \"inadmissible\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   and are otherwise hearsay.\" (Docket No. 201 at p. 2.) According to the defendants, \"several portions of the affidavit and deposition transcript either contain inadmissible hearsay or incompetent testimony\" and therefore must be \"stricken [along with the unauthenticated documents] and may not be taken into consideration when ruling of [sic] the pending motion for summary juedgment [sic].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendants' efforts to strike Parker's evidence and assertions are futile. The defendants move to strike the news article attached as an exhibit to Parker's opposition memorandum, five documents attached to Parker's opposing statement of uncontested facts, a segment of Peter Cambs's deposition testimony, and many paragraphs of Jerrold Parker's declaration. (Docket No. 201 at pp. 5-7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 186, Ex. 1 at pp. 1-2, 5-8, 23, 26-42; Docket No. 187, Ex. 1.) The defendants claim that the evidence is either \"inadmissible hearsay and irrelevant,\" \"unauthenticated,\" \"conclusory and self-serving,\" or in violation of Model Rule of Professional Conduct 7.4(d). (Docket No. 201 at p. 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   First, the evidence reaches the \"very low bar for relevance.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Second, the Court need not address whether the evidence is inadmissible hearsay because \"a district court may consider hearsay evidence submitted in an inadmissible form at the summary judgment stage where the content of the evidence proffered could later be provided in an admissible form at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    S.E.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202021464\">\n    2018 WL 2021464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. Parker is not required to submit evidence \"in a form that would be admissible at trial in order\n   to avoid summary judgment,\" and the defendants fail to explain why Parker's evidence could not be submitted in an admissible form at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p324\">\n    477 U.S. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p324\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    S.E.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202021464\">\n    2018 WL 2021464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. Third, Peter Cambs and Jerrold Parker are both testifying at trial, and the defendants similarly fail to establish why the content of the declaration and deposition testimony could not be asserted in an admissible form at trial.

July 11, 2012) (L\u00f3pez, Mag. J.). Finally, the defendants' contention regarding the Model Rules of Professional Conduct is unavailing because Parker is not \"stat[ing]\" or \"imply[ing]\" that he is \"certified as a specialist in a particular field of law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Model Rules of Prof'l Conduct r. 7.4(d) (Am.

Quetglas explains that his request to amend is belated because the completion of discovery revealed\n   new evidence regarding the total settlement amount and attorney's fees. (Docket No. 188 at p. 2.) This reasoning demonstrates \"good cause\" for the delay and does not controvert Quetglas's diligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steir\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9204512\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/383/7/#p11\">\n    383 F.3d at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, Quetglas requests to amend his crossclaim in order to add a\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   claim against Nevares and Salas for an alleged material misrepresentation. (Docket No. 188 at p. 2; Docket No. 208 at p. 3.) Nevares and Salas do not deny making this misrepresentation in their opposition or sur-reply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 193 and 213. The requested\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   crossclaim \"arises out of the transaction or occurance that is the subject matter\" of this action and \"relates to [the] property that is the subject matter\" of this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(g). Because Quetglas demonstrates \"good cause\" for his delay and provides \"substantial and convincing evidence\" to justify his belated request, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Quetglas's motion requesting leave to file the amended crossclaim (Docket No. 188).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For the reasons stated, the defendants' motion to strike (Docket No. 201), the defendants' motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 182), Parker's motion to withdraw its request for a jury trial (Docket No. 197), and the defendants' motion for partial dismissal (Docket No. 198) are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n   Quetglas's motion requesting leave to file the amended crossclaim (Docket No. 188) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   Quetglas may file the amended crossclaim\n   <strong>\n    no later than May 29, 2018\n   </strong>\n   . Pursuant to Rule 15(a)(3), Nevares and Salas may file their answer\n   <strong>\n    no later than June 11, 2018\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Quetglas does not join Nevares and Salas' motion for summary judgment, motion for partial dismissal, or motion to strike. (Docket Nos. 182, 198, 201.) Quetglas only moves for leave to file the amended crossclaim. (Docket No. 188.)
