Burke, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Presently pending before the Court is a motion to dismiss filed by Defendant Soroof International, Inc. (\"Defendant\" or \"Soroof\") pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1), 12(b)(2), and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (the \"Motion\"). (D.I. 6) Specifically, Soroof argues that this action should be dismissed because: (1) Plaintiff John E. Harrison (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Harrison\") lacks standing to assert an alter ego/veil piercing claim (the \"alter ego claim\"); (2) this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Soroof; and (3) Harrison has failed to allege a plausible alter ego claim. For the reasons that follow, the Court GRANTS-IN-PART Soroof's Motion and DENIES-IN-PART the remainder of the Motion as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In August 2007, Soroof and Quivus Holdings, LLC (an entity wholly owned by Harrison) formed Quivus Systems, LLC (\"Quivus\"), a Delaware limited liability company. (D.I. 1, ex. A (\"Complaint\") at \u00b6 1; D.I. 6, ex. A at 1) Soroof and Quivus Holdings, LLC were the sole members of Quivus. (Complaint at \u00b6 1) Under the terms of Quivus' operating agreement (the \"operating agreement\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Harrison was to serve as Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") of Quivus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the negotiations over the operating agreement, Harrison wanted equal representation on Quivus' board of directors (the \"board\"), while Soroof wanted to control the board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The parties compromised in the end. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The operating agreement ultimately gave Soroof control of the board-it permitted Soroof to appoint three board members, while Harrison (via Quivus Holdings, LLC) was permitted to appoint two members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; D.I. 6, ex. A at \u00a7 10.1(a) ) In return, Harrison negotiated a provision of the operating agreement that stated that Harrison could only be removed as CEO if one of Harrison's\n   own board nominees agreed to his removal. (Complaint at \u00b6 12; D.I. 6, ex. A at \u00a7 10.1(d)(2) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 1, 2014, Soroof removed Harrison as CEO of Quivus without an approving vote of at least one of Harrison's board nominees, in violation of the terms of the operating agreement. (Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1) From that date forward, Quivus' operation and management has allegedly been controlled by Quivus directors Prince Bander Bin Abdulla Bin Mohammed Al-Saud (\"Prince Bander\"), Tahir Rashid, and Sasa Petrovic. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11) Prince Bander serves as Chairman of Quivus' board and is also the owner of a majority of Soroof's outstanding shares. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Rashid is the Chief Operating Officer of Soroof. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And Mr. Petrovic, who currently serves as CEO of Quivus, is said to be \"beholden to Soroof for his position at Quivus and [his] salary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After removing Harrison, Soroof and Quivus (which was now \"controlled by Soroof\") filed suit against Harrison in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia (the \"DC Action\") on July 6, 2015 for \"breaches of [Harrison's] duties to Quivus.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 6-1 at 4) The DC Action \"triggered [ ] Harrison's right to advancement [of his legal fees and expenses in connection with suits against him for alleged breach of duties to Quivus] under the Quivus operating agreement.\" (Complaint at \u00b6 2) Harrison requested advancement from Quivus but was rejected. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In a March 4, 2016 letter rejecting Harrison's advancement demand, Quivus claimed that it did not have the financial capacity to advance funds to Harrison. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15 &amp; n.1) Following Quivus' rejection of Harrison's advancement demand, on March 7, 2016, Harrison commenced suit (the \"Advancement Action\") against Quivus in the Delaware Court of Chancery (\"Chancery Court\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2; D.I. 6-1 at 4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Harrison alleges that it is not a coincidence that the \" 'downturn' \" in Quivus' financial status, which rendered it unable to pay its advancement obligations, \"occurred around the same time that [ ] Harrison commenced the Advancement Action in March 2016.\" (Complaint at \u00b6 15) Harrison claims that Quivus' suggestion that it was unable to advance these monies is suspicious, given that \"Quivus reported over $2.3 million in revenue in 2015 (a full year after Soroof removed [ ] Harrison as CEO) and an increase in assets in 2015 over 2014[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 23, 2016, Harrison obtained an Order in the Advancement Action (the \"August 23, 2016 Order\") \"holding that he was entitled to advancement ... of certain fees and expenses incurred in the DC Action and requiring Quivus to indemnify [him] for all of his fees in pursuing the Advancement Action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2) However, Quivus did not advance Harrison these funds nor indemnify him, as required by the August 23, 2016 Order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3) This caused Harrison to file a motion for contempt, which the Chancery Court subsequently granted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4) In doing so, the Chancery Court ordered Quivus to pay Harrison's counsel in the DC Action $259,071.88, ordered Quivus to pay Harrison's\n   counsel in the Advancement Action $160,724.78, and awarded Harrison his fees for bringing the motion for contempt (later determined to be $29,341.33). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4) Additionally, the Chancery Court: (1) ordered that Quivus disclose to it,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"the manner by which the fees and expenses incurred in defense of the Advancement Action were paid\"; and (2) ordered that Harrison was allowed \"to propound written discovery requests and take depositions in aid of execution.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Pursuant to the aforementioned order, Quivus \"disclosed that all of the fees incurred in defense of the Advancement Action had been paid by Soroof.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, in response to discovery propounded in both the DC Action and the Advancement Action, Harrison learned that \"Soroof was the sole source of funding for Quivus.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) More specifically, Harrison discovered that Quivus' employees were either paid directly by Soroof, or were paid using funds that Soroof would transfer to a \"Quivus Special Account\" maintained by Kalbian Hagerty LLP (\"Kalbian Hagerty\"), a law firm that is representing Soroof and Quivus in the DC Action (and that represents Soroof in the instant action). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 17) With regard to the latter payment method, a Soroof employee would direct Kalbian Hagerty how much to pay Quivus' employees and would wire that money to the firm; in turn, the firm would provide the funds and payment instructions to Quivus' payroll administrator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 17) Kalbian Hagerty also used monies obtained from Soroof to pay other invoices submitted to Quivus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Although it complied with the disclosure and discovery requirements ordered by the Chancery Court, Quivus ultimately did not make the payments to Harrison that had been ordered by the Chancery Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7) Consequently, on December 22, 2016, Harrison filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint in the Advancement Action, wherein he sought to add Soroof as a party and \"obtain a declaration that Soroof was responsible for Quivus' obligations under a veil piercing theory.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, on January 10, 2017, Harrison filed a second motion for contempt against Quivus in the Advancement Action, wherein Harrison again sought to compel payment of the funds owed to him by Quivus and to be appointed receiver of Quivus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Chancery Court agreed to hear argument on both motions and scheduled the hearing for March 10, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Four days prior to the hearing, the Chancery Court asked the parties to reschedule the hearing to March 9, 2017; Quivus' attorneys advised that they were unable to do so, but provided other dates when they were available. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8) Then, on March 8, 2017, two days prior to the originally-scheduled hearing, \"Quivus filed a petition for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code\" (the \"Bankruptcy Action\") in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (the \"Bankruptcy Court\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background In the Instant Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Harrison initially filed the instant suit against Soroof in the Chancery Court on March 13, 2017. (Complaint at 1) On April 26, 2017, Soroof filed a notice of removal in this Court on the basis of diversity of citizenship. (D.I. 1) The parties thereafter jointly consented to the Court's jurisdiction to conduct all proceedings in the case, including trial, the entry of final judgment, and all post-trial proceedings. (D.I. 8)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Soroof filed the instant Motion in lieu of answering on May 17, 2017, (D.I. 6), and\n   briefing was completed on July 6, 2017, (D.I. 10). Harrison thereafter filed additional submissions regarding: (1) a potentially relevant motion filed in the Bankruptcy Action (relating to the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Trustee's request that Soroof be permitted to purchase Quivus' claims against Harrison), (D.I. 13); (2) potentially relevant decisions in the Bankruptcy Action and DC Action, (D.I. 18); and (3) additional legal authority supportive of its position, (D.I. 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court granted oral argument on the Motion, which was held on January 17, 2018. (D.I. 20 (hereinafter, \"Tr.\") ) However, at oral argument, it became clear that a key (and perhaps\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   key) issue regarding the Motion was whether Harrison's alter ego claim is the property of Quivus' bankruptcy estate (and, thus, whether Harrison has standing to bring that claim here). Yet that issue was addressed in only a few pages of the parties' pre-hearing briefing, and a number of the important cases on the subject were not referenced therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Thus, on January 18, 2018, the Court ordered supplemental briefing on the standing issue. Supplemental briefing was completed by February 2, 2018. (D.I. 23) The parties have stipulated to a stay of the action pending the Court's decision on the Motion. (D.I. 27; D.I. 28)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Harrison asserted three counts against Soroof in his Complaint: (1) Count I, which seeks a declaration that Quivus is the alter ego\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   of Soroof; (2) Count II, which seeks an order requiring payment of the monies that the Chancery Court previously ordered that Quivus pay to Harrison in the Advancement Action, as well as the payment of other outstanding amounts owed (the \"advancement claim\"); and (3) Count III, a claim for Harrison's fees in enforcing his advancement award (\"fees on fees\"). (Complaint at 14-17)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   With its Motion, as noted above, Soroof makes three arguments as to why this action should be dismissed: (1) Harrison failed to state a claim sufficient to establish that Soroof is the alter ego of Quivus; (2) the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Soroof; and (3) Harrison's alter ego claim is the property of the Quivus bankruptcy estate and thus assertable only by the Bankruptcy Trustee (i.e., Harrison lacks standing to bring that claim here).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.I. 6-1 at 1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The parties agree that Harrison's standing to bring the alter ego claim is a threshold\n   issue, in that, if Harrison lacks standing to assert that claim, then this would moot Soroof's other two bases for relief. (Tr. at 5, 9-12, 36, 54, 59-60; D.I. 21 at 4) Thus, the Court will address that issue first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standing to Assert the Alter Ego Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The parties' briefing did not provide much guidance as to what standard the Court should use in deciding the standing issue. For example, the parties did not address who bears the burden of proof as to this issue, nor which Federal Rule of Civil Procedure applies to the question. It turns out that there is a considerable difference of opinion among federal courts on these questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Generally, \" ' Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) [is the rule that] authorizes dismissal of a complaint for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, or if the plaintiff\n   <em>\n    lacks standing\n   </em>\n   to bring his claim.' \"\n   <em>\n    Arneault v.

Soroof argues that Harrison's Delaware alter ego claim meets both requirements, and is thus property of the bankruptcy estate. (D.I. 10 at 1-2; D.I. 21 at 2, 4) Although the issue is a challenging one, and both sides made strong arguments, for the reasons set out below, the Court agrees with Soroof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The alter ego claim existed at the commencement of the Bankruptcy Action, and Quivus could have asserted the alter ego claim on its own behalf under Delaware law.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   According to\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   , in order for Soroof to demonstrate that Harrison lacks standing to assert his claim here, the first requirement is that the claim must have \"existed at the commencement of the filing\" and that \"the debtor [Quivus] could have asserted the claim on [its] own behalf under state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5890168,3826696\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/875/\">\n    740 F.3d at 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As to whether Harrison's alter ego cause of action existed at the commencement of the Bankruptcy Action, there is no controversy. Harrison does not dispute that it did. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 22 at 1-2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 23 at 1-2 (\"Plaintiff does not challenge that any\n   veil piercing claim already existed at the time of bankruptcy. Indeed, Plaintiff sought to pierce the veil in a [m]otion to [a]mend filed in the Court of Chancery in December 2016-ten weeks before the bankruptcy case was filed.\") (citing Complaint at \u00b6 7) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Next, then, Soroof must demonstrate that Quivus could have asserted the alter ego claim on its own behalf against Soroof at the time of the filing of the bankruptcy petition. Soroof asserts that, pursuant to Delaware law, Quivus could have done so. In making this argument, it cites to federal court opinions that have interpreted Delaware law as permitting a corporation like Quivus to pierce its own veil. (D.I. 21 at 2-3; D.I. 23 at 1-2 &amp; n.1 (citing cases) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Harrison, for his part, does not heavily contest this issue. While he does note that \"\n   <em>\n    no Delaware state court\n   </em>\n   has addressed whether a subsidiary can pierce its own veil[,]\" (D.I. 22 at 2 (emphasis added) ), Harrison simply goes on to argue that \"[e]ven if [a subsidiary] could [pierce its own veil pursuant to Delaware law], however, the second part of the\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   test-the requirement that the claim must be a 'general' one, is not met and therefore [ ] Harrison's claim does not belong to the bankruptcy estate[,]\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Although Harrison does not fight hard as to this issue, the Court will still briefly examine the question. To start, Harrison appears to be correct that no Delaware state court has ever definitively stated that, under Delaware law, a corporation may pierce its own corporate veil.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   When a state court has not ruled on an issue such as this, it is then up to the federal court applying that state's law to \"\n   <em>\n    predict\n   </em>\n   how [the state's highest court] would decide the issue were it confronted with the problem.\"\n   <em>\n    Jaworowski v.

In order to establish that this exception applies, and that the purchasing company should be seen as the \"mere continuation\" of the selling company, \"a plaintiff must 'establish that there is continuity in management, shareholders, personnel, physical location, assets[,] and general business operation between selling and purchasing corporations following the asset acquisition.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5890168,3826696\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/875/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5890168,3826696\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/875/\">\n    at 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In the end, the\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   Court determined that plaintiffs' successor liability claim under New Jersey law was a \"general\" claim. And in summarizing why this was so, the Third Circuit explained that the plaintiffs had failed to make either of two showings: (1) they had \"fail[ed] to demonstrate how any of the factual allegations that would establish their cause of action based on successor liability are unique to them as compared to other creditors of Emoral\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) they had likewise failed \"to demonstrate how recovery on their successor liability cause of action would not benefit all creditors of Emoral given that Aaroma, as a mere continuation of Emoral, would succeed to all of Emoral's liabilities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5890168,3826696\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/875/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Soroof argues that, just like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   , here Harrison's alter ego claim fails both of these two tests. In other words, Soroof argues that Harrison's claim: (1) involves factual allegations that are not unique to Harrison and that could be \"relied on by all of Quivus['] creditors\" and (2) that \"[a] finding that Soroof is an alter ego would benefit all creditors\" of Quivus, not just Harrison. (D.I. 21 at 2 (emphasis omitted) ) Thus, below the Court will address each of these two questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) Are the factual allegations that would establish Harrison's alter ego cause of action unique to him, as compared to other creditors of Emoral?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court first assesses whether \"the factual allegations that would establish [Harrison's alter ego] cause of action are unique to [him], as compared to other creditors of [Quivus].\"\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5890168,3826696\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/875/\">\n    740 F.3d at 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   How does a court determine the answer to this question? We know from\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   that, in doing so, the Court should be focused on Harrison's alter ego claim itself-not Harrison's underlying claim for advancement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5890168,3826696\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/875/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5890168,3826696\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/875/\">\n    at 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On that score, as was previously noted, a Delaware alter ego claim has two elements: (1) have the two companies (Quivus and Soroof) functioned as a single entity and thus should be treated as such, and (2) has this corporate structure caused fraud, injustice, or unfairness? Would the factual allegations used to establish these elements be \"unique\" to Harrison?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   There is no dispute that as to the first element-whether Quivus and Soroof functioned as a single entity-they would not be. After all, in order to assess whether two entities function as one for purposes of the alter ego analysis, Delaware law asks courts to consider a number of factors\n   <em>\n    about the parent and subsidiary companies, and their relationship to each other\n   </em>\n   , including: \"(1) whether the company [i.e., the subsidiary] was adequately capitalized for the undertaking; (2) whether the company was solvent; (3) whether corporate formalities were observed; (4) whether the dominant shareholder [i.e., the asserted alter ego of the company in question] siphoned company funds; and (5) whether, in general, the company simply functioned as a facade for the dominant shareholder.\"\n   <em>\n    Sprint Nextel Corp. v. iPCS, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Civil Action No. 3746-VCP,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202737409\">\n    2008 WL 2737409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (Del.

Just as with the successor liability claim in\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   , the information that a court would consider as to this first element of the alter ego test (i.e., information about the nature of the Quivus/Soroof relationship) would not differ depending on which Quivus creditor was bringing an alter ego claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   It is as to the second element of an alter ego claim, however (i.e., whether there was an element of fraud, injustice, or unfairness at play), where the\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   analysis gets a bit more difficult. Here, Harrison\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   argue that the relevant factual allegations would be \"unique\" to him. (Tr. at 66 (Harrison's counsel arguing that \"there's also a second part of that alter ego analysis that talks about it being a fraud or an injustice or ine[quity] and not all the creditors are going to be able to meet that second part of that test\") )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   This \"fraud, injustice, or unfairness\" element has at times been criticized for being \"less than clear\" in what it requires.\n   <em>\n    Soroof Trading Dev.

Nevertheless, certain parameters have been set out.

After all, in any such plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   case (like Harrison's), the parent's actions in assertedly ignoring the corporate form may have caused the subsidiary to fail to pay or default on obligations relating to a\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   loan, or business transaction, or legal controversy-\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   in the sense that the loan/transaction/controversy involves the subsidiary and that\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   plaintiff (and perhaps no other entity). Moreover, such a plaintiff might argue that the motive for the parent's wrongful use of the alter ego was primarily, or even exclusively,\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   to it-that is, that the parent was engaging in this abuse of the corporate form for the\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   purpose of harming that\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   plaintiff. If there are facts in the relevant complaint going to all of this asserted specificity or particularity, a plaintiff is going to point to those facts and argue that they are unique to it (as compared to other creditors).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Indeed, that is in part how Harrison tries to frame his alter ego claim. In his Complaint, Harrison asserts that Soroof perpetrated an \"injustice\" and a \"fraud on this Court[,]\" (Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 16, 24), in order to accomplish the following plan:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   (1) Soroof sought to \"ke[ep] Quivus alive\" as a corporate entity by funding certain of Quivus' expenses, and Soroof \"did this because\" it wanted Quivus' claims for breach of fiduciary duty against Harrison to remain viable in the DC Action;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (2) At the same time, Soroof made it look like Quivus \"had no money to pay Mr. Harrison.\" It underfunded Quivus and used separate accounts not in Quivus' control to pay Quivus expenses. In light of this, and because Quivus is a separate corporate entity from Soroof, Quivus could assert that it was unable to pay Harrison the fees and costs it owed him in the DC Action and Advancement Action, all while;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (3) Soroof and Quivus continued to cause Harrison and his counsel to expend additional monies in those two actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   (Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 16, 21-24, 27;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 9 at 8; Tr. at 67-69) The way these allegations are phrased make them sound as if they relate to a Quivus/Soroof plan that is very\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   to Harrison-one whose motive was to injure Harrison\n   <em>\n    specifically\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   But on the other hand, in alter ego cases like this one, the creditor plaintiff is likely to be relying on facts to make out the \"fraud or injustice\" element that are really not unique to only that plaintiff. In such cases, the plaintiff would cite to certain coordinated acts taken by the parent and/or the subsidiary that not only caused harm to that plaintiff but\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   to other creditors of the subsidiary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Indeed, the instant Complaint includes numerous allegations of this type. In describing how \"Soroof's use of Quivus as a purportedly separate entity perpetrated a fraud[,]\" (Complaint at \u00b6 16), the Complaint references many allegations about how, exactly, Soroof accomplished this-allegations that are not particular to Harrison. For example, the Complaint sets out how Soroof controls Quivus' operations and management through the efforts of Quivus' remaining board members, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11), and how Soroof rarely follows the terms of the operating agreement, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12). It describes how Soroof ordered Quivus to stop pursuing a potentially lucrative contract so that Soroof could pursue it instead. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13) It alleges that, although Quivus reported over $2.3 million in revenue in 2015, its financial status deteriorated and, as early as March 2016, Quivus stated \"that it did not have the financial capacity to advance funds to [ ] Harrison.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15) And there are paragraphs of allegations explaining how Soroof helped fund Quivus' existence while keeping money off of Quivus' books, all so that no such funds could be \"attached or seized by\" Quivus creditors (including Mr. Harrison). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20) These include allegations that Soroof provided funds to cover some of Quivus' expenses, such as employee salaries, \"employee health insurance plans, business and workers['] compensation insurance, accounting services, internet services[,] and franchise taxes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17-18) This money was not provided directly to Quivus, but rather was deposited into an account managed by counsel for Soroof and Quivus, to then be distributed directly for the relevant expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Complaint alleges that Quivus had no obligation to pay these monies back to Soroof. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   These same factual allegations could have been made by any number of different Quivus creditors to help show that, based on Soroof's conduct, those creditors too would suffer an injustice were Quivus' corporate veil not pierced. Indeed, at one point in his Complaint, Harrison suggests just that. He notes that, had Soroof paid Quivus \"the appropriate amounts\" that it should have pursuant to the Quivus/Soroof operating agreement, then \"Quivus would have been able to\n   <em>\n    pay all of its creditors\n   </em>\n   , including [ ] Harrison.\" (Complaint at \u00b6 19 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30 (Harrison alleging, in Count I's alter ego claim, that \"Soroof did not pay the additional funds to which Quivus was entitled under their agreement, which caused Quivus to be undercapitalized and an entity in name only\"); D.I. 23 at 2 (Defendant arguing that \"[l]ike Harrison, [other creditors] continued to do business with Quivus Systems\n   in the belief that they ultimately would be repaid, and their 'right[s] to [recovery under their respective claims] will [also] be eviscerated' unless they somehow succeed in making Soroof pay another's debts\") (alterations in original) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Again, both parties make good arguments about whether to view the allegations here as \"particularized\" (Harrison's view) or \"general\" (Soroof's view). In the end, for two primary reasons, the Court believes that Soroof's position is the correct one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   First, in the sections of the Complaint that most directly relate to the alter ego allegations, the majority of the facts pleaded strike the Court as \"general\" allegations-those that any number of Quivus' creditors might use to show that Quivus and Soroof are each other's alter ego. In the body of the Complaint, for example, the sections most directly relating to the alter ego claim (\"Soroof Controlled Quivus Operationally and Financially\" and \"Soroof Used its Control to Harm Mr. Harrison and This Court\") are predominantly comprised of such factual assertions. (Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 11-15, 17-20, 26) Even more notably, nearly every additional factual allegation in Count I-the alter ego count itself-fits this bill. The factual averments there simply describe how Soroof dominated Quivus' board, failed to observe corporate formalities vis-a-vis Quivus, caused Quivus to be undercapitalized, and sent a letter on its own letterhead terminating Quivus' employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 29-31) None of those allegations particularly have to do with Harrison.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Landmark Fence Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. ED CV10-00143-AHM,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%204924739\">\n    2010 WL 4924739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (CD. Cal. Dec. 3, 2010) (finding that an alter ego claim brought by individual creditors against the debtor's principal under California law, which purportedly allowed for both \"generalized\" and \"particularlized\" alter ego claims, was a \"general\" claim and the property of the bankruptcy estate, where the \"vast majority\" of the allegations in the complaint regarding the alter ego claim related to evidence that \"affect[ed] all creditors equally\") (citing cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Second, categorizing the claim as one containing allegations that are not \"unique\" to Harrison best aligns with the Third Circuit's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   . There, in discussing this issue,\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   cited in part to a prior decision by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey:\n   <em>\n    In re Buildings by Jamie, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11753575\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/230/36/\">\n    230 B.R. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bank.

The\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   Court noted that in\n   <em>\n    Buildings by Jamie\n   </em>\n   , a debtor's individual creditors were found to lack standing to bring an alter ego cause of action under New Jersey law. And in applying the result in\n   <em>\n    Buildings by Jamie\n   </em>\n   to the standing issue before it, the\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   Court went on to state that \"[a]s in ...\n   <em>\n    Buildings by Jamie\n   </em>\n   , [here] the Diacetyl Plaintiffs' cause of action against Aaroma\n   <em>\n    would be based on facts generally available to any creditor\n   </em>\n   [.]\"\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5890168,3826696\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/875/\">\n    740 F.3d at 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

But instead, the\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   Court described the\n   <em>\n    Buildings by Jamie\n   </em>\n   allegations as being \"based on facts\n   <em>\n    generally available\n   </em>\n   to any creditor[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5890168,3826696\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/875/\">\n    740 F.3d at 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Its focus, then, must have been less on the fact that in ignoring corporate formalities, the Joneses sought to harm any one particular creditor or creditors. Instead, the Third Circuit seems to have been framing the Joneses' abuse of the corporate form as actions that could also just as easily have been used to harm any or all other creditors as well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the way\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   framed the allegations in\n   <em>\n    Buildings by Jamie\n   </em>\n   , it stands to reason that it would also frame the allegations here in the same way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   For these reasons, the Court concludes that the factual allegations that would establish Harrison's alter ego cause of action should not be viewed as being \"unique\" to him, as compared to other creditors of Quivus. This supports Soroof's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    (3) Would Harrison's recovery on his alter ego cause of action benefit all creditors of Quivus?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   also asks whether \"recovery on [Harrison's alter ego] cause of action would ... benefit all creditors of [Quivus.]\"\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5890168,3826696\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/875/\">\n    740 F.3d at 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   On this point, Harrison argues that his \"alter ego claim, which arises out of the orders granting him advancement,\" would solely benefit him because the \"claim for advancement is a specific contractual right that he has as the CEO of Quivus.\" (D.I. 22 at 3) Put another way, \"Harrison seeks a finding of alter ego 'to hold Soroof liable for the financial obligations of Quivus under the [orders granting him advancement]' \"-obligations that were all generated due to \"Soroof's actions in directing Quivus to sue Mr. Harrison[,]\" rendering any recovery \"personal to Mr. Harrison.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 n.2 (citing Complaint at \u00b6 32);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 9 at 19-20 (\"There can be no\n   doubt that the relief [Harrison] is seeking-holding Soroof accountable for paying [ ] Harrison's attorneys' fees in the DC Action and Advancement Action-is [ ] individual [ ] and pleaded as such.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (\"It is obvious from the Complaint that [ ] Harrison is pursuing an individual claim, and therefore can pierce the corporate veil and hold Soroof liable for Quivus' obligations to [ ] Harrison.\") ) In making this argument, Harrison is asking the Court to assess the relevant question (Would Harrison's recovery \"benefit all creditors\"?) by focusing on the particular dispute Harrison has with Quivus over advancement/reimbursement of fees and costs in the DC Action and the Advancement Action. (Tr. at 56-57 (Harrison's counsel arguing that, pursuant to Third Circuit decisions, courts \"will actually look at the claim underlying the alter ego claim to make its decision\" and noting that Harrison is only \"asking for an alter ego declaration regarding specific claims, not a generalized claim\") )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   makes it clear, however, that this is the wrong way to look at this issue.

Although the issue is not free from doubt, again the Court ultimately agrees with Soroof that Harrison's claim, if successful, would \"benefit all creditors\" of Quivus. It so concludes for a few reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   First, it is easy to see how alter ego claims could, as a general matter, be framed as benefitting all creditors of a debtor. Once Quivus and Soroof are found by a court to be alter egos of each other, that finding would certainly be helpful to other creditors. Those other creditors should then have a much easier path to the extent they wished to bring a similar alter ego claim against Soroof to recoup monies owed to them by Quivus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Indeed, if Soroof is found to be an alter ego of Quivus, it may in fact be estopped from arguing thereafter to the contrary.

Contrary to what Harrison argues, (D.I. 22 at 2),\n   <em>\n    DSI Renal\n   </em>\n   does not discuss in any detail the relevant law regarding whether a claim is a \"general\" one for purposes of determining if that claim is property of the bankruptcy estate. Nor does\n   <em>\n    DSI Renal\n   </em>\n   discuss\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   or any other similar case. And even viewing\n   <em>\n    DSI Renal\n   </em>\n   with the\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   framework in mind, it appears that the veil piercing claim in\n   <em>\n    DSI Renal\n   </em>\n   would clearly only have benefitted a certain subset of creditors of DSI Renal (the creditors of Bucks County Hospital, who would have benefitted if the debtor was found to be the hospital's alter ego, causing the estate of the debtor to take on\n   <em>\n    more debt\n   </em>\n   ). (Tr. at 29, 31) Thus, the claim would not rightly be deemed property of the bankruptcy estate,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , because it would not \"inure[ ] to the benefit of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   creditors.\"\n   <em>\n    Emoral\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5890168,3826696\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/875/\">\n    740 F.3d at 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   For these reasons, it can rightly be said that recovery on Harrison's alter ego cause of action would benefit all creditors of Quivus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

Plausibility of Harrison's Alter Ego Claim and Personal Jurisdiction Over Soroof\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   As was previously noted above, the parties agree that Harrison's standing to bring the alter ego claim is a \"threshold issue,\" (D.I. 21 at 4; Tr. at 5, 36, 54, 59-60), in that Harrison's advancement claim and claim for fees on fees against Soroof are dependent on a finding that Soroof is the alter ego of Quivus. Having found that Harrison does not have standing to bring the alter ego claim, the Court also finds that Harrison's advancement claim and claim for fees on fees must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Thus, the Court need not address the two other grounds of Soroof's Motion-that Harrison's alter ego claim fails as a matter of law under Rule 12(b)(6) and that Soroof is not subject to the personal jurisdiction of this Court under Rule 12(b)(2). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 6 (\"\n   <em>\n    If\n   </em>\n   the Court was to determine that there is no stay in place here, it's our position that the [C]omplaint against Soroof should be dismissed for two reasons.\") (emphasis added) ) The Court thus finds that Defendant's request for relief on these two additional grounds should be denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

It asserted that if the Court finds that Harrison lacks standing to bring the alter ego claim, then \"in the interests of efficient administration of the already pending [Bankruptcy Action], [all three] claims should be dismissed, and the Trustee should determine whether it wishes to bring such an action within the purview of the Bankruptcy proceedings.\" (D.I. 6-1 at 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 10 at 3-4; D.I. 21 at 4; D.I. 23 at 2) However, at oral argument, Soroof's position appeared to change, as its counsel asserted that if the alter ego claim is property of the bankruptcy estate, then the appropriate thing for this Court to do would be to stay the instant case. (Tr. at 5-6 (\"So as an initial matter[,] the Court will need to decide whether the pierce the corporate veil claim is an asset for the estate and the trustee and\n   <em>\n    if it is, the case is stayed under the bankruptcy rules\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36 (\"[O]ur position is that [the case] should be stayed if it does belong to the trustee.\") )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Court finds that Soroof had it right the first time, and will order that this action be dismissed.
