Patoski (\"Patoski\" or \"plaintiff\") seeks judicial review of the denial of her application for disability insurance benefits by defendant, Nancy A. Berryhill (\"the Commissioner\" or \"defendant\"), in her official capacity as Commissioner of the Social Security Administration (\"SSA\"). Pending before the Court are plaintiff's motion to reverse or remand the Commissioner's decision and defendant's motion to affirm the same. For the reasons that follow, plaintiff's motion will be denied and the Commissioner's motion will be allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Employment History and Alleged Disability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Patoski was born in 1950. She resides in Marblehead, Massachusetts, is married\n   and has one child. She finished college and graduate school and worked as a financial services analyst from 1985 to 1997. From the beginning of her employment, Patoski had accommodations to account for her psychiatric and physical disorders. Beginning in 1985, Patoski's health declined and, by 1997, she was unable to work as a financial analyst. Patoski tried unsuccessfully to go back to school in 2000 and has not maintained full time employment since 1997. She filed an application for social security disability (\"SSD\") under Title II of the Social Security Act (\"the Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20216\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i) and 223(d), in November, 2013. For purposes of her application for disability insurance benefits, her alleged onset date (\"AOD\") is May 1, 2001, the date on which she started her treatment for breast cancer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Patoski's initial application for disability benefits was filed on November 8, 2013. Her disability claim was predicated on her obsessive compulsive disorder (\"OCD\"), depression, cervical disc damage, headaches, breast cancer and severe anxiety stemming from those conditions. Her application was denied in October, 2014, and, upon reconsideration, further denied in June, 2015. She filed a request for a hearing and review of the SSA's decision. That hearing was held on August 16, 2016, before Administrative Law Judge Sujata Rodgers (\"the ALJ\"). In September, 2016, the ALJ issued a partially favorable decision finding that Patoski was disabled from May 1, 2001, through May 1, 2002. The ALJ also found, however, that Patoski's symptoms after May 2, 2002, were not disabling. Patoski appealed the ALJ's decision to the Social Security Administration Appeals Council (\"the Appeals Council\"). In March, 2017, the Appeals Council issued a ruling adopting the ALJ's decision and clarifying that Patoski is not entitled to any disability benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The ALJ's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The ALJ found that Patoski was disabled while undergoing treatment for breast cancer from May 1, 2001, through May 1, 2002 (\"the treatment period\"). Having so found, the ALJ applied an eight-step analysis to determine whether Patoski's disability continued through December 31, 2002, which is her date last insured (\"DLI\"). The ALJ then found that Patoski was not disabled beginning on May 2, 2002, through December 31, 2002 (\"the post-treatment period\"), and continuing through the date of the decision. The ALJ relied upon testimony presented at the disability hearing as well as medical reports from doctors and health professionals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At step one of the analysis, the ALJ determined that Patoski was not engaged in substantial gainful activity. At step two, the ALJ determined that Patoski did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of the listed impairments in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), 404.1525 and 404.1526. At step three, the ALJ concluded that medical improvement had occurred as of May 2, 2002. At step four, the ALJ found that this medical improvement was related to Patoski's ability to work and that Patoski's functional capacity for basic work activities increased after her breast cancer treatment concluded on May 1, 2002. Because step five applies only if medical improvement is not related to the ability to work, the ALJ declined to make a step-five finding. At step six, the ALJ determined that Patoski had the following severe impairments: cervical radiculopathy, breast cancer, OCD, anxiety and depression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before reaching step seven, the ALJ found that, after the treatment period, Patoski was no longer permitted to be absent from work at least two days per month for treatment of her medical impairments. Patoski's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\") was otherwise unchanged between the treatment period and the post-treatment period. At step seven, the ALJ concluded Patoski was unable to perform her past relevant work. At step eight, the ALJ determined that, considering Patoski's background and the post-treatment RFC finding, Patoski was able to perform a significant number of jobs in the national economy that existed during the post-treatment period and after her DLI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Furthermore, the ALJ determined that Patoski remained insured through December 31, 2002, which is her DLI. Patoski was therefore required to establish disability on or before the DLI in order to be entitled to a period of disability and disability insurance benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20423\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(A) &amp; (c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Appeals Council's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Patoski timely appealed the ALJ's decision and review was granted by the Social Security Administration Appeals Council (\"the Appeals Council\"). In March, 2017, the Appeals Council adopted the ALJ's decision regarding all issues in this case and modified the decision to clarify that Patoski was not entitled to a period of disability or benefits from May 1, 2001, to May 1, 2002, because she applied too long after her disability ceased.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.621\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) and 404.320(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Patoski filed her complaint in this action on May 5, 2017, alleging that the ALJ failed to consider pertinent evidence and did not properly conduct the analysis under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 404.1527(d), 404.1529(c) and 404.1594. Patoski also alleged that the Appeals Council did not 1) consider her arguments or 2) provide notice that it was limiting the issues for review to those mentioned in its notice of proposed action sent to Patoski on November 7, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Pending Motions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Act gives United States District Courts (\"District Courts\") the power to affirm, modify or reverse an ALJ's decision or to remand the case for a rehearing.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).

The Act provides that the findings of the Commissioner are conclusive if they are \"supported by substantial evidence\" and the Commissioner has applied the correct legal standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) ;\n   <em>\n    Seavey\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barnhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9451142\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/276/1/#p9\">\n    276 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 9 (1st Cir. 2001).

Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Patoski claims that the ALJ erred in finding her capable of light work and not disabled during and after the post-treatment period by 1) failing to rely on substantial medical evidence in the record to support the mental RFC finding, 2) failing to rely on expert evidence to support the physical RFC finding and 3) affording undue weight to the opinions of certain doctors in supporting both the physical and mental RFC finding. Patoski further contends that the Appeals Council erred in its\n   decision because it failed to consider her arguments or provide notice of the issues it would consider on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Medical Evidence in the Record\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Patoski contends the ALJ's conclusion is not based on substantial medical evidence in the record but rather on a layman's view of the importance of isolated events. The Commissioner denies those allegations and responds that the ALJ's conclusions were supported by substantial evidence in the record, including Dr. Joan Kellerman's opinion, Patoski's testimony and her Global Assessment of Functioning (\"GAF\") scores. Moreover, the Commissioner submits that even if the ALJ erred, Patoski cannot establish reversible error because she cannot establish that any error caused her prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To determine whether an individual is disabled, the ALJ must support his/her decision with substantial evidence in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). The United States Supreme Court has held that substantial evidence in this context is\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion [and must constitute] more than a mere scintilla.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Perales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11733715\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/402/389/#p401\">\n    402 U.S. 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 401,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11733715\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/402/389/#p401\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11733715\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/402/389/#p401\">\n    28 L.Ed.2d 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Dr. Kellerman, a state agency psychologist, reviewed evidence in the record and found Patoski did not have any mental limitations beyond those described in the post-treatment RFC finding. Because Dr. Kellerman is a state agency psychologist, it was appropriate for the ALJ to adopt Dr. Kellerman's opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Moreover, Patoski testified that she was capable of performing many daily activities during and after the post-treatment period, including driving, shopping, handling finances and attending dinner with family and friends. Adjudicators are entitled to rely on evidence of daily activities to determine an individual's degree of impairment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1529\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, Patoski's GAF score was 60 during and after the post-treatment period, which the ALJ determined indicates only a moderate impairment in overall functioning. Although GAF scores are not determinative, it is appropriate for the ALJ to consider an individual's GAF score when assessing functional ability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dietz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Astrue\n   </em>\n   , No. 08-30123,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201532348\">\n    2009 WL 1532348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 n.4 (D. Mass. May 29, 2009) (holding that although GAF scores are not determinative, they may help the ALJ assess an individual's functional ability). The ALJ considered Patoski's GAF score and found it consistent with the evidence in the record as a whole showing Patoski was not disabled during and after the post-treatment period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Accordingly, the ALJ's decision was appropriately based on substantial evidence in the record because Dr. Kellerman's opinion, Patoski's description of her daily activities and her GAF score collectively constitute more than a scintilla of evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11733715\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/402/389/#p401\">\n    402 U.S. at 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11733715\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/402/389/#p401\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Weight of Expert Opinions in the Record\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Patoski also avers that the ALJ erred in weighing the medical opinions in the record because she gave little weight to opinion evidence from 1) Dr. Maria Lynn Buttolph, a Massachusetts General Hospital (\"MGH\") psychiatrist who treated Patoski during and after the post-treatment period, 2) Dr. Linda Shafer, an MGH psychiatrist who treated Patoski after the post-treatment period, 3) Dr. Anne Chosak, an\n   MGH psychologist who treated Patoski during the post-treatment period, 4) Dr. Feng Ge, Patoski's primary care physician since July, 2008, and 5) Dr. Karen Krag, Patoski's primary oncologist from 2001 to 2014. The Commissioner denies those characterizations and maintains that the ALJ appropriately weighed all the evidence in the record. Moreover, the Commissioner submits that even if the ALJ erred, Patoski cannot establish reversible error because she cannot establish that any error caused her prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   To determine whether an individual is disabled, the ALJ must weigh several potentially conflicting medical opinions.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1224206\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/647/218/#p222\">\n    647 F.2d 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 222 (1st Cir. 1981).

Patoski also contends that the ALJ's partial dismissal of the opinion of Dr. Krag was based on a layman's view of isolated events rather than on substantial medical evidence in the record. The Commissioner denies those allegations and maintains that the ALJ gave appropriate weight to Dr. Kellerman's opinion and to Patoski's daily activities and appropriately discounted the opinions of Dr. Buttolph, Dr. Shafer, Dr. Chosak, Dr. Ge and Dr. Krag because they are inconsistent with substantial evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The ALJ may discount an opinion if it is inconsistent with the opinion of the record as a whole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Purdy\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Berryhill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516587\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/7/#p13\">\n    887 F.3d 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 13 (1st Cir. 2018) (holding that a treating physician's opinion is not controlling if it is inconsistent with other substantial evidence in the record).

None of those documents reference\n   <em>\n    severe\n   </em>\n   fatigue during or after the post-treatment period and the ALJ concluded that Patoski did not suffer from severe fatigue during that period.

The Commissioner maintains that because those doctors had a limited treatment relationship with Patoski during the post-treatment period, their opinions regarding the post-treatment period should be discounted. The Commissioner also minimizes the relevancy of those treatment relationships\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the post-treatment period in assessing Patoski's disability\n   <em>\n    during\n   </em>\n   the post-treatment period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The ALJ is allowed to consider the length of treatment relationship when determining how much weight to afford to a physician's opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Colvin\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-10254,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201387864\">\n    2015 WL 1387864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (D.

Dr. Buttolph, for example, had one encounter with Patoski before the post-treatment period and two encounters with Patoski during the post-treatment period. The ALJ can discount a medical opinion based on frequency of examination and length and nature of the treatment relationship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.927\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(i) and (ii).

The Appeals Council went on to clarify that Patoski was not entitled to disability or benefits from May 1, 2001, to May 2, 2002, because her claim was untimely.
