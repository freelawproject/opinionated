BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The basic facts are not in dispute. This case arises from a notice (\"the Sunset Notice\" or \"the Notice\") promulgated by USDA that alters the review process for determining which substances may be used in food certified as \"organic\" under the OFPA. The OFPA requires the Secretary of Agriculture (\"the Secretary\") to establish a \"National List\" of substances that fall into specific groupings, including synthetic substances permitted to be used in organic products (referred to as \"exempted substances\"), and non-synthetic substances that are prohibited from use in organic products (referred to as \"prohibited substances\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs. Mot. at 2;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206517\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) - (c). The OFPA requires the National Organic Standards Board (\"NOSB\") to develop the National List for submission to the Secretary. The NOSB is composed of fifteen members appointed by the Secretary. The Secretary cannot exempt a synthetic substance unless the\n   NOSB proposes to do so.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206517\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The OFPA also contains a \"sunset provision,\" which provides that no substances on the National List are \"valid unless the [NOSB] has reviewed such exemption or prohibition as provided in this section within 5 years.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206517\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants move for summary judgment on two alternative grounds. First, Defendants argue that the Notice is not \"final agency action\" under the APA, and is therefore immune from judicial review. Defs. Mot. at 10-13. Second, if review is permissible, Defendants contend that the Notice satisfies the APA's procedural requirements and is fully consistent with the OFPA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2056%2C814\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2056%2C814\">\n    at 13-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs also move for summary judgment on the merits of\n   their OFPA and APA claims. Pls. Mot. at 10-24. Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that the Notice contravenes the substantive provisions of the OFPA, and is therefore arbitrary and capricious. In addition, Plaintiffs argue that the Notice violates the APA because it is a legislative rule enacted without prior notice-and-comment. The Court turns first to the issue of whether the issuance of the Notice is reviewable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Final agency action is a prerequisite to judicial review under the APA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Agency action made reviewable by statute and final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial review.\").

In applying\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   's principles \"certain factors provide an indicia of finality, such as whether the action amounts to a definitive statement of the agency's position, whether the action has a direct and immediate effect on the day-to-day operations of the party seeking review, and whether immediate compliance with the terms is expected.\"\n   <em>\n    Indus.

Defs. Mot. at 9. Defendants claim that the Notice does not consummate the USDA's decisionmaking process regarding renewal or removal of substances from the National List; rather, the Notice simply alters the method by which substances are proposed for removal or renewal from the National List.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs. Mot. at 3-6, 11. Defendants similarly contend that the Notice does not itself impart or remove any public rights or legal obligations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13. On the other hand, Defendants acknowledge that USDA's actual renewal or removal decision\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   constitute final agency action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. According to Defendants, Plaintiffs may accordingly challenge that \"consummating\" agency action.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs present three reasons why they satisfy\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   . First, Plaintiffs argue that the Notice is final in that it \"definitively mark[s] the consummation of USDA's process in overhauling the sunset review process.\" Pls. Mot. at 20; Pls. Opp. at 21. Second, Plaintiffs highlight that the Notice requires immediate compliance by USDA, even if final renewal and removal decisions are subsequently made. Pls. Opp. at 21-22. Third, Plaintiffs claim that the Notice's change to voting procedures shifts the presumption in favor of automatic renewal, instead of removal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. Mot. at 13-14; Pls. Opp. at 21-22. Plaintiffs accordingly assert that this shift directly impacts their day-to-day operations, as new voting procedures will discourage\n   individuals from participating in the sunset review process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. Opp. at 22; FAC, Ex. A, A-67. Plaintiffs also claim that this change will reduce the quality of organic foods by making it easier to include synthetic materials in organic products. Pls. Opp. at 26;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAC Ex. B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court concludes that the Notice is not reviewable final agency action. The Notice works a change to the method by which a substance is proposed for inclusion on the National List. That change is dispositive only of a follow-on substantive decision: the Secretary's renewal/removal determination. USDA's judgment on whether to renew or remove a substance, in turn, represents the agency's consummating action. The Notice does not itself alter any criteria or standards for the evaluation of a particular substance. Though Plaintiffs are correct that Defendants must immediately comply with the Notice's provisions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls. Mot. at 20, that itself is not sufficient to create final agency action under the APA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indus. Customers of Nw.

For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Indus. Customers of Nw. Utils v. Bonneville Power Admin.\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit held that there was no final agency action created by an agency's decision to commence a power rate hearing that in turn determined whether a power rate adjustment would be triggered.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8957542\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/408/638/#p646\">\n    408 F.3d 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 641-42 (9th Cir. 2005). In that case, the Bonneville Power Administration (\"BPA\") had responsibility for deciding whether to hold an initial rate hearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8957542\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/408/638/#p646\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") had limited authority to \"affirm or remand\" BPA's rate, but could not modify BPA's proposed rate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8957542\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/408/638/#p646\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8957542\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/408/638/#p646\">\n    at 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . BPA argued that its trigger determination was not subject to judicial review until FERC confirmed and approved the rate, thereby rendering a final rate determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Industrial Customers\n   </em>\n   court agreed with BPA. It turned first to whether jurisdiction existed under the Northwest Power Act (\"NPA\"), which provided review of \"final actions,\" including \"final rate determinations\" by FERC. The plaintiffs argued that FERC's limited role in the rate-setting process would deny them the \"opportunity to challenge the BPA's trigger decision\" once the rates were set.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8957542\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/408/638/#p646\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8957542\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/408/638/#p646\">\n    at 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs contended that independent review of the BPA's decision to commence a rate hearing was warranted. Notably, the Ninth Circuit stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [T]he absence of FERC review does not preclude judicial review of the BPA's trigger determination after final FERC action. Indeed, the BPA concedes that the petitioners have the full right to judicial review of its trigger decision as part of the petition for review of the ultimate FERC rate decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8957542\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/408/638/#p646\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8957542\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/408/638/#p646\">\n    at 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The clerk is directed to enter judgment in accordance with this order in favor of Defendants and to close the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    For support, Plaintiffs rely on a list of voting tallies for synthetic substances taken at the fall 2015 NOSB meeting.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Plts. Mot. at 20-21, 25; FAC, Ex. B (providing a \"list of substances and respective outcomes on motions to remove\" synthetic ingredients from the National List). According to Plaintiffs, this document shows that the Notice has increased the propensity for harmful synthetics to enter organic products. Defendants argue that this document is not properly before the Court, as it contains post-decisional information outside the administrative record.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Tri-Valley CAREs v. U.S. Dep't of Energy\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3732419\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/671/1113/#p1130\">\n     671 F.3d 1113\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1130 (9th Cir. 2012). Even if the Court considers this document, this list of substances and voting outcomes does not show that the Notice was dispositive for any member's particular vote: in other words, the list does not show that NOSB members would have voted differently (or that a substance would have appeared on the National List)\n    <em>\n     but for\n    </em>\n    the Notice. Nor does this table address the fact that USDA ultimately retains discretion to remove or renew a given substance.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Because the Court concludes that it lacks jurisdiction to review USDA's actions, the Court does not address the merits of Plaintiff's APA and OFPA claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Defs. Mot. at 10.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
