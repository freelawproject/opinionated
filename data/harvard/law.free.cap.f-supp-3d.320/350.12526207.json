Soto-Cosme asserts that his sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) must be vacated because the underlying count, namely, aiding and abetting federal bank robbery, is not a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 924(c). Petitioner contends that aiding and abetting federal bank robbery\n   cannot be labeled as a \"crime of violence\" under the section's residual clause, found in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), as said residual clause is allegedly unconstitutionally vague after\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court finds that it does not need to address Petitioner's constitutional void-for-vagueness challenge regarding \u00a7 924(c)'s residual clause because federal bank robbery under \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a) and (d) qualifies as a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 924(c)'s \"force clause,\" \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Next, Soto-Cosme argues that in order for a felony to be a \"crime of violence\" pursuant to the \"force clause\" in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), the felony must have \"as an element the use, attempted use\n   <strong>\n    or threatened use of physical force\n   </strong>\n   against the person or property of another.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(A) (emphasis added). On the other hand, \"whoever, by force and violence,\n   <strong>\n    or by intimidation\n   </strong>\n   , takes, or attempts to take, from the person or presence of another, or obtains or attempts to obtain by extortion any property or any other thing of value belonging to [...] any bank [...]\" will have committed a federal bank robbery.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). Soto-Cosme contends that federal bank robbery cannot be labeled as a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 924(c)'s \"force clause\" because the offense can be committed via intimidation, which does not require physical force. This argument is predicated on the premise that if the most innocent conduct penalized by a statute does not constitute a \"crime of violence,\" then the statute categorically fails to qualify as a \"crime of violence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Torres-Miguel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5710583\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/701/165/#p167\">\n    701 F.3d 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 167 (4th Cir. 2012). Petitioner reasons that if he could have committed federal bank robbery using intimidation alone, then the criminal conduct does not fit the epithet of a \"crime of violence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Even if Soto-Cosme could have committed federal bank robbery via intimidation alone, said felony would still be labeled as a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 924(c)'s force clause. In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ellison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275319\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/32/\">\n    866 F.3d 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 2017) and\n   <em>\n    Hunter v.

In\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   , the court employed the same categorical approach utilized by Soto-Cosme in order to arrive at the opposite conclusion. The\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   court concluded that proving intimidation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) requires \"proving that a threat of bodily harm was made.\"\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275319\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/32/\">\n    866 F.3d at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   court could not foresee any realistic probability of the statute applying to the commission of a bank robbery where a threat of bodily harm was made or inferred, but the means of causing said bodily harm would not constitute physical force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275319\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/32/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, it is highly improbable to find a scenario in which the victim of a bank robbery reasonably infers a threat of bodily harm based on the defendant's words and actions, but said bodily harm is not the expected result of a possible physical force instigated by the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In fact, other circuits have gone so far as to say that a taking by intimidation under \u00a7 2113(a) constitutes\n   <em>\n    ipso facto\n   </em>\n   a threat to use physical force, as the defendant must know that his or her actions would create in an ordinary person the impression that resistance would be answered\n   with force.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275319\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/32/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275319\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/32/\">\n    at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Appx. 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 924 (11th Cir. 2016) ). The First Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   pointed out that \"we are not supposed to imagine 'fanciful, hypothetical scenarios' in assessing what the least serious conduct is that the statute covers.\"\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275319\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/32/\">\n    866 F.3d at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Therefore, the analysis employed when assessing what is the least culpable means for committing federal bank robbery should be restricted to those means that fall squarely within the realm of possibility. The\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   court thus concluded that federal bank robbery qualifies as a \"crime of violence\" under the career-offender sentencing guideline's \"force clause,\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1), because said felony \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\"\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264393\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/388/\">\n    873 F.3d at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275319\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/866/32/\">\n    866 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   37 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following its decision in\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit extended the analysis employed therein to the facts in\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   in order to classify the conduct defined by \u00a7 2113 as a \"crime of violence\" under the \"force clause\" of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). The\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   court pointed out that the sole difference in language between the \"force clause\" of the career-offender sentencing guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1), at issue in\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   , and the \"force clause\" in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), at issue in\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   as well as here, is the latter's reference to the \"use of physical force against the person\n   <strong>\n    or property\n   </strong>\n   of another.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(A) (emphasis added). Therefore, the scope of \u00a7 924(c)'s force clause is greater than that of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1), as it encompasses both persons\n   <strong>\n    and\n   </strong>\n   property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It follows, then, that after\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   even the least culpable alternative mean of accomplishing the conduct prohibited by \u00a7 2113(a) and (d), federal bank robbery, is a \"crime of violence\" under the \"force clause\" of \u00a7 924(c). Consequently, any means that are more violent than the use of intimidation in the perpetration of a bank robbery must also be considered sufficient for meeting the requirements set by \u00a7 924(c)'s \"force clause.\" Following the decisions in\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   , federal bank robbery as defined by \u00a7 2113, must be considered a \"crime of violence,\" under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), regardless of the means employed to perfect the crime. As a result, the court concludes that Soto Cosme's argument holds no water and his motion to vacate is, therefore,\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Petitioner also asserts that\n   <strong>\n    aiding and abetting\n   </strong>\n   a federal bank robbery cannot be considered a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 924(c)'s \"force clause.\" Petitioner argues that\n   <strong>\n    aiding and abetting\n   </strong>\n   a bank robbery, as defined by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , does not require the use, attempted use, or threatened use of violent physical force because the jury need not find that the defendant himself used force to effect the bank robbery. Under federal law, \"whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the United States, is punishable as a principal.\" 18 U.S.C \u00a7 2(b). In other words, \"one who aids and abets an offense 'is punishable as principal' [...] and the acts of the principal become those of the aider and abetter as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

After\n   <em>\n    Ellison\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   , the First Circuit classified federal bank robbery as a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 924(c)'s \"force clause,\" therefore aiding and abetting a federal bank robbery must logically be considered a \"crime of violence\" as well under the same clause. The aider and abettor of a federal bank robbery is legally responsible for the acts of the principal, meaning that Soto-Cosme committed all the elements of a principal bank robbery that merit the epithet of a \"crime of violence\" under the \"force clause\" of \u00a7 924(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Based on the above-cited cases, which serve as binding precedent, the court finds that Soto-Cosme's argument regarding \u00a7 924(c)'s force clause lacks merit. Accordingly, his request for habeas relief on these grounds is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Lastly, Soto-Cosme asserts that his sentence in Criminal Case No. 06-055 (PG) was subject to an improper enhancement based on the conduct that was originally charged by the later dismissed Count Two. Soto-Cosme states that the enhancement was improper as it was imposed without Petitioner being granted \"any advanced warning or given the chance to object.\" Docket No. 17 at page 16. Said enhancement resulted in a five-level increase to Petitioner's total offense level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Generally, Section 2255 motions must be filed within one year of the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1). The First Circuit affirmed all of Petitioner's convictions on July 6, 2009.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Criminal Case No. 06-053(PG), Docket No. 139. Soto-Cosme raised this present enhancement issue for the first time on July 11, 2016, via a motion to amend his original Section 2255 petition (Docket No. 6). Soto-Cosme's sentencing enhancement claim is separate and unrelated to his principal claim under\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, the special period conceded by the United States for presenting claims under\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   does not open the door to Petitioner's sentencing enhancement claim. Since the\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   exception does not apply to this argument, Petitioner's sentencing enhancement claim was subject to the one-year period of limitation imposed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1). Because it was raised past the applicable one-year period of limitation, the same is time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Petitioner's request for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C \u00a7 2255 (Dockets No. 2, 17). As such, the case is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.\n   </strong>\n   Judgment shall be entered accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
