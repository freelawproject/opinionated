Commerce concluded that the \"comparisons and analysis do indicate a strong correlation between low value and zero quantities,\" which it determined demonstrates that the data is reliable, reasoning that, if the zero values were the results of random errors, the zero-quantity imports would not be \"consistently in the low value range of all imports\" as the comparisons demonstrate that they are.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38. Specifically, one analysis demonstrated that, \"of any imported quantity with more than one import (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , data point), the average value of zero-quantity imports is lower than the AUV of any other quantity of imports.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35. In another analysis, Commerce \"divide[d] the value of each zero-quantity import by the AUV of the HTS category under which the zero-quantity import was classified\" and averaged those quantities, which resulted in a quantity for the values that was \"nearly 50,000 times less than the average of the quantities of all data points.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36. Commerce uses this figure to demonstrate that the value of zero-quantity imports is lower than the AUV for other quantities for each import category. Commerce further discovered that more than one-third of the zero-quantity import values \"have a value that is less than the AUV of the HTS category under which the zero-quantity import was classified,\" which Commerce suggests implies a quantity of less than one for those values because \"the AUV is the average value of one unit imported under that HTS category[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-37. In an additional comparison methodology, Commerce replaced the zero with 0.49, the highest quantity that would be rounded down to zero, and discovered that, \"overall, the AUVs for zero-quantity imports are consistent with the AUVs of other low quantity imports.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37. Based on all of these methods of comparison, Commerce concluded that the zero-quantity import values \"exhibit characteristics consistent with other low-quantity imports.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37. Accordingly, Commerce \"continue[s] to find that the zero-quantity data are attributable to rounding small quantities down to zero, rather than random errors that might result in unreliable data.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Commerce has responded to the court's order. Commerce explained that it had not previously addressed the data thoroughly, and accordingly ran a thorough analysis of the data on remand. The results of that analysis demonstrate that the zero-quantity values are in fact consistent with other low-quantity values on the record. Having confirmed that the values are consistent with other low-quantity values, it is reasonable for Commerce to conclude that the zero-quantity values are not the result of error but are the result of rounding quantities between 0.01 and 0.49 down to zero, and to determine that the data is reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Trina contends that, on remand \"Commerce has ignored substantial information that demonstrates that the values of zero quantity Thai entries vary tremendously even within the same HTS classification and therefore cannot reasonably be considered to reflect only small quantity imports,\" such that these values are unreliable and should not be included. Trina Remand Comments at 5. Commerce's analysis of the data emphasizes that the overall trend of the zero-quantity values suggests that the zero-quantity values are consistent with other low-quantity\n   values on the record. This explanation does not require that the value within each HTS category be unvaried. The determination that the values are generally consistent with other low-quantity values for each HTS category is reasonable despite some variation within each HTS category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Trina also argues that Commerce's analysis is misleading and inaccurate because the agency has presented an analysis of the figures which relies upon grouping \"together completely different imported products with widely divergent import average unit values.\" Trina Remand Comments at 5. However, in explaining its analysis, Commerce stated that its methodology specifically accounted for the fact that there are differences in the AUVs of individual HTS categories.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 35-36, 46. To account for these differences, Commerce \"divid[ed] the total value of each import by the AUV of the HTS category under which the import was classified to normalize for differences in the AUVs of different HTS categories,\" and then compared the averages that resulted for each distinct import quantity to assess each individual HTS category.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46. This methodology reasonably assesses the reliability of each individual HTS category, and Trina's argument that the agency erroneously assessed all values together without taking those differences into account is therefore unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

An argument that an import value that is ten times the average value is clearly aberrational may on its face appear plausible, and yet the record in this case contains thousands of such values. Our current practice of only examining whether an entire country's AUV is aberrational prevents what could be a never-ending process of removing allegedly relatively high and low individual data points from our calculations. The second concern with using the proposed analysis is that it undermines the use of broad-market average prices for a particular input.

Although the administrative burden concern is significant, it does not outweigh the accuracy concerns raised in a case such as this where the Thai data includes unit values from Hong Kong which make up only 1.6% of the import volume yet, at 191 times higher than the average unit values from other countries, quadruple the Thai AUV.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; Yingli Br. at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Commerce of course may change its practice; however, its practice must still be reasonable.

Rather, we would rely on suitcase prices to value suitcases and if there were no such prices on the record, then we would rely on the value of a broader category of products consisting of containers used to convey or transport items to value a suitcase. Because solar cells and modules are electrical products manufactured using a multiple array of inputs, including chemicals and metals, we find that the potential surrogate covering scrapped manufactured electrical products comprising various inputs is the better surrogate compared to a potential surrogate covering silicon rocks.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    <em>\n     Remand Results\n    </em>\n    at 62. It is unclear how this comparison demonstrates that the selection of a category specific to scrapped electrical batteries provides a reasonable surrogate value for scrapped solar cell and module byproduct. This analogy demonstrates that a certain different inapposite valuation would be unreasonable and it implies that the scrapped batteries are broader category of solar modules. Commerce does not explain why its implication is reasonable other than to say that solar modules and batteries contain metals and chemicals and produce electricity. This explanation does not support Commerce's implication.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Commerce and Plaintiff-Intervenor each allude to the fact that HTS category 8548.10 for scrapped battery cells contains an \"other\" subcategory, suggesting that scrapped modules could possibly be represented within this other category.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Remand Results\n    </em>\n    at 59; Pl.-Intervenors BYD (Shangluo) Industrial Co., Ltd. and Shanghai BYD Co., Ltd. Comments on Remand Results at 5, Mar. 21, 2018, ECF No. 136. It is not clear that it is reasonable to suggest that this \"Other\" category would cover scrapped solar modules. However, this suggestion, even if reasonable, would not address the lack of a rationale that focuses on the representativeness of the selected value, as would be necessary to make the selection of this HTS reasonable on this record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
