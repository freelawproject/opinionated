CRENSHAW, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After this Court entered an Order (Doc. No. 51) granting Ronald G. Driver's Motion to Compel Arbitration (Doc. No. 42)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   and Pro Ag Management, Inc.'s (\"Pro Ag\") Motion to Stay Pending Completion of Arbitration (Doc. No. 39), Driver filed a Motion to Dismiss With Prejudice (Doc. No. 52). The basis for that Motion is that he has settled with Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In response, ARMtech Insurance Services, Inc. (\"ARMtech\") \"admits that [Driver] has entered into separate written settlement agreements with each Defendant thereby fully and finally resolving all claims asserted in Driver's Complaint.\" (Doc. No. 56 at 1). ARMtech insists, however, that its \"assertion of comparative fault against its Co-Defendant for negligence constitutes a still pending claim in this lawsuit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   ARMtech's use of the term \"assertion of comparative fault\" is telling. In its Answer, ARMtech alleges, as an affirmative defense, the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   4. The sole proximate cause or proximate contributing cause of Plaintiff's losses or damages, if any, was the Plaintiff's own negligent or intentional acts or omissions, which are pled as a complete bar to recovery or in diminution thereof. Alternatively, the sole proximate cause or proximate contributing cause of Plaintiff's losses or damages, if any, was Pro Ag's negligent or intentional acts or omissions, which are pled as a complete bar to recovery or in diminution thereof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (Doc. No. 25 at 9, \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Under Rule 13(g) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \"[a] pleading may state as a crossclaim any claim by one party against a coparty if the claim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action or of a counterclaim [and] may include a claim that the coparty is or may be liable to the cross-claimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the cross-claimant.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(g). An affirmative defense, however, is not a \"claim\" for relief.\n   <em>\n    Philadelphia Indem. Ins. Co. v. Chicago Title Ins.
