In a previous memorandum opinion and order, the Court dismissed almost all of Williams's claims but left intact her Rehabilitation Act claims against Meghan Brennan, in her official capacity as Postmaster General of the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

The Postal Service has now moved to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. Dkt. 41.

Williams's Remaining Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Paulette Williams, an employee of the Postal Service, filed this action in June 2017. Dkt. 1. The Court dismissed her initial complaint for failure to comply with the pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a). Dkt. 4. Williams then moved for reconsideration and to reopen the case, and, at the same time, she filed an amended complaint. Dkt. 6; Dkt. 7. After the Court granted her motion and reopened the case, Dkt. 9, fifteen of the defendants moved to dismiss on various grounds, Dkt. 21; Dkt. 29. There is no evidence that the remaining defendant was ever served.\n   <em>\n    Williams I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n    285 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   4 n.3. The Court granted one of those motions and\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   dismissed the remaining claims, with the exception of Williams's Rehabilitation Act claims against the Postal Service.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n    at 1-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although not a picture of clarity, those claims appear to have four components:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   First, Williams alleges that Tony Johnson, the Postmaster for Fort Belvoir, Virginia, denied her November 2015 request that the Post Office accommodate her physical disability. Dkt. 7 at 2 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 1). Then, when Williams was ready to return to work, Johnson denied her request to do so, even though her doctor had\n   \"lift[ed] all restrictions\" on her ability to work.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 2). And, when Williams had returned to work about two months later, Johnson \"creat[ed] a hostile work environment\" by making \"crude remarks ... pertaining to [her] disability\" and her \"homelessness.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Second, Williams avers that Preston Phillips, the manager of the Diamond Farms Post Office in Gaithersburg, Maryland, retaliated against her in February 2016 due to her \"pending grievance\" pertaining to the events occurring at the Fort Belvoir Post Office.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 4). Over a year later, according to Williams, Phillips denied her April 2017 request that the Post Office accommodate her \"mental health issues.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Third, Williams alleges that in June 2017, Patrice Shaw, the Officer in Charge of the Gaithersburg, Maryland Post Office, threatened to \"expos[e] her ... personal business\"-which the Court understands to refer to her disabilities-unless she met with Shaw \"without a steward present.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 6). According to the amended complaint, Shaw again \"victimized\" and \"harass[ed]\" Williams in July 2017, \"when [Shaw] had the floor supervisor ... serve [Williams] with a memo[ ] stating that [Williams's] job would be ... abolished.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Fourth, Williams avers that from February 2017 to the present, the Postal Service has denied her requests to transfer to other positions and her requests for promotion in retaliation for her \"intent to bring civil litigation\" against the Postal Service,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 7), and, finally, laid her off on July 3, 2017, \"due to [her] disability,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 9). Although Williams was told that this layoff was \"expected to last\" only two weeks, by the time she filed her amended complaint almost a month later, she had not yet been reinstated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Administrative Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 3, 2015, Williams filed an administrative Equal Employment Opportunity (\"EEO\") complaint with the Postal Service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1-4 at 4. Although the parties have not provided the Court with a copy of that administrative complaint, the Court assumes for present purposes that it challenged the Postal Service's November 30, 2015 decision declining to accommodate Williams's physical disability. Indeed, that is the only conduct that Williams now challenges that\n   <em>\n    preceded\n   </em>\n   the December 3, 2015 administrative complaint, Dkt. 7 at 2, and a later administrative notice confirms that Williams, in fact, filed an administrative complaint challenging the November 30, 2015 decision, Dkt. 41-7 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A week after filing that administrative complaint, Williams's union, the American Postal Workers' Union (\"APWU\"), filed a grievance on her behalf that raised the same substantive complaint, although in the context of a labor-management dispute. Dkt. 41-3. That grievance, filed on December 10, 2015, alleged that Williams \"was denied\" the opportunity to work \"after requesting reasonable accommodations due to her work limitations and permanent medical condition,\" and, in particular, that Johnson informed her that \"she would no longer be scheduled to work due to her work restrictions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n    at 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 4, 2016, Williams withdrew her EEO complaint, prior to issuance of a decision by the EEO Office and prior to expiration of the 180-day period of time for the EEO Office to act on the complaint. In a letter to the Postmaster General attached to Williams's initial complaint in this matter, she explains that she withdrew her EEO complaint \"because Dana Claybrooks,\" the Postal Service's EEO counselor,\n   \"convinced\" her that her union grievance process \"would help [her] the same way, if not better, than what [Claybrooks] could, considering [Williams's union grievance] was already up for arbitration.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 1-2 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Over ten months later, on April 20, 2017, the union and the Postal Service reached a settlement of Williams's grievance. Dkt. 41-4 at 2. Williams was awarded a cash payment to cover her lost wages for her \"denial of light duty [work] from December 15, 2015 until she returned to work on February 1, 2016.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although this award covers a period of time after she filed her administrative complaint (on December 3, 2015) and after the union initiated the grievance process (on December 10, 2015), it appears that the Postal Service's decision to restrict her ability to work during that period of time was directly related to Williams's earlier request for an accommodation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Unhappy with the resolution of her union grievance, Williams took a step toward re-initiating the EEO process on May 15, 2017, by submitting Postal Service Form 2564-A. Dkt. 41-5. That form, captioned \"Information for Pre-Complaint Counseling,\" is not an EEO complaint but, instead, merely initiates the counseling process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n    at 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The issues that Williams raised, moreover, are only indirectly related to the claims she asserts in this case. Rather than challenge the Postal Service's failure to accommodate her disabilities, she challenged the union grievance process, asserting that \"[t]he union rep did not at all attempt to represent [her] correctly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Consistent with that claim, she named the APWU Vice President for Labor Relations as the \"official[ ] who took the action which prompted\" Williams \"to seek counseling,\" and she listed the date the grievance was settled as the date \"the incident or action that prompted\" her need for counseling took place.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n    at 1-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no evidence that, prior to filing this lawsuit, Williams ever filed an administrative complaint relating to the allegations raised in her request for counseling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ultimately, with the exception of the complaint that she filed and withdrew, Williams did not file an administrative EEO complaint until August 9, 2017-several weeks after she filed this lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 41-7. As reasonably construed by the Postal Service's EEO Office, that administrative complaint raised ten issues, including the November 30, 2015 decision not to accommodate Williams's disability; alleged \"harassment regarding\" her \"shoes, pants, and mobile devices;\" and a variety of events occurring in 2017.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n    at 1-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In September 2017, the EEO Office accepted some of those claims for investigation but declined to accept three of Williams's claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Most significantly for present purposes, it declined to accept her claim regarding the November 30, 2015 failure to accommodate on the ground that Williams had raised that claim in a prior complaint and had voluntarily withdrawn that complaint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522874\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/1/#p6\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Postal Service moves to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment on three grounds: (1) Williams has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies in a timely manner; (2) her 2015 failure-to-accommodate\n   claims are barred by the settlement of her grievance; and (3) several of her other claims fail as a matter of law. Dkt. 41-1. In addition to these defenses, the Court must, on its own, consider whether it has subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez v. Thaler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186041,12445442\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/134/\">\n    565 U.S. 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 141,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186041,12445442\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/134/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186041,12445442\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/134/\">\n    181 L.Ed.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).

To start, her complaint alleges that she was harassed by Tony Johnson, the Postmaster for Fort Belvoir, Virginia from February 2016, and that, beginning that same month, Preston Phillips, the manager of the Gaithersburg, Maryland Post Office retaliated against her because of her pending grievance. Dkt. 7 at 2-3 (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-5). There is no evidence that Williams ever raised either of these allegations in an administrative EEO complaint. She, obviously, could not have raised either allegation in her 2015 administrative complaint, and her 2017 administrative complaint does not refer to any events occurring in 2016. Dkt. 41-6; Dkt. 41-7. Because the filing of an administrative complaint constitutes a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit under\n   <em>\n    Spinelli\n   </em>\n   , and because Williams has not satisfied her burden of pleading-or showing-that she filed an administrative complaint raising the 2016 events, the Court concludes that it must dismiss those claims for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In contrast, Williams has filed an administrative complaint regarding at least some of the events alleged in her complaint occurring in 2017 and continuing \"to [the] [p]resent,\" Dkt. 7 at 4 (Am.

The requirement is, understandably, framed in the past tense and, under the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Spinelli\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Doak\n   </em>\n   , confers jurisdiction on the district court only after the plaintiff has been aggrieved by the agency's disposition of her complaint. That conclusion is also consistent with the purpose of the exhaustion requirement, which exists \"in order to give federal agencies an opportunity to handle matters internally whenever possible and to ensure that the federal courts are burdened only when reasonably necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Williams's 2015 Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This, then, leaves only Williams's allegations involving conduct occurring in 2015. Williams asserts that the Postal Service discriminated against her based on her disability twice during this period: First,\n   on November 30, 2015, the Postal Service allegedly denied her request for a reasonable accommodation of her \"physical disability.\" Dkt. 7 at 2 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 1). Second, on December 15, 2015, the Postal Service did not allow her to return to work even after she had her \"physician ... lift all [work] restrictions\" that she had previously \"requested during [an earlier] reasonable accommodation process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1861896,3642251\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/707/524/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Am.

The Court will consider each of these allegations in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    November 30, 2015 Failure to Accommodate Williams's Disability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Williams's allegations relating to the Postal Service's alleged failure to accommodate her physical disability in November 2015 stands in a different posture from her other claims because she did file an EEO complaint on December 3, 2015, which raised this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1-4 at 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 41-7 at 3-4 (Aug. 2017 EEO Notice of Partial Acceptance/Partial Dismissal, describing the allegations regarding November 30, 2015 as \"identical to the claims raised in [her] previous EEO Complaint\"). The problem is that Williams withdrew that complaint on February 4, 2016, Dkt. 41-7 at 4, less than 180 days after it was filed and before the EEO Office took any action on it. According to Williams, she did so because Dana Claybrooks, the Postal Service's EEO counselor, \"convinced [her] that APWU would help [her] the same way, if not better, than what [Claybrooks] could, considering [Williams] was already up for arbitration.\" Dkt. 1-2 at 4. The question, then, is whether Williams satisfied the jurisdictional exhaustion requirement by filing an administrative complaint and, if so, whether she can then assert an equitable defense (her reliance on Claybrooks) to overcome any non-jurisdictional hurdles. Because the Court concludes that Williams failed to satisfy the jurisdictional exhaustion requirement, it does not reach the question whether, as a matter of equity, her failure to follow through should be overlooked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The relevant question is, once again, whether this issue is controlled by\n   <em>\n    Spinelli\n   </em>\n   ; if it is, the defect is jurisdictional. The only difference between the facts present here and those in\n   <em>\n    Spinelli\n   </em>\n   is that the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Spinelli\n   </em>\n   \"never filed an administrative complaint,\"\n   <em>\n    Doak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331882,6772339\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/1096/\">\n    798 F.3d at 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , while Williams filed, and then withdrew, her complaint. That difference is immaterial. The relevant question under the Rehabilitation Act is whether the Williams was \"aggrieved by [a] final disposition of\" her administrative complaint. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(1). In\n   <em>\n    Spinelli\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff was not aggrieved by a final disposition because he \"never filed an administrative complaint.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2838800,3456101\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/446/159/\">\n    446 F.3d at 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Williams was not aggrieved by a final disposition because she withdrew her complaint before the Postal Service could act on it. There is no sensible reading of the statute that would permit the Court to distinguish between these circumstances. In both\n   <em>\n    Spinelli\n   </em>\n   and this case, the employee did not obtain a final disposition (and the agency did not simply fail \"to take final action on [an administrative EEO] complaint\"), and, in both cases, that omission was a product of the employee's own failure to pursue administrative relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Even if this Court were to conclude that\n   <em>\n    Spinelli\n   </em>\n   is at odds with prevailing doctrine for distinguishing between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional rules,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Spinelli\n   </em>\n   still requires this result. To be sure, one might argue that\n   <em>\n    Spinelli\n   </em>\n   held only that the Rehabilitation Act conditions jurisdiction on\n   the\n   <em>\n    filing\n   </em>\n   of an administrative complaint. But that is not what\n   <em>\n    Spinelli\n   </em>\n   actually says. The D.C. Circuit clearly set forth its holding: \"jurisdiction depended on the 'final disposition of [an administrative] complaint,\" and, because Spinelli never filed an administrative complaint, \"there was ... no final disposition of one.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2838800,3456101\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/446/159/\">\n    446 F.3d at 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, the district lacked jurisdiction over Spinelli's claim because \"there was no final disposition\" of an administrative charge. Any question that this was the holding in\n   <em>\n    Spinelli\n   </em>\n   , moreover, was put firmly to rest in\n   <em>\n    Doak\n   </em>\n   . There, the Court of Appeals wrote that\n   <em>\n    Spinelli\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    held\n   </em>\n   that federal court 'jurisdiction depended on the \"final disposition of [an administrative] complaint.\" ' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331882,6772339\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/1096/\">\n    798 F.3d at 1103-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Spinelli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2838800,3456101\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/446/159/\">\n    446 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   162 ). This Court is bound by that holding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am.

Applying that rule here, Williams withdrew her administrative complaint before the Postal Service had an opportunity to issue a final disposition, and thus this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the claim raised in that aborted administrative complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    December 15, 2015 Refusal to Permit Williams to Return to Work\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Williams's final claim alleges that the Postal Service refused to allow her to return to work on and after December 15, 2015, even though her doctor had lifted \"all restrictions\" on her ability to work. Dkt. 7 at 2 (Am. Compl. \u00b6 2). Because this claim did not arise until after Williams filed her December 3, 2015 EEO complaint, the Court can safely assume that it was not included in that complaint. Moreover, even if it was added by way of amendment-and there is no evidence that it was-it would face the same jurisdictional hurdle discussed above. Nor does the fact that Williams included the claim in her August 9, 2017 EEO complaint provide the Court with jurisdiction, at least with respect to her pending complaint. As explained above, the Court must have jurisdiction at the time the plaintiff brings suit, and a subsequently filed administrative complaint is insufficient to confer jurisdiction over a claim that was absent at the time suit was brought. In those circumstances, the plaintiff's remedy, if any, lies in exhausting her administrative rights and then commencing a new suit. Such a suit may face other exhaustion hurdles, but (presumably) not jurisdictional ones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court, accordingly, concludes that Williams failed to satisfy the jurisdictional exhaustion requirements before bringing suit on her December 15, 2015 claim and that, as a result, that claim must also be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's motion to dismiss, Dkt. 41, and will\n   <strong>\n    DISMISS\n   </strong>\n   this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   A separate Order will issue.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Because Williams is proceeding\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    , the Court has reviewed her various submissions, including attachments, for evidence or information that might support her claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Crawford v.

Williams brought this action on June 29, 2017,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 1, and, if a party has \"filed before the exhaustion requirement ... was satisfied,\" then \"th[e] jurisdictional defect cannot be cured by the filing of a[ ] [later] amended complaint.\"\n    <em>\n     Edwards v.

Second, even if the Court were to treat the operative date of this action as August 18, 2017, the date on which Williams filed her amended complaint, Williams still would not have exhausted her administrative remedies; she did not provide the agency with an opportunity to investigate or default on her claims, and, therefore, there was no \"final disposition\" or \"failure to take final action\" by the Postal Service prior to the time she filed her amended complaint. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(1) ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Doak\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331882,6772339\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/1096/\">\n     798 F.3d at 1103\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    At least one other decision from this Court has observed that\n    <em>\n     Spinelli\n    </em>\n    stands in some tension with the Supreme Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Arbaugh v.
