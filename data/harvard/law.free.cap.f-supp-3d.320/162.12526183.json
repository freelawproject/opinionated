COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On April 6, 2017, President Trump ordered a cruise missile strike on the Shayrat\n   military airfield in western Syria. Administration officials explained that the strike was a response to the chemical attack that had killed dozens of Syrian civilians three days earlier-one that, according to U.S. intelligence, had been directed by Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The day after the U.S. missile strike, a nonprofit called The Protect Democracy Project, Inc. submitted several requests under the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") seeking documents related to the President's legal authority to launch the strike. It filed these requests with the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and three components of the Department of Justice, including the Office of Legal Counsel. The agencies released some responsive documents but withheld fifteen documents in full. The withheld documents fall into three categories. The first includes three iterations of a legal memorandum produced by an interagency group of lawyers for the President's national security staff on the day the strike was ordered. The second is an outline drafted by attorneys in the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel to help the Office advise the Attorney General on the legal basis for the strike the day after it was launched. And the third includes several sets of talking points prepared to assist Executive Branch officials in answering questions from the press and from Congress. To justify withholding these documents, the agencies invoked several FOIA exemptions. Chief among them was Exemption 5, which shields from disclosure documents that would typically be privileged in civil discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541320\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/132/#p149\">\n    421 U.S. 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 149,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541320\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/132/#p149\">\n    95 S.Ct. 1504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541320\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/132/#p149\">\n    44 L.Ed.2d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Protect Democracy and the government now ask the Court to decide whether the documents were properly withheld under FOIA. For the most part, the Court finds the agencies' withholdings justified. The Court does, however, find that a small amount of information in several of the talking-point documents has already been officially acknowledged, and thus that the agencies may not withhold that information. It will therefore grant in part and deny in part each party's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 7, 2017, the day after the Shayrat airfield strike, Protect Democracy sent identical FOIA requests to the Department of State (\"State\"), the Department of Defense (\"DOD\"), and three components of the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\")-collectively, \"the agencies.\" The requests sought:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Any and all records [from April 4, 2017 through the present], including but not limited to emails and memoranda, reflecting, discussing, or otherwise relating to the April 6, 2017 military strike on Syria and/or the President's legal authority to launch such a strike. This request includes, but is not limited to, internal [agency] communications, communications between [agency] employees and the Executive Office of the President, and communications between [agency] employees and other agencies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Compl. Exs. A, C, E, G, I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Having received no responses to these requests a month after their submission, Protect Democracy brought this lawsuit alleging violations of FOIA. It also moved for a preliminary injunction that would compel the agencies to review its requests on an expedited basis. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 2. In July 2017, this Court granted that request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, ECF No. 15 (July 17, 2017). The parties worked to narrow the scope of Protect Democracy's requests and the agencies provided a final response in September 2017. Joint Status Report,\n   ECF No. 20, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3 (Sept. 15, 2017). The agencies released some documents in full, released redacted versions of others, and withheld fifteen outright. In redacting and withholding certain documents, the agencies invoked several of FOIA's exemptions-specifically, Exemptions 1, 5, 6, and 7. The parties then filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the question of whether the agencies properly withheld the fifteen documents. At this point, the crux of their dispute is whether the documents are protected under Exemption 5, which shields materials \"normally privileged in the civil discovery context.\"\n   <em>\n    Sears\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541320\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/132/#p149\">\n    421 U.S. at 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541320\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/132/#p149\">\n    95 S.Ct. 1504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After an initial review of the parties' filings, the Court concluded that it needed to\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   the talking points-documents 5 through 15 in the government's\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -before it could resolve an important aspect of the dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B) (authorizing the Court to \"examine the contents of [withheld] agency records in camera to determine whether such records or any part thereof shall be withheld\" under a FOIA exemption). Specifically, Protect Democracy contends that the government has waived any privileges applicable to the withheld documents by publicly acknowledging information contained in them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fitzgibbon v.

Cir. 1990) (\"[W]hen information has been 'officially acknowledged,' its disclosure may be compelled even over an agency's otherwise valid exemption claim.\"). With respect to documents 5 through 15, the Court found that Protect Democracy had cited public statements by Trump Administration officials sufficient to meet its \"initial burden of pointing to specific information in the public domain that appears to duplicate that being withheld.\" Order, ECF.

Yet the government's descriptions of the documents were not detailed enough for the Court \"to decide whether their information sufficiently overlaps with the public statements so as to satisfy the D.C.

On May 31, 2018, the Office of Legal Counsel (\"OLC\") publicly released a 22-page memorandum justifying the legality of a second set of missile strikes that President Trump directed against Syria on April 13, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Steven A.

Noting that little of the 2018 memorandum's analysis was \"particularized to the recent strike\" and that some of its reasoning \"closely align[ed] with the publicly stated rationale for the 2017 strike,\" the Court found it \"at least plausible that 'specific information in the public domain' (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the 2018 memorandum) duplicated 'that being withheld' (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the 2017 memorandum).\" Order, ECF No. 36, at 3-4 (June 5, 2018) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Afshar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3640642,1847947\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/702/1125/\">\n    702 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1130 ). The Court therefore ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs, with affidavits as necessary, addressing whether OLC's release of the 2018 memorandum constituted a waiver of any applicable privileges for purposes of Exemption 5.

In evaluating each motion, the Court must view the record in the light most favorable to the non-movant. The agency may satisfy its burden of showing that a FOIA exemption applies through an affidavit that \"describes the justifications for withholding the information with specific detail, demonstrates that the information withheld logically falls within the claimed exemption, and is not contradicted by contrary evidence in the record or by evidence of the agency's bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    ACLU v.

If not, then withholding is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The government contends that the legal memorandum is covered by three well-established privileges-those that protect presidential communications, attorney-client communications, and deliberative processes. Each of these privileges has been recognized as a basis for withholding documents under Exemption 5.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

For information to be \"officially acknowledged,\" \"(1) the information requested must be as specific as the information previously released; (2) the information requested must match the information previously disclosed; and (3) the information requested must already have been made public through an official and documented disclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    ACLU v.

At the outset, the structure of the NSC shows that its Legal Adviser is the sort of \"immediate White House adviser\" whose national security documents are subject to protection by the privilege. The NSC sits within the Executive Office of the President and, among its other goals, works to \"assess and appraise the objectives, commitments, and risks of the United States in relation to the actual and potential military power of the United States, and make recommendations thereon to the President.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203021\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).

So if the Legal Adviser were to solicit a document related to a national security decision being contemplated by the President, it would no doubt be protected by the presidential communications privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   It follows that opinions solicited by the\n   <em>\n    Deputy\n   </em>\n   NSC Legal Adviser are no less protected.

And based on the government's declarations, it is clear that the Deputy NSC Legal Adviser is the sort of staff member that the D.C. Circuit had in mind when setting the scope of the privilege.

It claims that, without more specific information on that front, the Court cannot be sure that the opinion was actually solicited to aid presidential decisionmaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   To be sure, the government's declarations provide little detail on the role of the legal opinion in the President's decision. A declaration from a State Department official simply states that the Deputy Legal Adviser solicited the opinion \"for the purpose of providing advice and recommendations to the President and other senior Executive Branch officials regarding the legal basis for potential military action.\" Suppl. Stein Decl. \u00b6 6. There is no indication that the President was briefed on the legal basis for the strike. But the government need not make a particularized showing about the role of a certain document in the President's decision. Rather, the very nature of the decision here-whether to attack a foreign nation-assures the Court \"that even if the President were not a party to the communications over which the government is asserting presidential privilege, these communications nonetheless are intimately connected to his presidential decisionmaking.\"\n   <em>\n    Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285176,3708318\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/729/\">\n    121 F.3d at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is because commanding the armed forces, like appointing and removing the officers at issue in\n   <em>\n    Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   , is \"a quintessential and nondelegable Presidential power.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285176,3708318\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/729/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 752 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court concludes that the legal memorandum (documents 1 through 3 in the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index) was properly withheld under FOIA Exemption 5 because it would routinely be covered by the presidential communications privilege. The OLC outline (document 4) was properly withheld under that exemption because it is protected by attorney-client privilege. As for the press guidance documents (documents 5 through 15), the Court finds that the documents were properly withheld as a general matter, but that certain of their contents have been disclosed to the public and thus must be released to Protect Democracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court will therefore grant in part and deny in part both parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. A separate order accompanies this memorandum opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    A \"\n    <em>\n     Vaughn\n    </em>\n    index\" is a document that summarizes the government's withholdings of documents responsive to a FOIA request.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Vaughn v. Rosen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3592114,238373\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/484/820/\">\n     484 F.2d 820\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (D.C. Cir. 1973).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The agencies initially also invoked Exemptions 1 and 3 in withholding the memorandum, claiming that it contained classified and statutorily protected information. But Protect Democracy has clarified that it seeks only portions of the document that provides legal analysis regarding the military strikes, and not any of its factual information. The Government concedes that this legal analysis is not protected under Exemptions 1 or 3, and that the information Protect Democracy seeks is segregable from the protected factual material in the memorandum. Thus, the sole remaining issue with the memorandum is whether information in the documents was properly withheld under Exemption 5.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    The official acknowledgement doctrine developed in cases involving different FOIA exemptions-namely, Exemptions 1 and 3, which relate to classified or otherwise sensitive information.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     ACLU v. DOD\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076968,3553786\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/628/612/\">\n     628 F.3d at 622\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Court is not aware of any cases in this Circuit applying the doctrine to overcome withholdings made under Exemption 5; rather, the courts that have evaluated the relationship between public disclosure and Exemption 5 have done so using the doctrine of\n    <em>\n     waiver\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Citizens for Responsibility &amp; Ethics in Wash. v. DOJ\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775232\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/658/217/#p236\">\n     658 F.Supp.2d 217\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 236-37 (D.D.C. 2009). But, at least in this case, the Court finds the analysis basically duplicative. Surely if the government publicly releases information that specifically matches information it has withheld pursuant to a privilege under Exemption 5, that release amounts to a waiver of privilege.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     N.Y. Times v. DOJ\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5898726\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/100/#p114\">\n     756 F.3d 100\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 114 (2d Cir. 2014) (\"Voluntary disclosures of all or part of a document may waive an otherwise valid FOIA exemption, and the attorney-client and deliberative privileges, in the context of Exemption 5, may be lost by disclosure.\" (citations omitted) ). And Protect Democracy's assertion of waiver mostly overlaps with its argument regarding official acknowledgment: it claims \"that the government's public statements in the wake of the strike ... waived privilege as to at least some of the material in either the memo and/or the talking points.\" Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 29.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    In its summary judgment motion and accompanying declarations, the government revealed only that \"staff' to the NSC Legal Adviser solicited the opinion.

But an allegation that the executive's decision was unlawful cannot render unprotected legal opinions he seeks in making that decision; legal opinions are most valuable in the face of legal indeterminacy. Rather, the relevant point for purposes of the privilege is that the President's decision here-whether lawful or not-could not be delegated to another executive branch official, and thus the opinion by definition spoke to \"governmental operations that ... call ultimately for direct decisionmaking by the President.\"\n    <em>\n     Sealed Case\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285176,3708318\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/729/\">\n     121 F.3d at 752\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Protect Democracy raises the same argument regarding official acknowledgement for the OLC outline as it did for the interagency legal memorandum.
