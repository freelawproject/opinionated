Two of the four members of the plaintiff LLC, acting on behalf of the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   , argue that because plaintiff has not used its mark in commerce in the United States, plaintiff has no common law trademark rights in the United States, and hence plaintiff cannot bring a claim under the ACPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The matter has been fully briefed and argued, and is now ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Of course, the entry of summary judgment is appropriate only where there are no genuine disputes of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

In 2012, Khorsev and Dubyna visited the United States to discuss starting a project similar to Klumba. The two met with some Americans and did some research to find out whether people knew or were familiar with the\n   word Klumba. That research disclosed that the mark Klumba had no meaning to American consumers who were interviewed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 The klumba.ua website has no English language content.

There have been 1.5 million page views of the klumba.ua website in the United States, but there is no evidence that any of those page views came from U.S. citizens.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 Plaintiff's primary source of revenue was from Google's AdSense program. According to statistics from Google AdSense, plaintiff received less than 1% of its revenue from advertisement generated from users accessing the klumba.ua website in the United States. In 2013, this U.S. revenue amounted to $880, compared to $147,000 in revenue from users accessing the klumba.ua website in Ukraine.

Plaintiff's business in this respect is \"the cyberspace analogue of renting out space on your land for a billboard\" because plaintiff sold advertisement space on plaintiff's website to Google.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3540290\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/788/#p820\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   It is of course undisputed that plaintiff sold space to Google, but that alone is insufficient to establish that plaintiff used the Klumba mark in United States commerce for as the Fourth Circuit has made clear, the fact that plaintiff provided a service to a U.S. citizen is not enough to establish common law trademark rights in the United States; instead, plaintiff must also show that the \"mark for that service [was] being used or displayed in the sale or advertising of that service.\"\n   <em>\n    Int'l Bancorp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9125090\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/329/359/#p363\">\n    329 F.3d at 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, in\n   <em>\n    Int'l Bancorp\n   </em>\n   , it was undisputed that plaintiff maintained an office in the U.S., advertised in the U.S., and hosted a promotional website for its services that could be accessed in the U.S.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9125090\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/329/359/#p363\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9125090\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/329/359/#p363\">\n    at 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Still, the Fourth Circuit held that these activities in the United States were insufficient to establish common law trademark rights because \"[t]he Lanham Act and the Supreme Court ...make clear that a mark's protection may not be based on 'mere advertising' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9125090\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/329/359/#p363\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9125090\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/329/359/#p363\">\n    at 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Just as in\n   <em>\n    Int'l Bancorp\n   </em>\n   , there is no evidence in this record showing that the Klumba mark was used in connection with the sale or even the advertising of plaintiff's \"service\" to Google. On this record, there is no evidence that Google knew of the Klumba mark, or that the mark was associated with the advertising space service Klumba provided. In fact, given that Google has a number of advertising partners whose websites vary widely in content there is no reason to believe that plaintiff's Klumba mark is\n   <em>\n    in any way\n   </em>\n   associated with the advertising space service provided to Google. The Klumba mark is not used to market plaintiff's services to Google; rather, plaintiff solicited Google for the code necessary to host Google's advertisements on its website as a means for plaintiff to monetize its user base. The Klumba mark is not used to brand plaintiff's advertising space services to Google because the mark is not used or displayed to Google in plaintiff's efforts to sell advertising space. There is simply no evidence in this record that the Klumba mark has any meaning for Google or that the Klumba mark was used as a means of attracting Google to purchase advertising space. And even if there were, a single transaction with a single U.S. company is not the kind of \"deliberate and continuous\" use of a mark necessary to establish common law trademark rights.\n   <em>\n    Larsen v.

Thus, the hosting of advertising space for Google on plaintiff's Ukrainian web page does not provide a sufficient\n   basis for concluding that plaintiff engaged in \"deliberate and continuous\" use of the mark in the United States necessary to establish common law trademark rights. Accordingly, plaintiff has failed to establish that it has used the Klumba mark in its transactions with Google in such a way as to give rise to common law trademark rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In sum, plaintiff does not use the Klumba mark in U.S. commerce within the meaning of the Lanham Act. Therefore, plaintiff cannot establish common law trademark rights in the United States. Although the Klumba mark is undoubtedly used in connection with plaintiff's children's clothing services, there is no record evidence showing that U.S. citizens utilized these clothing services. And although plaintiff has established that it has business ties with Google, it has not established that it uses the Klumba mark to brand its advertising space services or to market to Google. Because plaintiff has failed to establish that it has any common law trademark rights in the Klumba mark in the United States, plaintiff's ACPA claim fails and summary judgment in favor of defendant must be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant also argues that it should be awarded fees as the prevailing party.

Plaintiff cited controlling law, and appears to have made its argument in good faith.
