The patent at issue, owned by Altova, concerns an automatic fix feature for errors in XML coding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Syncro Soft has moved to disqualify its former law firm Sunstein Kann Murphy &amp; Timbers LLP (\"Sunstein\") from representing Altova, based on Sunstein's representation of Syncro Soft. The Court has stayed the proceedings pending resolution of the\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    partes\n   </em>\n   review of the patent at issue, but the parties have asked the Court to decide the motion to disqualify counsel at this time.

Docket No. 39 at 11, 13-14. The patent at issue is\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%209%2C501%2C456\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 9,501,456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '456 Patent\"), which is owned by Altova GmbH. Docket No. 12 \u00b6 8. The '456 Patent is entitled \"AUTOMATIC FIX FOR EXTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE ERRORS,\" and is directed to \"[m]ethods and apparatus, including computer program products, for an automatic fix for [XML] errors.\" '456 Patent, at [54], [57].

'456 Patent, at [22], [45].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The accused product is version 19.0 of Syncro Soft's OXYGEN XML Editor software, which includes a feature called \"Quick Fix.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 12 \u00b6 15. Altova alleges that the Quick Fix feature \"helps [users] resolve errors that appear in an XML document by offering\n   <em>\n    Quick Fixes\n   </em>\n   to problems such as missing required attributes or invalid elements.\" Docket No. 12 \u00b6 15. Altova maintains that, via the Quick Fix function, Syncro Soft directly and indirectly infringes at least Claim 1 of the '456 Patent.

Syncro Soft's 2004 Trademark Dispute with Oxygen Media LLC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In October 2004, Syncro Soft received a cease and desist letter from Oxygen Media LLC, which accused Syncro Soft's OXYGEN XML Editor software of trademark infringement and dilution. Docket No. 21 \u00b6 2. Syncro Soft sought legal counsel to respond to the cease and desist letter. Docket No. 21 \u00b6 2. Lee Carl Bromberg of Bromberg Sunstein LLP, the firm that would later become Sunstein, first agreed to represent Syncro Soft in connection with this matter in early November 2004. Docket No. 21-1 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The 2004 engagement letter specified that Syncro Soft was granting the law firm \"power of attorney to execute on [Syncro Soft's] behalf all documents relating to the matters for which [the firm has] been retained.\" Docket No. 21-1 at 2. The letter\n   also included a paragraph regarding possible future conflicts of interest. It read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Occasionally, because of ethical considerations, attorneys are required to withdraw from the representation of clients. While we do not anticipate having to withdraw from your representation, you should be aware that because our firm represents a large number of clients, there is always a possibility that a conflict of interest might develop which would force us to cease representing you. However, we would only do so upon reasonable notice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Docket No. 21-1 at 3. Stefan Vasile, Syncro Soft's Chief Executive Officer, executed the agreement on November 2, 2004. Docket No. 21-1 at 5. The dispute with Oxygen Media LLC was resolved to Syncro Soft's satisfaction through attorney correspondence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 21 \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Syncro Soft's 2009 Copyright and Trade Dress Dispute with Altova\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Then, in April 2009, Syncro Soft received another cease and desist letter -- this time, from Altova.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 21-2 at 2-4. The 2009 letter accused Syncro Soft of infringing on Altova's copyrights and misappropriating Altova's \"distinctive trade dress.\" Docket No. 21-2 at 3. Specifically, Altova claimed that version 10.1 of Syncro Soft's OXYGEN XML Editor software \"copied the look and feel of [Altova's] XMLSpy schema visualization and user interface.\" Docket No. 21-2 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Sunstein again represented Syncro Soft in its dispute with Altova. Docket No. 21 \u00b6 10. Throughout the representation, Vasile provided Sunstein attorney Joel Leeman with information about how OXYGEN XML Editor software functioned and hyperlinks to images and a video showing the product's operation on publicly available websites. Docket No. 21 \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Leeman and Altova's counsel exchanged correspondence related to Syncro Soft's software, and Altova demanded that Syncro Soft make changes to the OXYGEN XML Editor interface.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 21-5; Docket No. 21-7; Docket No. 21-9; Docket No. 21-11. Syncro Soft did, in fact, make some changes to its software in response to Altova's letters, releasing versions 10.2 and 10.3 of OXYGEN XML Editor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 21-5 at 3-4; Docket No. 21-9 at 7. The final letter Sunstein received from Altova's counsel with regard to this matter was dated June 25, 2009. Docket No. 21-11 at 2. The letter stated that Altova would \"review the new release of Oxygen 10.3 and continue to monitor this situation.\" Docket No. 21-11 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Syncro Soft's Trademark Registration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Sunstein also assisted Syncro Soft with its 2010 U.S. Trademark\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Registration%20No.%202%2C932%2C884\">\n    Registration No. 2,932,884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Docket No. 21 \u00b6 26. The firm continued to provide trademark maintenance assistance for Syncro Soft through 2014. Docket No. 28 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Sunstein Begins Representing Altova in 2011 in Trademark Matters\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In around October 2011, Sunstein began to represent Altova in trademark matters, which were not adverse to Syncro Soft. Altova had not yet filed its application that would become the '456 Patent. Docket No. 28 at 6. On behalf of Altova, Sunstein sued Embarcadero Technologies, Inc., in June 2012, asserting trademark infringement, unfair competition, disparagement, and copyright infringement claims. Docket No. 21 \u00b6 37. Sunstein did not inform Syncro Soft that it was representing Altova in an intellectual property dispute at that time. Docket No. 21 \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Conflict\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   From 2011 to 2017, Sunstein represented both Syncro Soft and Altova without incident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 28 at 7. Then, Altova approached Sunstein in late June 2017 regarding this patent dispute involving Syncro Soft. Docket No. 28 at 7. To attempt to avoid the conflict of interest, Sunstein terminated its relationship with Syncro Soft on July 6, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 28 at 8; Docket No. 21-13 at 2. The letter from attorney Leeman to Vasile stated that Sunstein \"encounter[s] potential conflicts in relation to other clients' work that [it] would like to undertake and that these other clients would like [it] to undertake.\" Docket No. 21-13 at 2. Leeman also wrote that Sunstein \"believe[s] it is inappropriate to require [its] existing or potential clients to retain separate counsel in any matter that might be adverse to Syncro Soft.\" Docket No. 21-13 at 2. The letter did not request Syncro Soft's consent to allow Sunstein to represent Altova in litigation against Syncro Soft.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 21-13 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Vasile responded to Leeman's letter on July 11, 2017. Docket No. 21 \u00b6 32. He wrote that he understood there to be \"a potential conflict of interest that might develop and matters that might be adverse to [the] company\" and expressed concern about \"these possible legal issues.\" Docket No. 21-15 at 26. Vasile also said that Syncro Soft was \"currently not aware of any such legal issues that could affect\" the company. Docket No. 21-15 at 26. Syncro Soft did not consent to Sunstein's representation of Altova in this matter. Docket No. 21 \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"[T]o avoid the potential or appearance of using confidential information to Syncro Soft's disadvantage,\" Sunstein erected an ethical wall so that three attorneys -- including Leeman -- would not have access to any of Syncro Soft's files. Docket No. 28 at 8. Sunstein then filed this action on Altova's behalf against its prior client Syncro Soft on August 31, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Which Rule of Professional Conduct Applies\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Syncro Soft argues that Sunstein should be disqualified because the firm violated Rule 1.7 of the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which governs conflicts of interest among current clients, by representing Altova in a matter adverse to Syncro Soft. Alternatively, if the Court finds that Syncro Soft was not Sunstein's then-current client, Syncro Soft asserts that Sunstein should still be disqualified pursuant to Rule 1.9, which lays out a lawyer's duties to former clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Altova disclosed its patent dispute with Syncro Soft to Sunstein in late June 2017, and terminated its relationship with Syncro Soft on July 6, 2017. Thus, Altova does not (and cannot) seriously dispute that Syncro Soft was Sunstein's \"current client\" at the time the conflict of interest arose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Markham Concepts, Inc. v.

Because the breach of the duty of loyalty is clear, this Court need not consider the hot potato doctrine to reach the conclusion that an attorney may not avoid the strict requirements of Rule 1.7 by simply dropping a present client to convert it into a former one. Such an interpretation of Rule 1.7 would render meaningless the duty of undivided loyalty a lawyer owes to current clients.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Markham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12181316\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/196/345/#p348\">\n    196 F.Supp.3d at 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It states: \"Syncro Soft faults Sunstein for not disclosing Altova's potential lawsuit to Syncro Soft, but Sunstein could not do so without violating its duty to Altova.\" Docket No. 28 at 11-12. As Sunstein acknowledges, it could not simultaneously uphold its duty of loyalty to Syncro Soft and its duty of confidentiality to Altova between late June and July 6, 2017, so it withdrew from representing Syncro Soft only. It points out that in the 13-year relationship, Sunstein had billed Syncro Soft for less than 50 hours of work. Still, although Syncro Soft was not a lucrative client, it had still been a client for a long time. Sunstein's course of action was not the appropriate one:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [W]here circumstances arise such that a\n   reasonable lawyer would believe that the actions required to provide competent representation of one client would render the client's interests adverse to those of another client of the lawyer, the proper course of action is to disclose the conflict and obtain the informed consent of both clients, or withdraw from representation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Bryan Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20N.E.3d%2095\">\n    52 N.E.3d at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   But Sunstein argues that its decision to withdraw from representing Syncro Soft is allowed under Comment 5 to Rule 1.7 because the conflict was unforeseeable. That comment acknowledges that \"[u]nforeseeable developments, such as changes in corporate and other organizational affiliations or the addition or realignment of parties in litigation, might create conflicts in the midst of a representation.\" Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.7 cmt. 5.

The companies were direct competitors who sold similar XML editor software products. Sunstein knew that Altova vigorously protected its intellectual property rights. In fact, Altova had previously sent Syncro Soft a cease and desist letter related to alleged copyright infringement involving this software. For these reasons, this patent dispute is not the type of unforeseeable development contemplated by Comment 5.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mass. R. Prof. C. 1.7 cmt. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   At the hearing, Sunstein argued that its 2004 engagement letter with Syncro Soft informed the client that the representation might have to be terminated. Docket No. 39 at 29. Specifically, the engagement letter stated \"there is always a possibility that a conflict of interest might develop which would force [Sunstein] to cease representing [Syncro Soft],\" but it also promised that Sunstein \"would only do so upon reasonable notice.\" Docket No. 21-1 at 3. Sunstein emailed Vasile out of the blue on July 6, 2017, terminating their relationship forthwith without discussion. Sunstein argues it gave \"reasonable notice\" with respect to the incoming patent suit, so it met its obligations under the engagement letter. I disagree. By undertaking continuing representation in the engagement letter, Sunstein owed Syncro Soft a duty of undivided loyalty during the representation. Sunstein cannot simply choose the more profitable client and drop the other.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \u00a7 132 cmt. c (2000);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20N.E.3d%20199\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 121 illus. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The question of whether disqualification is the appropriate remedy remains. \"Disqualification, as a prophylactic device for protecting the attorney-client relationship,\n   is a drastic measure which courts should hesitate to impose except when absolutely necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Erica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"369445\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/426/55/\">\n    426 Mass. 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=686%20N.E.2d%20967\">\n    686 N.E.2d 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 970 (Mass. 1997) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Freeman v.

Sunstein seeks a less drastic remedy. In\n   <em>\n    Markham\n   </em>\n   , the court suggested that \"where one existing firm client decided to sue another firm client,\" a conflict would be \"often beyond the control of the ... attorneys.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12181316\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/196/345/#p348\">\n    196 F.Supp.3d at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those particular circumstances \"warrant a more sympathetic analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12181316\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/196/345/#p348\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While the sympathetic analysis may apply when two unrelated clients engage in an unpredictable dispute, this altercation was foreseeable. Because Sunstein violated its duty of undivided loyalty to Syncro Soft in violation of Rule 1.7, the Court finds in its discretion that disqualification is appropriate in this litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bryan Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20N.E.3d%2095\">\n    52 N.E.3d at 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The motion to disqualify the Sunstein firm (Docket No. 20) from representing Altova in this patent litigation against Syncro Soft is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWED\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    In computing, XML is a language for encoding documents.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docket No. 39 at 14.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Attorneys practicing in this district must comply with the ethical requirements embodied in the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct.
