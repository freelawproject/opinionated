CHEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The instant action was initially filed in November 2012. The plaintiffs at that time included individuals as well as the Service Women's Action Network (\"SWAN\"). They challenged as unconstitutional \"the official policy of the Department of Defense ('DoD') that categorically excludes ... women[ ] from assignments to units whose primary mission is to engage in direct ground combat.\" Compl. \u00b6 1. In January 2013, the then-Secretary of Defense announced that that policy (which dated back to 1994) was rescinded \" 'effective immediately.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 3. In spite of the Defense Secretary's statement, exclusion appeared to continue. In December 2015, the DoD announced that there would be no exceptions to \" 'the full implementation of ... rescission.' \" SAC \u00b6 4. In proceedings before this Court, the government represented\n   that \"[t]he Military Services will use the same procedures that are currently used to select, assign, and train male service members.\" Docket No. 66 (Joint CMC St. at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Notwithstanding the above, there remains a dispute in the instant case because, as alleged by the now sole remaining plaintiff SWAN, there are two new policies in place regarding placement of women in combat positions, both of which are unconstitutional based on sex discrimination. Currently pending before the Court is the current Defense Secretary's motion to dismiss. The Secretary argues that: (1) venue is improper in this District; (2) the case raises issues that are not justiciable; and (3) SWAN lacks standing to sue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Having considered the parties' briefs and accompanying submissions, as well as the oral argument of counsel, the Court hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the Secretary's motion based on standing only. SWAN has leave to file an amended complaint to address its standing to bring this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the operative second amended complaint (\"SAC\"), SWAN challenges two policies that came about following the rescission of the policy that categorically excluded women from combat: (1) the \"Leaders First\" policy, which is used by both the Army and Marines; and (2) a Marines training policy that segregates trainees by gender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As alleged in the SAC, the Leaders First policy \"require[s] junior enlisted women to wait to enter combat battalions until two or more 'women leaders' join[ ] those battalions.\" SAC \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 26 (alleging that \"the Army decided that 'Leaders First' meant that two or more women officers or NCOs [noncommissioned officers], of any rank (not midgrade or senior women), needed to be assigned at the battalion level\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   junior enlisted women could be assigned to that battalion\") (emphasis in original). According to SWAN, for the Army, the result of the policy is that, \"in practice, brand new women infantry and armor second lieutenants are being assigned to just two brigades, one at Fort Bragg [in North Carolina] and one at Fort Hood [in Texas]. No other infantry or armor brigade has been opened to women.\" SAC \u00b6 27. SWAN also alleges that \"the problem is even more severe\" in the National Guard where \"only\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   states have met the 'Leaders First' requirement, Colorado and New Hampshire.\" SAC \u00b6 29 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As for the Marines training policy, it \"segregate[s] recruits who are entering into combat MOSs [military occupational specialties] along gender lines during their training for those positions. The Marines have, for example, an 'all-female Fourth Recruit Training Battalion.' \" SAC \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to SWAN, the above policies are based \"at least in part\" on the \"animus towards servicewomen on the part of the DoD and the Administration. Defendant Mattis, President Trump, and the President's close advisors have expressed extreme hostility towards Secretary Panetta's January 2013 announcement that women would be allowed to serve in some or all combat units.\" SAC \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As noted above, the Secretary makes three arguments in the pending motion to dismiss: (1) venue is improper in this District; (2) the case raises issues that are not justiciable; and (3) SWAN lacks standing to sue. Each argument is addressed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Venue\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Venue in the instant case is governed by subsection (e) of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

One district court has even suggested that, in some cases, the place of impact is more important than the place of decisionmaking for purposes of \u00a7 1391 : \"In a case brought on First Amendment grounds, impact becomes the most important part of the case\" and \"[m]inimizing the impact of the statute, compared to its adoption or administration, would marginalize the Plaintiff's substantive First Amendment claims under the guise of a venue statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Kalman v.

With respect to the Leaders First policy as used by the Army, SWAN has shown that a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to its claims occurred in this District. First, the Army has several bases\n   in this District; second, the policy has been implemented at those bases; and, third, the effect of the policy is that there are combat units in the District which are not yet integrated as a result of the challenged policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the very least, there was no integration in this District at the time SWAN filed its SAC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Da Cruz v.

Nevertheless, as SWAN points out, under the pendent venue doctrine, when one or more claims are closely related (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , arise out of a common nucleus of operative facts), venue is proper as to all claims so long as venue is established for just one claim.

In assessing justiciability of a challenge to a military decision, the Ninth Circuit has expressly embraced the Fifth Circuit's approach in\n   <em>\n    Mindes v. Seaman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"749889\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/453/197/\">\n    453 F.2d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 1971).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wenger v.

These factors include:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (1) The nature and strength of the plaintiff's claim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (2) The potential injury to the plaintiff if review is refused;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (3) The extent of interference with military functions; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (4) The extent to which military discretion or expertise is involved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Threshold\n    <em>\n     Mindes\n    </em>\n    Elements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Under the\n   <em>\n    Mindes\n   </em>\n   test, a court must first consider two threshold elements: whether a federal right is allegedly violated and whether there has been an exhaustion of intraservice remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In the instant case, there is no dispute that the first threshold element has been satisfied: SWAN alleges a violation of a recognized constitutional right not to be discriminated against on the basis of gender. However, the Secretary argues that the second threshold element-exhaustion of intraservice remedies-has not been met.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 12. The Court does not agree for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   First, SWAN is an organization, not a service member, and so it has no intraservice remedies available to it to exhaust.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Christoffersen v. Wash. State Air Nat'l Guard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536805\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/855/1437/#p1441\">\n    855 F.2d 1437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1441-42 (9th Cir. 1988) (acknowledging that the absence of an intraservice remedy does not preclude application of the\n   <em>\n    Mindes\n   </em>\n   test, but assuming exhaustion of all available remedies given that the Records Board could not provide effective relief).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Second, the purpose underlying the exhaustion requirement has been met in the instant case. The point of exhaustion is to give the military the opportunity to resolve the dispute in the first instance, thus obviating the need for litigation. But the Secretary has already been given that opportunity. This lawsuit began because of the blanket exclusion of women from combat units; the case was then essentially put on hold because of the government's decision to rescind that policy; and, although that policy has now been formally rescinded, the policies that have replaced it have still (at least allegedly) resulted in exclusion of women from combat units. The decision of\n   the Army and Marines was the result of a lengthy process and took place while this litigation was pending. The views of Plaintiffs have been known to the Army and the Marines throughout their deliberative processes. Hence, the purpose of exhaustion has been satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Because both\n   <em>\n    Mindes\n   </em>\n   threshold elements have been satisfied, the Court may now consider the four \"substantive\"\n   <em>\n    Mindes\n   </em>\n   factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wenger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9475416\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/282/1068/#p1072\">\n    282 F.3d at 1073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    First\n    <em>\n     Mindes\n    </em>\n    Factor\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The first\n   <em>\n    Mindes\n   </em>\n   factor calls upon a court to evaluate the nature and strength of the plaintiff's claim. These are two different considerations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   With respect to the nature of a plaintiff's claim, the\n   <em>\n    Mindes\n   </em>\n   court underscored that constitutional claims are \"normally more important than those having only a statutory or regulatory base\"; however, even constitutional claims \"are themselves unequal in the whole scale of values - compare haircut regulation questions to those arising in court-martial situations which raise issues of personal liberty.\"\n   <em>\n    Mindes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"749889\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/453/197/\">\n    453 F.2d at 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the instant case, the Secretary has not addressed the nature of SWAN's claim, focusing instead on the strength of the claim only.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 12. That is problematic. The nature of the claim asserted by SWAN is important: SWAN is asserting a constitutional claim, not a statutory or regulatory one, and the constitutional claim implicates significant values. At stake is not,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , a haircut regulation, but a policy that impedes the ability of women to serve in the military. At issue is an explicit gender-based policy that normally is subject to heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment as against the federal government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As for the strength of SWAN's claim, the Secretary does not make any argument that the constitutional challenge fails on the merits under heightened scrutiny.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the Secretary simply argues that SWAN's claim is weak because SWAN \"does not show that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   service member has been denied a combat billet due to the 'Leaders First' policy or the policy that govern Marine Corps Recruit Training.\" Mot. at 12 (emphasis in original). But this argument mischaracterizes SWAN's operative complaint. For example, as reflected in \u00b6 27 of the SAC, SWAN has a problem with the Leaders First policy because, with respect to the Army, \"in practice, brand new women infantry and armor second lieutenants are being assigned to just two brigades one at Fort Bragg and one at Fort Hood. No other infantry or armor brigade has been opened to women.\" SAC \u00b6 27. Furthermore, SWAN alleges that there is further injury to service women because \"the Army [has] ended up with more women infantry and armor officers than anticipated, so that today, there is a surplus of these new officers at the designated brigades [in Fort Bragg and Fort Hood], also effectively\n   <em>\n    segregating\n   </em>\n   them from the rest of the Army.\" SAC \u00b6 27 (emphasis omitted and added). SWAN is also critical of the Marines training policy because it segregates expressly on the basis of sex.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The first\n   <em>\n    Mindes\n   </em>\n   factor therefore weighs in favor of judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Second\n    <em>\n     Mindes\n    </em>\n    Factor\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The second\n   <em>\n    Mindes\n   </em>\n   factor is the potential injury to the plaintiff if judicial review is refused. As an initial matter, it is not clear whether the Court's inquiry here should be limited to injury to SWAN only, or whether it may also consider injury to service women. The Court need not decide that legal issue because the Secretary proceeds with the assumption that the Court should consider injury to service women (in fact, ignores any injury to SWAN itself).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 12 (arguing that the first two\n   <em>\n    Mindes\n   </em>\n   factors weigh against SWAN because it \"does not show that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   service member has been denied a combat billet\" due to the challenged policies) (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   So framed, the potential injury to service women is significant-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , being denied assignment to any brigades outside of Fort Bragg and Fort Hood (for the Army) and being subject to segregation on the basis of sex (both Army and Marines). And even if the Court were confined to consideration of only SWAN's injury, that injury is not insignificant. As discussed in Part II.C below (addressing standing), DoD's policies appear to have had an economic impact on SWAN, and the Ninth Circuit has recognized that an economic injury is enough to establish an injury for purposes of the second\n   <em>\n    Mindes\n   </em>\n   factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Christoffersen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536805\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/855/1437/#p1441\">\n    855 F.2d at 1444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"[t]he potential injury to [plaintiffs who were not selected for retention in the Air Force National Guard] is primarily economic\"-a loss of military and civilian employment and eligibility for civil service retirement benefits; ultimately concluding that the second\n   <em>\n    Mindes\n   </em>\n   factor weighed in plaintiffs' favor).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Third and Fourth\n    <em>\n     Mindes\n    </em>\n    Factors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \"The third and fourth\n   <em>\n    Mindes\n   </em>\n   factors, 'the extent of interference with military functions' and 'the extent to which military discretion or expertise is involved,' are generally considered together.\"\n   <em>\n    Wenger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9475416\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/282/1068/#p1072\">\n    282 F.3d at 1075\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The case at bar falls under neither of those extremes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The relief sought here would not require the Court to exercise continuing comprehensive regulatory supervision over a wide range of military decisions. Instead, SWAN is asking that two discrete policies be held unconstitutional and thereby enjoined, and that the Army and Marines conform with the policies and practice of other branches of the military which have drawn no similar gender-based distinctions. Nor do Plaintiffs challenge discrete, individualized personnel decisions based on a multitude of personnel-type judgments of many. Rather, SWAN is contesting two\n   broadly applicable facial policies that have been adopted by the Army and the Marines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Secretary contends that the latter fact means judicial review of the instant case should involve even more interference. According to the Secretary, \"[t]he impact of judicial review on the military if an organization was allowed to challenge 240,000 military assignment decisions dramatically magnifies those concerns\" present with only a single service member's challenge.

Because of the current segregation policy and practice, SWAN has had to divert its resources to address the inequities, uncertainties and harms to the military caused by the DoD's segregation policies and practices. SWAN regularly fields complaints from junior enlisted women and from women \"leaders\" in the Army and Army National Guard concerning the effect of \"Leaders First\" on their accession and advancement opportunities, and on their relationships with their male colleagues and superior officers. SWAN also expends resources responding to reports of disadvantages faced by female Marines entering combat MOSs and the rates of sexual harassment and assault that they experience, stemming in part from the stigma imparted by their segregation from male colleagues at basic training.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   15. The DoD's decision to rescind its 1994 directive excluding women from assignment to ground combat units has not reduced the work SWAN must do to combat the ill effects of the DoD's ongoing exclusion and segregation of servicewomen.
