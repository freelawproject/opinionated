Shea, District Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs Anthem Sports, LLC (\"Anthem\"), and Griffin Global Products, LLC, bring this suit against Under the Weather, LLC (\"UTW\"), and Eric Pescovitz, its principal, for various intellectual property and other claims arising from the marketing and sale of \"sportspods,\" i.e., small tents for viewing outdoor sporting events during inclement weather. The plaintiffs set out eight counts in their amended complaint: (i) a request for a declaratory judgment of non-infringement with regard to various patents owned by UTW (count one); (ii) a request for a declaratory judgment of invalidity with respect to various patents owned by UTW (count two); (iii) a request for a declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity with respect to a trademark asserted by UTW (count three); (iv) various violations of the Lanham Act (count four); (v) common law trademark infringement (count five); (vi) tortious interference with business expectancies (count six); (vii) violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"CUTPA\") (count seven); and (viii) common law unfair competition (count eight). The defendants move to dismiss all of the plaintiffs' counts save for the third. (ECF No. 41-1 at 2). For the following reasons,\n   the defendants' motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiffs make the following factual allegations in their amended complaint, which I assume to be true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Anthem is \"a family-owned business and premier nationwide distributor of brand name sporting goods and equipment\" that \"primarily does business online through its website, through company catalogs, and [through] significant advertising and marketing efforts through its social media accounts.\" (ECF No. 38 at \u00b6 2). UTW is an Ohio company in possession of various patents\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Patents-in-Suit\") that \"purport to claim certain rights in designs for personal enclosures that protect the user from weather while watching sporting events ('UTW Personal Enclosure[s]').\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 10). When UTW \"first began selling the UTW Personal Enclosures, [it] was unable to garner significant interest in the market and struggled to make appreciable sales.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11). Around the fall of 2014, \"Anthem became aware of the UTW Personal enclosures and approached UTW to establish an exclusive online distribution relationship.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12) Through \"Anthem's extensive efforts in early 2015, ... the UTW Personal Enclosures gained traction in the marketplace and became commercially successful....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). At this point, \"UTW and Anthem entered into an agreement in Connecticut whereby Anthem would be the exclusive online distributor of UTW Personal Enclosures other than UTW, who would continue to sell UTW Personal Enclosures online.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14). The parties discussed forming a partnership, but these discussions dissipated after UTW declined to respond to Anthem's proposed \"partnership term outline.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The parties' relationship collapsed shortly thereafter. UTW \"raised the prices for the UTW Personal Enclosures sold to Anthem\" to the point where Anthem could no longer afford to purchase and sell them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16). UTW then began selling the enclosures \"to major sporting goods retailer DICK's Sporting Goods, [which] in turn\" offered them for sale online. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17). Anthem subsequently located a different manufacturer and \"began offering all weather personal enclosure products under the trade names UnderCover\u2122 and SportPod\u2122, including SoloPod\u2122, Action Pod\u2122, TeamPod\u2122, and BugPod\u2122 (collectively, the 'Anthem Pods')\"; Anthem ensured that none of these products \"infringe[d] any valid or enforceable claim of the Patents-in-Suit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18). Subsequent to \"Anthem's adoption and use of the trademark SportPod\u2122,\" UTW began using \"the mark 'Sportspod' to refer to multiple goods\" that it offered for sale. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19). \"Anthem did not authorize UTW to use its SportPod\u2122 mark, and the 'SportsPod' mark is confusingly similar and likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception as to the source of UTW's goods, and is likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception as to whether UTW's products are associated, affiliated, or connected with or approved or sponsored by Anthem.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Despite Anthem's precautions concerning the Patents-in-Suit, UTW subsequently demonstrated \"that it believes [that] Anthem ... is allegedly infringing upon\n   UTW's rights in the Patents-in-Suit....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22). \"On or about April 7, 2017, one of UTW's principals left a voicemail for one of Anthem's principles\" stating as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Hey Mark, it's Rick; just got an email from Anthem with your new products. I shouldn't sound surprised, I assume that's how you work. I just [sic] letting you know, and you can tell your friend Shanghai Eversuccess as well, they will be sued as well as you, I have the patent on that design, so, and if you think I'm kidding, there will be a lawsuit for you next week. Just letting you know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22-23). UTW has also \"made threats against Anthem, its supposed supplier, and customers that the Anthem Pods allegedly infringe one or more claims of the Patents-in-Suit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26). Further, UTW \"recently sued another personal enclosure product supplier ... for infringement of four of the Patents-in-Suit ... in the Southern District of Ohio.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   UTW has also waged a campaign against Anthem's products on Facebook.com. \"On numerous occasions and without justification, [Defendant] Pescovitz, UTW, or its representatives have responded to customer comments indicating a desire to purchase Anthem Pods\" on Anthem's web page on Facebook.com with the following comments: (i) that the \"only place to get [Anthem Pods] is undertheweatherpod.com,\"; (ii) that the Anthem Pods \"are illegal knockoffs and very poor quality,\" and that the \"legal ones are only available at undertheweatherpods.com\"; and (iii) that the Anthem Pods were \"[Pescovitz's] idea and patent\"; (iv) and that the Anthem Pods are \"complete knock offs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Patent Claims (Counts One and Two)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendants make two arguments with respect to the plaintiffs' patent claims. First, they contend that there is no actual case or controversy for the purposes of the Declaratory Judgment Act with respect to four newly issued UTW patents first mentioned in the plaintiffs' operative amended complaint-the '023 Patent, the '024 Patent, the '025 Patent, and the '26 Patent (\"new patents\"). (ECF No. 41-1 at 5). Second, they aver that the plaintiffs' second count requesting a declaratory judgment of invalidity as to the Patents-in-Suit fails to set out a plausible claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8). I address each of these contentions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

According to the plaintiffs' complaint, all of the Patents-in-Suit pertain to designs for \"personal enclosures that protect the user from weather while watching sporting events.\" (ECF No. 38 at \u00b6 10). Further, a principal of UTW has threatened to sue Anthem over, at the very least, more than one of the Patents-in-Suit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23). It is also apparent from the attachments to the complaint that the dispute between the parties involves the right to market and sell a single type of product-small tents or pods designed for viewing sporting events. The newly issued patents pertain to the same type of product. Thus, given the general threats of litigation defendants have allegedly already made, the plaintiffs have a justifiable concern that the defendants could bring suit for infringement of the new patents, along with the other Patents-in-Suit. This is enough to create an actual case or controversy concerning the new patents at this stage of the litigation, and it also shows that a declaratory judgment would offer relief from uncertainty and serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal issues involved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Banff, Ltd. v.

The plaintiff grounded his claim on several Wall Street Journal articles suggesting that the defendant would bring potential infringement suits against \"generic omeprazole manufacturers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. While the\n   <em>\n    Dr. Reddy's\n   </em>\n   court acknowledged that \"two of the three patents upon which [the plaintiff sought] a declaratory judgment had not yet been issued\" at the time of the publication of the articles, it nonetheless concluded that a case or controversy existed with respect to the newly issued patents given the defendant's broad threat against omeprazole manufacturers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8-9.

The Federal Rules expressly contemplate updating pleadings to take account of actionable events occurring after the original complaint is filed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ.

The plaintiffs advance three distinct claims under the Lanham Act in count four. First, the plaintiffs advance a \"false designation of origin\" claim with regard to Mr. Pescovitz's comments on Anthem's Facebook.com web page (\"Facebook page\") allegedly implying \"that the Anthem Pods are only available for purchase from UTW and that the Anthem Pods were UTW and/or Mr. Pescovitz's idea.\" (ECF No. 38 at \u00b6 56). Second, the plaintiffs advance a \"false advertising claim\" with respect to Mr. Pescovitz's comments on Anthem's Facebook page alleging that the Anthem Pods are \"knockoffs of very poor or inferior quality.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57). Finally, the plaintiffs advance a \"trademark infringement claim\" concerning UTW's adoption and use of the mark \"SportsPod\" in light of Anthem's prior trademark, \"SportPod\u2122.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58). The defendants attack all three of these claims in their motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    1. False Designation of Origin Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   A false designation of origin claim under the Lanham Act generally applies to three types of activities: \"(1) false advertising;\" \"(2) passing off' (also called palming off) in which A sells its product under B's name;\" and (3) \"reverse passing off, in which A sells B's product under A's name.\"\n   <em>\n    Waldman Pub.

Although the plaintiffs' complaint is somewhat unclear as to which category its false designation of origin claims falls into, the plaintiffs' response to the defendants' motion to dismiss suggests that they wish to bring a reverse passing off claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 46 at 19 (\"Simply put, UTW is trying to sell the Anthem Pods as its own, using the UTW trademark and website address to direct consumers.\") ). To prevail on a reverse passing off claim, a plaintiff must establish: \"(1) that the [product] at issue originated with the plaintiff; (2) that [the] origin of the [product] was falsely designated by the defendant; (3) that the\n   false designation of origin was likely to cause consumer confusion; and (4) that the plaintiff was harmed by the defendant's false designation of origin.\"\n   <em>\n    Softel, Inc. v.

As an initial matter, the plaintiffs' claim that Mr. Pescovitz misrepresented himself as the inventor of the Anthem Pods is a nonstarter as the Lanham Act applies to misrepresentations concerning the \"origin of goods,\" not ideas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dastar Corp. v.

The remarks in question, which were made on Anthem's Facebook Page and which the plaintiffs include as attachments to their complaint (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 38, Exhibit F), do not actually hold out UTW as the origin of the Anthem Pods. Rather, the majority of Mr. Pescovitz's comments state that the Anthem Pods are \"knockoffs\" or of \"inferior quality,\" and that the only place to get legal \"pods\" is from UTW's website. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 38, Exhibit F at 3) (\"You saw undertheweatherpods.com the ones you see here are patent infringing knockoffs\"), 4 (\"these are illegal knockoffs-only place to get them is undertheweatherpods.com\"), 6 (\"[t]hese are illegal knockoffs and very poor quality. The legal ones are only available at undertheweatherpods.com\"), 8 (\"these are illegal knockoffs-only place to purchase is underthweatherpods.com\"). Especially when considered together, these comments cannot plausibly be interpreted to suggest that UTW sells Anthem Pods. Rather, they imply that Anthem sells inferior and illegal copies of UTW's pods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The only comment mentioned in the plaintiffs' complaint that could possibly be construed as conflating UTW with Anthem instructs a commenter on Anthem's Facebook page as follows: \"[Commenter name] only [p]lace to get them is undertheweatherpods.com (patent holder and inventor).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). The context in which this comment was made, however, does not suggest that UTW is the manufacturer of Anthem Pods. Rather, Mr. Pescovitz's identification of himself as the \"patent holder and inventor\" implies that the Anthem Pods are being illicitly marketed, and that the only place to purchase a legal pod is UTW's website. Also, the comment in question-which, as noted, is set forth on Anthem's Facebook page-includes a hyperlink to UTW's website which clearly states \"Under the Weather Pods\" and contains UTW's logo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Thus, at best, Mr. Pescovitz's comment presents the consumer with an alternative to the Anthem Pods, as opposed to holding out UTW as the producer of the Anthem pods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FragranceNet.com, Inc. v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 38 at \u00b6 25). All of Mr. Pescovitz's statements in Exhibit F that use \"knockoff\" pair that term with \"illegal\" or \"patent infringing.\" (See ECF No. 38, Exhibit F at 3) (\"You saw undertheweatherpods.com the ones you see here are patent infringing knockoffs\"), 4 (\"these are illegal knockoffs-only place to get them is undertheweatherpods.com\"), 6 (\"[t]hese are illegal knockoffs and very poor quality.

Mr. Pescovitz's assertion that the Anthem Pods were unlicensed or unauthorized copies, and \"illegal\" or \"patent infringing\" ones at that, is ultimately his lay opinion about the finding this Court or some other court might make about infringement when the issue is litigated.

The plaintiffs' tortious interference claim avers that the defendants have interfered with Anthem's business relationships with customers through Mr. Pescovitz's Facebook comments disparaging the Anthem Pods. (ECF No. 38 at \u00b6\u00b6 66-69).

The plaintiffs' complaint notes that various potential customers have expressed interest in purchasing Anthem Pods on Anthem's Facebook page. (ECF No. 38 at \u00b6 66). Further, Exhibit F of the plaintiffs' complaint demonstrates that the majority of Mr. Pescovitz's comments were aimed at customers who had expressed enthusiasm for Anthem's products.

(ECF No. 38 at \u00b6\u00b6 72-74). The defendants assail all three of these alleged bases. (ECF No. 41-1 at 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As an initial matter, the plaintiffs' trademark infringement claim sets out a viable CUTPA claim inasmuch as it states a viable claim under the Lanham Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pfizer, Inc. v.

As a result, I conclude that his statements do not support CUTPA liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The plaintiffs' allegations concerning UTW's alleged false promises to Anthem presents a closer question. The defendants contend that these allegations are insufficiently pled and, even if accepted, establish little more than a breach of contract, which \"is not sufficient to establish a violation of CUTPA.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 47 at 10 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Boulevard Assocs. v.

Conn. 2004). Here, the plaintiffs allege sufficient aggravating circumstances to set out a cognizable CUTPA claim. The plaintiffs' complaint recounts that UTW not only violated its contract with Anthem, but then proceeded to make baseless infringement threats against Anthem when the company attempted to sell its own products in lieu of those from UTW. The plaintiffs' trademark infringement allegations also constitute aggravating circumstances. Thus, when the plaintiffs' breach of contract allegations are combined with the other circumstances of this case, they give rise to a cognizable CUTPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The plaintiffs' CUTPA claim may therefore move forward with respect to UTW's alleged breach of contract and trademark infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

Beyond this, the extent of common law unfair competition under Connecticut law is somewhat unclear. Nonetheless, the exact extent of the plaintiffs' claim is of little moment here, as the defendants' sole argument to dismiss the claim is that it is coextensive with the tortious interference with business expectancies claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 41-1 at 21). Given my resolution of the latter claim, the defendants' argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   I therefore deny the defendants' motion to dismiss with regard to the plaintiff's common law unfair competition claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Instead, they argue only that \"like the CUTPA and Lanham Act claims, [the plaintiffs' tortious interference] claim[ ] fail[s] because [it] rel[ies] on nonactionable opinion or puffery.\" (ECF No. 41-1 at 21). This conclusory assertion does not justify the dismissal of the plaintiffs' tortious interference claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
