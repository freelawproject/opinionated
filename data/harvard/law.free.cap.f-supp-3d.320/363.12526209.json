Introduction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case is one of many, look-alike lawsuits filed nationwide by current and former members of faculty and staff of private (mainly elite) universities in which it is alleged that the universities imprudently managed retirement accounts to the detriment of their employee-plan participants. Plaintiffs Diane G. Short, Samira Pardanani, Judith Daviau, and Joseph Barboza (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"), eligible faculty and staff at Defendant Brown University (\"Brown\" or \"Defendant\"), and vested participants in one of Brown's two retirement plans, sue individually and as representatives of a class of participants and beneficiaries of the Brown University Deferred Vesting Retirement Plan (\"Deferred Vesting Plan\") and the Brown University Legacy Retirement Plan (\"Legacy Plan\") (collectively, \"Plans\"). Plaintiffs suggest they were short-changed by Brown in saving for their retirement. More precisely, Plaintiffs allege that Brown, as the Plans' named fiduciary and plan administrator, has breached its duties of prudence and loyalty contra to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1461. Brown moves to dismiss (ECF No. 21), suggesting Plaintiffs have not overcome the pleading standard of Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For the below reasons,\n   Brown's Motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   II. Background\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs, plan-participants, bring this action, individually and on behalf of a class of participants and beneficiaries of the Plans, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) and (3). (Compl. \u00b6 1, ECF No. 1.) Brown's Plans are defined contribution, individual account, employee pension benefits plans, defined under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A) and \u00a7 1002(34). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) The Plans, under which eligible faculty and staff members at Brown may participate, provide the principal source of retirement income for Brown's employees and are premised on deferrals of employee compensation and employer matching contributions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   With assets above $1 billion as of December 31, 2015, the Legacy Plan constitutes a \"Mega\" plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.) That Plan had 6,325 participants as of December 31, 2014, and a year later it had 4,535 participants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) With more than $244 million in assets as of December 31, 2015, 8,054 participants as of December 31, 2014, and 9,594 participants one year later, the Deferred Vesting Plan qualifies as a \"Large\" plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.) Brown, as the \"Plan Administrator under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (16)(A)(i),\" and a named fiduciary pursuant to section 402(a)(1) of ERISA, \"is responsible for day-to-day plan operations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Specifically, as Plan Administrator, Brown:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   is vested with exclusive and complete responsibility and discretionary authority to control the operation, management and administration of the Plans, with all powers necessary to enable it properly to carry out such responsibilities, including the selection and compensation of the providers of administrative services to the Plans and the selection, monitoring, and removal of the investment options made available to participants for the investment of their contributions and provision of their retirement income.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) For similar reasons, Brown is a fiduciary to the Plans because it maintains discretionary authority and/or control with respect to the Plans' management, management and disposition of Plan assets, and discretionary authority or responsibility in the Plans' administration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Brown's Plans are known as 403(b) retirement plans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Brown failed to fulfill its fiduciary duties pursuant to ERISA. For example, according to Plaintiffs, on or before December 31, 2014, the Legacy Plan \"offered a bewildering array of 175 investment options through Fidelity Investments and offered an additional 24 investment options through TIAA-CREF, which included numerous duplicative investment choices (e.g., 9 target retirement date funds offered by Fidelity Investments and 9 target retirement date funds offered by TIAA CREF).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7(a).) As of December 31, 2015, the Legacy Plan offered 35 investment options through TIAA-CREF and 26 through Fidelity Investments; those options continued to include duplicative investment choices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7(b).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On or before December 31, 2014, similarly, the Deferred Vesting Plan \"offered a bewildering array of 177 investment options through Fidelity Investments and offered an additional 26 investment options through TIAA-CREF.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7(c).) As of that date, the Deferred Vesting Plan also included many duplicative investment choices \"and dozens of highly specialized funds that lack diversification and inappropriate for inclusion in a menu of investment choices in a participant-directed individual account plan.\" (Id.) As of December 31, 2015, at least 35 investment options were offered through TIAA-CREF whereas Fidelity Investments offered at least 26, which included duplicative choices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7(d).) Specifically, both Plans offered the TIAA Traditional Annuity, \"a fixed annuity contract that returns a contractually specified minimum interest rate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) The Plans also offered \"variable annuities that invest in underlying securities for a given investment style,\" including the \"CREF Stock Account, CREF Money Market Account, CREF Inflation-Linked Bond Account, CREF Social Choice Account, CREF Bond Market Account, CREF Global Equities Account, CREF Growth Account, and CREF Equity Index Account.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) These annuities' value fluctuated based on investment performance and the accounts' expenses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Similarly offered was the TIAA Real Estate Account, a TIAA-CREF maintained, insurance company separate account, i.e., \"an investment vehicle that aggregates assets from more than one retirement plan for a given investment strategy, but those assets are segregated from the insurance company's general account assets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) What remains for the Plans' investment options are various TIAA-CREF mutual funds, which \"charge varying amounts for investment management, but also charge distribution, marketing, and other expenses, depending on the type of investment and share class.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   III.

Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the outset, because Plaintiffs expressly concede that Counts III and IV do not survive Brown's Motion for lack of standing, the Court dismisses those Counts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss (\"Pls.' Opp'n\") 1 n.2 (\"Plaintiffs do not oppose dismissal of Counts III and IV ... as Plaintiffs were not borrowers under this loan program.\") ). The Court's discussion is therefore limited to Counts I and II.

Duty of Loyalty\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As an initial matter, Plaintiffs, for at least two reasons,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   fail to state a claim that Brown breached its duty of loyalty. First, Plaintiffs' Complaint is bereft of sufficient factual allegations to state a claim for breach of the duty of loyalty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And all other allegations with respect to the duty of loyalty merely \"piggy back\" on Plaintiffs' duty-of-prudence allegations, which is not sufficient to state a claim for the duty of loyalty. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 48, 59, 100, 110-28.);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cassell v.

Sept. 29, 2017) (\"Because these claims do not support an inference that defendants' actions were\n   <em>\n    for the purpose\n   </em>\n   of providing benefits to themselves or someone else and did not simply have that incidental effect, the loyalty claims ... are dismissed.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   B. Duty of Prudence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   1. Count I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In Count I, Plaintiffs suggest that Brown did not engage in a prudent process for evaluating and monitoring fees and expenses that TIAA and Fidelity charged to the Plans in breach of its duty of prudence under ERISA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 110-16.) In support, Plaintiffs fault Brown for: (1) offering too many investment options, including duplicative options, rather than a\n   \"core\" lineup (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-28, 49-50, 121); (2) using more than one record-keeper (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-48); (3) failing to employ a competitive bidding process with respect to record-keeping (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-38, 48); (4) offering investment options that charged \"multiple layers of expense charges\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-33); and (5) offering investment options that charged asset-based fees and used revenue sharing, instead of a per-participant rate (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 39, 51-53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Like Plaintiffs' duty-of-loyalty claims, Plaintiffs neglect to rebut certain of Brown's arguments with respect to the duty-of-prudence claims. And for that reason, those particular theories must fall away. First, by offering not one word in response to Brown's Motion with respect to their allegations that the Plans offered investments with multiple layers of fees, Plaintiffs waive this aspect of their imprudence claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tower v. Leslie-Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312297\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/290/#p299\">\n    326 F.3d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 299 (1st Cir. 2003) (\"[F]ailure to brief an argument does, in fact, constitute waiver....\"). Likewise, Plaintiffs fail to respond and therefore abandon their claim that it was imprudent for Brown to use asset-based fees and revenue sharing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312297\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/290/#p299\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Another aspect of Plaintiffs' imprudence claim that falls away - albeit for different reasons - is the allegation that Brown was imprudent in offering a surplus of investment options and failing to feature a set of \"core\" investment options. Plaintiffs fail to state a claim in this respect. Brown is correct that courts have repeatedly rejected, as a matter of law, identical claims in factually analogous cases, and ERISA does not impose that fiduciaries limit plan participants' investment options. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. in Supp. Mot. to Dismiss (\"Def.'s Mem.\") 18-20, ECF No. 21-1.) The Court finds these cases persuasive. Allegedly offering too many investment options for participants does not suffice for a breach of ERISA's duty of prudence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Henderson v. Emory Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274177\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/252/1344/#p1350\">\n    252 F.Supp.3d 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1350 (N.D.

The Court first considers whether Plaintiffs state a claim that Brown acted imprudently by using more than one record-keeper. Because Plaintiffs do not\n   allege what services TIAA and Fidelity provided as record-keepers, Brown suggests, the Court cannot infer that no prudent fiduciary could have chosen to use both companies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. 20.)

There, the plaintiffs' complaint cited the use of three separate record-keepers \"[d]espite the long-recognized benefits of a single recordkeeper\" as causing an inefficient and costly structure that passed on excessive and unreasonable fees to plan participants. The plaintiffs also alleged that comparably sized plans maintained only one, rather than multiple, record-keepers, which helped minimize costs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274177\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/252/1344/#p1350\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Swap out three with two record-keepers and you have Plaintiffs' allegations in this case.

Brown argues that, as a matter of law, \"[a]llegations that a plan administrator should have engaged in competitive bidding for services are also not sufficient to support a claim of breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA.\" (Def.'s Mem. 21.) And it argues bidding is but one available process to determine fees and expenses, and that it is not required that fiduciaries use competitive bidding to select record-keepers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Brown also faults Plaintiffs for not alleging or challenging the process through which Brown retained TIAA and Fidelity as record-keepers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs' claim that a prudent fiduciary in like circumstances would have solicited competitive bids plausibly alleges a breach of the duty of prudence.

Plaintiffs allege that the Plans paid significantly too much for recordkeeping compared to market rates, suggesting that $35-$45 annually per participant would be reasonable, when Plan participants annually pay about $300. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 55-58; Pls.' Opp'n 12.) Brown argues that Plaintiffs fail to allege that no reasonable fiduciary would make the same decisions as Brown. That is, Brown suggests Plaintiffs' allegation that a \"reasonable recordkeeping fee for the Plans would have been a fixed amount between ... approximately $35-$45 per participant\" (Compl. \u00b6 55), is insufficient because Plaintiffs fail to include a comparison to what other universities with 403(b) plans pay for recordkeeping services or how many use a flat-fee per participant. (Def.'s Mem. 23-24.) Further, Brown argues, \"so many universities have been sued for paying more than the '$35-$45' selected by Plaintiffs as the 'right' amount ... that their fee estimate is not a plausible basis for a claim of imprudence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Brown's averment is not persuasive at the motion-to-dismiss stage.

Count II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In Count II, Plaintiffs aver that rather than \"engage in a prudent process for the selection and retention of Plan investment options,\" Brown selected \"more expensive funds with inferior historical performance.\" (Compl. \u00b6 122.) Specifically, Plaintiffs challenge Brown's process with respect to: (1) the CREF Stock Account (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 63-76, 123); (2) the TIAA Real Estate Account (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-89, 124); and (3) the TIAA Traditional Annuity\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 90-99, 125).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Brown argues that because \"hindsight and allegations of poor performance are all that Plaintiffs offer on their claim that Brown was imprudent in the selection and retention of the three TIAA annuity investment options about which Plaintiffs complain,\" Plaintiffs' claim should be dismissed. (Def.'s Mem. 25.) Underperforming funds is alone insufficient to allege that\n   no prudent fiduciary would have made the same choices, Brown avers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs respond that Count II states a plausible claim for excessive investment management fees and performance losses in contravention of Brown's duty to \"minimize costs\" and to \"incur only costs that are reasonable.\" (Pls.' Opp'n 17.) \"Plaintiffs allege - and Brown cannot dispute - the CREF Stock and TIAA Real Estate funds had both drastically underperformed comparable lower-cost alternatives over the preceding one-, five-, and ten-year periods.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 68-89.) For example, Plaintiffs cite a recommendation from independent investment consultant Aon Hewitt in March of 2012 that the CREF Stock Account should be removed based on its historic underperformance and strategy that vastly reduced the ability of the fund to produce excess returns over time. (Pls.' Opp'n 18-19; Compl. \u00b6 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To the extent Brown suggests otherwise, or presents different benchmarks to measure the Plans' performance, it raises factual issues that cannot be decided at the pleading stage. The court deems persuasive the analysis of courts considering analogous theories in analogous circumstances, which have allowed a theory like Plaintiffs' to move forward in spite of the defendant-university's attempt (like Brown's here) to insert different performance benchmarks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274177\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/252/1344/#p1350\">\n    252 F.Supp.3d at 1352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he proper benchmark can be more appropriately determined on summary judgment.\").
