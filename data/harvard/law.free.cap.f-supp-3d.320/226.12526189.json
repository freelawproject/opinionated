Anticompetitive Effects are a Foreseeable Result\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although Maine law does not grant county sheriffs exclusive authority to serve civil process, the statutory scheme demonstrates that the legislature intended county sheriffs and their deputies to play the\n   primary role in completing personal service of civil process in Maine. The legislature's grant of broad authority to sheriffs and deputies as process servers displaces some competition. In order to have process served personally by someone other than the sheriff or his deputies, one would have to obtain a special appointment from the court or use one of a narrow class of individuals otherwise authorized by law to effectuate service.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 14 M.R.S. \u00a7 703 (service by constables). Although special appointments are to be granted liberally, the extra step creates an impediment to the use of alternate forms of personal service of process. Me. R. Civ. P. 4(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Two other features of the Maine service statutes also support the foreseeability of an anticompetitive effect. First, the statute here not only authorizes the sheriff to effectuate personal service, it also sets the fees which can be charged. This is not a case like\n   <em>\n    FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , where rating bureaus for title insurance companies were authorized by state statute to set fees because here the state set the fees.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730354\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/621/\">\n    504 U.S. 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730354\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/621/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730354\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/621/\">\n    119 L.Ed.2d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phoebe Putney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407396\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/216/#p225\">\n    568 U.S. at 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407396\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/216/#p225\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (broad grant of authority to hospital authorities did not delegate authority to act anticompetitively);\n   <em>\n    Comty.Commc'ns Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11303605\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/40/#p52\">\n    455 U.S. at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11303605\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/40/#p52\">\n    102 S.Ct. 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (state's grant of broad neutral authority to municipalities to govern local affairs did not contemplate anticompetitive actions later taken by the municipality). Second, contrary to the Plaintiffs' contention, the statute is not neutral with respect to the actions challenged as anticompetitive. The statute compels sheriffs and their deputies to execute service of lawfully issued writs and precepts presented to them. The statutory language indicates that, provided payment is received, the sheriffs and their deputies \"\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   serve and execute\" these documents. 14 M.R.S. \u00a7 702 (emphasis added). In\n   <em>\n    Hallie\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court stated that a municipality was not required to show compulsion in order to receive the benefit of state action immunity, but it acknowledged that \"compulsion affirmatively expressed may be the best evidence of state policy [to displace competition].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195473\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/34/#p38\">\n    471 U.S. at 45-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6195473\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/34/#p38\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, in this case the anticompetitive effect can be attributed to the state itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Because displacement of competition is the ordinary, logical, and inherent result of the Maine statutory scheme, its anticompetitive effect on personal service of process is foreseeable and the \"clear articulation\" test is satisfied. Thus, the sheriffs and county Defendants are entitled to state action immunity on all the Plaintiffs' federal antitrust claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fisichelli v.
