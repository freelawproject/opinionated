The allegedly tortious conduct in Count I occurred at the hands of two military doctors. These doctors allegedly accessed the same electronic medical record system to find Colon's private medical information that other military doctors utilized when treating Colon while she was an active member of the military. The doctors then allegedly disclosed that information to another member of the military-an individual with whom Colon was in a custody dispute stemming from a relationship that took place while both were active members of the military. The allegedly tortious conduct in Count II occurred at the hands of the Secretary of Defense, who allegedly breached his duty to exercise reasonable care in ensuring that military employees only access and disclose records from the military's electronic medical record system when they have authorization to do so. The Secretary of Defense's negligence allegedly created the opportunity for the two military doctors to engage in the conduct alleged in Count I. In other words, the tortious acts alleged in Counts I and II were committed by active members of the military who used the military's electronic medical record system to cause Colon injuries she would never have incurred but for her status as a member of the military. For these reasons, Colon's injuries arose out of \"activity incident to service\" and her FTCA claims against the United States are therefore barred by the\n      <em>\n       Feres\n      </em>\n      doctrine.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-37\">\n      Colon raises two primary arguments to the contrary, each of which fails. First, she argues that her injury was not \"incident to service\" because the injury itself did not occur until after she left the military. Second, she argues that none of the three rationales underlying the\n      <em>\n       Feres\n      </em>\n      doctrine are present.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-38\">\n      First, the fact that Colon's injury did not occur until after she left the military is irrelevant. Indeed, the Fourth Circuit has explicitly stated: \"the focus of\n      <em>\n       Feres\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       is not upon when the injury occurs\n      </em>\n      or when the claim becomes actionable, rather it is concerned with when and under what circumstances the negligent act occurs.\"\n      <em>\n       Kendrick v.

And while Berkowitz's alleged unauthorized access occurred in 2015, after Colon's discharge, the access was still incident to her service because it related to the use and management of her active duty medical records by a military doctor, the control of which is left to \"military discipline and decisionmaking.\"\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Cioca v.

The Amended Complaint alleges that each doctor did this favor not as part of his military duties, but instead out of a desire to help Wollenburg. Indeed, Colon alleges that Kassop accessed and shared her confidential health records because he wanted to help Wollenburg, who was his close friend, roommate, and a groomsman in his wedding.

Specifically, the alleged MCMRA violations and negligent access and disclosure of protected health information occurred on two different \"federal enclaves,\" where such causes of action are not applicable. Accordingly, Counts V and VI are dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-61\">\n      Article I of the Constitution states Congress shall have the power:\n     </p>\n     <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-62\">\n      to exercise Legislation in all Cases whatsoever over such District[s] ... as may, by Cession of particular States ... become the Seat of the government of the United States, and to exercise like authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, Dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-63\">\n      U.S. Const.

Second, where it is established that the conduct occurred on a federal enclave, the Court must determine whether the federal government has decided to make the particular state law at issue applicable on that federal enclave.
