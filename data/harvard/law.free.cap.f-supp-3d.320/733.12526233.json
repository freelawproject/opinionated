Specifically, Colon alleges the United States violated the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"), <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201346\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346</extracted-citation>(b), 2671 <em>et seq.</em> ; DOD violated the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a ; and Kassop and Berkowitz violated the Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments, the Maryland Confidentiality of Medical Records Act (\"MCMRA\"), Md.

Put simply, a service member is injured \"incident to service\" when he is injured \"because of his military relationship with the Government.\" <em>See</em> <em>Johnson</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220447\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/681/#p689\">481 U.S. at 689</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220447\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/681/#p689\">107 S.Ct. 2063</extracted-citation> (\"Where a service member is injured incident to service-that is, because of his military relationship with the Government ...\").</p><p id=\"p-36\">Here, there can be no doubt that Colon's injuries arose out of \"activity incident to service.\" Specifically, her injuries arose out of her treatment by military doctors at military medical installations-treatment she received solely because she was a member of the military. The allegedly tortious conduct in Count I occurred at the hands of two military doctors. These doctors allegedly accessed the same electronic medical record system to find Colon's private medical information that other military doctors utilized when treating Colon while she was an active member of the military. The doctors then allegedly disclosed that information to another member of the military-an individual with whom Colon was in a custody dispute stemming from a relationship that took place while both were active members of the military. The allegedly tortious conduct in Count II occurred at the hands of the Secretary of Defense, who allegedly breached his duty to exercise reasonable care in ensuring that military employees only access and disclose records from the military's electronic medical record system when they have authorization to do so. The Secretary of Defense's negligence allegedly created the opportunity for the two military doctors to engage in the conduct alleged in Count I. In other words, the tortious acts alleged in Counts I and II were committed by active members of the military who used the military's electronic medical record system to cause Colon injuries she would never have incurred but for her status as a member of the military. For these reasons, Colon's injuries arose out of \"activity incident to service\" and her FTCA claims against the United States are therefore barred by the <em>Feres</em> doctrine.</p><p id=\"p-37\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"741\" href=\"#p741\" id=\"p741\">*741</a>Colon raises two primary arguments to the contrary, each of which fails. First, she argues that her injury was not \"incident to service\" because the injury itself did not occur until after she left the military. Second, she argues that none of the three rationales underlying the <em>Feres</em> doctrine are present.</p><p id=\"p-38\">First, the fact that Colon's injury did not occur until after she left the military is irrelevant. Indeed, the Fourth Circuit has explicitly stated: \"the focus of <em>Feres</em> <em>is not upon when the injury occurs</em> or when the claim becomes actionable, rather it is concerned with when and under what circumstances the negligent act occurs.\" <em>Kendrick v.

And while Berkowitz's alleged unauthorized access occurred in 2015, after Colon's discharge, the access was still incident to her service because it related to the use and management of her active duty medical records by a military doctor, the control of which is left to \"military discipline and decisionmaking.\" <em>See</em> <em>Cioca v.

Department of the Navy</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5872978,9398454\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/279/1051/\">279 F.3d 1051</extracted-citation>, 1056-57 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (\"Although judicial reluctance to impinge on military matters is understandable in many contexts, it is unjustified in this setting; as we have discussed, the Congress clearly <em>enlisted</em> the federal courts to inquire into potential military violations of the Privacy Act.\") (emphasis in original).</p><p id=\"p-44\">The parties agree that the government has waived sovereign immunity and consented to be sued under the Privacy Act only where the plaintiff has suffered \"actual damages.\" <em>See</em> <em>F.A.A. v. Cooper</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189060\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/284/#p299\">566 U.S. 284</extracted-citation>, 299, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189060\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/284/#p299\">132 S.Ct. 1441</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189060\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/284/#p299\">182 L.Ed.2d 497</extracted-citation> (2012). The DOD contends, however, that Colon has not pled \"actual damages.\" ECF No. 26-1 at 26-28.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But Colon's Amended Complaint states that she \"suffered actual damages when she paid for medical services and transportation to and from medical services to address the trauma she suffered as a result of the intentional and/or willful disclosures of her private health records.\" ECF No. 19 \u00b6 55. It also states that \"as a result of Dr. Kassop and Dr. Berkowitz's violation of the Privacy Act, Plaintiff has suffered adverse and harmful effects and actual damages, including, but not limited to, mental distress, emotional trauma, fear of receiving medical treatment, embarrassment, humiliation, and costs for therapy sessions.\" <em>Id.</em> \u00b6 56. Thus, Count III of the Amended Complaint clearly alleges both emotional damages and actual damages.</p><p id=\"p-45\">Colon cannot recover for any emotional damages suffered as a result of a Privacy Act violation. However, to the extent \"she paid for medical services and transportation to and from medical services\" and paid \"costs for therapy sessions.\" \"to address the trauma she suffered as a result of the intentional and/or willful disclosures of her private health records.\" she can recover. The causation argument raised by the DOD, that Colon's therapy sessions were not caused by any violation of the Privacy Act, <em>see</em> ECF No. 26-1 at 27-28, may ultimately preclude Colon from recovering the actual damages she has pled. It does not, however, alter the fact that she has pled such damages. Accordingly, Count III of Colon's complaint survives to the extent she alleges she suffered actual damages as a result of a violation of the Privacy Act.</p><p id=\"p-46\"><strong>B. Claims against Kassop and Berkowitz</strong></p><p id=\"p-47\"><strong>1. <em>Bivens</em> Claim (Count IV)</strong></p><p id=\"p-48\">In Count IV, Colon attempts to bring a <em>Bivens</em> action against Kassop and Berkowitz based on alleged constitutional violations. The Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear this claim because it is barred by an outgrowth of the <em>Feres</em> doctrine: the doctrine of intra-military immunity. Accordingly, Count IV is dismissed under Rule 12(b)(1).</p><p id=\"p-49\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"743\" href=\"#p743\" id=\"p743\">*743</a>Whereas the <em>Feres</em> doctrine prohibits servicemen from suing the government under the FTCA, the related doctrine of intra-military immunity prohibits servicemen from bringing suits for service-related injuries in other contexts. One such context is where a serviceman seeks to bring a <em>Bivens</em> action against another serviceman to redress an injury suffered \"incident to service.\" In <em>Stanley</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28195\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/669/#p682\">483 U.S. at 684</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28195\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/669/#p682\">107 S.Ct. 3054</extracted-citation>, the Supreme Court unequivocally held: \"no <em>Bivens</em> remedy is available for injuries that 'arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.' \" (internal citation omitted). In light of <em>Stanley</em> , \"the law is now settled that <em>Bivens</em> suits are never permitted for constitutional violations arising from military service, no matter how severe the injury or how egregious the rights infringement.\" Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction 622 (5th ed. 2007).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-50\">For the reasons set forth above, Colon's injuries \"arise out of activity incident to service.\" <em>See</em> Section III.A.1, <em>supra</em> . Therefore, the doctrine of intra-military immunity bars Colon from bringing a <em>Bivens</em> action based on her injuries. Accordingly, Count IV is dismissed.</p><p id=\"p-53\">While the doctrine of intra-military immunity serves as an absolute bar to a plaintiff's <em>Bivens</em> action against fellow military personnel, the doctrine only bars state statutory or tort claims where a plaintiff's injury is \"incident to service\" <em>and</em> the defendant is sued for \"performing a military act.\" <em>See</em> <em>Kenneally v. Bayer</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120281\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/760/503/#p505\">760 F.Supp. 503</extracted-citation>, 505 (D. Md. 1990).</p><p id=\"p-54\">In imposing the \"military act\" requirement in <em>Kenneally</em> , Judge Ramsey relied on the Tenth Circuit's opinion in <em>Durant v. Neneman</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11368523\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/1350/\">884 F.2d 1350</extracted-citation> (10th Cir. 1989). In <em>Durant</em> , the Tenth Circuit rightly acknowledged the distinction between the <em>Feres</em> doctrine and the intra-military immunity doctrine. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11368523\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/1350/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11368523\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/1350/\"> at 1352</extracted-citation> (\"cases in which liability is asserted by servicemen against military actors for acts committed within the context of military service\" are not \"true <em>Feres</em> cases because the claims asserted are not founded upon the FTCA and the liability of the United States is not implicated.\"). The Tenth Circuit recognized that the intra-military immunity doctrine is based on only one of the rationales underlying <em>Feres</em> : courts should not interfere with sensitive military affairs because doing so risks military discipline and effectiveness. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11368523\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/1350/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> at 1353 (citing <em>Chappell v.

Indeed, when one serviceman sues another serviceman, the distinctively federal relationship between the Government and members of its armed forces is not implicated, nor can the serviceman avail himself of a generous system <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"744\" href=\"#p744\" id=\"p744\">*744</a>of statutory disability and death benefits. The Tenth Circuit also recognized that although \"evolving jurisprudence has created a zone of protection for military actors, immunizing actions and decisions which involved military authority from scrutiny by civilian courts.\" \"this zone was never intended to protect the <em>personal acts</em> of an individual when those acts in no way implicate the function or authority of the military.\" <em>Durant</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11368523\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/1350/\">884 F.2d at 1353</extracted-citation> (emphasis added).</p><p id=\"p-55\">Recognizing these facts, the Tenth Circuit imposed an additional requirement for invoking intra-military immunity where one serviceman brings a common law tort claim against another serviceman: the defendant must be sued for performing a \"military act.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11368523\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/1350/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11368523\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/1350/\"> at 1354</extracted-citation>. Although the Tenth Circuit was the first to explicitly adopt this requirement, it noted that other courts had implicitly imposed the same requirement. <em>See <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11368523\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/884/1350/\">id.</extracted-citation></em> (\"courts have granted immunity to persons whose <em>military authority</em> is the basis for a plaintiff's claim of liability\") (emphasis added).</p><p id=\"p-56\">The Fourth Circuit has never explicitly adopted the \"military act\" requirement of <em>Durant</em> and <em>Kenneally</em> . However, it has done so implicitly. In <em>Trerice v. Summons,</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"675260\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/755/1081/#p1084\">755 F.2d 1081</extracted-citation>, 1084-85 (4th Cir. 1985), where the Fourth Circuit held that <em>Feres</em> barred a common law tort claim between enlisted military personnel and their superiors, the court noted that the defendant was engaged in a military-rather than a personal-act. In that case, plaintiff's superior was sued for punishing plaintiff's minor infraction unduly harshly, which allegedly led to plaintiff's death. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"675260\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/755/1081/#p1084\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> The punishment handed down by the naval officer in his supervisory capacity-unduly harsh or not-was unequivocally a \"military act\" and the court was reluctant to disturb it. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"675260\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/755/1081/#p1084\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"675260\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/755/1081/#p1084\"> at 1084</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-57\">Moreover, in <em>each and every</em> case cited in <em>Trerice,</em> the defendant was sued for engaging in a military act.

In maintaining, operating, and controlling the aircraft those individuals were also clearly engaged in a \"military act.\" Finally, in <em>Bailey v.

Plaintiff was injured <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"745\" href=\"#p745\" id=\"p745\">*745</a>and went to the surgeons to be operated upon. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"866756\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/345/298/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"866756\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/345/298/\"> at 298</extracted-citation>. He subsequently sued them for their alleged negligence. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"866756\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/345/298/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> The surgeons' treatment of plaintiff's military injury was unequivocally a \"military act.\" These cases confirm that the Fourth Circuit has implicitly adopted the requirement adopted explicitly in <em>Durant</em> and <em>Kenneally</em> : a serviceman can invoke intra-military immunity to bar a common law tort suit brought by another serviceman <em>if</em> he is sued for committing a \"military\"-as opposed to a personal-\"act.\"</p><p id=\"p-58\">Here, neither Kassop nor Berkowitz is being sued for performing a \"military act.\" Instead, each is being sued for accessing and sharing Colon's medical records as a favor to Wollenburg, with whom each had a personal relationship. The Amended Complaint alleges that each doctor did this favor not as part of his military duties, but instead out of a desire to help Wollenburg. Indeed, Colon alleges that Kassop accessed and shared her confidential health records because he wanted to help Wollenburg, who was his close friend, roommate, and a groomsman in his wedding. ECF No. 19 \u00b6 16. Colon alleges that Berkowitz directed his subordinates to access, view and print Colon's medical records because he too wanted to help Wollenburg, who was his patient. <em>Id.</em> \u00b6 20, Because the Amended Complaint alleges that each of the doctors acted in his personal capacity-and outside the scope of his military authority-there is no rationale for affording either immunity. Regulating the doctors' conduct would not involve courts in sensitive military affairs or risk interfering with military discipline and effectiveness. Instead, it would prevent military doctors from using their privileged access to the military electronic records system for private aims. In short, because Kassop and Berkowitz are being sued for performing personal-rather than military-acts, they cannot invoke the doctrine of intra-military immunity in order to bar Colon from bringing Count VI.</p><p id=\"p-59\"><strong>ii. Federal Enclave Doctrine</strong></p><p id=\"p-60\">While the doctrine of intra-military immunity does not bar Colon's state law claims, the Federal Enclave doctrine does. Specifically, the alleged MCMRA violations and negligent access and disclosure of protected health information occurred on two different \"federal enclaves,\" where such causes of action are not applicable. Accordingly, Counts V and VI are dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6).</p><p id=\"p-61\">Article I of the Constitution states Congress shall have the power:</p><p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-62\">to exercise Legislation in all Cases whatsoever over such District[s] ... as may, by Cession of particular States ... become the Seat of the government of the United States, and to exercise like authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, Dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings.</p><p id=\"p-63\">U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 17. This constitutional provision has given rise to the federal enclave doctrine. Generally speaking, the federal enclave doctrine establishes that the federal government obtains the right to choose whether state or federal law governs a territory from the time it exerts exclusive jurisdiction over that territory.</p><p id=\"p-64\">Determining whether application of a particular state law is barred by the federal enclave doctrine requires two steps. First, the Court must determine whether the conduct at issue occurred on a federal enclave. \"The United States acquires exclusive jurisdiction over a federal enclave if it acquires the land by consent of the state legislature.\" <em>See</em> <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"746\" href=\"#p746\" id=\"p746\">*746</a><em>Bouthner v. Cleveland Const., Inc.</em> , No. RDB-11-224, <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%202976868\">2011 WL 2976868</extracted-citation>, at *2 (D. Md.

Second, where it is established that the conduct occurred on a federal enclave, the Court must determine whether the federal government has decided to make the particular state law at issue applicable on that federal enclave. The general rule for identifying whether a state law is applicable on a federal enclave is as follows: a state law in effect at the time of cessation continues in effect as long as it does not conflict with federal purposes, but a subsequent state law has no effect unless (1) at the time of cessation the state specifically retained jurisdiction over the subject matter at issue or (2) Congress specifically authorized the enforcement of the state law on the federal enclave. <em>See, e.g.</em> , <em>Stokes v.

But to read subsection (b) that way would be to allow it to swallow the federal enclave doctrine whole, which there is no indication Congress wished to do when it passed 28 U.S.C. 5001. <em>See</em> <em>Shurow</em> , <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201550162\">2017 WL 1550162</extracted-citation>, at *3 (noting that interpretation covering any injury would be co-extensive with Article III standing and that \"[s]uch a result would be inconsistent with the more than eighty years of Federal Enclave Doctrine jurisprudence ...\"). Colon does not assert either a wrongful death or a survival claim or a physical injury to the person.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205001\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 5001</extracted-citation> does not authorize the enforcement of her state law claims on these two federal enclaves.</p><p id=\"p-68\">Second, Colon claims Maryland specifically retained jurisdiction over the subject matter at issue when it passed what is now Md. Code. Ann., Gen. Prov., \u00a7 6-201. The initial version of this law became effective on October 1, 1984. <em>See <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205001\">id.</extracted-citation></em> (\"Former State Government \u00a7 14-102, added by Acts 1984, c. 284, \u00a7 1, eff. Oct. 1, 1984.\"). For one, a state statute promulgated <em>after</em> the cessation of a federal enclave cannot possibly be the vehicle by which a state retains jurisdiction over a particular subject matter on that federal enclave. Indeed, once the federal enclave has been ceded, <em>the federal government</em> has exclusive authority to determine the choice of law on that federal enclave. Moreover, \u00a7 6-201 by its own terms \"does not affect the jurisdiction and authority of the State over land, or persons, property, and transactions on the land, that the United States or a unit of the United States acquired on or before May 31, 1943.\" Both Fort Meade and the Walter Reed Medical Center were ceded to the United States prior to May 31, 1943. Therefore, this statute cannot possibly affect the applicability of state law on these federal enclaves.</p><p id=\"p-69\">Thus, (1) the MCMRA and the tort of negligent access and disclosure of protected health information are state laws not in existence at the time Fort Meade and the Walter Reed Medical Center were ceded by Maryland to the United States; (2) Congress did not specifically authorize the enforcement of either of these state laws on either Fort Meade or the Walter Reed Medical Center: and (3) Maryland did not specifically retain jurisdiction over the subject matter covered by these state laws when it ceded Fort Meade and the Walter Reed Medical Center to the United States. For these reasons, neither the MCMRA nor the novel tort Colon asserts is applicable on either of these federal enclaves. Accordingly, Counts V and VI are dismissed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-70\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"748\" href=\"#p748\" id=\"p748\">*748</a><strong>IV.
