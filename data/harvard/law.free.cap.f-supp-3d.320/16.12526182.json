HUVELLE, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiffs, twenty-three federal police officers stationed at the Veterans Affairs (\"VA\") Medical Center in Washington, D.C., bring this action against the Chief of Police at the VA Medical Center, Jerry Brown; the VA Medical Center Director, Brian Hawkins; and the Secretary of United States Department of Veterans Affairs. They allege that defendants secretly installed audio and video recording devices at several non-public locations within the VA Medical Center, in violation of federal and state wiretapping statutes, state civil conspiracy law, and the Fourth Amendment. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. For the reasons stated herein, defendants' motion will be denied as to the federal wiretapping claim and the Fourth Amendment claim (Counts 1 and 4) but granted as to the state law claims (Counts 2 and 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Facts Alleged in the Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs are police officers employed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and stationed at the VA Medical Center, under the command of Chief of Police Jerry Brown. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-24, ECF No. 5.) In October 2013, Chief Brown allegedly \"conspired\" with the Medical Director, Brian Hawkins, to install hidden cameras, with both audio and video recording capability, in at least three non-public locations within the VA Medical Center - the Police Control Room, the Police Report Writing Room, and the Watch Commander's Office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30, 52.) Before arranging for the installation of these devices, Chief Brown did not obtain a warrant or comply with the applicable rules in the VA Handbook.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46-49, 74.) He did, however, send a memorandum, dated October 23, 2013, to Director Hawkins, requesting permission \"to install two covert video surveillance devices\" - one in the Police Control Room and the other in the Police Report Writing Room. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. A (copy of 10/23/2013 memorandum);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 53.) According\n   to this memorandum, the devices were to be used for a period of 90 days to investigate \"suspicious activity\" between the evening dispatcher and other police officers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. A.) Director Hawkins approved Chief Brown's request, and cameras were subsequently installed in these two locations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Exs. A, J (Decl. of Chief Brown) (\"Brown Decl.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36, 39, 53.) There is no mention of the Watch Commander's Office in this memorandum, and defendants deny that a camera was ever installed in that location. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brown Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Police Control Room is a room where every VA police officer spends time throughout the day. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 33.) Other individuals, including cleaning staff, other staff members, various contractors, and patients of the medical facility, also have access to this room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) The Report Writing Room is used by police officers daily for a variety of purposes, including the writing of reports and as an alternative break room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) The Watch Commander's Office is \"used, in part, as a changing room for both male and female officers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) In each of these rooms, individuals could stop talking when other individuals entered the room or doors could be closed to prevent individuals from outside the room from overhearing conversations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   VA police officers first learned of the possible existence of hidden cameras on January 19, 2014, when Officer Gentry, a plaintiff, \"informed various officers that [Chief] Brown might have secret cameras installed and may be monitoring their activities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) A few days later, on January 24, 2014, several officers discovered the camera in the Police Control Room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) The camera was \"covertly mounted on a support bracket for the CCTV monitors with a microphone hidden behind the monitors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"While the camera and microphone had indicator lights, those lights were covered with black electric tape.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Upon discovery, one officer \"covered the microphone portion of the camera,\" while the officers who were present \"discussed what to do about the camera and microphone.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As soon as the microphone was covered, Chief Brown appeared in the Police Control Room, \"demanding to know what the officers were doing in the room and ordered all attending officers to draft statements regarding what was happening in the control room.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.) In March 2014, a hidden camera with a microphone unit was discovered in the Police Report Writing Room.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) In January 2015, officers found a hidden camera with a microphone unit in the Watch Commander's Office (Room 1E229B). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During April 2014, in response to complaints, the VA Medical Center Administrative Investigation Board conducted an investigation into an allegedly hostile work environment fostered by Chief Brown. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. F, at 1, 8 (transcript of 4/23/2014 interview under oath of Chief Brown) (\"Brown Tr.\").) Chief Brown and Director Hawkins were both interviewed as part of this investigation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. F; Defs.' Ex. G (transcript of 4/22/2014 interview under oath of Director Hawkins) (\"Hawkins' Tr.\").) One aspect of this investigation concerned the hidden cameras that had been discovered in the Police Report Writing Room and the Police Control\n   Room. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brown Tr. at 11-13, 23-26.) During his interview, Chief Brown testified that he had sought permission from Director Hawkins to install these cameras \"as part of a criminal investigation, suspicion of criminal activity, not for monitoring the performance of the work of the employee.\" (Brown Tr. at 12.) He further testified that he had never requested that the audio recording capabilities of the hidden devices be activated, and that the company who installed the equipment told him that they were not. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24.) Director Hawkins testified during his interview that he had authorized the video surveillance requested by Chief Brown due to Chief Brown's concerns about potential criminal activity and workplace misconduct. (Hawkins Tr. at 6.) He further testified that he did not authorize any audio. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) The Board also interviewed Mark Bradford, an employee of the company that installed the surveillance equipment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. K (transcript of 4/22/2014 interview under oath of Mark Bradford) (\"Bradford Tr.\").) He testified that the audio capabilities of the devices his company installed were not activated. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the above-described testimony, along with the October 2013 memorandum, and Chief Brown's declaration filed in this case, defendants deny that the audio capabilities of the cameras in the Police Control Room and the Police Report Writing Room were activated or that any audio recordings were ever made. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Facts \u00b6\u00b6 8, 11; Brown Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 4, 2014, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) issued Directive 1078, entitled \"Privacy of Persons Regarding Photographs, Digital Images, and Video or Audio Recordings.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Ex. 11.) The stated purpose of the directive was to \"establish[ ] VHA policy defining the parameters under which members of the VHA workforce may produce and use photographs, digital images, and video or audio recordings of all persons.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) The Directive provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   If the use of equipment to covertly produce photographs, digital images, or video or audio recordings is to investigate suspected cases of VHA workforce misconduct, the VA medical facility Director, the Regional Counsel, and the chief human resources officer of the facility all must approve this use before the equipment may be used.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at A-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 2, 2015, video footage from the camera in the Police Report Writing Room was used by Chief Brown to request disciplinary action against two of the plaintiffs, Officers Kevin Price and Anthony Green, for sleeping on duty and lack of candor in pretending to have been on patrol while actually sleeping. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. B.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The cameras in these three locations were used to \"ma[k]e audio and video recordings of all personnel who utilized these rooms,\" which \"were delivered on a real-time basis to [Chief] Brown's office.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 45, 56.) Plaintiffs believe that \"these cameras remain[ed] in use as of the filing of this action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) They also \"suspect the existence of other audio and video recording devices.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) Defendants deny that the two cameras they admit to installing remained in use until this lawsuit was filed. They claim that the camera in the Police Control Room \"was only operational until January 29, 2014,\" and that the camera in the Police Report Writing Room \"was operational until March 23, 2014.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brown Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, 10-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    403 U.S. 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    29 L.Ed.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971) ; and Court V claimed that the Secretary of the VA was liable for Chief Brown's actions under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\"). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 96-98, 2015 Litigation.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The Court denied the motion except as to Count V, the FTCA claim against the Secretary of the VA, which it dismissed on the ground that the only proper defendant for an FTCA claim is the United States, and plaintiffs had not sought to substitute the United States as the defendant for that count.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order, 2015 Litigation, ECF No. 36.) However, on August 1, 2016, plaintiffs' attorneys filed a motion to withdraw as counsel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Withdraw, 2015 Litigation, ECF No. 38.) The motion informed the Court that on June 27, 2016, they had sent a letter, along with their motion to withdraw, to each plaintiff advising that they intended to withdraw and that plaintiffs could\n   either have new counsel enter an appearance or notify the Clerk if they intended to proceed without counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court set a hearing on the motion to withdraw for September 8, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, 2015 Litigation, ECF No. 39.) In its Order, the Court directed counsel to ensure that each plaintiff received notice of the hearing and was advised either to appear in person or retain new counsel to appear on his/her behalf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court also ordered the Clerk of Court to mail copies of the Order to each plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   No plaintiff took action prior to the hearing or appeared at the hearing; nor did any new counsel appear. At the hearing, after a discussion with plaintiffs' counsel, the Court determined that it would grant the motion to withdraw. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. of 9/8/2016 Mot. Hrg., 2015 Litigation (\"9/8/16 Tr.\") (COURT: \"I'm going to grant the motion to withdraw as counsel. I understand why.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122054\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/185/1/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANTS: \"[G]iven [plaintiffs' failure to provide initial disclosures] and given the lack of interest in coming to the status hearing today[,] we[ ] would ask for the record that the matter be dismissed for lack of prosecution.\").) The Court decided to defer ruling on defendants' motion until after it had issued an order to show cause, giving plaintiffs one final chance to either retain new counsel or decide to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) If plaintiffs failed to respond to the order to show cause, the Court indicated that it would dismiss for failure to prosecute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (\"I will set a date certain for dismissal.\").) The Court noted, and defendants' counsel verbally acknowledged that it understood, that such a dismissal would be without prejudice.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, 2015 Litigation, ECF No. 41.) The Clerk of Court mailed a copy of the order to each plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On September 27, 2016, having received no response from any plaintiff, the Court dismissed all remaining claims in the 2015 Litigation for failure to prosecute, but its Order failed to indicate that the dismissal was without prejudice.

Of the 23 plaintiffs, 21 had been plaintiffs in the 2015 Litigation. The complaint again named Chief Brown, Director Hawkins, and the Secretary of the VA as defendants, and it included counts that mirrored Counts I-IV from the 2015 Litigation. Specifically, Count 1 claims that Chief Brown and Director Hawkins violated the federal wiretapping statute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202510\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; Count 2 claims that they violated the District of Columbia wiretapping statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2023-542\">\n    D.C.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 59-78.)

In the 2015 Litigation, Counts I through IV, which are virtually identical to Counts 1 through 4 in the current litigation, were dismissed for lack of prosecution. The parties dispute whether this dismissal constituted a \"final, valid judgment on the merits,\" which, in turn, they agree, depends on whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice. The dismissal order did not state whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice. Thus, relying on Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b), defendants argue that the dismissal should be treated as a dismissal with prejudice. Plaintiffs, pointing to Local Civil Rule 83.23, take the opposite view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For several reasons, the Court agrees with plaintiffs.

It provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-69\">\n   An order dismissing a claim for failure to prosecute shall specify that\n   <em>\n    the dismissal is without prejudice, unless the Court determines that the delay in prosecution of the claim has resulted in prejudice to an opposing party\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   LCvR 83.23 (emphasis added). The effect of this rule is to \"provide that dismissals for failure to prosecute\n   <em>\n    should be made without prejudice unless the delay in prosecution impairs the opposing party's interests\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    James v.

Howard Univ.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-cv-303, slip op. at 3 (D.D.C. Nov. 13, 2017) (\"Defendant does not allege that its interests will be impaired by dismissal without prejudice; accordingly, the Court sees no reason to depart from this default rule.\"). There are thus two arguably conflicting default rules. Second, at the September 8, 2016 hearing, after the Court indicated that it would grant counsel's motion to withdraw, defendants orally moved for plaintiffs' claims to be dismissed for lack of prosecution, but they did not request a dismissal with prejudice or provide any basis why such a dismissal would be warranted. (9/8/2016 Tr. (\"[G]iven [plaintiffs' failure to provide initial disclosures] and given the lack of interest in coming to the status hearing today[,] we[ ] would ask for that record that the matter be dismissed for lack of prosecution.\").) Third, while the dismissal order itself does not cite to either Rule 41(b) or Local Rule 83.23, or state whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice, the transcript from the final hearing in the 2015 Litigation makes it clear that the Court anticipated that a dismissal for failure to prosecute would be without prejudice and, furthermore, that the Court made that clear to defendants' counsel at the hearing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   9/8/2016 Tr. (COURT: \"If it is dismissed for lack of prosecution, it is without prejudice, I think.\" COUNSEL: \"Understood, Your Honor.\").) Finally, the Court's order to plaintiffs to show cause why the case should not be dismissed for lack of prosecution did not advise plaintiffs, who were proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   at that point, that the dismissal would be with prejudice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, 2015 Litigation, Sept. 8, 2016.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Given these facts, the only possible conclusion is that Counts I-IV in the 2015 Litigation were dismissed without prejudice. Indeed, given plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   status and the lack of any apparent prejudice to defendants from the delay, a dismissal with prejudice would indeed have been unnecessarily \"Draconian.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   , 323 F.R.D. at 87 ;\n   <em>\n    see also e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Seawright v.

Mem. at 12-13.) Plaintiffs counter that a \"virtually identical argument[ ]\" was previously rejected by the Court in the 2015 Litigation on the ground that plaintiffs were entitled to discovery on this issue and that the Court should reach the same conclusion here, especially as the current record includes \"additional evidence of audio recording.\" (Pls.'

The Court's conclusion from the 2015 Litigation is still applicable, and, as it explained then, while defendants have submitted significant evidence to support their contention that no audio recording took place, plaintiffs have produced enough countervailing evidence to preclude summary judgment, especially given the necessity of construing all inferences in plaintiffs favor and plaintiffs submission of a Rule 56(d) declaration requesting document discovery and depositions in order to be able to access any other relevant evidence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Allen v.

FUTURE PROCEEDINGS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    As previously discussed, there are two potentially dispositive issues with respect to the viability of Count 1, which may be resolved with limited discovery: (1) whether there was audio surveillance (if not, the federal wiretapping statute does not apply,\n    <em>\n     see supra\n    </em>\n    Section IV.A); and (2) what, if any, audio surveillance took place on or after September 22, 2015 (if not, Count 1 is barred by the two-year statute of limitations,\n    <em>\n     see supra\n    </em>\n    Section III.C). In addition, it appears that Count 4 would be barred by the applicable three-year statute of limitations if no surveillance took place on or after September 22, 2014. Further, whether surveillance even occurred in the Watch Commander's Office will bear on the Fourth Amendment analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Accordingly, the Court will permit limited discovery on the following issues:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    (1) the existence, location and duration of any audio recording in the three rooms identified in the complaint;\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    (2) the date when the admitted video surveillance in the Police Control Room and the Police Report Writing Room ceased; and\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    (3) the existence and duration of any video surveillance in the Watch Commander's Office.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    If appropriate, after discovery on these issues, defendants will be given an opportunity to renew their motion for summary judgment on Count 1 or Count 4.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    For the reasons stated above, the Court will grant in part and deny in part defendants' motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The Secretary of the VA is dismissed as a defendant as no claim is brought against him. The two state law claims -- Count 2 (the D.C. wiretapping claim) and Count 3 (the civil conspiracy claim under D.C. law) -- which have been converted into claims against the United States governed by the FTCA, are dismissed without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to plaintiffs' failure to adequately plead administrative exhaustion. Count 1 (the federal wiretapping claim) and Count 4 (the Fourth Amendment\n    <em>\n     Bivens\n    </em>\n    claim) are not subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim, and ruling on summary judgment at this stage would be premature, but defendants will be allowed to renew their motion for summary judgment if appropriate after the conclusion of a period of limited discovery.
