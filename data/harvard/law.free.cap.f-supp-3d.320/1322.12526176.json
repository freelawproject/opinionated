Complaint (ECF No. 1-1), \u00b6 7. The property is a three story, mixed-use office rental building (the \"Building\") known as the Shoreview Center.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The tenants include professional offices, medical offices, and restaurants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Central to this dispute is one of the Building's side doorways. The side doorways are egress only doors-doors that open only for persons exiting the building.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9. On or about October 12, 2017, the Building's first floor north side egress only door system (the \"North Egress Door\") was vandalized and/or damaged by an ambulatory patient delivery driver during the transportation of a patient to Fresenius Dialysis, one of the Building's tenants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10. As a result of this incident, the North Egress Door became susceptible to occasional minor jamming due to the damaged lock.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On or about October 13, 2017, Ismael Naranjo, as the Village's Building Official, inspected the North Egress Door and determined that the door had been intentionally locked by AHE.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12. That afternoon, Naranjo met with AHE's property manager Julio Martinez and informed him that the allegedly locked North Egress Door violated certain codes and ordinances, which Naranjo did not specify.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13. Naranjo instructed AHE to unlock the North Egress Door and replace the entire door system so that it could operate as both an ingress and egress door.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 13. Martinez denied that the North Egress Door was locked and informed Naranjo: (1) that it may appear locked due to occasional partial jamming due to the damaged lock, (2) that AHE had already taken affirmative steps to address the issue by ordering custom replacement door framing and hardware, and (3) that AHE objected to the instructions to convert the North Egress Door system into both an ingress and egress system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14. Naranjo then informed Martinez that once AHE put into place the proposed system it would be compliant and also instructed AHE to unlock the door and file a police report.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15.

That same day, Martinez met with Tom Benton, the Village's City Manager, who informed AHE that the Village rescinded its demand that the side entrance doors be replaced with ingress and egress door systems, as opposed to egress only doors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 28. The City Manager also informed AHE that it could temporarily cure the unsafe building declaration by utilizing a wood stopper to prop the door open and prevent it from jamming until the replacement egress only door system was installed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Later that day, Martinez inserted a small piece of cardboard into the locking mechanism, thereby temporarily converting the door from egress only to both an ingress and egress door.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   AHE notified Mr. Benton of its compliance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On the morning of October 31, 2017, because the Unsafe Building Notice remained posted on the Building, Martinez notified Naranjo that the Building would be evacuated pursuant to the orders set forth in the Unsafe Building Notice and\n   the letter to the bank.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 31.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This dispute boils down to an allegedly wrongful eviction notice that did not result in the displacement of any of AHE's tenants because it was rescinded nearly immediately after its posting. In what is best described as a \"shotgun\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   pleading, AHE appears to allege that its Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated by the arbitrary and bad faith actions of Naranjo by declaring the Building unsafe, the failure of the Village and Naranjo to provide pre-deprivation due process safeguards, interference with AHE's possession of property and relationship with its tenants, and irreparable harm that threatens human life by virtue of an erroneous and arbitrary declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For the reasons that follow, dismissal of the federal claims (Counts III-V) is appropriate because AHE has failed to allege a violation of a federal right and, even if it did, Naranjo is entitled to qualified immunity, and the Village and County are not liable for Naranjo's alleged actions. By virtue of dismissal of the federal claims, the remaining state law claims should be remanded to state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     \u00a7 1983 Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects against deprivation by state action of a constitutionally protected interest in 'life, liberty, or property' without the due process of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Maddox v.

In opposition, AHE argues that it was deprived of pre-deprivation procedural due process because of Naranjo's failure to provide notice and the existence of the municipal ordinance alone is insufficient as a matter of law to provide notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   AHE does not challenge the legality of Section 8-5 of the MDC Code but instead challenges its interpretation and implementation here. Section 8-5 permits a building official to take certain emergency actions if the building official believed there is an actual or immediate danger to the building or persons. In relevant part, Section 8-5(f) reads: \"[w]hen in the opinion of the Building Official, there is actual or immediate danger of the failure or collapse of a building or structure, or there is a health, windstorm or fire hazard, he may order the occupants to vacate ... In such event, the operation of the notice and hearing requirements of this Section shall be suspended as reasonably necessary in the opinion of the Building Official to redress the emergency situation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   AHE argues that the Building was never \"unsafe\" as defined by Section 8-5(b) such that emergency action pursuant to Section 8-5(f) was justified. However, AHE alleges facts which indicate just the opposite. One of the physical criteria for deeming a building a fire hazard and/or unsafe is when \"[t]he building condition creates hazards with respect to means of egress and fire protection as provided herein for the particular Occupancy.\" Section 8-5(b)(1)(iii). Emergency action is justified \"[w]hen in the opinion of the Building Official, ... there is a health, windstorm or fire hazard...\" Section 8-5(f). AHE admits that the North Egress Door lock was damaged and susceptible to minor jamming such that it appeared locked at times-this falls squarely within the definition of a hazard with respect to means of egress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Construing the facts alleged in the light most favorable to AHE, Naranjo had a reasonable basis to conclude that the Building met the physical criteria for being declared as unsafe, as defined by Section 8-5(b)(1)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Because the facts alleged indicate that the Building was unsafe as defined by Section 8-5(b)(1)(iii), MDC Code provides that emergency action may be taken in such situations. MDC Code Section 8-5(f). As relevant here, the requirements for notice and a hearing \"shall be suspended as reasonably necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3726516\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/959/#p965\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, MDC Code explicitly provides for the suspension of notice and a hearing under these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   AHE relies upon\n   <em>\n    Grayden v.
