RUSSELL, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint, Doc. 23. Plaintiffs are former employees of Sulphur Boomarang Diner, LLC, one of a chain of \"Boomarang\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   diners in Oklahoma. They brought an Amended Complaint (Doc. 21) for individual and collective Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") violations and state-law defamation against nine Boomarang diners and Ms. Sheila Moehringer, a manager at each of Defendants' diners. Defendants' main issue with the Amended Complaint concerns whether employees of Sulphur Boomarang can sue the other Boomarangs for conduct that Defendants believe was limited to the Sulphur location, and if so whether Plaintiffs can sue on behalf of non-Sulphur Boomarang employees. The Court answers \"yes\" to both questions because Plaintiffs allege a plausible joint employment relationship. The Motion to Dismiss is denied with respect to these arguments and others, but granted as to Plaintiffs' individual claims for FLSA retaliation that fail to state a plausible claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court accepts as true the following facts alleged in the Amended Complaint, Doc. 21. The Defendant Boomarang diners have a unique employment arrangement. On the one hand, they appear to share authority over and benefit from each other's employees-as in the employees that usually work at a particular location. Specifically, the diners have a \"common pooling\" arrangement in which they \"specially assign[ ] employees\" between locations for training and shift-covering purposes; utilize a \"common payment source\" and \"central payroll system by which wages are paid to all of the defendants' employees\"; exercise \"joint control over\" work conditions; share \"common managers\" across diners, such as Defendant Sheila Moehringer, \"who acted as a manager at all of the defendants' Boomarang locations\"; and host monthly meetings at Pauls Valley Boomarang with their managers and assistant managers to collect cash earned at each diner since the prior meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4. Plaintiff Tish Thomas, a Sulphur Boomarang \"assistant manager,\" trained at Davis Boomarang, occasionally filled in for absent Davis employees, and attended the monthly Pauls Valley meetings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5, 11. Plaintiff Makita McGill, a Boomarang server, only worked at the Sulphur location.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the other hand, the Defendant Boomarang diners share a similar problem of wage and hour issues. Defendants did not pay wages to Thomas for time spent traveling to and from monthly Pauls Valley meetings, nor did they pay her mileage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. They also failed to pay wages to Thomas and other employees for time spent traveling on \"special assignments\" between Boomarang locations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 11-12. Moreover, Plaintiffs and other similarly situated Boomarang employees \"routinely worked in excess of 40 hours per week for the defendants without receiving overtime compensation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 7. This was because Defendants instructed Thomas, McGill, and others not to \"clock in\" at certain times, such as when traveling to and from these special assignments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs Thomas and McGill also experienced issues at Sulphur Boomarang that may have led to their June 2017 exit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Plaintiffs inquired \"into being paid overtime\n   pursuant to the FLSA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10. Sometime after this, Defendant Moehringer, another Boomarang manager Curtis Abernathy, and Sulfur employee Andrew Tyson, knowingly circulated a false rumor to Plaintiffs' coworkers, \"the community at large, including Thomas' children,\" and \"diner patrons.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-11. They said that Plaintiffs \"had been stealing from the Sulphur location by charging defendants' customers full price but recording the sale as discounted, and then pocketing the discount.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9. Moehringer fired Thomas on June 21, 2017, and McGill left two days later due to what she calls \"hostile working conditions\" at Sulphur Boomarang amidst the stealing rumors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs assert the following individual claims in their Amended Complaint: (1) FLSA failure to pay wages and overtime (\"Count 1,\" Doc. 21, at 4-6); (2) defamation (\"Count 3,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-1.); and (3) FLSA retaliation (\"Count 3,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).

Otherwise, if Moehringer, Abernathy, and Tyson directly published the statement to those outside Boomarang, Plaintiffs may allege a plausible defamation claim.

As a manager of each of Defendants' Boomarang locations, Moehringer's alleged statement subjects them to liability only if it was within the scope of her employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hatcher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9152338\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/99/707/\">\n    99 P.3d at 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants concede that \"Moehringer and man[a]ger Curtis Abernathy were acting within the scope of their employment when they allegedly made the alleged defamatory statements to Defendant' employees,\" but the Amended Complaint does not offer context for the public communications to Thomas's children or diner patrons. Doc. 23, at 21-22;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 21, at 9, 11. The Court finds it plausible that Moehringer was managing the Boomarang diners when she told diner patrons that Plaintiffs were stealing from Sulfur Boomarang. Thus, the Boomarang Defendants are vicariously liable for this allegedly defamatory publication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Subject of the communication\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The answer to the subject element is clear-the diner patrons and Thomas's children \"reasonably understood the statement to be about\" Plaintiffs Thomas and McGill. The very nature of the communication that \"plaintiffs had been stealing from the Sulphur location\" was sufficient to notify recipients that the communication concerned Thomas and McGill. Doc. 21, at 8. Defendants ask the Court to look only to Plaintiffs' more generalized allegations that the recipients were members of \"the community at large,\" but the Amended Complaint provides enough specificity to survive dismissal.

Retaliation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendants also move to dismiss Plaintiffs' Claim 3 for FLSA retaliation. There are three elements to this FLSA retaliation claim: (1) adverse employment action-Defendants \"discharge[d] or in any other manner discriminate[d] against\" Plaintiffs; (2) protected conduct-Plaintiffs \"filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under [the FLSA] or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding\"; and (3) causation-Defendants' adverse action was because of Plaintiffs' protected conduct.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20215\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3).

Adverse employment action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendants clearly subjected Plaintiff Thomas to an adverse employment action when Defendant Moehringer, a \"manager at all of the defendants' Boomarang locations,\" terminated Thomas's employment.

At first blush, it is not entirely clear that asking about overtime compensation under the FLSA is the same thing as \"fil[ing] any [FLSA] complaint,\" but the Tenth Circuit adopts a broad interpretation of the statute and protects \"the unofficial assertion of rights through complaints at work.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20215\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3) ;\n   <em>\n    Love v.
