As to how to evaluate a defendant's claim of possession and expectation of privacy, the Byrd Court said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   On the one hand, as noted above, it is by now well established that\n   <em>\n    a person need not always have a recognized common-law property interest in the place searched to be able to claim a reasonable expectation of privacy in it.\n   </em>\n   On the other hand,\n   <em>\n    it is also clear that legitimate presence on the premises of the place searched, standing alone, is not enough to accord a reasonable expectation of privacy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    because it \"creates too broad a gauge for measurement of Fourth Amendment rights.\"\n   </em>\n   Although the Court has not set forth a single metric or exhaustive list of considerations to resolve the circumstances in which a person can be said to have a reasonable expectation of privacy, it has explained that legitimation of expectations of privacy by law must have a source outside of the Fourth Amendment, either by reference to concepts of real or personal property law or to understandings that are recognized and permitted by society. The two concepts in cases like this one are often linked. One of the main rights attaching to property is the right to exclude others, and, in the main, one who owns or lawfully possesses or controls property will in all likelihood have a legitimate expectation of privacy by virtue of the right to exclude.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1527 (emphasis added) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). In other words, the Court explained that while someone may not necessarily need a traditionally-understood property interest to invoke the Fourth Amendment, a person cannot merely invoke Fourth Amendment rights because they happen to be legitimately located in the place searched. This mere \"presence\" metric would create \"too broad a gauge\" to measure Fourth Amendment rights. And so the Byrd Court noted the analytical importance of the\n   \"right to exclude,\" which is common to both concepts of possession and societal expectations of privacy. Byrd involved a motion to suppress filed by a defendant who was driving a rental car for which he was not formally authorized. Based on the above rationale, the Court concluded that \"the mere fact that a driver\n   <em>\n    in lawful possession or control\n   </em>\n   of a rental car is not listed on the rental agreement will not defeat his or her otherwise reasonable expectation of privacy\" and reversed and remanded the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1531 (emphasis added). The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has in the past set forth similar principles, directing courts to consider, among other factors, a defendant's proprietary or possessory interest in the place to be searched or the item to be seized; whether he had the right to exclude others from the place in question; and whether he had taken normal precautions to maintain his privacy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Critically, there was\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   question about the ownership or control of the cell phones for which CSLA was obtained, and standing to bring the Fourth Amendment challenge was never questioned (or even discussed).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendant's brief backs this up: he asserts that it would be a \"lie\" and \"perjury\" for Defendant \"to admit ownership of the phone.\" (Doc. No. 189 at 2.) Rather, defense counsel advanced the theory that perhaps the alleged victim or her agents had either followed Defendant around with the phone or planted it in his vehicle, and that, as a result, his movements were\n   <em>\n    unknowingly\n   </em>\n   tracked by T3 for a period of time.

The Government reads Byrd more narrowly and does not understand\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   to have disturbed traditional Fourth Amendment standing principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant's ambitious reading of\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   cuts far too wide a swath across Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. In the Court's view,\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   has not changed that, before Defendant can assert a Fourth Amendment violation, he has to be able to assert a personal connection to the place or object in which he claims a privacy right. As a result,\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   does not afford a criminal defendant standing to challenge the collection of CSLI from a cell phone for which he\n   <em>\n    denies\n   </em>\n   the ownership, possession, control, use, and exclusion of others. Without a grant of standing under\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , there is no standing consistent Fourth Amendment principles. Under Byrd and preceding caselaw, without ownership,\n   possession, custody, or control, Defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the \"the invaded place\" - i.e., T3 - such that the gathering of the attendant CSLI could constitute a \"search\" that would potentially trigger Fourth Amendment protections.\n   <em>\n    Rakas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11329017\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/128/#p139\">\n    439 U.S. at 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11329017\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/439/128/#p139\">\n    99 S.Ct. 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Katz v.

(Doc. No. 163 at 2.) The Application sought to search 76 Oakes Lane for concealed property including: \"firearms &amp; ammunition; black powder or low explosives; metal pipes, plates, and fragments for use in improvised explosives; empty bottles or similar for construction of improvised explosives; switches, activators, initiators, or fuses used to ignite explosives; and records relating to the purchase, acquisition, or manufacture of the items listed above.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Special Agent Musgrave attached a seven-page Affidavit of Probable Cause consisting of 21 paragraphs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant first objects to Special Agent Musgrave's statement that: \"Franklin Police Department officer Samantha Brooks has reviewed the video surveillance footage from the Kangaroo Market for this time and date and observed MITCHELL OAKES on the video at the time corresponding closely to the GPS information from the phone.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, \u00b6 17.) Defendant maintains that this was a false or reckless statement because no identification was possible due to the poor quality of the Kangaroo Mart video. At the hearing, the Government conceded that this was a false identification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 251 at 45-46.) As\n   discussed on the record, the Court assumes for purposes of this analysis that this false identification corrupts the related sentences in Paragraph 18 to which it gives added meaning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48-51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Second, Defendant objects to the explanation in the Affidavit that T3 was in the Franklin area for more than two hours, spending at least 35 minutes in the area of the National Healthcare Corporation (\"NHC\") assisted living center where the bomb was found. (Doc. No. 163 at 8, \u00b6 18.) Defendant maintains that this was false because, in reality, data shows that T3 was only in the Franklin area for 15 minutes and the NHC area for 13 minutes, undermining the idea that the bomb was placed in the alleged victim's car while she was at the NHC. The Government concedes that these specific times listed in the Affidavit were incorrect. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-46, 52.) The other times listed in Paragraph 17 are unrelated to the false statements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52-53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, Defendant contends that the Affidavit suffered from the omission of not explaining that the alleged victim had not only found the bomb and looked at it, but had also handled the bomb. (Doc. No. 163 at 5, \u00b6 6.) The Government responds that the alleged victim actually stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   When I left work on 9-10-16 to get into my car it was hard[.] I hit the unlock button again and pulled hard on the door and opened it. I saw a black wire in my driver seat and then a wine bottle and metal piece with a black trash bag around it on the door. I picked up on the metal piece thinking it was something broken on the car when I realized what it was I immediately called NHC supervisor to keep the safety of everyone ...\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Doc. No. 179 at 2-3.) In other words, when the alleged victim saw something strange in her car door, she touched it thinking it could be something broken, and then she realized that it was a bomb. (Doc. No. 251 at 57.) The Government argues that this information is not material, and it also was not necessary because the Government was not required to provide every fact known in the investigation to the Magistrate Judge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57-58.) Indeed, that the alleged victim handled the bomb might have been helpful information for the Magistrate Judge to have, but the Court is limited in the amount of conjecture it may entertain about any benefit Defendant might have garnered from it. Generally speaking, an affidavit of probable cause \"is judged on the adequacy of what it does contain, not on what it lacks, or on what a critic might say should have been added.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Affidavit also stated that Defendant had no registered firearms, and thus it provided evidence related to both crimes of which Defendant was accused. Upon reviewing the four corners of the Affidavit, the Court concludes that the remaining information therein was sufficient, in the absence of the false Kangaroo Market identification and incorrect CSLI time tracking information, to establish a fair probability that firearms or explosives directly relevant to the two specifically-named crimes might be found at 76 Oakes Lane.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Vanderweele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3895058\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/545/465/#p469\">\n    545 F.

In that case, the defendant argued that, because a detective never actually saw an informant enter his residence (because he drove around the block and left that task to others), his statement in the warrant affidavit that the informant was never out of visual contact during the transactions other than when he was inside the residence was made with reckless disregard for the truth.\n    <em>\n     Hawkins\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077365\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/278/629/#p634\">\n     278 F.

Therefore, the defendant's suggestion that it may have been a case of mistaken identity was insufficient to prove that the detective intentionally provided false information in the warrant affidavit or made statements with reckless disregard for the truth.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077365\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/278/629/#p634\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Indeed, the Court notes that even if the alleged victim had merely stated that Defendant possessed firearms, and not identified the specific location, \"in cases involving a variety of suspected crimes, that an issuing judge may infer that a criminal suspect keeps the 'instrumentalities and fruits' of his crime in his residence.\n    <em>\n     United States v.
