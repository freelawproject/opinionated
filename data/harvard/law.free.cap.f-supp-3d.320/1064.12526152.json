(GunUp) in South Dakota. When GunUp merged with Media Lodge, Inc. (Media Lodge) in the spring of 2015, Giddings accepted a job as Media Lodge's director of sales. Shortly thereafter, Giddings left to serve active duty for five-plus months with the Air Force. After returning from active duty, Giddings allegedly was demoted by and then terminated from Media Lodge without cause. Giddings sued Media Lodge, Media Lodge's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jeff Siegel, and Media Lodge's majority owner IA Tech, LLC (IA Tech) (collectively \"Defendants\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging that they violated the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA). Doc. 41. Defendants filed a motion arguing that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and the arbitration clause in Giddings' Employment Agreement require this Court to stay or dismiss Giddings' case and compel arbitration. Doc. 18. For the reasons explained below, this Court grants Defendants' motion to compel arbitration under the arbitration clause, but stays the case rather than dismissing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

That is, neither party argued or even addressed a claimed delegation provision being in the arbitration clause. However, under Eighth Circuit precedent, this arbitration clause arguably could be read as containing a delegation provision intending to submit questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator. The arbitration clause provides that \"[i]n the event any disagreement arises under this Agreement, the disagreement shall be settled by binding arbitration pursuant to the Rules of the American Arbitration Association ['AAA'].\" Doc. 21-1 at 6. The AAA Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures, in turn, provide for the arbitrator to rule on questions of arbitrability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AAA Employment Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures, Rule 6\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"The\n   arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the arbitration agreement.\"). When an arbitration provision incorporates rules that authorize an arbitrator to decide issues of arbitrability, the Eighth Circuit deems that incorporation to constitute \"a clear and unmistakable expression of the parties' intent to leave the question of arbitrability to an arbitrator.\"\n   <em>\n    Fallo v.

So the question becomes whether Media Lodge has waived any assertion of a delegation provision in the arbitration clause.

The Eighth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Express Scripts\n   </em>\n   found a waiver of the argument of a delegation provision to exist because the defendant not only failed to raise the issue before the district court, but also forwent briefing the issue to the Eighth Circuit, raising it for the first time at oral argument.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3640764\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/516/695/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3640764\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/516/695/\">\n    at 701-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Order stated that \"it would benefit the Court to know for sure whether the defendants who filed the motion [to compel arbitration] are indeed waiving any arguments of a delegation provision,\" and gave those defendants an opportunity \"to file any assertion of a 'delegation provision' and explanation of why such assertion has not been waived, or this Court will deem any such assertion to be waived.\" Doc. 63. The Defendants' response to the Order was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 23, 2018, the Court requested clarification from Defendants Media Lodge, IA Tech, LLC, and Jeff Siegel (\"Defendants\") regarding whether they had waived an argument that the arbitration provision at issue contained a \"delegation provision.\" Defendants provide the following in response to the Court's request:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants did not raise or waive an argument or make an assertion that the issue of arbitrability should be within the arbitrator's jurisdiction.

The Employment Agreement has a choice-of-law provision, stating that the Agreement \"shall be construed and the legal relationship between the parties determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia.\" Doc. 21-1 at 6. Giddings argues that the choice-of-law provision does not apply once the Employment Agreement is terminated, that South Dakota law should govern this case, and that, in any event, Georgia's law on contracts is substantially similar to South Dakota's. Doc. 23 at 9 n.3.

According to Giddings, the following facts show that the agreement to arbitrate resulted from overwhelming economic power: 1) Media Lodge's employment of Giddings and Shelley was a material term of the merger between Media Lodge and GunUp, Doc. 25-5 at 22-23; Doc. 44-1 at 4; Doc. 25-2 at 3; Doc. 25-1 at 5; 2) Giddings received the Employment Agreement containing the arbitration clause one day before closing of the merger, Doc. 24 at \u00b6 8; and 3) as a result of the merger, Giddings would receive $46,952.66 in deferred compensation for work he performed for GunUp, $85,702.00 in Media Lodge stock due to his 2.86% ownership in GunUp, and $16,654.27 in cash disbursements, Doc. 24 at \u00b6 7; Doc. 25-5 at 61. Giddings argues that his refusal to sign the Employment Agreement would have jeopardized his and Shelley's jobs and forfeited the deferred compensation, Media Lodge stock, and cash disbursements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Media Lodge disputes many of the assertions Giddings relies on to show procedural unconscionability. Media Lodge argues that the merger was not conditioned on Giddings' employment with Media Lodge so he did not have to sign the Employment Agreement to receive the deferred compensation, stock, and disbursements; that there is no evidence Shelley's job would have been in jeopardy if Giddings had refused to sign the Employment Agreement; and that Giddings was given nearly two weeks to have the Employment Agreement reviewed by counsel. In support of this last argument, Media Lodge filed an affidavit from Siegel explaining that Hall was acting on behalf of Giddings and Shelley to negotiate their employment agreements, so Siegel provided all of the terms and conditions to Hall and discussed the terms of those agreements with Hall. Doc. 29 at \u00b6 4. Media Lodge also filed a series of emails between Siegel and Hall concerning the employment agreements in support of its argument. On February 11, 2015, Siegel emailed Hall a to-do list, which included a promise to send Hall employment agreements for Giddings and Shelley. Doc. 29-2 at 1. Siegel asked Hall how Giddings and Shelley's \"comp packages\" were structured and told Hall that their salaries would be \"as outlined in your spreadsheet.\" Doc. 29-2 at 1. Hall responded that Siegel's email \"sound[ed] good\" and that he would be working on the to-do list from his end. Doc. 29-2. On March 17, 2015, Siegel emailed Hall a draft\n   employment agreement for Hall, Giddings, and Shelley. Doc. 29 at \u00b6 7; Doc. 29-3. Although the draft left blank spaces for the employee's name, title, and compensation, it contained the other terms of the agreement, including the same arbitration provision found in the employment agreements Giddings and Hall ultimately signed. Doc. 29 at \u00b6 7; Doc. 21-1 at 6; Doc. 29-3 at 6. Hall replied that the draft looked like \"pretty boiler plate 'at-will' employment agreements.\" Doc. 29-3 at 1. Because the parties were considering having Hall and the Giddings work a set term of years rather than an indefinite period as the draft provided, Hall offered to draft some revised employment contracts. Doc. 29-3 at 1. He explained that he had \"a fair bit of experience in this area (running HR and recruiting for a $50MM company for close to 2 years and my wife is an employment attorney who specializes in such things).\" Doc. 29-3 at 1. On March 18, 2015, Siegel emailed Hall a copy of Media Lodge's military leave policy along with the following message: \"Good to chat yesterday. Re: Caleb [Giddings]-what's been the GunUp policy on Military Leave? Our company policy is as written below, but I'm open to pushing to change that if needed.\" Doc. 29-4 at 1. Hall replied that same day saying \"[p]retty standard policy language for military duty. Should be fine for us.\" Doc. 29-4 at 1. On March 19, 2015, Hall emailed Media Lodge's counsel saying that attorney Jamie Cole would be handling \"our employment agreements\" and that Hall and Cole would be drafting agreements with a three-year term of employment. Doc. 29 at \u00b6 9; Doc. 29-5 at 2. After further discussions, however, Hall emailed Siegel that \"[w]e are ok with at-will agreements.\" Doc. 29-5 at 1. He said that he would contact Siegel if he had any questions about the agreements and that he would have Attorney Cole review them if he needed advice. Doc. 29-5 at 1. On March 26, 2015, Siegel emailed Hall a revised copy of Hall's employment agreement. Doc. 29 at \u00b6 10; Doc. 29-6. He also asked Hall to confirm the job titles and compensation for Giddings and Shelley. Docs. 29-6, 29-7. Hall responded that same day, stating that he had talked with Giddings and Shelley and that they were fine with their titles and compensation. Doc. 29-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The emails between Hall and Siegel undercut Giddings's claim that the arbitration clause was procedurally unconscionable because he had so little time to review it. Although Giddings may not have received the final Employment Agreement until a day before the March 31 merger, Hall (the CEO and co-owner of the small business at which Giddings then worked) had a draft of the agreement, which included the arbitration clause, by March 17. Hall said that he had experience with employment agreements and, by March 19, he had an attorney to review the agreements if he felt it was necessary. It was not unreasonable for Siegel to use Hall, GunUp's CEO, to communicate with then GunUp employees Giddings and Shelley about the post-merger employment agreements with Media Lodge. And Siegel can hardly be faulted for assuming that Hall was acting on Giddings' behalf in negotiating the employment agreement. After all, Hall provided Siegel with salary information for Giddings and Shelley, discussed Medial Lodge's military leave policy as it related to Giddings, said that the leave policy would be \"fine for us\" and that \"[w]e are okay with at-will agreements,\" and told Siegel that he had spoken with Giddings and Shelley to confirm they were satisfied with their salaries. Giddings has not provided any evidence that he requested more time to consider the Employment Agreement, that he was denied the opportunity to negotiate the terms of the Employment\n   Agreement himself, or that he raised any concerns about the Employment Agreement with Hall or Media Lodge. Nor has he alleged that he did not understand the arbitration clause, which was written in plain English with normal-size print. Under these circumstances, Giddings's receipt of the final Employment Agreement one day before the merger does not make the arbitration clause procedurally unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Giddings's argument that Media Lodge's overwhelming bargaining power makes the arbitration clause procedurally unconscionable fares no better. None of the documents Giddings cites establish that the merger, the money Giddings hoped to receive therefrom, and Shelley's job were dependent upon him signing the Employment Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 25-5; Doc. 44-1 at 4; Doc. 25-2 at 3; Doc. 25-1 at 5. Even if the money from the merger had somehow been dependent on Giddings signing the Employment Agreement, the choice Giddings faced was no different from the choice facing every employee asked to sign an arbitration agreement-whether the job and the salary and benefits that come with it are worth more to the employee than access to a judicial forum. But the Supreme Court's statement in\n   <em>\n    Gilmer\n   </em>\n   -that unequal bargaining power is not alone an adequate reason for refusing to. enforce arbitration clauses in employment contracts-signals that employees seeking to avoid an arbitration clause must show \"circumstances more egregious than the ordinary economic pressure faced by every employee who needs the job.\"\n   <em>\n    Vilches v. The Travelers Co., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4055330\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/413/487/#p493\">\n    413 F. App'x 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 493 (3d Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). Indeed, \"[i]t is well-settled ... that conditioning employment on the acceptance of an agreement to arbitrate disputes ... is not itself unlawfully coercive.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Parkell Prods., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1437174\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/91/707/#p708\">\n    91 F. App'x 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 708 (2d Cir. 2003). Giddings has not offered any evidence of financial distress so bad that he had no choice but to sign the Employment Agreement. And there is no indication that Giddings could only work for Media Lodge. In fact, Giddings explains in his affidavit that he is the owner and author of a blog for competitive shooters and that he has 11 years' experience and \"deep relationships\" in the firearm media industry. Doc. 24 at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4. Giddings had the option to decline employment with Media Lodge. Although this may not have been an easy choice, it was still a meaningful one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Giddings also argues that the arbitration clause is substantively unconscionable because it limits the arbitrator to awarding \"actual damages.\" Doc. 21-1 at 6. In Giddings' view, this limitation is one-sided because the party most likely to seek additional damages, such as liquidated damages or attorney fees under a statutory claim, would disproportionately be the employee. Questions about remedies are generally for the arbitrator to decide in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    Faber v. Menard. Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9249309\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/367/1048/#p1052\">\n    367 F.3d 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1054 (8th Cir. 2004). The arbitrator is not only \"particularly well-suited to interpret the agreement and determine the appropriate extent of [its] remedial authority,\" but also \"has the authority to enforce substantive statutory rights even if those rights are in conflict with contractual limitations in the agreement that would otherwise apply.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9249309\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/367/1048/#p1052\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alteration in original) (citations and internal marks omitted). Recognizing that arbitrators have the authority to enforce substantive statutory rights even if the contract says otherwise, Media Lodge said during the hearing that if Giddings' claims go to arbitration, Media Lodge would not argue that the Employment Agreement deprived the arbitrator of authority under USERRA to award front pay, liquidated damages,\n   or costs and fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Eighth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Faber\n   </em>\n   recognized that \"a restriction on remedies in an arbitration agreement may so limit recovery that the agreement is unconscionable and invalid under state law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9249309\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/367/1048/#p1052\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9249309\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/367/1048/#p1052\">\n    at 1054-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (considering argument that arbitration provision requiring employee to pay his own attorney's fees unconscionably denied the employee his statutory right to fees and costs if he prevailed under the Age Discrimination Employment Act). But here, the judicial admissions of Media Lodge committing itself not to argue for any restriction on the arbitrator to award damages recoverable under USERRA resolves that concern about substantive unconscionability. Moreover, this Court is staying the case, rather than dismissing it, in case the arbitrator somehow decides that USERRA claims or remedies cannot be addressed under the arbitration clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Giddings nevertheless argues that the limitation on damages makes the arbitration clause substantively unconscionable under the Supreme Court of South Dakota's decision in\n   <em>\n    Rozeboom v.

The compelling reasons for finding the limitation clause in\n   <em>\n    Rozeboom\n   </em>\n   unconscionable are not present here. Media Lodge did not have a monopoly on jobs involving marketing in the firearm industry and Giddings could have sought work elsewhere if he did not want to sign the Employment Agreement. And, again, Media Lodge has made a judicial admission that it will not seek to enforce the damage limitation language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Giddings' last argument about substantive unconscionability is that the arbitration clause is unenforceable because it requires that arbitration occur in Atlanta, Georgia. Giddings contends that he has no connection to Georgia and that it would be unconscionable to require him to travel to Georgia at his own expense to pursue his rights against Media Lodge. Media Lodge had little explanation of why Georgia was selected as a venue for arbitration, but said at the hearing that it would \"not necessarily\" be insisting that the arbitration occur in Georgia.

Among other things, Section 5 states that Media Lodge can terminate Giddings' employment \"without any liability at any time\" and that Media Lodge's total liability for terminating Giddings \"shall be payment of his salary through the effective date of termination.\" Doc. 21-1 at 3.

Giddings appears to argue that the existence of such unenforceable prospective waiver language in Section 5 indicates that arbitration under the Employment Agreement was not meant to cover USERRA claims. Part of Giddings' argument is undercut by Media Lodge's judicial admission that it will not invoke damage limitation provisions in the Employment Agreement if the USERRA claims are subject to arbitration.

This would suggest that the parties were aware of the possibility of Giddings going on military leave.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The parties filed pleadings both in a lawsuit that Media Lodge and related plaintiffs filed against GunUp alleging fraud and breach of the merger agreement and in a lawsuit GunUp's CEO Hall filed against Media Lodge and related parties. Those pleadings included in places allegations about Media Lodge's alleged inappropriate treatment of Giddings' employment and about Giddings' alleged underperformance of his duties as a Media Lodge employee.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Giddings' letter to this Court also cited to\n    <em>\n     Quiles v.

After deciding that there was no valid, binding agreement to arbitrate, the district court in\n    <em>\n     Quiles\n    </em>\n    suggested that the arbitration agreement was also unenforceable because it failed to mention USERRA and USERRA requires that employees expressly waive their right to bring USERRA claims in federal court.\n    <em>\n     Quiles\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201592360\">\n     2017 WL 1592360\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *6.
