(\"Helms\") filed this action on June 20, 2017, challenging the constitutionality of Section 121 of New York's Multiple Dwelling Law\n   (\"MDL\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   passed into law on October 21, 2016 and colloquially referred to as the \"Airbnb Law.\" Section 121 prohibits advertising the use of a class A multiple dwelling for non-permanent residence purposes. The Complaint alleges that this provision is unconstitutionally vague, facially and as applied to Plaintiff, in violation of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants now move to dismiss the Complaint or in the alternative to stay the proceedings pending the conclusion of state court proceedings. For the reasons stated below, I deny the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    STATUTORY FRAMEWORK\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Two statutory provisions form the basis of the instant suit. Because of their importance to understanding the Complaint, I begin with describing them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The first provision is \u00a7 4(8) of the New York Multiple Dwelling Law (\"MDL\"). This provision defines the term \"class A\" dwelling, and prohibits\n   <em>\n    using\n   </em>\n   class A dwellings for non-permanent residence purposes. \u00a7 4(8)(a) defines a \"class A\" dwelling as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   A \"class A\" multiple dwelling is a multiple dwelling that is occupied for permanent residence purposes. This class shall include tenements, flat houses, maisonette apartments, apartment houses, apartment hotels ... and all other multiple dwellings except class B multiple dwellings. A class A multiple dwelling shall only be used for permanent residence purposes. For the purposes of this definition, \"permanent residence purposes\" shall consist of occupancy of a dwelling unit by the same natural person or family for thirty consecutive days or more ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Put simply, \u00a7 4(8) prohibits using a class A dwelling for non-permanent residence purposes. Furthermore, a \"class B\" dwelling, as contrasted with \"class A\" dwelling, is defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   A \"class B\" multiple dwelling is a multiple dwelling which is occupied, as a rule transiently, as the more or less temporary abode of individuals or families who are lodged with or without meals. This class shall include hotels, lodging houses, rooming houses, boarding houses, boarding schools, furnished room houses, lodgings, club houses, college and school dormitories and dwellings designed as private dwellings but occupied by one or two families with five or more transient boarders, roomers or lodgers in one household.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00a7 4(9). That is, whereas a class A building\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   be used for transient occupancy, a class B building can be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The second relevant provision is \u00a7 121 of the New York MDL. This provision prohibits\n   <em>\n    advertising\n   </em>\n   class A dwellings for illegal uses, where such uses are illegal under \u00a7 4(8). \u00a7 121(1) incorporates by reference \u00a7 4(8) and states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   It shall be unlawful to advertise occupancy or use of dwelling units in a class A multiple dwelling for occupancy that would violate subdivision eight of section four of this chapter defining a \"class A\" multiple dwelling as a multiple dwelling that is occupied for permanent residence purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   That is, \u00a7 121(1) prohibits advertising class A dwellings for non-permanent residence occupancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, \u00a7 121 also defines the term \"advertise,\" as the term is used in \u00a7 121(1). \u00a7 121(3) defines term \"advertise\" to mean as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   For the purposes of this section, the term \"advertise\" shall mean any form of communication for marketing that is used to encourage, persuade or manipulate viewers, readers or listeners into contracting for goods and/or services as may be viewed through various media including, but not limited to, newspapers, magazines, flyers, handbills, television commercials, radio, signage, direct mail, websites or text messages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   That is, the term \"advertise\" refers to communications intended to encourage persons into contracting for goods or services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    COMPLAINT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff Helms owns and operates The Broadway Hotel and Hostel (the \"Hotel\"), located at 230 West 101\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Street in New York City, a hotel with 126 rooms and which has been in use as a hotel for the last 75 years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\"), Dkt. No. 34 at \u00b6 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Hotel uses its 126 rooms for transient occupancy, or occupancy of less than 30 days, and advertises room vacancies on online websites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A short history of the hotel is useful. Before 1938, it was not legally required for buildings to have certificates of occupancies, or CO's, which describe what is and is not appropriate use of a building. \u00b6 20. Prior to 1938, and in lieu of CO's, the Department of Buildings maintained what were called \"I-Cards,\" which contained information relevant to the proper use and categorization of buildings. The Hotel's I-Cards designate the 126 rooms as class \"B\" single room occupancy units. \u00b6 22. In 1942, the Department of Buildings issued a CO to the Hotel for the first time, and the CO permitted the Hotel to use its rooms for transient occupancy. The CO however did not designate the Hotel as a class \"A\" or \"B\" building, but instead as \"Old Law Tenement, Single Room Occupancy.\" The parties dispute the implications of the I-Cards and CO to the current categorization of the Hotel as class A or class B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Defendants\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants, the City of New York and its associated enforcement entities, oppose the Hotel's use for transient occupancy. According to Defendants, it is illegal under New York State and City law for Helms to\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   its rooms for transient occupancy or to\n   <em>\n    advertise\n   </em>\n   use for transient occupancy. Defendants have attempted to sanction Helms for both of these illegal activities,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , illegal use and illegal advertising.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, regarding illegal use, Defendants issued Plaintiff citations on December 30, 2014, under N.Y.C. Administrative Code \u00a7 28-210.3, for illegally using the Hotel for transient occupancy. \u00a7 28-210.1 makes it \"unlawful for any person or entity who owns or occupies a ... dwelling unit classified for permanent residence purposes to use or occupy ... such multiple dwelling or dwelling unit for other than permanent residence purposes.\" The City contended in issuing its citation that Plaintiff's Hotel was a class A multiple dwelling and that its use for transient occupancy therefore violated \u00a7 4(8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A hearing officer, however, dismissed these violations. Examining the history of the Hotel's occupancy and the language of\n   the CO, the hearing officer found that the Hotel was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a class A dwelling and therefore did not violate \u00a7 4(8). The City appealed and, on February 2, 2017, the Environmental Control Board (\"ECB\"), the administrative body hearing the appeal, denied the appeal and upheld the hearing officer's dismissal. \u00b6 26.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York City v. Helms Realty Corp.\n   </em>\n   , ECB Appeal No. 1601223 (Feb. 2, 2017) (\"ECB Decision\") (Annexed as Exhibit D to the Declaration of Emily K. Stitelman, Dkt. No. 38, Ex. D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The City nevertheless persisted. Following the ECB decision, between February 10 and April 12 of 2017, the City issued Plaintiff 27 additional violations under N.Y.C. Administrative Code \u00a7 28-287.1 and MDL \u00a7 121, this time for unlawful\n   <em>\n    advertising\n   </em>\n   of the use of transient occupancy in a class A building. \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. These violations form the basis of the instant action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Instant Action\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The instant action, filed on June 20, 2017, alleges that the law under which the advertising violations were issued\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 121, is unconstitutional, facially and as applied to Plaintiff (Count I). In particular, Plaintiff alleges that the term \"class A\" dwelling and the term \"advertise\" are vague and fail to provide a reasonable person with notice of what conduct is proscribed. Plaintiff also alleges that \u00a7 121 is unconstitutional as applied to Plaintiff since Plaintiff\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   the legal right (as confirmed by the ECB decision) to use the Broadway Hotel for transient occupancy. According to Plaintiff, it cannot have violated \u00a7 121's prohibition on advertising illegal uses where it was already determined that Plaintiff's underlying use was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   illegal under \u00a7 4(8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In addition to its claims pursuant to the U.S. Constitution, the Complaint also (a) alleges violations of Article I, \u00a7 8 of the New York State Constitution (Count II),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (b) seeks a declaration, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 2202, that the Airbnb law is invalid and unconstitutional (Count III), (c) seeks damages under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count IV) and, finally, (d) seeks attorneys' fees under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count V). These Counts rise and fall with the success of Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   There are three state court proceedings relevant to this case. The first case, filed on April 28, 2017, is\n   <em>\n    Terrilee 97th Street LLC, v. City of New York, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Index No. 652306/2017 (Sup. Ct. N.Y.

It is a word \"of common usage that ha[s] plain and ordinary meaning[ ],\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gagliardi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046316\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/506/140/#p147\">\n    506 F.3d 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 147 (2d Cir. 2007), and the Multiple Dwelling Law defines \"advertise\" to mean (understandably) \"any form of communication for marketing that is used to encourage, persuade or manipulate viewers, readers or listeners into contracting for goods and/or services as may be viewed through various media.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 121(3). Helms' contention that \u00a7 121 would prohibit, for example, an article in a travel magazine detailing the writer's experience in a hotel lacks merit. The purpose of such a writing it to describe an experience. The purpose of the advertising that \u00a7 121 bans is to encourage readers into contracting for goods or services with the writer or with an entity the writer represents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Second, the definition of \"class A\" found in \u00a7 4(8) is also sufficiently clear. That provision defines \"class A\" as a dwelling for \"permanent residence purposes,\" and then further defines \"permanent residence purposes\" as occupancy by the same natural person or family for thirty consecutive days. There is nothing ambiguous about this definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In short, the terms \"advertise\" and \"class A\" are sufficiently clear, and the resulting statutory scheme is similarly clear. Read together, \u00a7 121(1) and \u00a7 121(3) prohibit the advertising of occupancy that would violate the provisions of \u00a7 4(8), where \u00a7 4(8) defines \"class A.\" It cannot be said that this statutory scheme fails \"to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits\" or that \"it authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\"\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414210\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/703/#p732\">\n    530 U.S. at 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414210\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/703/#p732\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Furthermore, given the clear scope of \u00a7 121, it is also clear that \u00a7 121 does not reach any constitutionally protected speech. \u00a7 121 prohibits the advertisement of\n   <em>\n    illegal\n   </em>\n   conduct,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the use of class A dwellings for uses prohibited by \u00a7 4(8). \"The government may ban forms of communication more likely to deceive the public than to inform it, or commercial speech related to illegal activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec.

An overbreadth challenge fails as well. \u00a7 121 is clear in that it prohibits\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   speech concerning illegal activity, which is not constitutionally protected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    3. As Applied Vagueness and First-Amendment Challenge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Helms also mounts an as-applied vagueness challenge and an as-applied First Amendment challenge to \u00a7 121, arguing that enforcement of \u00a7 121\n   <em>\n    against Helms\n   </em>\n   violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments. To state an as-applied vagueness challenge, Helms must show that the law failed to give it adequate notice that the conduct it engaged in was illegal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5408614\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/449/470/#p485\">\n    449 F.3d at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To state an as-applied First Amendment challenge, Helms must show that the (commercial) speech it engaged in was protected under the four-part test articulated in\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   At the heart of Helms' as-applied challenges is the fact that the City's ECB February 2 decision found that Helms did not violate \u00a7 4(8). Helms argues, relying on the ECB decision, that the City could not have found that Helms violated \u00a7 121 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , illegal advertising), since Helms was already found not to have violated \u00a7 4(8) (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the underlying illegal use). As Helms portrays it, the City is attempting to have a second shot at preventing Helms from operating its hotel after the City lost its first shot in litigating the \u00a7 4(8) violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The as-applied challenge is best understood not as a vagueness challenge (the statute is not in fact vague, as described above), but as a First Amendment challenge, the argument being that the City cannot restrict Helms' speech where Helms' speech does not concern illegal activity. Put differently, the challenge is that it is nonsensical for Helms to have been found to have violated \u00a7 121 since, by its own terms, \u00a7 121 only restricts advertising uses that are illegal under \u00a7 4(8), and the City found Helms not to be engaging in illegal uses under \u00a7 4(8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendants do not challenge the sufficiency of the as-applied challenges. Instead, Defendants move the court to abstain from adjudicating these challenges in light of state court proceedings. According to Defendants, whether in fact Helms violated \u00a7 4(8) is a question pending before the state courts\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   resolved by the ECB February 2 Decision.
