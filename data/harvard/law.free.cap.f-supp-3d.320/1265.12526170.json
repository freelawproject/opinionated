Inherent in that vindication are the ancillary benefits of stressing the importance of that right, educating law enforcement personnel as to proper procedures implicating that right, and clarifying the understanding of those who instruct law officers as to what is required to conform with the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff prevailed three times during trial and post-trial proceedings, namely in an early opinion of the court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the court's granting of Plaintiff's motion for a directed verdict,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and in the court's post-trial determination that Plaintiff was entitled to nominal damages as a matter of law because his Fourth Amendment rights were violated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff prevailed a fourth time by the affirmation of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In consideration of Plaintiff's application for attorney's fees and costs, the court held evidentiary hearings on December 7, 2017 and January 22, 2018 and closing arguments on January 31, 2018. Diana Huntsman appeared on behalf of Plaintiff, and Andrew Morse and R. Scott Young appeared on behalf of Defendants Kenneth Gates and Kenyon Madsen (\"Defendants\").

As further discussed below, Plaintiff is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred throughout the case, but the amount of such fees is subject to adjustments.

There, Justice O'Connor noted that not \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   nominal damages awards are\n   <em>\n    de minimis.\n   </em>\n   Nominal relief does not necessarily a nominal victory make.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, Justice O'Connor's concurrence \"distills various principles from the Court's \u00a7 1988 case law into a three-part test to determine whether a prevailing party achieved enough success to be entitled to an award of attorney's fees. The 'relevant indicia of success' in such cases are: (1) the difference between the judgment recovered and the recovery sought; (2) the significance of the legal issue on which the plaintiff prevailed; and (3) the public purpose of the litigation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Thus, under\n   <em>\n    Farrar\n   </em>\n   and Tenth Circuit precedent, although a party may recover no actual damages, insofar as his recovery was not merely technical or de minimis, he should still receive an appropriate, reasonable amount of attorney's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   There are essentially two issues before the court: (i) is Plaintiff entitled to an award of his attorney's fees and costs incurred throughout this litigation, and, if so, (ii) what is the appropriate amount of such award? Each issue will be addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Is Plaintiff Entitled to an Award of His Attorney's Fees and Costs?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The parties segregate this case into three separate stages of litigation-trial, post-trial motions, and appeal.

Applying Justice O'Connor's three-part\n   <em>\n    Farrar\n   </em>\n   test, the court finds awarding attorney's fee incurred through trial is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The first\n   <em>\n    Farrar\n   </em>\n   factor looks to the difference between the judgment recovered and the judgment sought. In the present case, Plaintiff acknowledges that he requested $450,000 in damages during trial but that he recovered only $1,\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   While Plaintiff's nominal damages are a limited recovery compared to what he sought, such discrepancy is substantially less than the discrepancy in\n   <em>\n    Farrar,\n   </em>\n   wherein the plaintiff sought $17 million in compensatory damages but received only $1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The second\n   <em>\n    Farrar\n   </em>\n   factor-the significance of the legal issue on which the plaintiff prevailed-weighs heavily in Plaintiff's favor. This factor \"goes beyond the actual relief awarded to examine the extent to which the plaintiffs succeeded on their theory of liability.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff proved that his Fourth Amendment rights had been violated as a matter of law. This is a significant victory achieved through trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The third\n   <em>\n    Farrar\n   </em>\n   factor-the public purpose of the litigation-also weighs in Plaintiff's favor. This litigation served several public purposes.

And such will benefit not only average citizens, whose Fourth Amendment rights are protected in the future from constitutionally deficient actions, but also other police officers, who are now more likely to be properly trained and thus face a lower risk of liability. Further, this litigation served the public purpose of fortifying the fact that, in the Tenth Circuit at least, nominal damages are mandatory upon a finding of a constitutional violation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   This clarity regarding nominal damages is important for future parties, as nominal damages affect the entry of a final judgment and a plaintiff's ability to vindicate his or her constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Tenth Circuit precedent supports this court's conclusion that, under the\n   <em>\n    Farrar\n   </em>\n   three-part test, Plaintiff achieved more than a technical or de minimis victory and should receive reasonable attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    Koopman v.

As a result of this case, the District is on notice that it must provide its employees with constitutionally adequate pretermination and post-termination hearings. This is a significant victory. Although it is true Koopman received only a nominal award, the present and future employees of the District benefit by having their rights affirmed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   It does not appear to us this is the kind of case\n   <em>\n    Farrar\n   </em>\n   was intended to discourage attorneys from taking. It is true Koopman was not successful in proving he was damaged, but we do not believe he and his attorney should bear the entire cost of battling the District's unconstitutional practices. Deterring meritorious lawsuits on constitutional issues because they offer a small likelihood of a significant money judgment presents as grave a danger to our legal system as frivolous litigation. In the past, we have attempted to balance these concerns in cases where nominal damages were awarded but which involved the vindication of a constitutional right of significance extending beyond the plaintiff by reducing rather than denying the award of attorney's fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   It is indisputable that Koopman did not prove actual damages and so under Farrar is not entitled to Ml reimbursement for attorney's fees and costs. Nonetheless, his lawsuit was successful in important ways. We remand the issue of the appropriate amount of attorney's fees and costs to the district court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Relevant to the present case, the Tenth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Koopman\n   </em>\n   determined that the plaintiff's minimal $1 recovery under the first\n   <em>\n    Farrar\n   </em>\n   factor did not bar plaintiff from receiving attorney's fees and costs. Instead, looking to the second and third\n   <em>\n    Farrar\n   </em>\n   factors-i.e., the plaintiff's vindication of his due process rights and the benefit this provided to fellow employees in notifying the employer that it must provide adequate pre-termination and post-termination hearings-the Tenth Circuit found that an appropriate amount of attorney's fees and costs should be awarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Branclau v. State of Kansas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11644053\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/168/1179/\">\n    168 F.3d 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 1999), the Tenth Circuit found an award of attorney's fees to be appropriate, despite the plaintiff's limited monetary recovery. In\n   <em>\n    Brandau\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff sued her former state employer on a number of claims, but she only prevailed on her claim for hostile work environment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury awarded her nominal damages of $1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   Applying the\n   <em>\n    Farrar\n   </em>\n   three-part test, the Tenth Circuit upheld the district court's decision to award the plaintiff attorney's fees:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   In this case, the district court applied precisely the analysis we adopted in\n   <em>\n    Phelps.\n   </em>\n   Analyzing the degree of success obtained, the first factor under\n   <em>\n    Farrar\n   </em>\n   , the court found that, despite Plaintiffs limited monetary recovery, her victory was not merely technical or de minimis; instead, the jury's \"verdict vindicated the violation of her civil rights.\" The court determined that the difference between the judgment recovered and the recovery sought was significantly distinct from the corresponding difference in\n   <em>\n    Farrar:\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's claims for damages were not extravagant-she sought only back pay for twenty-one months and $50,000 in non-economic damages-while Mr. Farrar sought damages of $17 million.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   The court also relied on the fact that, unlike Mr. Farrar's litigation which was drawn out over ten years and two appeals, Plaintiff's litigation was not protracted. Citing this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Koopman v. Water District No. 1\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413260\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/41/1417/\">\n    41 F.3d 1417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1421 (10th Cir.1994), the court determined that Plaintiff's nominal damage award did not preclude an award of fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   With respect to the second\n   <em>\n    Farrar\n   </em>\n   factor, the significance of the legal issue on which the plaintiff prevailed, the district court determined that Plaintiff succeeded on her primary claim, sexual harassment. Therefore, although she lost her retaliation and constructive discharge claims, Plaintiff \"succeeded on a 'significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit [she] sought in bringing suit.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, in examining the third factor, the public purpose served by the plaintiff's success, the district court weighed whether \"the judgment deters future lawless conduct as opposed to merely 'occupying the time and energy of counsel, court, and client.' \" The court found that Plaintiff presented \"evidence that supervisory personnel in [her] department had little training in how to investigate sexual harassment charges, and ... that, in this case, the department's policy on sexual harassment was not followed.\" Thus, the court found that, \"[a]s a result of this case, defendant is on notice that it must educate its employees about sexual harassment in the workplace and must promptly investigate any such claims,\" and \"the present and future employees of both the Wyandotte County Adult Probation Division, and of the State, benefit by having their rights affirmed.\" In short, the court found that while Plaintiffs litigation did not achieve significant monetary benefits, it served a larger public purpose. Although Defendant disputes whether such a benefit in fact occurred and argues that any benefit achieved is speculative, \"the [d]istrict [c]ourt was free, within the bounds of the clearly erroneous standard, to find that the lawsuit did benefit\" the employees of Kansas and Wyandotte County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   We conclude that the district court appropriately evaluated the reasonableness of a fee award to Plaintiff in light of controlling case law. We also hold that the court did not abuse its discretion in awarding to Plaintiff $41,598.13 in fees and expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As with\n   <em>\n    Koopman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Brandau\n   </em>\n   , application of the three-part\n   <em>\n    Farrar\n   </em>\n   test warrants a finding in the present case that Plaintiff is entitled to a reasonable amount of attorney's fees and costs. Plaintiff did not achieve merely a technical or de minimis victory: although Plaintiff recovered only limited monetary damages, he successfully vindicated his Fourth Amendment rights and provided a meaningful public benefit to Utah citizens and police officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Thus, the court finds Plaintiff is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred through trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Post-Trial Motions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Second, Plaintiff seeks attorney's fees incurred in post-trial motions. In this segment of litigation, Plaintiff largely prevailed. Although the court partially denied Plaintiff's post-trial motion,\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   in that the\n   court denied Plaintiff's request for compensatory damages and a new trial, the court granted the motion on two major issues. First, the court granted Plaintiff's request for nominal damages.

The court will address each matter in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    Reductions for Inexperience, Inadequate Time Entries, and Improper Billing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Defendants argue that, even if the court awards Plaintiff attorney's fees, such fees should be significantly reduced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants contend the fees should be reduced to account for Plaintiff's counsel's inexperience in civil rights matters; imprecise, excessive, duplicative, and unreliable time entries; and improper billing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As to Plaintiff's attorney's fees incurred through trial and post-trial motions, the court finds that the reductions Plaintiff's counsel has already voluntarily applied are sufficient to address the concerns raised by Defendants. The evidence indicates that Plaintiff's counsel discounted her attorney's fees incurred through trial by 40%-i.e., by $177,695-which translates to a discount of nearly one-third of all attorney's fees sought throughout the entire case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   This 40% discount is in addition to the discount Plaintiff's counsel also applied to her fee rate when she took Plaintiff's case: although her billing rate had been $275 per hour, she dropped that rate to $225 per hour due to her lack of experience in dealing with cases involving civil rights matters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court finds that no additional reductions are required for Plaintiff's attorney's fees incurred through trial and post-trial motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As to Plaintiff's attorney's fees incurred on appeal, the court generally finds them to be reasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n   The exception pertains to the attorney's fees generated in drafting Plaintiff's appellate brief. Plaintiff's counsel spent approximately 120 hours-approximately $23,750 in fees-in drafting Plaintiff's original 120-page appellee brief. This original brief did not comply with the applicable rules governing the length of appellee briefs, and thus it was rejected by the Tenth Circuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, Plaintiff filed a new 60-page appellee brief that was accepted by the Tenth Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The court finds that Plaintiff should not receive attorney's fees for a work product that was non-compliant and consequently not accepted as an appellee brief. Thus, Plaintiff is not entitled to the $23,750 fees incurred in what ended up being an extracurricular activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The court finds that no additional reductions are required and that Plaintiff is entitled to the remainder of attorney's fees incurred on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Contingency Enhancement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Plaintiff asks the court to consider enhancing Plaintiff's fee awards because Plaintiff's counsel took the case on a contingency basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Tenth Circuit instructs that a contingency enhancement should be viewed with caution and only awarded in \"exceptional cases.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Tenth Circuit describes an \"exceptional case\" to be one where \"prior to the litigation, the attorney for the prevailing party was confronted with a 'real risk of not prevailing.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court analyzes the risk of not prevailing by (i) considering the law in effect at the time the suit was filed and the extent to which the law was unsettled, and (ii) considering the extent to which the outcome of the case depended on resolution of disputed material facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Once a real risk of not prevailing has been demonstrated, the party seeking to enhance the lodestar must also come forward with evidence that, absent an enhancement, 'the plaintiff would have faced substantial difficulties in finding counsel in the local or other relevant market.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The present case does not appear to warrant a contingency enhancement. The court did not find the law surrounding Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment claims to be unsettled. Indeed, it was the established nature of the law that led the court to deny the Defendants' claims for qualified immunity. Additionally, while Plaintiff submitted evidence suggesting that Robert J. DeBry's law office-a personal injury firm-was disinterested in his case because it was not likely to make the firm enough money,\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff did not submit sufficient evidence that he had difficulty or would have had difficulty securing a civil rights attorney absent the prospect of a contingency enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As such, the court declines to apply a contingency enhancement to Plaintiff's attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   iii.\n   <em>\n    Current Billing Rate Enhancement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Plaintiff asks the court to enhance the attorney's fees awarded by calculating such fees using Plaintiff's counsel's current billing rate of $350 per hour, rather than the $225 rate Plaintiff's counsel charged throughout the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Tenth Circuit has instructed that \"[t]he hourly rate at which compensation is awarded should reflect rates in effect at the time the fee is being established by the court, rather than those in effect at the time the services were performed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \"[T]he court should establish, from the information provided to it and from its own analysis of the level of performance and skills of each lawyer whose work is to be compensated, a billing rate for each lawyer based upon the norm for comparable private firm lawyers in the area in which the court sits calculated as of the time the court awards fees.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    90\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The court finds that the evidence does not sufficiently support a rate adjustment beyond the $225 rate Plaintiff's counsel agreed to charge at the onset of the case. Although Plaintiff's counsel submitted an affidavit stating that her current rate is $350,\n   <footnotemark>\n    91\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's counsel did not otherwise provide evidence that she had actually submitted bills to clients or received payment of fees at a rate of $350 per hour.\n   <footnotemark>\n    92\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, the court finds that the amount of $225 is an appropriate hourly rate and is consistent with the court's own analysis of the efforts of counsel in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   iv.\n   <em>\n    Reductions for Degree of Success\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In determining the appropriate amount to award Plaintiff, the court is mindful of the Supreme Court's instruction in\n   <em>\n    Farrar\n   </em>\n   that the degree of success obtained is \"the most critical factor\" in considering the reasonableness of attorney's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    93\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   As Plaintiff acknowledges,\n   <footnotemark>\n    94\n   </footnotemark>\n   where the success achieved is minimal, a reduction in attorney's fees is warranted. In\n   <em>\n    Koopman\n   </em>\n   , after the Tenth Circuit remanded the case, the district court reduced the calculated fees by 60% for lack of success, awarding $15,351.56 in attorney's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    95\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Bell v. Board of County Com'rs of Jefferson County\n   </em>\n   , the Tenth Circuit affirmed a district court's reduction of the lodestar by 90% (from $168,888 to $16,888)\n   <footnotemark>\n    96\n   </footnotemark>\n   based on the plaintiff's lack of success:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Consistent with the Supreme Court's admonition that the degree of success is the most critical consideration in determining the reasonableness of a fee, the district court rightly emphasized the minimal success of the suit. Two of the claims failed outright, and the third did not secure any compensatory or equitable relief. The gross discrepancy between Bell's \"extravagant and overreaching\" request for $1.4 million and the jury's minimal award is particularly telling. The court's assessment of the other factors, previously discussed in response to particularized objections raised by Bell, lend additional support for its determination.

As such, the court reduces the $266,542.20 of attorney's fees incurred through trial by 65% for lack of success, leaving a total of $93,289.77 in attorney's fees incurred through trial available to Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    98\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   As previously discussed, in contrast to the case through trial, Plaintiff largely prevailed at both the post-trial and appellate stages of litigation.
