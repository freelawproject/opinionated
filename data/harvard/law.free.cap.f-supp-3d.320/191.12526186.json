Ex. A to Def.'s Mot. [Dkt. # 25-1] (\"Ex. A\") at 2. In January 2008, the VA awarded plaintiff monthly benefits for a medical condition found to be related to his military service.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. The VA rated this injury as ten percent disabling.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff appealed that decision on January 27, 2011, seeking additional benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex.

The VA apparently did not decide the appeal until June 12, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   While the VA found that other injuries plaintiff cited were service-connected, it rated them as zero percent disabling and therefore denied additional compensation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-3, 5. On June 14, 2017, the VA sent plaintiff a letter explaining that he would not receive any additional benefits since \"[t]he law says VA can't pay for disabilities that are less than 10% disabling.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. But it confirmed that plaintiff would continue to receive compensation at the ten percent disability rating, per the 2008 determination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff appealed the decision, and on June 24, 2017, the VA sent plaintiff another letter indicating that the appeal had been certified to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.

That court observed that plaintiff's complaint lacked \"information necessary for the Court's review of [p]laintiff's claims,\" so it ordered plaintiff to submit an amended complaint using the \"General Complaint\" form found on the court's website.

The complaint alleges that the Secretary of the VA and the President of the United States have \"conspired to cut or eliminate veteran disability payments.\" Compl.; Am. Compl. at 4. Plaintiff also claims that \"Bryan Ross reported [him] as deceased to stop disability payments.\" Compl.; Am. Compl. at 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff complains of \"age discrimination, fraud in filing false documents ..., conspiracy to deny medical attention, arbitrary and capricious claim, [and] intentional delay to cause [his] death ... prior to [the] resolution\" of his unanswered requests.
