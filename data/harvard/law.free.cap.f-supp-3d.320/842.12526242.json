First, Plaintiffs argue their case is different because they did not settle partnership items with the IRS.

As the Fifth Circuit has repeatedly declared, \"a refund court litigating or re-litigating a partnership item, such as the merits of the asserted \u00a7 6229 basis for an extension of the limitations period, is exactly the result prohibited by TEFRA.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodgers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12171961\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/181/#p184\">\n    843 F.3d at 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Irvine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3699887\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/729/455/#p459\">\n    729 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   461-62 ).
