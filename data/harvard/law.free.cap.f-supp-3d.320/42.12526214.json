The Court granted this motion on November 18, 2016, concluding that plaintiffs' challenge to the FFY 2005 and 2006 outlier determinations-as well as any new arguments regarding the FFY 2004 determination-were barred by the doctrines of claim and issue preclusion.

In Part VI.B, the Court considered the adequacy of HHS's explanation regarding its assumption \"that the rate at which charges had inflated between FYs 2000 and 2002 would accurately approximate charge growth\" and its failure to \"exclude charge data for the 123 historical turbo-chargers from its FY 2004 charge-inflation calculation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275613\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1323/#p1328\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275613\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1323/#p1328\">\n    at 1345-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court of Appeals found the plaintiffs' challenge on this point to be meritorious, holding that \"HHS acted arbitrarily and capriciously in failing to adequately explain why it did not adjust its projection cost-to-charge ratios downward.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275613\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1323/#p1328\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275613\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1323/#p1328\">\n    at 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals also determined that the 2005 and 2006 rulemaking suffered from this same flaw.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 1352-53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In light of the Court of Appeals' decision in\n   <em>\n    Banner Health\n   </em>\n   , defendant proposed that the Court lift the stay in this matter and enter a final order remanding to HHS. (Apr. 9, 2018 Joint Status Report at 2, ECF No. 29.) Plaintiffs did not oppose this proposal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On April 23, 2018, the Court directed the parties to submit proposed final orders with supporting briefs. (Order at 4, ECF No. 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In response, the parties filed competing submissions that request several alternate forms of relief. (Pls.' Submission, ECF No. 35; Def.'s Submission, ECF No. 36.) Plaintiffs ask the Court to reconsider the 2016 Partial Dismissal Order in light of the Court of Appeals' decision in\n   <em>\n    Banner Health\n   </em>\n   . (Pls.' Submission at 2, 5-6.) In the alternative, plaintiffs seek clarification of that ruling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.) Meanwhile, defendant requests partial summary judgment based on Part VI.C of\n   <em>\n    Banner Health\n   </em>\n   , where the Court of Appeals rejected the hospitals' arbitrary-and-capricious challenge to HHS's selection of only 50 hospitals as likely to be subject to reconciliation. (Def.'s Submission at 6 (citing\n   <em>\n    Banner Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275613\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1323/#p1328\">\n    867 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1346-48 ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Lastly, the parties dispute the scope of the remand to HHS. Plaintiffs argue that the remand should encompass the full scope of the issues identified for remand by the Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Banner Health\n   </em>\n   . (Pls.' Submission at 2-3 (requesting remand \"consistent with\n   <em>\n    Banner\n   </em>\n   Part VI in its entirety for the Hospitals with claims for 2004, and\n   <em>\n    Banner\n   </em>\n   Parts VI, VII, and VIII in their entirety for the Hospitals with claims for 2005 and 2006\").) By contrast, defendant argues that only the issue discussed in Part VI.B of\n   <em>\n    Banner Health\n   </em>\n   remains in this case after the Court's November 2016 ruling, and thus only this issue should be remanded to HHS. (Def.'s Submission at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiffs' Motion for Reconsideration of the 2016 Partial Dismissal Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs ask the Court to reconsider its 2016 Partial Dismissal Order, arguing that reconsideration is warranted because the ruling conflicts with the subsequent Circuit decision in\n   <em>\n    Banner Health v. Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275613\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1323/#p1328\">\n    867 F.3d 1323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 2017). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Submission at 2, 5-6.) Plaintiffs' argument appears to be that a conflict exists because\n   <em>\n    Banner Health\n   </em>\n   recognized that certain arbitrary-and-capricious challenges to the FFY 2005 and 2006 thresholds were meritorious, while the 2016 Partial Dismissal Order dismissed those challenges in this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs are mistaken in their assertion that there is a conflict. The Court's Memorandum Opinion did not analyze the merits of arbitrary-and-capricious challenges to the FFY 2005 and 2006 rulemaking. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. at 46-47.) Instead, it dismissed those challenges on the basis of claim and issue preclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court of Appeals' decision in\n   <em>\n    Banner Health\n   </em>\n   does not alter the analysis described by the Court\n   regarding the effects of claim and issue preclusion on plaintiffs' claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hardison v. Alexander\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3518905,1262181\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/655/1281/\">\n    655 F.2d 1281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1288-89 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (explaining that subsequent judicial decisions are not a basis to override the doctrine of res judicata in civil cases, absent extraordinary circumstances such as \"paramount questions of constitutional law or exclusive jurisdiction\"). The Court thus denies plaintiffs' request to reconsider its 2016 Partial Dismissal Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiffs' Request for Clarification of the 2016 Partial Dismissal Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs alternatively request that this Court clarify the preclusionary effects of its November 18, 2016 ruling in regards to the claims of some plaintiffs, HCA Hospitals, who have claims currently pending before another district court judge in\n   <em>\n    Galen Hospital Alaska, Inc. v. Azar\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-cv-728-RBW (D.D.C.). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Submission at 6-7.) Plaintiffs explain that in Galen a subset of the plaintiffs here, HCA Hospitals, have brought a challenge to the 2005 and 2006 outlier threshold rulemaking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) They seek for this Court to clarify that HCA Hospitals' 2005 and 2006 claims in\n   <em>\n    Galen\n   </em>\n   are not precluded by the 2016 Partial Dismissal Order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The preclusive effect of this Court's ruling is a determination to be made by the judge before whom the\n   <em>\n    Galen\n   </em>\n   case is pending.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4405, p. 82 (2d ed. 2002) ). Therefore, the issue of whether the HCA Hospitals are barred from bringing their 2005 and 2006 outlier threshold claims in\n   <em>\n    Galen\n   </em>\n   is not properly before this Court.

The\n   <em>\n    Banner Health\n   </em>\n   decision forecloses plaintiffs' challenge to the FFY 2004 determination that is based on the argument described in Part VI.C of\n   <em>\n    Banner Health\n   </em>\n   , and thus the Court grants defendant partial summary judgment only with respect to the challenges articulated in Part VI.C of\n   <em>\n    Banner\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Submission at 3; Def.'s Submission at 5-6.) However, the parties dispute whether the issue discussed in Part VI.D of\n   <em>\n    Banner Health\n   </em>\n   is an appropriate subject for remand from this Court:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   the application of a \"charge[-]inflation factor when predicting hospital charges for the 2004 fiscal year without adjusting [hospitals' cost-to-charge ratios].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275613\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1323/#p1328\">\n    867 F.3d at 1348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

Thus, the parties' dispute lies at whether the argument discussed in Part VI.D of\n   <em>\n    Banner Health\n   </em>\n   is within the issues identified for remand in\n   <em>\n    District Hospital I\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant argues that the issues encompassed by the\n   <em>\n    District Hospital I\n   </em>\n   remand are \"exclusively ... whether and how [HHS] adjusted [its] methods for calculating projected Medicare payments to account for past improper charging practices known as 'turbocharging.' \" (Def.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) By contrast, plaintiffs argue that HHS's discussion of cost-to-charge ratios in its Remand Explanation-which in turn was the subject of discussion in Part VI.D of\n   <em>\n    Banner Health\n   </em>\n   -was a direct response to the remand instruction in\n   <em>\n    District Hospital I\n   </em>\n   that HHS explain,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the \"measure[s] ... taken to account for the distorting effect that turbo-charging hospitals had on the dataset for the 2004 rulemaking.\" (Pls.' Submission at 3 (quoting\n   <em>\n    District Hospital I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222740,4191543\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/46/\">\n    786 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   60 ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court concludes that the issue discussed in Part VI.D of\n   <em>\n    Banner Health\n   </em>\n   is properly within the scope of the matters that remain in this case, as that portion of\n   <em>\n    Banner Health\n   </em>\n   relates to the FFY 2004 determination and focused on a section of HHS's Remand Explanation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%203%2C727\">\n    81 Fed.

It is perplexing why HHS would discuss its calculation of cost-to-charge ratios in its Remand Explanation only to now argue here that this issue was never within the scope of the remand from\n   <em>\n    District Hospital I\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court thus remands to HHS for further explanation of the FFY 2004 determination consistent with Parts VI.B and VI.D of\n   <em>\n    Banner Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275613\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1323/#p1328\">\n    867 F.3d at 1345-46, 1348-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, this Court denies plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration, denies plaintiffs' request for clarification, grants partial summary judgment to defendant with respect to the challenge to the FFY 2004 rule that was rejected by the Court of Appeals in Part VI.C of\n   <em>\n    Banner Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275613\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1323/#p1328\">\n    867 F.3d at 1346-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and remands to HHS for further proceedings consistent with Parts VI.B and VI.D of\n   <em>\n    Banner Health,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275613\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1323/#p1328\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275613\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1323/#p1328\">\n    at 1345-46, 1348-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A separate Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    To the extent defendant's submission may be construed as a request for summary judgment with respect to the challenges discussed in Part VI.D of\n    <em>\n     Banner Health\n    </em>\n    , the Court denies that request without prejudice. As explained\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , the FFY 2004 calculation of cost-to-charge ratios discussed in Part VI.D of\n    <em>\n     Banner Health\n    </em>\n    is within the scope of the Court's remand to HHS.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Plaintiffs also request that the Court's remand include the FFY 2005 and 2006 determinations. (Pls.' Submission at 5-6.) Given that the Court denies plaintiffs' request for reconsideration of the 2016 Partial Dismissal Order, the Court denies plaintiffs' request to remand to HHS for further explanation regarding its determinations from those years. Plaintiffs' 2005 and 2006 challenges are no longer part of this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
