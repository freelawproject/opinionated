(Order, ECF No. 9; Order, Case No. JKB-17-2939, ECF No. 46.) The cases involve Defendants' failure to respond to and act on a petition filed by Maryland pursuant to section 126(b) of the CAA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207426\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Now pending before the Court is Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 15) and Defendants' Cross-Motion on Remedy (ECF No. 26). The issues have been briefed (ECF Nos. 16, 27, 28, and 33) and no hearing is required,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 105.6 (D. Md. 2016). For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs' Motion will be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART and Defendants' Cross-Motion will be DENIED. Pursuant to its equitable powers, the Court will enter an order requiring Defendants to take final action either making Maryland's requested finding or denying the section 126(b) petition on or before September 15, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties agree on many of the relevant facts, including the fundamental requirements of the CAA that are at issue here. The CAA requires states to regulate sources of air pollution within their boundaries to meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards (\"NAAQS\") established by EPA. Any area that does not meet NAAQS is designated a \"nonattainment\" area and those areas that do meet NAAQS are designated \"attainment\" areas.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207407\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). States also must develop and submit to EPA State Implementation Plans (\"SIPs\")-comprehensive emission control plans that specify how the state will achieve and maintain NAAQS within the state.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207407\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 7407(a), 7410(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In addition to achieving attainment within their boundaries, states also are obligated to ensure that sources of air pollution within their boundaries do not \"contribute significantly\" to nonattainment in other states.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207407\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). In other words, states must account for the fact that source emissions do not respect artificial boundaries and do not simply stop at state lines. Rather, their impact may be felt hundreds of miles away in multiple other states. This section of the CAA is commonly referred to as the \"good neighbor\" provision. Not surprisingly, the Act provides recourse for those states that believe their neighbors are not fulfilling their obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Section 126 of the CAA provides that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Any State or political subdivision may petition the Administrator for a finding that any major source or group of stationary sources emits or would emit any air pollutant in violation of the prohibition of section 7410(a)(2)(D)(ii) of this title or this section [i.e., the \"good neighbor\" provision].\n   <em>\n    Within 60 days after receipt\n   </em>\n   of any petition under this subsection and after public hearing, the Administrator\n   <em>\n    shall make such a finding or deny the petition\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207426\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (emphasis added). If the Administrator makes a finding pursuant to \u00a7 7426(b), it is a violation of the Act \"for any major existing source to operate more than three months after such finding has been made with respect to it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207426\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7426(c).

(Maryland \u00a7 126(b) Petition, ECF No. 1-1.) Specifically, the petition contends that the 36 EGUs are emitting nitrogen oxides in a manner that significantly contributes to Maryland's nonattainment of the 2008 Ozone NAAQS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On January 3, 2017, Defendants granted themselves a six-month extension to respond to the petition pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(I0). Defendants, however, did not hold a public hearing or otherwise act on Maryland's petition within the new deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 20, 2017, Maryland provided notice to Defendants that it intended to file suit against them pursuant to the CAA's citizen suit provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207604\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). The plaintiffs in Case No. 17-2939 likewise provided notice to Defendants of their intent to file suit based on the Administrator's failure to perform a nondiscretionary duty.

Ozone is a \"secondary air pollutant\" that forms as a result of chemical reactions that often take place hundreds of miles from the emission source.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, EPA historically has attempted to address interstate transmission of ozone through regional rulemakings. These regional rulemakings have analyzed ozone precursor emissions only at a statewide level. Accordingly, \"EPA has not previously established policies and a methodology for evaluating whether\n   <em>\n    individual\n   </em>\n   sources ... are significantly contributing to nonattainment or interfering with maintenance for an ozone NAAQS in a downwind state in violation of the [good neighbor provision].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22 (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, Mr. Tsirigotis provides insight into EPA's internal procedure for evaluating the petition. For instance, he notes that EPA staff have been reviewing the petition for \"some months.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) And he explains that the issues presented in the petition \"will be raised to senior management in an organized process.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) Moreover, he notes that \"EPA may grant or deny the petition based on technical or policy factors from other existing programs or policies related to interstate transport of ozone.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Additionally, if EPA determines that some or all of the 36 EGUs are operating in violation of the good neighbor provision, it will need \"to develop emission limits and compliance schedules as appropriate\" to remedy the violation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Finally, Defendants will need to prepare a proposed action for publication in the Federal Register, hold a\n   public hearing on that proposal, and then prepare a final Federal Register package, explaining the agency's final decision and the deliberative process it employed. Essentially, Mr. Tsirigotis describes a thorough process for fact-gathering, analysis, synthesis, presentation, policy development, and eventual action on the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Third, Mr. Tsirigotis points to agency resource constraints and potential efficiencies that could be gained from Defendants' proposed timeline. He contends that \"EPA is unable to perform all activities that that [sic] Congress has directed it to perform and that EPA may want to perform, at any given time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Additionally, Mr. Tsirigotis notes that \"EPA currently has five other section 126(b) petitions pending that ask the EPA to make similar findings regarding different states.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) Defendants would like to address these petitions together to the extent practicable, especially because some petitions involve the same EGUs. Moreover, the same agency \"staff, resources, and expertise must be used to assess each of these separate section 126(b) petitions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) Accordingly, EPA believes that addressing the six petitions together will best achieve \"the goal of thorough, coordinated responses\" to the petitions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) Mr. Tsirigotis also points out that EPA's Office of Air and Radiation (\"OAR\") has a number of other mandatory \"statutory and court-ordered\" obligations that it must complete in 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mr. Tsirigotis's lengthy declaration, however, is also notable for what it does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   say. Nowhere does Mr. Tsirigotis say that it would be impossible for EPA to render a final decision on Maryland's petition within sixty days. Perhaps more importantly, Mr. Tsirigotis provides little in the way of explanation regarding EPA's attempts, if any, to comply with its mandatory obligations. Mr. Tsirigotis simply notes that agency staff has been reviewing the petition for \"some months.\" This is a far cry from the showing Defendants must make to satisfy their burden-that is, that the Administrator has \"employed the\n   <em>\n    utmost diligence\n   </em>\n   in discharging his statutory responsibilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662066\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/444/46/#p52\">\n    444 F.Supp.2d at 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Rather, Defendants provide a blueprint for how they would\n   <em>\n    like\n   </em>\n   to address Maryland's petition, seemingly with little regard for how they\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   address that petition. Some common themes emerge from Mr. Tsirigotis's declaration. EPA is busy. EPA has limited resources. And EPA has many competing demands on its limited resources. Moreover, the demand at issue here-responding to \u00a7 126(b) petitions regarding\n   ozone levels-is particularly challenging given the complex nature of measuring a given source's contribution to downwind ozone. The Court understands all of these concerns, and, were EPA granted unlimited discretion to prioritize its responsibilities, the Court would normally be loathe to presume to tell an agency such as EPA how to perform its regulatory duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   But that is not the situation in which the Court finds itself. On the contrary, Congress has determined that the Administrator must grant or deny a \u00a7 126(b) petition within sixty days. In other words, Congress has taken the decision out of the agency's hands and so too largely out of the Court's hands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662066\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/444/46/#p52\">\n    444 F.Supp.2d at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Although in most circumstances the Court defers to agency expertise about appropriate rulemaking procedures, such deference is inappropriate where Congress has unambiguously expressed its intent that these regulations be promulgated by a date certain and the agency manifestly has failed to fulfill this statutory obligation.\");\n   <em>\n    Gorsuch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3520719\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/554/1060/#p1062\">\n    554 F.Supp. at 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"While the Administrator should be commended for striving to develop the fullest possible statistical basis for any regulations she promulgates, that quest must give ground in favor of expedition where Congress expressly directs the Administrator to establish standards promptly.\");\n   <em>\n    Gorsuch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3510017\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/551/785/#p788\">\n    551 F.Supp. at 788-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he EPA envisions a level of thoroughness and scientific certainty not within the contemplation of Congress at the time it mandated the regulation of hazardous air pollutants.\").

Unlike the Connecticut petition that EPA was ordered to decide in sixty days, which identified only\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   upwind EGU, Maryland's petition identifies\n   <em>\n    thirty-six\n   </em>\n   EGUs in five different states. Indeed, even Congress seems to have recognized that the sixty-day deadline it imposed may be inadequate in many instances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(10) (allowing agency to extend its deadline to six months where \"necessary to afford the public, and the agency, adequate opportunity to carry out the purposes of this subsection\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court finds that the appropriate schedule lies somewhere between the requests of the parties. According to Defendants' proposed scheduled, as of now they should have already-developed a proposed action on Maryland's petition. (ECF No. 27-1, at 6.) Moreover, Defendants should be in the midst of publishing their proposed action (if they have not already) in the Federal Register. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Going forward, Defendants proposed a public hearing date of July 2, 2018, to be followed by a forty-five day public comment period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court believes these timelines are appropriate. The Court, however, believes that Defendants have allotted themselves an excessive amount of time to take final agency action following receipt of public comments, especially in light of Defendants' dilatory approach to date. Adopting Defendants' proposed timeline \"would effectively amount to condoning a fully discretionary approach to a nondiscretionary duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v. Browner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132772\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/130/78/#p95\">\n    130 F.Supp.2d 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 95 (D.D.C. 2001),\n   <em>\n    aff'd sub nom.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v.

Accordingly, the Court will order that Defendants sign a notice taking final agency action on Maryland's petition on or before September 15, 2018 (i.e., thirty days after the end of the public comment period and approximately 90 days from the Court's ruling).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In closing, the Court notes that it does not grant the above extension lightly. On the contrary, the Court is troubled by EPA's apparent unwillingness or inability to comply with its mandatory statutory duties within the timeline set by Congress. If EPA and the Administrator believe the timelines set by the CAA are unreasonable, they should seek an extension from Congress (in the form of an amendment),\n   not through the courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   EPA and the Administrator may not take seriously the deadlines set by Congress, but this Court expects and demands that they take seriously the deadlines set by it.

The plaintiff organizations argue that they have both organizational standing (i.e., standing to sue on their own behalf) and associational standing (i.e., standing to sue on behalf of their members). The Court need address only the latter of these two bases for standing. An organizational plaintiff has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when: \"(1) its members would otherwise have standing to sue as individuals; (2) the interests at stake are germane to the group's purpose; and (3) neither the claim made nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the suit.\"\n    <em>\n     White Tail Park, Inc. v.

The Chesapeake Bay Foundation has submitted declarations from two of its members and from its Vice President of Environmental Protection and Restoration.

(ECF No. 16-1 \u00b6 6-8.) These declarations satisfy the first two requirements for associational standing. Moreover, participation of individual members is not necessary in a case such as this that presents a pure question of law (i.e., Defendants' obligations under the CAA). Accordingly, the Court finds that the Chesapeake Bay Foundation has standing.

And he notes that a shorter timeframe would preclude EPA only from \"act[ing] on the six petitions in a coordinated manner.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) In other words, Mr. Tsirigotis seems to suggest, albeit implicitly, that EPA could in fact act on Maryland's petition in a shorter timeframe if it were not concerned with coordinating that response with the other pending \u00a7 126(b) petitions. Indeed, it seems that is exactly what EPA did with regard to Connecticut's petition when ordered to do so by a different court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    First, under the CAA, EPA must hold a public hearing after its proposed resolution of the petition has been published in the Federal Register.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207607\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(5).

Here, Plaintiffs have submitted an expert declaration that questions EPA's proposed timeline and the justification for it. (Dr. Sahu Decl., ECF No. 28-4, \u00b6 5 (opining that \"EPA is well equipped to quickly analyze Maryland's 126(b) petition ... using its\n    <em>\n     current\n    </em>\n    methodology-and\n    <em>\n     without having to invent new methodology\n    </em>\n    or new policy-... in a much faster and shorter time period than the year-long timeline proposed by EPA\").)
