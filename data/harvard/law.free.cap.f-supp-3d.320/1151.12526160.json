Christensen, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court is Defendant Republican National Committee's (\"RNC\") motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Defendant argues that this case should be dismissed because: (1) RNC's use of Plaintiff's photograph constituted a fair use under federal copyright law; (2) Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage; and (3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff's state law claim for intentional interference with economic advantage is preempted by federal copyright law. For the reasons explained below, the Court grants the motion in part and denies the motion in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Erika Peterman (\"Peterman\") is a photographer and is the author and owner of the copyright in Peterman's photograph (\"Work\"). Defendant RNC is a U.S. political organization responsible for developing and promoting the Republican political platform, as well as coordinating fundraising and election strategy. RNC previously campaigned on behalf of Montana U.S. Representative Greg Gianforte in Montana's Special Election to fill its lone Congressional seat in the U.S House of Representatives in 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 18, 2017, Peterman contracted with the Montana Democratic Party to take photographs at the annual Mansfield-Metcalf Dinner in Helena, Montana. She was asked to take photographs of Democratic Candidate Rob Quist (\"Quist\") who was the focus of the event. The Work depicts Quist, wearing a cattleman's hat from behind, with three bright lights in the distance. On March 21, 2017, Peterman edited and sent her photographs to the Montana Democratic Party and gave limited license to the Montana Democratic Party and Quist's campaign to use the Work. Peterman filed for registration of her Work with the U.S. Copyright Office on May 12, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 9, 2017, Peterman was notified that RNC had sent out mass direct mailings using her Work to negatively depict Quist. The image on the RNC mailer is a direct copy of Peterman's Work, altered with a treble clef inserted over the bottom left of the image and the text, \"For Montana Conservatives, Liberal Rob Quist Can't Hit the Right Note.\" The back of the mailers contained standard political advertisement disclaimer language that they were paid for by RNC and were not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 16, 2017, Peterman filed her Complaint against RNC alleging copyright infringement and intentional interference with economic advantage based on RNC copying, using, and distributing her Work. (Doc. 1.) On September 9, 2017, RNC filed a Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim, arguing that its use of the Work constituted a fair use under federal copyright law and that Peterman failed to state a claim for intentional interference with economic advantage. (Doc. 7.) Additionally, RNC argued that Peterman's state law claim for intentional interference with economic advantage was preempted by federal copyright law.

As alleged in the Complaint, RNC copied the whole of the visual Work and merely added a few lines of text that were critical of Quist, stating \"For Montana Conservatives, Liberal Rob Quist Can't Hit the Right Note\" in the lower-left quadrant. (Doc. 1-3 at 1.) Absent the inclusion of a treble clef attached to the commentary, the entirety of the visual aspects of the Work remain unaltered in RNC's use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   There is no basis in the pleadings for determining the existence and extent of any purpose or transformation of the Work at this stage. RNC added commentary, which may have altered the Work with new expression. Thus, RNC's use would establish a new purpose or new function. However, Peterman's purpose for the Work is not plain on the face of the pleadings and has yet to be developed. RNC alleges the purpose and function of the Work based on the Montana Democratic Party's use of the Work and not Peterman's use of the Work. Therefore, the purpose of the Work remains a disputed issue of fact for a finding of fair use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Further, the character of RNC's use appears to be minimally transformative. The Work was not altered from Peterman's original photograph, and instead similar to\n   <em>\n    Monge\n   </em>\n   , where the Ninth Circuit found \"wholesale copying sprinkled with written commentary...at best minimally transformative,\" RNC left the inherent character of the image unchanged and only included short written commentary. Additionally, as\n   <em>\n    Monge\n   </em>\n   illustrates, RNC's separate purpose or function for the Work of criticizing Quist by itself does not necessarily create a new work that alters the Work's expression. Separate purpose is not the same thing as transformation, which is the critical inquiry at this juncture. Therefore, because the Work's purpose remains a disputed issue of fact and the transformative character of the use appears marginal, the purpose and character of the use factor weighs against a finding of fair use at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

A side-by-side comparison of the Work and RNC's mailer shows that RNC attempted to qualitatively retain the whole of the visual aspects of the Work in order to comment on Quist's musical background as it applied to his political career. The mailer reproduces the original balance of the photograph, the illuminated cowboy hat atop Quist's head, the three stage lights in the distance, and a dark background to juxtapose its commentary with the appearance that Quist is giving a musical performance. (Doc. 1-3 at 1.) The only alteration present from the original Work is RNC's inclusion of a treble clef attached to its commentary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Consequently, both the amount and substantiality of the Work RNC used for its political mailers either weighs neutrally or against a finding of fair use. RNC used substantially all the Work quantitatively as the entirety of the Work was copied. Further, the qualitative aspects of the Work were maintained in RNC's use for its intended purpose to criticize Quist's political career in conjunction with his musical background.

Construing the pleadings in favor of Peterman, it is uncertain whether the use of the Work in a political mailing criticizing Quist is likely to diminish the potential sale of the Work, interfere with the marketability of the Work, or fulfill the demand for the Work. The only evidence available in the pleadings about the market for the Work was that Peterman was contacted by the Montana Democratic Party to create the Work, that Peterman gave limited license to the Work to the Montana Democratic Party and the Quist campaign, and that RNC used the Work in a political mailer. (Doc. 1 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   RNC's use of the Work may have potentially prejudiced further derivative use of the Work by Peterman, however such evidence is not available on the face of the pleadings. Likewise, though RNC's use would not likely substitute for the Work, and may have served a different market function, there is no plain evidence in the pleadings to determine what effect RNC's use had on the Work. Finally, as the transformative purpose and character of the use remains a disputed issue of fact in the analysis above, it is additionally premature to determine what effect RNC's use had on the potential market for the Work. Accordingly, a finding of fair use on the market effect of the use is premature on this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Having weighed each of the fair use factors, and resolving all issues in favor of Peterman under the allegations in the Complaint, the Court finds that disputed issues of material fact remain on whether RNC's use of Peterman's Work constituted a fair use. Thus, RNC's Motion to Dismiss on Count I is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   RNC next seeks dismissal of Peterman's intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim. Peterman asserts that RNC's use of the Work for a use opposite than intended has caused Peterman damages and interfered with Peterman's prospective economic advantage and business relations. (Doc. 1 at 9.) To state a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, a plaintiff must adequately plead that the defendant's acts: \"(1) are intentional and willful; (2) are calculated to cause damage to the plaintiff's business; (3) are done with the unlawful purpose of causing damage or loss, without right or justifiable cause on the part of the actor; and (4) result in actual damages or loss.\"\n   <em>\n    Victory Ins.

Under the Ninth Circuit's framework in\n   <em>\n    Sybersound\n   </em>\n   , Peterman's state claim is preempted because the content of the asserted right under state law falls within the subject matter of copyright, and the right asserted under state law is equivalent to the exclusive rights contained in federal copyright law. Peterman's claim is supported solely on RNC's alleged infringing use of the Work, a work protected by federal copyright law. Further, the state law claim's strict reliance on the infringing use of Peterman's Work as support for the action is equivalent to the exclusive rights granted under federal copyright law. Peterman's state law claim is therefore preempted because of its dependence on RNC's use of the Work, a claim already secured by federal copyright law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Further, Peterman's intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim is predicated on RNC's unauthorized use of her Work in violation of her copyright, and as a result, is not \"qualitatively different\" from Peterman's copyright infringement claim. Peterman potentially claims an \"extra element\" as the potential loss of business as a result of RNC's use of the Work during a time when the Work had special and increased value. However, Peterman's claim does not assert an extra element that fundamentally changes the nature of her claim to distinguish it from her copyright infringement claim because it relies on the unauthorized use of her Work as support. (Doc. 1 at 9.) Like the tortious interference claim presented in\n   <em>\n    Harper\n   </em>\n   , Peterman's intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim alleges a violation of essentially the same exclusive rights provided for by federal copyright law. The Copyright Act already protects the exclusive right of distribution. Consequently, Peterman's state law claim is preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Peterman has not identified an independent theory of interference with economic advantage apart from RNC's unauthorized use of the Work that would allow her to plead it outside of federal copyright law. The Complaint does not contain any specific facts regarding any economic advantage Peterman had that was damaged by RNC's use of the Work outside of the alleged infringement. (Doc. 1 at 9.) Further, the Complaint fails to include facts suggesting that it was plausible that RNC's actions were calculated to cause damage to Peterman's photography business or that RNC's actions resulted in actual damage or loss to state a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) To any extent Peterman's claim is not preempted by federal copyright law, Peterman has additionally failed to state a claim for relief. Thus, RNC's Motion to Dismiss on Count II is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that Defendant's Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim (Doc. 7) is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Count I is DENIED and Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Count II is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
