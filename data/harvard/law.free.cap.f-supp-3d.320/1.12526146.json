(\"BHM\"), a medical review service provider, seeks a preliminary injunction against URAC, Inc.'s (\"URAC\") revocation of its accreditation as an independent review organization. Am. Compl. 1, ECF No. 15. BHM argues that URAC applied its review standards arbitrarily and capriciously, violated BHM's common law due process rights and breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and that without an injunction, its business will suffer significant loss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 169-93.

Given these considerations, the plain language of the provision, and the similarities between this case and the examples cited by the parties, all operating against the backdrop of a presumption of enforceability of exculpatory clauses, I find that the exculpatory clause in the parties' contract precludes judicial review of this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

So, URAC is the sole accrediting organization sanctioned by the Government to determine which entities can provide IRO services, and organizations on both the supply (subject to the ACA and/or and seeking IRO services) and demand (seeking to provide IRO services) sides are bound by its determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Having the United States Government's imprimatur is significant, as shown here by BHM's testimony that the market has increasingly required URAC accreditation and its estimation that a majority of its IRO revenues is now accreditation-dependent. Supp. Johnson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 25; Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 170.

Thus, that URAC accreditation is codified in Government regulations sets this situation apart from the mine-run of cases where applicants are free to choose whether to seek accreditation or certification.

Based on the evidence presented, the Accreditation Committee decided to revoke BHM's accreditation and informed BHM of its right to appeal to the Executive Committee, which may accept, reject, or modify the Accreditation Committee's decision.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34, 39;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   Ex.

This process-which provided for a multi-step process with blind grading at each critical stage and the opportunity to respond to the revocation decision in writing-is not unreasonably favorable to URAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   BHM challenges aspects of each step of the process as deficient. It does not dispute URAC's authority or decision here to conduct a \"for cause\" review but alleges that the for cause review team did not offer BHM an entrance or exit conference\n   or spend meaningful time with senior leadership, that it did not permit management to be present during the interviews with staff, and that BHM leadership lacked the opportunity to discuss the team's initial findings or answer any questions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 51, 53-55, 57-58. It also alleges that URAC provided only summary information about why it was revoking BHM's accreditation, that URAC expanded the scope of the review beyond the scope of the initial grievance filed, and that it is unsure what information URAC used in making the revocation decision and appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52, 70, 88, 95. It also quarrels with the appeals process, objecting to not being permitted to review the redacted (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , blinded) version of its appeal documents, not being provided a copy of any other materials put before the Executive Committee, and being refused to present its appeal in-person to the Executive Committee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 92-94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   But focusing on these complaints misses the forest for the trees. Ultimately, these tiffs do not alter the big picture; that BHM received written notice of the elements on which it was considered non-compliant and the reasons for the determinations, it was provided an opportunity to present written arguments, and its internal appeal went through two layers of blinded evaluation. Both the terms of the contract and the process afforded to BHM are not so outrageously unfair as to shock the judicial conscience, and the Contract is therefore not substantively unconscionable. So, the Court will dismiss BHM's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    B. A Preliminary Injunction Should Not Be Granted, as BHM Has Not Shown a Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The enforceable exculpatory clause of the parties' Contract settles this lawsuit. Even balancing the four preliminary injunction factors, however, BHM would not be entitled to a preliminary injunction.

BHM's action is based on the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and its common law due process rights. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 187-93.

But given the similarities between the industries-both the higher education and IRO services industries are highly regulated, both provide services affecting the public, and both involve accreditation from private organizations-it is appropriate to follow the same standard in this accreditation context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Under this deferential analysis, URAC's decision was not arbitrary or capricious. For each of the four standards upheld by URAC's Executive Committee, BHM argues that URAC considered the \"wrong\" evidence or should have employed other procedures to ensure that it obtained and considered the \"right\" evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for Prelim. Inj. 10-16. As detailed in Section I.B., the arguments that BHM makes\n   to this Court largely mirror those that it advanced in its 26-page written appeal to the Executive Committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Committee's decision to uphold the findings are supported by the record. For example, for Core Requirement 4(b), not even BHM disputes the fact that it failed to file the annual report necessary for incorporation in Florida, and that its corporate status was dissolved for months as a result. BHM Appeal 7. It argues for essentially a \"no harm, no foul\" rule because its corporate status was reinstated and made retroactive, but this does not change the fact that the evidence still supports a finding of non-compliance.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075870\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/161/#p170\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For Core Requirement 13(a), BHM argues that URAC should have spoken with BHM's CIO instead of the clinical specialists who showed that they could access the drop-down menu that permits changes to be made to a reviewer's decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. Again, the evidence-which not only involved this demonstration, but other testimonial evidence as well-supports URAC's finding, and it was entitled to fashion its investigation in a way that efficiently and sufficiently answered its inquiries. Am. Compl. Ex. 1 Attach 12. Who URAC selects to interview, as well as what questions it asks, and whether and to what extent it conducts any follow-up, are matters within its discretion that neither BHM nor this Court should dictate. The same analysis applies for Core Requirements 17(a)(ii) and 32(b). BHM disputes URAC's substantive findings and argues that URAC should have ceded to BHM's explanations for its seeming non-compliance. Mot. for Prelim. Inj. 11-14, 15-16. But URAC, on three separate occasions, two of which were on a blinded basis, determined that evidence gathered during the for-cause investigation was enough to sustain a finding. The final decision-maker, the Executive Committee, made its decision with the benefit of BHM's written appeal. This Court will not disturb these findings, which were made upon review of the facts by a knowledgeable entity with subject matter expertise, when they are supported by the record and adequately explained by URAC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Dismiss 27-33 (explaining its determinations);\n   <em>\n    Kumar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347798\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/174/172/#p190\">\n    174 F.Supp.3d at 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2016) (an arbitrary or capricious decision is one that \"could not be fairly characterized as the product of reasoned decision-making.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As for URAC's decision-making process, the record shows that it followed \"fundamental principles of fairness.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Med.

As described in greater detail in Section I. A.2., URAC followed its written procedures throughout this process, involving: receiving a grievance, conducting a preliminary investigation, starting a for cause review, conducting a site visit, making a determination, and considering and resolving an appeal. There is no evidence of bias against BHM at any point throughout the proceedings; indeed, both the Accreditation and the Executive Committees considered the evidence and made their decisions on a blinded basis. Members of these committees also are unpaid volunteers and not URAC employees. At the Executive Committee level, BHM submitted a written appeal to advocate its case. And as evidence of the process working, the Executive Committee overturned three of the seven findings below. These steps-the several levels of independent and unbiased review with the opportunity to respond-satisfy any common law due process rights that BHM has.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In summary, BHM cannot show a likelihood of success on the merits, both because of the exculpatory language in the parties' Contract and because URAC's determinations were the product of reasoned decision-making and a fair process. I conclude that BHM's inability to succeed on\n   the merits is determinative and warrants a denial of the its Motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    C. URAC's Motion to Dismiss Should Be Granted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Because the parties' contractual language is valid and enforceable, URAC's Motion to Dismiss must be granted. BHM's Amended Complaint, even if the allegations it contains are assumed to be true, does not state claims for which the Court may grant relief, as BHM agreed to the exculpatory clause that precludes it from pursuing legal action for URAC's revocation decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The parties here agree that URAC may be the only accrediting entity for IROs, TRO Hr'g Tr. 21, May 21, 2018, but it is also undisputed that BHM successfully operated for a decade before initially seeking and obtaining URAC accreditation. Supp. Johnson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 25. While passage of the ACA may have made accreditation more valuable, and indeed, necessary for many contracts, it is not necessarily the case that BHM could not sustain a successful business model without URAC accreditation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    I stop short of reaching this question because the regulation issued over a year after the parties signed the Contract and the record is not fully developed about the state of the IRO industry when the parties signed the Contract.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    URAC contends that the duty of good faith and fair dealing does not cover challenges to accreditation decisions, and quotes from cases where courts have dismissed accreditation actions brought under breach of contract.

I therefore assume for the sake of argument that in the District of Columbia, an accreditation decision can be reviewed under an arbitrary and capricious standard.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Because this case must be dismissed under the exculpatory clause, the Court need not linger on the other preliminary injunction factors. But consideration of these factors demonstrates that BHM would not be entitled to an injunction in any case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The Court agrees that BHM likely suffered significant reputational harm resulting from a revocation of its accreditation. Though BHM did not provide any concrete evidence of a loss of clients, and though URAC has since re-accredited BHM for 2018, the Court assumes that the \"irreparable harm\" factor would tip in BHM's favor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The balance of equities in this case is in equipoise. It is true that URAC is the sole accrediting entity that governs who may provide IRO services under the ACA. Thus, a loss of URAC accreditation harms BHM's capacity to conduct third party reviews for several clients. However, URAC's status as the sole accrediting entity also means that public trust in the fairness and efficacy of its review processes is paramount. The perception that it may permit non-compliant entities to continue providing critical, medical services would severely erode this trust.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Finally, the public interest is better served by denying a preliminary injunction. BHM argues that its lack of accreditation \"disrupt[s] reviews of medical decisions for hundreds of patients and health plans, delaying prior authorization and coverage determinations until the health plans and patients can resubmit their cases to other IROs.\" Mot. for Prelim. Inj. 29. However, BHM has not cited any support for this claim, and other accredited IROs could likely step in to service BHM's clients. Thus, it does not appear that any public harm would be long-lasting. On the other hand, as discussed, the ability of the public to trust URAC-accredited entities is of the utmost importance due to URAC's status as the sole accrediting organization.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
