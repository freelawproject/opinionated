Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case began with a complaint filed in Ozaukee County Circuit Court on January 15, 2014, dkt. no. 1-1, and culminated in a five-day jury trial in federal court, with the jury returning a $2 million dollar verdict for the plaintiff on September 28, 2017, dkt. no. 337. The defendants timely filed a Rule 50(b) motion for a judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, a Rule 59 motion for new trial. Dkt. No. 344. After the plaintiff filed a brief opposing that motion, dkt. no. 354, the parties filed a stipulation, notifying the court that they had reached a settlement in principle and asking the court not to enter judgment on the jury's verdict, dkt. no. 355.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 19, 2018, the parties filed a \"Stipulated Order of Dismissal With Prejudice,\" dkt. no. 357; the stipulation provided that the court would vacate \"A. all prior rulings of the Court; B. all prior findings regarding damages, costs and fees; C. all prior rulings regarding summary judgment, motions in limine and evidentiary matters; and D. the September 15, 2017 jury verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The stipulation also provided that the court \"shall retain jurisdiction of this matter and the Parties to enforce the Confidential Settlement Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A week later, on February 26, 2018, the court issued an order construing the stipulation as a motion for vacatur under Rule 60(b). Dkt. No. 358. The court's order recounted the case law regarding motions for vacatur, and concluded that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   if, as the court believes, the parties require the court to grant their Rule 60(b)(6) motion in order to effectuate the settlement, it would be helpful to the court if they would provide it with information regarding the balance of equities in relation to the vacatur provision of the settlement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dkt.

In reviewing that brief, the court noted that the parties had asked the court to vacate \"all prior rulings of the court\"-apparently a request that the court vacate not only any substantive rulings, but any rulings on motions to seal and other procedural rulings. In an April 13, 2018 order, the court identified this issue and asked the parties to provide an additional submission detailing the specific court orders they wanted the court to vacate. Dkt. No. 360. The parties responded on April 24, 2018, asking that the court constrain the motion for vacatur to the following docket entries: Dkt. Nos. 39 (order denying motion to dismiss); 81 (order granting in part and denying in part motion to dismiss); 215 (order granting in part and denying in part motion for summary judgment); 242 (order granting in part and denying in part motion to reconsider summary judgment); 255 (order denying motion to compel); 274 (order denying sanction and granting motion to preclude expert); 324 (text-only order dismissing Great Lakes Spine Group, LLC as a defendant); 337 (jury verdict); 340 (minute order from final pretrial conference); 341 (order resolving motions\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   ); and 342 (minute entry denying defendants' post-trial motion), as well as three text-only orders entered on March 4, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

This is a far more extensive request than the one made in\n   <em>\n    Mayes\n   </em>\n   , where \"the parties [sought] vacatur only of the jury verdict and final judgment but not, critically, of any prior opinions or orders of the Court, including its summary judgment decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Mayes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4166787\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/631/1082/#p1088\">\n    631 F.Supp.2d at 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Nonetheless, the court recognizes that its opinions do not bind other judges in other cases. This court's pre-trial decisions would have only persuasive authority in future cases, and given the unique implosion of a business relationship that sparked (and fueled) this litigation, the court agrees that its decisions might have only limited persuasive authority, at that. While the court admits some frustration with the fact that it spent hours of resources writing the decisions that the parties now seek to vacate-hours that would have been saved had the parties reached agreement before trial-it would be nothing but hubris for the court to conclude that these decisions constituted important precedent on Wisconsin law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Public Interests-Preclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   With regard to preclusion, the parties argue that a vacatur will have no impact on issue or claim preclusion, because the court has not entered a final judgment in the case.

Dkt. No. 355. For the parties to ask the court to forestall entering judgment on the jury verdict, and then argue that there can be no preclusion because there is no judgment, appears somewhat disingenuous. That being said, the court has an obligation to analyze the parties' argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Had the parties not asked the court to withhold entering judgment so that they could finalize a settlement-a settlement that the court now knows is conditioned on vacatur-the court would have entered\n   judgment in favor of the plaintiff on the jury's verdict. In order to analyze this factor, the court will imagine for the sake of argument that it had entered a judgment consistent with the jury's verdict, and will analyze the impact that vacating that judgment would have on the future application of preclusion doctrines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   If the court grants the parties' motion for vacatur of that imaginary judgment, it would deprive any subsequent court of the ability to dismiss any future litigation involving these parties on the grounds of claim preclusion or issue preclusion (referred to collectively as\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

That means that the court has no way to evaluate whether the agreement represented a fair compromise in light of the jury's $2 million verdict (a question other courts have considered in ruling on vacatur motions).

When the dismissal is pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2), which specifies that the action \"shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff's instance save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper,\" the parties' compliance with the terms of the settlement contract (or the court's \"retention of jurisdiction\" over the settlement contract) may, in the court's discretion, be one of the terms set forth in the order. Even when, as occurred here, the dismissal is pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(ii) (which does not by its terms empower a district court to attach conditions to the parties' stipulation of dismissal) we think the court is authorized to embody the settlement contract in its dismissal order (or, what has the same effect, retain jurisdiction over the settlement contract) if the parties agree.
