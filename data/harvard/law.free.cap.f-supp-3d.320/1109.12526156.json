INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Lou Moua is a former employee of Defendant Optum Services, Inc. (\"Optum\"), and its parent company, UnitedHealth Group, Inc. (\"UHG\"). Plaintiff brings this action alleging various violations of state law arising out of her employment and the termination of her employment. (Dkt. 1-2 [Complaint, hereinafter \"Compl.\"].) Defendants now move to compel arbitration. (Dkts. 9 [Notice of Motion and Motion], 9-2 [Memorandum of Points and Authorities, hereinafter \"Mot.\"].) Defendants claim that Plaintiff entered into an arbitration agreement that covers the instant dispute. For the following reasons, the Court finds that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable and DENIES Defendants' motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that she began working for Optum on or about January 31, 2005, as a Claims Representative. (Compl. \u00b6 9.) According to Defendants, Plaintiff's employment with Optum was terminated on July 3, 2007. (Dkt. 13-1 [Declaration of Amy Gregoire] \u00b6 4.) Then, in February 2008, Plaintiff applied for a Claims Examiner position with UHG and was rehired, effective March 31, 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When Plaintiff was re-hired, she received an offer letter, dated March 18, 2008. (Dkt. 9-6 Ex. 1.) The second page of the letter includes a section entitled: \"Conditions of Your Employment with UnitedHealth Group.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) This section explains that Plaintiff's employment was conditional on her agreement to arbitrate all employment-related disputes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It also states that Plaintiff would be required to \"electronically acknowledge\" her understanding of the arbitration agreement once she began her employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The offer letter also attaches a copy of UHG's Employment Arbitration Policy (\"Policy\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-17 [Policy].) The Policy contains various provisions indicating what types of disputes are covered by arbitration and the rules governing the arbitration\n   proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   ) As relevant here, Section D of the Policy contains a modification provision that allows UHG to modify or terminate the terms of the agreement. The modification provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   UnitedHealth Group reserves the right to amend, modify, or terminate the Policy effective on January 1 of any year after providing at least 30 days notice of its intent and the substance of any amendment, modification, or termination of the Policy. Notice may be effected by the positing of the notice on the UnitedHealth Group intranet website. The Policy may only be amended, modified, or terminated in writing, effective on January 1 of any year, by the authority of the Senior Executive for Human Capital.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 D.) Further, Section E provides that \"[a]ll arbitrations shall be conducted in accordance with the Policy in effect on the date the Corporate Employee Relations Department receives the Demand for Arbitration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 E \u00b6 2.) The Policy also provides that a court may sever any portion of the Policy that is found void or unenforceable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 C.23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 31, 2008, Plaintiff electronically acknowledged review and receipt of the Policy. (Dkt. 9-6 Ex. 2.) Defendants attach the copy of the Policy that Plaintiff signed to their motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Nevertheless, Plaintiff declares that she was not informed about any arbitration agreement, including the Policy. (Dkt. 12-1 [Declaration of Lou Moua] \u00b6 4.) Plaintiff attests that no one explained how the Policy operates, whether it was required, or whether she could negotiate the terms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5, 7-9.) Plaintiff further declares that she was not provided a copy of the arbitration rules, including those of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that her employment was terminated as of May 16, 2016. (Compl. \u00b6 17.) At the time, Defendants represented that the termination was a result of the company's decision to relocate Plaintiff's entire department from California to other states. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Plaintiff claims that this purported explanation is pretext for Defendants' true motive, which includes discrimination and an unwillingness to provide Plaintiff with reasonable accommodations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Accordingly, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendants on August 4, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl.) Defendants now move to compel arbitration based on the terms of the Policy, federal law, and California state law. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mot.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

(Dkt. 12 [Opposition, hereinafter \"Opp.\"] at 9.) Section D provides that UHG may make any such modification, in writing, after providing 30 days' notice. (Policy \u00a7 D.) Section E further provides that any arbitration will be conducted under the terms of the Policy that was in effect on the date \"the Corporate Employee Relations Department receives the Demand for Arbitration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 E \u00b6 2.) Under these provisions, UHG may alter or terminate the Policy, without any employee's consent, and the alteration or termination would apply to a claim that has already accrued but for which a Demand for Arbitration has not yet been served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Peleg v.

The provision stated that \"the employer may amend, modify, or revoke the arbitration contract on 30 days' written notice; at the end of the 30-day period, a contract change applies to any claim that has not been filed with the American Arbitration Association (AAA).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1432-33,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=140%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2038\">\n    140 Cal.Rptr.3d 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court found that this provision rendered the contract illusory under California law because it allowed modifications to apply to claims that had already accrued at the time of the modification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1465,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=140%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2038\">\n    140 Cal.Rptr.3d 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, the provision expressly provided that any modifications would not apply\n   to claims that had been\n   <em>\n    filed\n   </em>\n   before the modification was implemented. But, the modifications would apply to claims that the employer knew about or that had already accrued, if those claims had not been filed with the AAA. This made it possible for the employer to unilaterally change the terms of the agreement to its benefit when it anticipated a particular claim would be filed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1459,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=140%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2038\">\n    140 Cal.Rptr.3d 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The vice of the modification provision in this case is that it allows the employer to manipulate the arbitration process, tailoring it to fit specific cases, either by making the process more difficult or more expensive for the employee, or by revoking the Agreement in the belief that a judicial forum is preferable.\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12441499\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/248/373/#p385\">\n    248 Cal.

The court held that agreements that are silent on the issue are not rendered illusory because the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing restricts modifications from applying to accrued or known claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1465,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=140%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2038\">\n    140 Cal.Rptr.3d 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A unilateral modification provision that is silent as to whether contract changes apply to claims, accrued or known, is impliedly restricted by the covenant so that changes do not apply to such claims.\"). However, if \"a modification provision expressly addresses whether contract changes apply to claims that have accrued or are known to the employer, the covenant cannot create implied terms that contradict the express language.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=140%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2038\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead, such a modification provision renders the agreement illusory.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=140%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%2038\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The principles articulated in\n   <em>\n    Peleg\n   </em>\n   directly apply here. The Policy here states that the only claims exempt from UHG's unilateral modification are those that have been served on the Corporate Employee Relations Department. (Policy \u00a7 E.) The express terms provide that claims that are known to UHG or that have already accrued are not exempt from modifications if the company has not been served with a Demand for Arbitration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Policy therefore suffers from the very same problem as the agreement in\n   <em>\n    Peleg\n   </em>\n   , which renders the Policy illusory. Moreover, because the express terms provide which claims will be exempt from modifications, the covenant of good faith and fair dealing cannot apply to save the Policy from being unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.

The modification provision is not collateral to the main purpose of the Policy, but rather creates an imbalance of mutuality between the employer and the employee. This imbalance renders the agreement's entire purpose-to\n   impose arbitration-an illusory promise. Severance therefore is not a cure.
