MOSS, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This case arises from the abductions and murders of four U.S. soldiers serving in Iraq. In January 2007, First Lieutenant Jacob Fritz, Specialist Johnathan Bryan Chism, and Private First Class Shawn Falter were abducted from the Provincial Joint Coordination Center in Karbala, Iraq and, shortly thereafter, murdered by their captors. In October 2006, Staff Sergeant Ahmed A1-Taie was abducted while in Baghdad, held hostage, and, ultimately, murdered. Plaintiffs, the estates and family members of the four direct victims, contend that \"[t]hese two separate incidents of kidnapping and murder are linked\" because \"both were planned and executed mere months apart\" by the same terrorist organization: Asaib Ahl al-Haq (\"AAH\"), a network of Iraqi Shia militias. Dkt. 38 at 1. Significantly, plaintiffs assert that AAH benefited from and relied on \"training, funding, direction, and support\" from Iran, which Iran provided as part of a \"coordinated scheme ... to target U.S. service-members in Iraq.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Without Iranian aid, Plaintiffs continue, AAH could not have carried out the Karbala attack nor evaded the U.S. military's search for Staff Sergeant Al-Taie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs, all except one of whom are U.S. nationals, bring this action against the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (collectively, \"Iran\"), and five \"John Doe\" defendants. To establish subject matter jurisdiction, they invoke the state-sponsored terrorism exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (\"FSIA\"). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(a). They rely on another provision in the statute, \u00a7 1605A(c), to supply a federal cause of action, alleging that Iran provided \"material support\" to AAH, which in turn engaged in acts of extrajudicial killing, hostage taking, and torture.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1605A(c). Plaintiffs also assert state common law claims for wrongful death, battery, assault, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress including solatium, survival damages, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting. Iran, in the form of either the Islamic Republic of Iran or the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (\"IRGC\"), has not answered or otherwise appeared in this action and, at Plaintiffs' request, the clerk of the court has entered a default as\n   to both Defendants. Dkt. 23; Dkt. 39. The John Doe defendants have not been served, and thus the Court's decision does not apply to those defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs have moved for a default judgment against the Islamic Republic of Iran and the IRGC, Dkt. 64, and for the appointment of a special master to conduct damages proceedings, Dkt. 49. As explained below, the U.S. national plaintiffs have established their right to relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A. Plaintiffs concede, however, that because plaintiff Bashar Al-Taie is not a U.S. national, he is not entitled to relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(c). The Court concludes, moreover, that Bashar Al-Taie has failed, at least at this stage of the litigation, to establish that he is entitled to relief based on his state law claims. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' motion for the entry of a default judgment against the Islamic Republic of Iran and the IRGC will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to the U.S. national plaintiffs and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   without prejudice as to Bashar Al-Taie.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). Having found that the U.S. national plaintiffs have established Defendants' liability to the satisfaction of the Court, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' motion for the appointment of a special master as to the U.S. national plaintiffs,\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the motion without prejudice as to Bashar Al-Taie, and\n   <strong>\n    APPOINT\n   </strong>\n   a special master to hear the damage claims of the U.S. national plaintiffs and to report to the Court regarding the appropriate award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs, the estates of the four U.S. soldiers and twenty-two of their family members, bring this action for damages against the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and five unidentified \"senior Iranian government officials and members of the IRGC\" who, Plaintiffs allege, \"planned, supported, and approved the abduction[s] and murder[s]\" of Fritz, Chism, Falter, and Al-Taie. Dkt. 9 at 6-10, 12 (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-31, 37). They effected service on the Islamic Republic of Iran and the IRGC in January 2017 and December 2017, respectively, and neither Defendant has answered, filed a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12, or otherwise appeared.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 21; Dkt. 37. Accordingly, at Plaintiffs' request, the clerk of the court declared the Islamic Republic of Iran in default on August 14, 2017, Dkt. 23, and declared the IRGC in default on March 27, 2018, Dkt. 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs now seek entry of a default judgment with respect to liability against both Defendants pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55. Dkt. 64. Even in a garden variety case, the entry of a default judgment is not automatic and requires the exercise of sound discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mwani v. bin Laden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3448002,8936946\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/417/1/\">\n    417 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 6 (D.C.

Most notably, the Court must-at a minimum-satisfy itself that it has subject matter jurisdiction over the claims and personal jurisdiction over the defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jerez v.

By statute, no federal or state court may enter a default judgment against a foreign state or instrumentality\n   \"unless the claimant establishes his claim or right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). This is the same standard that applies to default judgments against the United States under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(d).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Owens v.

Cir. 2003). In a case, such as this, alleging that a foreign state materially supported acts of terrorism, the district court must determine \"how much and what kinds of evidence the plaintiff must provide.\"\n   <em>\n    Han Kim v. Democratic People's Republic of Korea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340131,4285324\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/1044/\">\n    774 F.3d 1044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1047 (D.C. Cir. 2014). But the Court must do so in light of Congress's purpose in enacting \u00a7 1605A-that is, to \"compensate the victims of terrorism [so as to] punish foreign states who have committed or sponsored such acts and [to] deter them from doing so in the future,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340131,4285324\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/1044/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340131,4285324\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/1044/\">\n    at 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted)-and the difficulty in obtaining \"firsthand evidence and eyewitness testimony ... from an absent and likely hostile sovereign,\"\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275860\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/751/#p785\">\n    864 F.3d at 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This means that, to obtain a default judgment against Iran, plaintiffs must (1) carry their burden of producing evidence sufficient to show that their claims fall within the state-sponsored terrorism exception to the FSIA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(a) ;\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275860\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/751/#p785\">\n    864 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   784 ; (2) establish that defendants were served in accordance with the FSIA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; and (3) establish their right to relief under federal,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(c), or state law,\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275860\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/751/#p785\">\n    864 F.3d at 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the pass-through approach remains viable\"), by offering evidence \"satisfactory to the court,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Against this backdrop, the Court held a four-day hearing on liability, Dkt. 51 (Transcript of Evidentiary Hearing, Apr. 10, 2018); Dkt. 52 (Transcript of Evidentiary Hearing, Apr. 11, 2018); Dkt. 53 (Transcript of Evidentiary Hearing, Apr. 12, 2018); Dkt. 54 (Transcript of Evidentiary Hearing, Apr. 13, 2018), and received additional evidentiary submissions, Dkt. 55, as well as proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law from plaintiffs, Dkt. 59-1.

FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs' evidentiary presentation included testimony from thirteen witnesses (including experts) and dozens of exhibits (including several government reports). Along with other witnesses, the Court heard from Colonel William Rabena (ret.), the U.S. Army officer appointed to investigate the 2007 Karbala attack; General George Casey (ret.), the Commander\n   of the Multi-National Forces in Iraq at the time of the Karbala attack and of the abduction of Staff Sergeant Al-Taie; Dr. Matthew Levitt, an expert on Hezbollah and Iran's support for terrorist proxies, including AAH; Dr. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, an expert on AAH and Iranian support for terrorism in Iraq; Dr. Craig Mallak, a forensic pathologist who previously served as the U.S. Armed Forces Medical Examiner; [redacted]\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and representatives from each of the four families of the murdered servicemembers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based on the testimony of these witnesses, and almost one hundred trial exhibits, the Court finds as follows: First, Iran provided AAH with significant support-in the form of training, supplies, intelligence, and funding-as part of its larger strategy to destabilize Iraq and drive the United States from the Middle East using Iraqi Shia militias as proxies. Second, AAH carried out the Karbala attack, took Fritz, Chism, and Falter hostage, and brutally beat and murdered them. Third, AAH held Al-Taie hostage, brutally beat and murdered him. Finally, AAH could not have committed any of these acts without Iran's support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Iran's Provision of Support to Asaib Ahl al-Haq\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Overview of Iran's Proxy Strategy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Shortly after the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the Islamic Republic of Iran initiated a campaign to export the principles of the Iranian Revolution to areas with large communities of Shia Muslims by, among other things, using local groups as proxies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 52 at 192 (Levitt). The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-or IRGC-played a critical role in this effort.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 194 (Levitt). The IRGC is a military institution\n   that operates separately from the ordinary Iranian military; instead of defending Iran's borders, the IRGC is \"charged with preserving the ideals of the Islamic Republic,\" both in Iran and elsewhere. Ex. 66 at 25;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52 at 193-94 (Levitt).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A \"special branch\" of the IRGC known as the Quds Force is \"tasked with extending\" the IRGC's \"mission beyond Iran's borders.\" Ex. 66 at 25; Dkt. 52 at 194 (Levitt). The commander of the Quds Force, General Qasem Soleimani, reports directly to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khomeini. Ex. 66 at 25. Among other responsibilities, the Quds Force is charged with \"cultivating and supporting pro-Iran proxies\" in foreign countries and coordinating with these militant groups to conduct terrorist attacks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52 at 194 (Levitt). According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Quds Force has supported militant groups including the Taliban, Hamas, and-most relevant here-the Lebanese Hezbollah (\"Hezbollah\") and Iraqi Shia militant groups. Ex. 67 at 2. By using these groups as proxies, Iran has sought to achieve its goals in other regions while simultaneously denying responsibility for the actions of its proxies. Ex. 65 at 19; Ex. 66 at 22, 26; Ex. 15 at 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State Department has designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S. Dep't of State,\n   <em>\n    State Sponsors of Terrorism\n   </em>\n   (last visited August 2, 2018),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Treasury Department has designated the IRGC's Quds Force as an entity providing support for terrorism, Ex. 67 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In order to fully understand AAH's role in the Karbala attacks, it is necessary to\n   understand Iran's prior conduct in supporting proxy organizations and the role those organizations played in AAH's development. Accordingly, the Court will outline how Iran turned Hezbollah into an Iranian proxy before describing the similar approach that Iran took with Iraqi Shia militias, including AAH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Hezbollah\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Hezbollah's development into an Iranian proxy in Lebanon is relevant to this case in two respects. First, it serves as an example of how Iran cultivates militant organizations in other countries and employs them as surrogates-a model that Iran then applied to Iraqi Shia militias.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52 at 216 (Levitt). Second, Hezbollah served as a liaison between Iran and AAH and helped Iran establish a proxy relationship with AAH.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Part II.A.3.b. Iran's relationship with Hezbollah, accordingly, is part of the story of AAH's emergence as an Iranian proxy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Hezbollah was founded in the early 1980s as a loose network of Shia militias that sought to transform Lebanon into an Islamic republic. Ex. 65 at 6-8. Iran played a central role in Hezbollah's development and growth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Notably, shortly after Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, \"approximately 1,500 [IRGC] advisors set up a base in [Lebanon] with the goal of exporting the Islamic revolution to the Arab world,\" and, according to Nairn Qassem, Hezbollah's deputy Secretary General, the organization's \"members were required to attend these camps and learn how to confront the enemy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By 1985, Hezbollah's \"ideological platform\" identified \"the Iranian regime as the vanguard and new nucleus of the leading Islamic State in the world\" and declared: \"We abide by the orders of one single wise and just leadership, represented by 'Waliyat el Faqih' [rule of jurisprudent] and personified by Khomeini.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alteration in original). In the expert opinion of Dr. Levitt, \"Hezbollah has been Iran's proxy ever since, and it is estimated that,\" today, \"Iran provides Hezbollah with as much as $700 million-$1 billion per year\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , in the form of cash, training, intelligence, and weapons,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52 at 204 (Levitt).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Hezbollah envisions itself as \"the sharp end of the spear[,] going where Iran tells it to go in defense of....

Dkt. 51 at 62, 78-79 (Rabena); Dkt. 52 at 41, 45 (Rabena); Ex. 4 at 11. A third vehicle positioned itself between the two checkpoints. Ex. 4 at 11; Dkt. 51 at 78 (Rabena). The remaining SUVs continued north toward the PJCC's main building and entered the parking lot. Dkt. 51 at 79, 83 (Rabena); Ex. 4 at 11. An unknown number of militants disembarked and immediately subdued the Iraqi police stationed around the gated entrance to the courtyard. Dkt. 52 at 41 (Rabena); Ex. 4 at Tab M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Five of the militants then crossed through the gated entrance into the courtyard and approached the front door of the PJCC main building. Ex. 4 at 11. At this time, Freeman and Fritz were in their room at the front of the building,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, while Chism and Falter occupied an armored Humvee in the courtyard next to the building's entrance,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. 23 (showing the position of American forces during the attack);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 51 at 73-74 (Rabena). Chism manned the machine gun mounted on top of the turret; Falter was in the driver's seat. Dkt. 51 at 73 (Rabena); Dkt. 52 at 47-48 (Rabena). The five insurgents, who wore the uniforms of American troops and spoke English, greeted Chism and Falter and walked toward the PJCC as though they were arriving for a meeting. Ex. 4 at 11; Dkt. 52 at 47-48 (Rabena). Falter exited\n   the Humvee and started to approach the SUVs, presumably to determine the reason for their arrival.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   About five seconds later, three more militants entered the courtyard, greeted Chism and Falter, and followed the initial group of five to the front entrance of the PJCC. Ex. 4 at 11; Dkt. 52 at 48-49 (Rabena). Like the others, these militants were dressed in American uniforms and greeted Chism and Falter in English. Dkt. 52 at 49 (Rabena).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Each of the last three insurgents to enter the courtyard had specific tactical roles, and they executed their assignments more or less simultaneously. The last of the three walked past Falter, turned around, and shot him in the neck from behind.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Rabena); Ex. 4 at 11. The second climbed on the back of the Humvee and shot Chism, who was facing the courtyard gate and \"had no chance to react.\" Ex. 4 at 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52 at 50 (Rabena). Despite the seriousness of their injuries, neither Chism nor Falter was killed by these gunshots. Dkt. 52 at 49-51 (Rabena). The third insurgent made his way to the front entrance of the main building and subdued the two Iraqi police officers there and took their weapons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51 (Rabena); Ex. 4 at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Seconds after the sound of gunfire in the courtyard, \"a well-coordinated and synchronized attack occurred in the building, in the back, and against the barracks area.\" Ex. 4 at 11. The militants who were staged outside the building began to fire at the building, which had the effect of diverting the U.S. military personnel in the barracks areas and on the second floor of the PJCC to the roof of the building, where they responded to what they believed to be a small arms assault on the complex. Dkt. 52 at 51-55 (Rabena). At the same time, other militants launched an attack on the PJCC command and control room, which was located next to the room where Fritz and Freeman were working.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53 (Rabena); Ex. 4 at 12. According to Colonel William Rabena, the U.S. Army Officer appointed to investigate the attack, this focus of the attack was consistent with a plan to abduct Fritz and Freeman; the attackers \"knew that\" the occupants of the command and control room posed the most substantial threat to their mission, and they therefore confronted that threat before turning their attention to the abduction of Fritz and Freeman. Dkt. 52 at 53 (Rabena); Ex. 4 at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The command and control room held five U.S. soldiers-the only soldiers other than Fritz and Freeman located on the first floor of the main PJCC building-as well as radios for communicating between the PJCC and coalition forces. Dkt. 51 at 75 (Rabena); Ex. 23. By attacking that room, the militants were able to aid their exfiltration by delaying communications regarding the attack, and they were able to subdue \"the closest support that could interfere with the abduction.\" Dkt. 52 at 54 (Rabena). The fact that the attackers \"knew exactly where they were going\" evidences that they had inside information and that the attack was a highly sophisticated one.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55 (Rabena);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4 at 12. The U.S. soldiers working in the command and control room were able to prevent the attackers from fully opening the door, but the militants were able to direct gunfire and a grenade into the room. Ex. 4 at 12; Dkt. 52 at 56-57 (Rabena). Three of these five soldiers were injured, and one, Private First Class Millican, was killed. Dkt. 52 at 55-56 (Rabena). PFC Millican thwarted the militants' effort to take the command and control room when he threw himself on the grenade.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57 (Rabena); Ex. 4 at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As the soldiers in the command and control room continued to fight back, they heard gunshots and explosions elsewhere. They heard shots in the hallway and heard a grenade explode in Fritz and Freeman's room next door. Ex. 4 at 12-13; Dkt. 52 at 57 (Rabena). The militants then took Fritz and Freeman from the officer's room and led them out of the building. Dkt. 52 at 58-59 (Rabena). While exiting the PJCC, the militants threw a high explosive grenade into the hallway near the two rooms. Ex. 4 at 13; Dkt. 52 at 57 (Rabena). That grenade blast, along with increased gunfire, prevented the soldiers in the command and control room from leaving the room. Ex. 4 at 13. Both Fritz and Freeman were alive at this time, although it appears that Fritz was injured and bleeding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Significantly, the militants did not attack the soldiers on the second floor of the PJCC, providing further evidence that their mission was to abduct the U.S. soldiers. Dkt. 52 at 59-60 (Rabena). Upon returning to the courtyard, the militants destroyed the Humvee that Chism and Falter had manned, as a well as an unmanned second Humvee, Ex. 4 at 13, and they used \"smoke grenades\" to obscure their exfiltration. Dkt. 52 at 61-62 (Rabena). They then handcuffed Freeman and Chism and put them in one SUV and handcuffed Fritz and Falter together and put them in a second SUV.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62 (Rabena). Up to this point, the entire attack took only about ten to fifteen minutes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63 (Rabena).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The attackers fled, and a chase ensued. Hrg. Tr. (Apr 11, 2018) at 64, 73-74. The militants drove toward the city of Hillah in the general direction of Iran. Ex. 25; Dkt. 52 at 70-74 (Rabena). But instead of taking the road that directly connected Karbala with Hillah, they took a long detour through Musayib. Dkt. 52 at 74 (Rabena);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. 75 at 2. Their route tracked a well-known \"ratline,\" a path along which Iran smuggled weapons and ammunition into Iraq. Dkt. 52 at 74 (Rabena). Iraqis who were sympathetic to Iran controlled the checkpoints along the ratline and facilitated the passage of smuggled goods.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75-77 (Rabena). No one outside the area \"would have known to take those roads unless they were being helped\" by the IRGC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76 (Rabena).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Ultimately, however, this escape route failed. Members of the Iraqi Army stationed at a checkpoint in the town of Mahawil received word that an attack had occurred in Karbala and that they should stop a \"fast moving small convoy of SUVs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77-78 (Rabena); Ex. 4 at 8-9. Earlier that day, three men had approached the Iraqi Army soldiers stationed at the checkpoint and told them that a convoy would be coming through and that they needed to let the convoy proceed. Dkt. 52 at 78 (Rabena). In doing so, they provoked suspicion, asserting at times that those in the convoy were Americans, and at other times saying that they were Israelis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Rabena). Later, the three men came back to make sure that the Iraqi soldiers would facilitate the passage of the convoy, and, as the convoy approached, they \"yelled out to the guards, 'Don't shoot them. Don't shoot them. This is what we talked about.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Rabena). The Iraqi soldiers figured out what was happening and, accordingly, detained the three men and pursued the convoy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Rabena). It was later determined that one of the three men was a high ranking official from a\n   Shia-affiliated militia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77, 79-80 (Rabena).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   With the guard posts now \"really on alert\" the militants knew \"that someone [wa]s following them.\" Dkt. 52 at 79 (Rabena). As a result, they \"took a back road, changed out of\" the U.S. Army Combat Uniforms that they wore, \"abandoned most of [their] equipment,\" and shot Fritz, Chism, Falter, and Freeman. Ex. 4 at 8; Dkt. 52 at 80-96 (\"[The attackers] had to execute [the soldiers] because they couldn't go any further.\"). By the time the Iraqi Army arrived, only Freeman was still alive, and he died a short time later. Dkt. 52 at 83, 85 (Rabena).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Direct Victims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Fritz, Chism, and Falter each sustained numerous gunshot wounds and blunt force injuries. Based on the \"signs of vital reaction\" to these wounds, the Court finds that the injuries were inflicted while the soldiers were still alive. Dkt. 54 at 44-45 (Mallak). In addition, the Court finds that each soldier was deliberately killed-or, to put it more precisely, executed-by the attackers. This finding is based on the location and nature of the soldiers' wounds as well as the fact that all four of the victims were handcuffed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34 (Mallak). The Court also finds that Fritz, Chism, and Falter were abducted so that they could be traded for militants held captive by coalition forces. Finally, the Court finds that the militants inflicted severe pain on their captives, likely for the purpose of punishing the U.S. military for its presence in Iraq or in order to deter that presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Armed Forces Medical Examiner concluded that First Lieutenant Fritz died from multiple gunshot wounds and that the manner of death was homicide. Ex. 6 at 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fritz was shot four times in the chest and once in the right shoulder. Dkt. 53 at 207-03 (Mallak). He also suffered blunt force injuries on his face and head that are consistent with being beaten and kicked.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 202-04 (Mallak). The evidence demonstrates, moreover, that Fritz was alive at the time he was taken from the PJCC and at the time his injuries were inflicted. Among other things, he wrote his name in blood with his finger on the back of one of the SUVs, Dkt. 52 at 84 (Rabena); his captors handcuffed him,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 62; and his autopsy showed that he was alive for a sufficient period of time to permit severe bruises to develop, Dkt. 53 at 203-10 (Mallak). In the expert opinion of Dr. Craig Mallak, which the Court credits, Fritz's attackers inflicted \"many\" wounds on him \"prior to the fatal wound,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 209 (Mallak), and these wounds would have caused Fritz to suffer severe pain,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 195-209 (Mallak).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court also credits Dr. Mallak's\n   expert opinion that \"the location of [Fritz's mortal] wounds, the manner of the wounds, [and] the restraints placed on\" Fritz, show that he was executed. Dkt. 54 at 33-34 (Mallak). The evidence shows, for example, that the militants moved a Kevlar plate from Fritz's body armor in order to inflict a mortal wound. Dkt. 53 at 211-12 (Mallak).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Armed Forces Medical Examiner concluded that Chism also died from multiple gunshot wounds and that the manner of his death was homicide. Ex. 7 at 2. Chism sustained gunshot wounds to his torso, hand, and both legs. Ex. 7 at 3-4; Dkt. 53 at 218-21 (Mallak). The fatal gunshot punctured one of his lungs. Dkt. 53 at 216-17 (Mallak). Both of the gunshot wounds to Chism's upper body avoided his body armor, indicating that they were deliberately inflicted by someone in close proximity who had control over Chism's movements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 225-27 (Mallak). Chism also had numerous contusions on his face, head, and body that, like Fritz, were consistent with being beaten and kicked.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 221, 224 (Mallak). At least one of these blows was severe enough to cause bleeding in the back of his skull, the middle ear, and in the spinal cord.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 223-24, 230 (Mallak). All of these injuries, moreover, occurred while Chism was alive and likely conscious, and, according to Dr. Mallak, they caused Chism to experience severe pain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 224-29; Dkt. 54 at 20-22 (Mallak). The location and nature of Chism's wounds and the use of handcuffs indicate that he was executed. Dkt. 54 at 33-34 (Mallak).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   According to the autopsy report, Falter also died from multiple gunshot wounds and his manner of death was homicide. Ex. 8 at 1. Falter was shot in the neck during the attack on the PJCC, and, although that injury was \"a very, very serious\" one \"that most people probably would die [from] very quickly,\" Ex. 8 at 2; Dkt. 54 at 27-28 (Mallak), there is evidence that Falter was alive at the time of his abduction. Dkt. 54 at 26 (Mallak). After his abduction, he was shot \"execution style\" from several inches away. Dkt. 52 at 86 (Rabena); Dkt. 54 at 27 (Mallak). In addition, Falter had a \"series of abrasions and contusions and hemorrhag[ing]\" around his face and head, torso, and extremities, including a blunt force trauma to the head. Dkt. 54 at 28-29 (Mallak); Ex. 8 at 3. He was alive when these injuries were inflicted and, according to Dr. Mallak, would have suffered severe pain prior to and during his death. Dkt. 54 at 30-31; Ex. 8 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court, accordingly, finds that Fritz, Chism, and Falter were each shot, beaten, and subsequently executed. Although it is possible that many of the contusions on the victim's bodies were received in the course of the abduction, the evidence that both Fritz and Chism were kicked in the face,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hrg. Tr. (Apr. 12, 2013) at 202-03, 221-23 (Mallak), along with the extensive nature of the injuries all three sustained, supports a finding that the victims were severely beaten while in captivity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court also finds that each of the three were abducted to be used in an effort to compel the Multi-National Force in Iraq to release detainees. Just a few months after the Karbala attack, Qais Khazali admitted to U.S. authorities that the purpose of the attack was to capture American hostages to be used to trade for detainees in the custody of coalition forces. Ex. 87b at 3. That admission, moreover, is consistent with the militants' actions; they employed sophisticated tactics that, in retrospect, were clearly designed to abduct U.S. military personnel. They could have-and presumably would have-killed the\n   victims at the PJCC if they did not want to take them captive and they had an extensive exfiltration plan in place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52 at 59 (Rabena) (describing the PJCC attack as \"a clear abduction case\" where \"there was a reason why they wanted to do a kidnapping\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Finally, the Court finds that each of the direct victims was both a U.S. citizen and a member of the U.S. armed forces.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 69 at 1 (Certificate of Death (Overseas) for Jacob Fritz, Feb. 1, 2007); Ex. 71 at 1 (Certificate of Death (Overseas) for Jonathan B. Chism, Feb. 1, 2007); Ex. 72 at 1 (Certificate of Death (Overseas) for Shawn Patrick Falter, Jan. 31, 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Asaib Ahl al-Haq and Iran's Responsibility for the Karbala Attack\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In the immediate aftermath of the Karbala attack, the identity, affiliation, and specific goals of the attackers were not clear. The United States and coalition forces, however, conducted a comprehensive investigation of the attack and concluded that it was the work of AAH, which had carried out the operation with Iran's support.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1 at 1-4, 7. Evidence of AAH and Iran's involvement in the attack is manifold. First, the United States captured Qais Khazali (the leader of AAH), Laith Khazali (his brother and lieutenant), and Ali Musa Daqduq (the Hezbollah liaison between Iran and AAH). All three confirmed that AAH was responsible for the attack and that it would not have been possible without Iran's support. Second, the sophistication of the attack provides compelling circumstantial evidence that Iran assisted the militants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Asaib Ahl al-Haq\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   AAH repeatedly claimed responsibility for the Karbala attack. First, the group produced and published a video titled \"The General's Downfall,\" which contains footage of the PJCC, displays the photographs of the U.S. soldiers who were killed, and \"claims [the attack] as one of [its] successes.\" Dkt. 53 at 98 (Gartenstein-Ross). This video, Ex. 20, was admitted into evidence based on testimony from Dr. Gartenstein-Ross, describing internal and external indicia that it was produced by AAH,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53 at 99-102 (Gartenstein-Ross). As Dr. Gartenstein-Ross explained, the video served multiple purposes; it helped \"rally[ ] popular support with AAH portraying itself as being at the forefront of the resistance,\" and it \"show[ed] value to their sponsors[,] like Iran, that they[ ] [were] carrying out these attacks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102 (Gartenstein-Ross).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Second, the Khazali brothers and Daqduq confessed that AAH planned and carried out the Karbala attack. Ex. 1 at 3. Daqduq, as noted earlier, was a senior Hezbollah operative tasked with building and supporting Iraqi Shia militias as Iranian proxies. Coalition forces captured him along with the Khazali brothers on March 20, 2007 in Iraq. Ex. 1 at 1-3; Ex. 2 at 4. Both Daqduq and Qais Khazali admitted that Khazali \"authorized the operation\" and that another AAH member, Azhar al-Dulaimi, \"executed the operation.\" Ex. 1 at 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3 at 2 (interrogation report of Qais Khazali) (\"[Khazali] stated that he was the religious approval authority for the attack[ ] Reporting indicates that [Khazali] was directly in charge of the individuals [who] conducted the attack.\"); Ex. 87b at 3 (interrogation report of Qais Khazali). The purpose of the attack, Khazali explained, was \"to capture American hostages to be ... trade[d].\" Ex. 87b at 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52 at 59, 111 (Rabena).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Third, coalition forces recovered documents confirming that the attack was conducted by AAH, with Iranian support. When Daqduq was taken captive, he was found with \"detailed documents that discussed tactics\" for \"attack[ing] Iraqi and\n   coalition forces\" as well as \"a personal journal\" that recounted \"his involvement with extremist operations in Iraq.\" Ex. 1 at 3. And, when Qais Khazali was captured, coalition forces recovered a twenty-two page, \"in-depth planning and lessons learned document\" about the attack. Ex. 65 at 43. This document \"laid bare the extensive preoperational surveillance, logistical preparation, and tactical drills that were carried out prior to the attack.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Daqduq also had in his possession \"information on exactly how\" the U.S. soldiers at the PJCC \"defended that place,\" which could only have been received by \"someone watching [the soldiers'] drills.\" Hrg. Tr. (Apr. 11, 201) at 92-93 (Rabena).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Iran\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court also finds that Iran assisted AAH in planning and executing the Karbala attack; The twenty-two page document found when Qais Khazali was captured revealed the Quds Force's \"intimate role in the[ ] preparations, including provisions of the uniforms, vehicles, and identification cards that allowed the attackers to disguise their intentions.\" Ex. 66 at 45. Qais Khazali and Daqduq, moreover, confirmed that Iran-through the Quds Force-had provided training, intelligence, and supplies that were essential to AAH's ability to execute the operation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They reported that \"senior leadership within the Q[u]ds Force knew of and supported planning for the eventual Karbala attack that killed five coalition soldiers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Daqduq, \"the Iraqi [S]pecial [G]roups could not have conducted th[e] complex operation without the support and direction of the Q[u]ds Force.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The sophistication, complexity, and skilled execution of the attack corroborate Khazali and Daqduq's statements regarding Iran's involvement. The evidence leaves little doubt that the assault was \"resourced from the outside\" with supplies that the local militia could not have obtained without assistance. Dkt. 51 at 59 (Rabena). These supplies included U.S. uniforms, weapons, and vehicles designed to resemble those of American soldiers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-60 (Rabena);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 80 (Rabena) (\"The level of planning and resourcing and logistical support for this was ... above and beyond anything we had ever seen before.\"). The black Suburban SUVs, for example, could not have been obtained by a Shia militia acting on its own.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81 (Rabena).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The attackers also had detailed knowledge about the layout of the PJCC and intelligence on how the soldiers there would respond to a small arms attack. Dkt. 52 at 52-53, 106-07 (Rabena). This information allowed the militants to abduct the U.S. soldiers even though they were vastly outnumbered by U.S. forces.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52 (Rabena). When the militants entered the PJCC, \"they knew exactly where they were going\" and were able to get out before the coalition forces were able to respond.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 106-07 (Rabena). The attackers knew to cover the entry of the assault force by firing on the PJCC from outside the building, prompting the U.S. forces to believe that they were under a small arms attack rather than recognizing the true purpose of the mission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Rabena). The nature of the attack thus confirms Khazali and Daqduq's reports that Iran provided critical intelligence to the attackers. Ex. 1 at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The speed, efficiency, and skill with which the attack was executed further supports the finding that the militants received training from Iran. The testimony Plaintiffs offered at the hearing showed that \"local insurgents\" were not \"so well[-]orchestrated\" and \"coordinated.\" Dkt. 52 at 106 (Rabena). The planning document recovered during Daqduq's capture, moreover, showed that the attackers\n   had set up \"a mock site\" where they \"practice[d] and train[ed] and rehearse[d]\" how the assault would unfold.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93 (Rabena).

The facts that the attackers knew to use this \"ratline\" and that they were able make their way through several security checkpoints suggests that Iran helped coordinate the attackers' safe passage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 107 (Rabena) (\"[F]acilitat[ing] the passage [from] one province ... into another province has to be done by a central figure[ ] like the IRGC ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In sum, the evidence obtained from Qais Khazali and Daqduq, and each of these features of the attack, provides \"credible evidence of Iranian involvement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113 (Rabena). The Court finds that there is more than ample evidence that Iran assisted AAH in planning and carrying out the Karbala attack and that the attack would not have been possible without that assistance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Dkt. 54 at 51-52 (H. Taie); Hrg. Tr. (April 11, 2018) at 11 (Casey). On October 23, 2006, he left the secure zone to visit his wife, who lived in the city. Ex. 37. While outside of a relative's home, he was kidnapped and taken away in a vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Ex. 53; Ex. 65 at 46; Dkt. 52 at 25 (Casey). At the time of the kidnapping, Al-Taie's captors, members of JAM, were unaware that Al-Taie was an American soldier and were not prepared to evade the massive search-and-rescue mission that the U.S. military would inevitably undertake. Ex. 37 at 2 (case summary from U.S. Central Command on Al-Taie dated Feb. 28, 2010); Ex. 65 at 46; Dkt. 53 at 8 (Levitt). And, indeed, when the military learned of Al-Taie's abduction, in the words of General George Casey, the Commander of the Multi-National Forces in Iraq at the time of the search, it \"locked down\" Baghdad \"for a week\" and had \"soldiers searching everywhere for him.\" Dkt. 52 at 25 (Casey). The entire \"intelligence community of the United States [was] focused on recovering one soldier.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27 (Casey). On an ongoing basis, moreover, there was a unit dedicated\n   solely to \"track[ing] missing soldiers and missing remains until ... everybody [was] back.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26 (Casey).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   By early November 2006, after Al-Taie's abductors realized that he was a U.S. soldier, they transferred him to AAH. Dkt. 53 at 8-12 (Levitt); Ex. 37; Ex. 53 at 2; Ex. 65 at 46. AAH kept Al-Taie as a bargaining chip. Ex. 65 at 46. In December 2006, for example, it \"demanded a prisoner exchange for his release,\" and a year later, it \"demanded\" that coalition forces release the Khazali brothers in exchange for Al-Taie. Ex. 53 at 2. On February 14, 2007, an AAH \"front group\" called Ahl al-Bayt Brigades released a \"proof of life\" video of Al-Taie. Ex. 21; Ex. 53 at 2; Ex. 65 at 47; Dkt. 53 at 142-47 (Gartenstein-Ross). Significantly, that video was held by Daqduq before it was released. Dkt. 53 at 142, 144-45 (Gartenstein-Ross).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Information about what happened next comes from [redacted] Ex. 76 at 1 ( [redacted] ). According to [redacted] declaration, Al-Taie was held by AAH [redacted] from [redacted] to [redacted]. Ex. 76 at 2,4 ( [redacted] ). [redacted]. \"AAH eventually released Al-Taie's remains in February 2012,\" Ex. 66 at 52, more than five years after his abduction. According to the Iraqi Shia politician who supervised the negotiations for the release of Al-Taie's remains, \"AAH acknowledged killing Al-Taie within a year of his abduction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Hostage Taking, Torture, and Execution of Ahmed Al-Taie\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Al-Taie was born in Iraq and became a naturalized citizen of the United States while serving in the U.S. military. Dkt. 54 at 48-49 (H. Taie). By the time AAH released Al-Taie's remains, they were in a state of advanced decomposition. Dkt. 54 at 35-36 (Mallak). As a result, the Armed Forces Medical Examiner was able to reach only a limited set of conclusions. The cause of Al-Taie's death was a gunshot wound or wounds, and the manner of his death was homicide. Ex. 9 at 2-4; Dkt. 54 at 34-35 (Mallak). Al-Taie was shot twice, once in the torso and a second time in the neck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-40 (Mallak). The gunshot to his neck is consistent with an execution-style killing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-44 (Mallak).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The [redacted] declaration sheds further light on Al-Taie's treatment at the hands of AAH. According to [redacted] Al-Taie was \"was beaten on a daily basis.\" Ex. 76 at 2 ( [redacted] ). [redacted] could hear \"both the physical impacts\" of the blows and Al-Taie's \"cries of pain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [redacted] that \"they had executed\" Al-Taie.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 ( [redacted] ). [redacted] \"all of the other hostages had been killed\" either because they \"tr[ied] to escape\" or because the captors believed the U.S. military was going to raid the house in which the hostages were being held.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court, accordingly, finds that Al-Taie was brutally beaten and was eventually executed. Based on [redacted] declaration, moreover, the Court finds that Al-Taie suffered severe and persistent pain due to his repeated beatings. The Court also finds that Al-Taie was detained as a bargaining chip, which AAH sought to use to compel the release of the Khazali brothers and at least one other detainee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Asaib Ahl al-Haq and Iran's Responsibility\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Although Al-Taie was initially abducted by JAM, AAH took and held Al-Taie shortly after he was kidnapped, and its members beat and eventually killed him. The evidence of AAH's role is compelling. The \"proof of life\" video was released by a front group for AAH,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. 53 at 2; Dkt. 53 at 146-47 (Gartenstein-Ross), and Daqduq had the video before its release, Dkt. 53 at 144-45 (Gartenstein-Ross). In an interview with the\n   <em>\n    Islam Times\n   </em>\n   website,\n   AAH's deputy leader, moreover, Akram al-Kabi, admitted that AAH did not release Al-Taie because he was \"a U.S. soldier who was working directly with the U.S. military command in Iraq.\" Ex. 66 at 52. [redacted] the \"Khazali brothers\" were \"responsible for [Al-Taie's] abduction and captivity.\" Ex. 76 at 3 ( [redacted] ). [redacted] saw a [redacted] captive who fit Al-Taie's description. Ex. 76 at 2-3 ( [redacted] ). The fact that Al-Taie's captors demanded the release of the Khazali brothers in exchange for Al-Taie's release, and the fact that AAH ultimately released his body, further support the conclusion that AAH held Al-Taie. Dkt. 53 at 137 (Garenstein-Ross).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The evidence that AAH held Al-Taie captive is also consistent with the group's modus operandi. Throughout its existence, AAH has focused on attacking U.S. and coalition forces, and, on multiple occasions, it has taken hostages. Ex. 66 at 55. In addition, after thoroughly investigating Al-Taie's abduction, the U.S. Army concluded that Qais Khazali and AAH were responsible,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. 5 (CID Report); Dkt. 53 at 155-58 (Gartenstein-Ross), and Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Gartenstein-Ross, opined that \"AAH held Mr. Al-Taie,\" and \"was responsible for his murder,\" Dkt. 53 at 158. The Court shares that view and, accordingly, finds that AAH was responsible for holding and beating Al-Taie and for his eventual murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Iran, for its part, supported AAH's actions. As explained above, Iran provided AAH with significant funding, supplies, training, and other support. As part of its general efforts to train Iraqi Shia militants, Iran instructed AAH on how to kidnap and move high-value targets. Dkt. 53 at 159, 170 (Gartenstein-Ross). In the words of Dr. Levitt, members of AAH \"were trained for exactly this type of mission by Iran and by Hezbollah.\" Dkt. 53 at 16 (Levitt). There is also substantial evidence that the availability of Iranian \"ratlines,\" and Iranian financial support, allowed AAH to evade the massive manhunt undertaken by U.S. and coalition forces in an effort to rescue Al-Taie.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53 at 138-42, 162-71 (Gartenstein-Ross). In particular, the fact that Al-Taie was moved frequently-including in broad daylight-demonstrates that his captors were receiving \"intelligence from a service like Iran.\" Dkt. 53 at 139 (Gartenstein-Ross). The fact that Daqduq, a Hezbollah operative, had the proof of life video before it was released, moreover, further evidences Iranian support.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 162 (Gartenstein-Ross). Based on all of this evidence, Dr. Gartenstein-Ross opined with \"100 percent\" confidence that Iranian support was used to hold Al-Taie.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 169 (Gartenstein-Ross). Once again, the Court concurs in this conclusion and, accordingly, finds that Iran provided essential support to AAH and that it was foreseeable that AAH would use that support to hold, beat, and murder Al-Taie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

For present purposes, the sole relevant exception is found in the \"state-sponsored terrorism exception,\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A, which both confers subject matter jurisdiction on federal courts to hear certain terrorism-related claims,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201330\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and recognizes a federal cause of action against those foreign states subject to the exception,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275860\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/751/#p785\">\n    864 F.3d at 764-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, because the FSIA deprives courts of subject matter jurisdiction in the absence of a relevant exception, a failure to appear does not waive the defense and the courts are \"obligated to consider\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   \" whether they have jurisdiction hear the case and to order any relief.\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez v.

Second, with respect to the substance of the Plaintiffs' state or federal law claims, as noted above, the FSIA precludes courts from entering a default judgment against a foreign state unless the court is satisfied that the plaintiff has established her right to relief.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275860\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/751/#p785\">\n    864 F.3d at 784-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The one exception, as Plaintiffs concede, is that Bashar Al-Taie, one of Ahmed Al-Taie's brothers, is not a U.S. national, member of the U.S. armed forces, or an employee or contractor of the U.S. government acting within the scope of his employment, and, accordingly, is not entitled to relief under the federal cause of action. Moreover, the Court concludes that, at least on the present record, Bashar Al-Taie has yet to establish his right to relief under D.C. law. Finally, the Court will defer to the damages stage the determination\n   of whether each of the plaintiffs has established the necessary familial relationship to recover individual damages and, if so, the damages to which each is entitled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Second, although the claims brought by the estates of direct victims differ in certain respects from those brought by the victims' families, all of the claims seek to recover \"for personal injury\" or \"death.\" Third, Iran was designated as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1984,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20Fed.%20Reg.%202836\">\n    49 Fed.

Moreover, because the IRGC is properly considered \"an integral part\" of the \"foreign state\" of Iran,\n   <em>\n    TMR Energy Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , 411 F.3d at 300, and because \u00a7 1605A focuses on whether \"the foreign state\" was designated-and not whether each named defendant was separately designated-the Court concludes that the designation of Iran as a state\n   sponsor of terrorism is sufficient to satisfy the designation requirement as to both defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(a)(2)(A)(i)(I).

For the reasons explained below, the Court concludes as follows: (1) AAH committed acts of \"hostage taking,\" \"torture,\" and \"extrajudicial killing\" within the meaning of the International Convention Against the Taking of Hostages and the Torture Victim Protection Act; (2) Iranian officials and their agents provided \"material support or resources\" for these acts within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339A ; and (3) Iran's provision of material support caused the injuries and deaths of the four victims. Plaintiffs' claims, accordingly, fall within the state-sponsored terrorism exception of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Asaib Ahl al-Haq's Acts of Hostage Taking, Torture, and Extrajudicial Killing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The state-sponsored terrorism exception to the FSIA defines the terms \"hostage taking,\" \"torture,\" and \"extrajudicial killing\" by reference to the Convention Against the Taking of Hostages, 1316 U.N.T.S. 205, and the Torture Victim Protection Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201350\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   note, respectively.

Under these circumstances, the Court must do its best to determine which injuries were sustained after the victims were captured and taken into custody, and which injuries were sustained in the battle or assault leading up to their abduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The Court's findings regarding the abduction and murder of Fritz, Chism, and Falter highlight these at times overlapping difficulties. First, the evidence shows that a number of their most severe injuries were sustained before their capture. Most notably, there is evidence that all three soldiers were shot in the course of the attack and that Falter, in particular, was gravely injured during the first moments of the AAH's assault on the PJCC. There is also evidence, however, that all three were alive at the time they were captured and that they sustained numerous additional injuries while in custody.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   , Part II.B.2; Dkt. 54 at 44-45 (Mallak). The question, then, is whether those further injuries were inflicted with the requisite intent to inflict severe pain and were sufficiently\n   \"extreme and outrageous to warrant the universal condemnation that the term 'torture' both connotes and invokes.\"\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9408216,3699263\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/294/82/\">\n    294 F.3d at 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although a close question, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have offered evidence satisfactory to the Court.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). Both the depravity of the abuse and the purpose for which it was inflicted suggest that the victims' injuries were the result of \"torture\" under the TVPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   First, the extreme and gratuitous nature of the beatings the victims suffered were sufficiently \"severe\" to constitute torture. Fritz, Falter, and Chism were all shot in the course of their abduction. To be sure, this, in and of itself, does not suggest torture. Despite the substantial evidence regarding the pain the victims suffered as a result of their gunshot wounds,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53 at 30-31, 195-209, 224-29 (Mallak), there is no evidence that the militants shot their victims with the specific intent of causing pain or suffering-as opposed to their evident intent to subdue and then to execute the soldiers. There is substantial evidence, however, that the soldiers were badly beaten while in custody and while handcuffed. Those beatings did not take place over an extended period of time, but they were severe, and given the state of the soldiers, they demonstrated an intent to cause extreme pain and suffering. Most strikingly, there is evidence that Chism was kicked in the face, while handcuffed, with sufficient force to cause bleeding in the back of the skull, the middle ear, and the spinal cord. Dkt. 53 at 221-24, 230 (Mallak). The evidence also shows that Fritz was likely kicked in the face,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201608\">\n    at 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mallak), and that Falter suffered blunt force trauma to his head, Dkt. 54 at 29 (Mallak).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Taken together, this evidence supports the inference that all three men were kicked or otherwise beaten in the head while handcuffed and-significantly-while already suffering from severe gunshot wounds. Although not every beating of a person in custody rises to the level of severity or heinousness required to constitute torture, and while it does a disservice to the victims of torture to dilute the meaning of that concept, the Court is satisfied that kicking or beating someone in the face or head who is already suffering from a serious-and perhaps life threatening-gunshot reflects the type of depravity and enormous suffering that the TVPA and international law condemns. In some cases, the relative brevity of the victim's pain and suffering might counsel against a finding of torture. In others, including this one, the gratuitousness, intensity, and inhumanity of the assault permits a finding of torture, although the short period of time might bear on the assessment of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Second, the Court concludes that this abuse was motivated by the types of invidious purposes encompassed by the TVPA. Specifically, the Court concludes that the soldiers were beaten for the purpose of punishing the United States and coalition forces for their presence in Iraq and to induce those forces to leave the region. In circumstances such as these, where the victims were violently abducted, it can be difficult to determine which abusive acts were carried out for which purpose. One act of abuse may have been to ensure the total submission of the hostage, while another may have punished the victim for the United States' role in Iraq. Here, however, the record supports the conclusion that AAH abused the victims for a purpose \"such ... as... punishing\" the soldiers or others, or \"intimidating[,] or coercing\" the United States, coalition forces, or others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201350\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   note. The circumstances of the Karbala attack, and the broader role of the AAH as an Iranian proxy to drive the United States out of the Gulf region, all suggest that AAH abused\n   the victims for the purposes encompassed by the TVPA.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   , Part II.A.3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. 65 at 18 (describing Iran's overall goal to \"humiliate[ ]\" the United States in Iraq and \"force[ ] [it] out of the region in disgrace\" in order to deter it from \"pursuing similar military interventions in the [Gulf] region in the future\"). This evidence satisfies the demands of the TVPA's \"purpose\" requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   In reaching these conclusions, the Court recognizes that \"[w]e cannot know with certainty precisely what occurred between\" the soldiers' \"capture and [their] deaths.\"\n   <em>\n    Foley v. Syrian Arab Republic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274185\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/249/186/#p203\">\n    249 F.Supp.3d 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 203 (D.D.C. 2017). But that is because Defendants have defaulted and because the assailants are not subject to process in the United States. As the Court of Appeals has observed, \"[r]equiring a plaintiff to produce direct, firsthand evidence of the victim's torture and murder would ... thwart the purpose of the terrorism exception\" to the FSIA: \"holding the state sponsor of terrorism accountable for torture and extrajudicial killing.\"\n   <em>\n    Han Kim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340131,4285324\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/1044/\">\n    774 F.3d at 1045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present context, the Court concludes that there is sufficient evidence to support the inference that, while in the custody of the assailants, Fritz, Chism, and Falter were intentionally subjected to severe pain in order to punish them for the U.S. presence in Iraq and to send a message to the United States and other U.S. forces that they should leave the Gulf region.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The Court also concludes that Plaintiffs have offered evidence sufficient to show that Al-Taie was tortured. Unlike in the case of Fritz, Chism, and Falter, the evidence shows that Al-Taie was subject to severe beatings over an extended period of time. As described above,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.C.2, Plaintiffs offered compelling evidence that Al-Taie was beaten \"[o]n a daily basis\" and that the physical impact of the blows and Al-Taie's \"cries of pain\" could be heard by another prisoner, held in a different room.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 76 at 2 ( [redacted] ).

Moreover, unlike the definition of \"summary executions\" under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, 6 U.S.T. 3113, 75 U.S.T.S. 85, the state-sponsored terrorism exception to the FSIA does not require direct participation of a state actor; it is sufficient that a state actor provided material support for an extrajudicial killing committed by a nonstate actor.\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275860\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/751/#p785\">\n    864 F.3d at 770-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Cir. 2017). The evidence Plaintiffs offered at the hearing satisfies this requirement. The autopsy reports on the four soldiers abducted and killed in the Karbala attack show that they sustained execution-style wounds. They were shot at a close range; they were handcuffed at the time they received their final, life-ending wounds ; and it appears that their assailants moved the victims' body armor to inflict the deadly wounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53 at 211-12 (Mallak). The militants, moreover, had every interest in fleeing, but they took the time to kill the servicemen-none of whom posed any danger to the assailants-before doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The evidence also supports the conclusion that Al-Taie was executed. According to the [redacted] declaration, Laith Khazali admitted that AAH \"had executed the Iraqi-American U.S. soldier\" [redacted]. Ex. 76 ( [redacted] ). [redacted] \"all of the other hostages had been killed either while\n   trying to escape, or that they were\" killed when their AAH captors mistakenly believed that the house at which the hostages were being held was the target of a raid by the U.S. military.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275860\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/751/#p785\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because Al-Taie's autopsy showed that he was shot through the neck from the front, the evidence supports the conclusion that he was shot while in custody, and not while trying to escape. The fact that his captors mistakenly believed that the U.S. military was on the verge of rescuing Al-Taie does not diminish the evidence that they made a calculated decision to brutally end his life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The Court, accordingly, concludes that Fritz, Chism, Falter, and Al-Taie were all victims of extrajudicial killings within the meaning of the TVPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Iran's Provision of Material Support for Asaib Ahl al-Haq's Acts of Hostage Taking, Torture, and Extrajudicial Killing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   The Court further concludes that Iran provided AAH with material support for the acts described above. The FSIA's definition of \"material support or resources\" is borrowed from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339A, which defines \"material support or resources\" in relevant part as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   any property, tangible or intangible, or service, including currency or monetary instruments or financial securities, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice or assistance, safehouses, false documentation or identification, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal substances, explosives, personnel ..., and transportation, except medicine or religious materials.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339A(b)(1). The evidence set forth above demonstrates that Iran helped AAH attack coalition forces and kidnap U.S. soldiers.\n   <em>\n    See generally supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.A.3. Plaintiffs offered evidence that Iran provided support to AAH and other Iraqi Shia militias as part of a \"deliberate policy to inflict casualties on U.S. forces\"-a policy that was \"approved by the [S]upreme [L]eader\" of Iran and that was \"executed very covertly ... by the Q[u]ds [F]orce.\" Dkt. 52 at 14 (Casey);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. 65 at 39; Ex. 66 at 25-29. The evidence also showed that, pursuant to this policy, Iran provided weapons, financial support, training, and \"expert advice [and] assistance\" to AAH. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339A(b)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 53 at 41 (Gartenstein-Ross); Ex. 15 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Even more to the point, Plaintiffs offered compelling evidence that Iran provided material support for the specific acts of hostage taking, torture, and extrajudicial killing at issue in this case. With respect to the Karbala attack, Qais Khazali and Daqduq confessed that \"senior leadership within the Q[u]ds Force knew of,\" \"support[ed]\" and \"direct[ed]\" the operation. Ex. 1 at 3-4. Daqduq, moreover, acknowledged that \"the Iraqi [S]pecial [G]roups could not have conducted th[e] complex operation without the support and direction of the Q[u]ds Force.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The sophistication, knowledge, training, and skill exhibited in the attack, moreover, corroborates these statements.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.B.1. In short, for the reasons explained above, the Court concludes that AAH could not have conducted the attack without the assistance of Iran. That assistance permitted AAH to take Fritz, Chism, and Falter hostage; to torture them; and to execute them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   A similar conclusion follows with respect to AAH's hostage taking, torture, and execution of Al-Taie.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.C.3. Iran taught members of AAH how to kidnap U.S. soldiers and how to keep them hidden from coalition forces.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 53 at 170 (Gartenstein-Ross). The evidence also showed that Iran provided AAH with intelligence and the use of its ratlines, which prevented U.S. forces from rescuing\n   Al-Taie.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 138-42 (Gartenstein-Ross). In addition, as Plaintiffs' experts testified, Iran provided AAH with significant, and perhaps complete, financial support,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 166-71 (Gartenstein-Ross), and that Iranian financial support was essential to the group's ability to detain Al-Taie for an extended period of time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 169-70 (Gartenstein-Ross). Accepting that testimony, Iran clearly provided \"material support\" for the acts at issue in this case. But, even without establishing such a direct nexus, Plaintiffs' proof would suffice. Because money is, of course, fungible and because \"terrorist organizations can hardly be counted on to keep careful bookkeeping records,\" it is sufficient for Plaintiffs to have shown-as they have-that Iran provided AAH with substantial financial assistance, regardless of whether they have also shown that any payments were provided \"directly for the specific act[s]\" of hostage taking, torture, and extrajudicial killing at issue in this case.\n   <em>\n    Kilburn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9377682,3433647\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/1123/\">\n    376 F.3d at 1130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Finally, the evidence showed that this material support was provided at the direction of Iranian officials or agents acting within the scope of their \"office, employment, or agency.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(a)(1). As described in the Court's findings of fact, Iran's Quds Force was responsible for cultivating proxies in other countries and did so with both the Lebanese Hezbollah and AAH.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.A. The Quds Force is part of the IRGC, which is, in turn, an arm of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Those findings are sufficient to satisfy the scope of office requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Causation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The only remaining requirement for finding a waiver of sovereign immunity under \u00a7 1605A is a showing that the injuries and deaths at issue were \"caused by\" Iran's provision of material support to AAH. 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1605A(a)(1). The D.C.

The support that Iran provided\n   to AAH was not only a \"substantial factor\" in the chain of events that culminated in the injuries and deaths of Fritz, Chism, Falter, and Al-Taie, it was a necessary ingredient. The evidence showed that, without Iran's support, AAH could not have successfully executed the PJCC attack,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.B.3.b, and could not have successfully kept Al-Taie captive,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.C.3. Likewise, the Court has no doubt that Plaintiffs' injuries were \"reasonably foreseeable or anticipated as a natural consequence\" of Iran's support to AAH. Even if Iran did not intend that the victims sustain the specific injuries at issue, the events that led to those injuries were a \"reasonably foreseeable\" consequence of Iran's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   In assessing reasonable foreseeability, moreover, the Court must consider \"the broader context\" of Iran's conduct.\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275860\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/751/#p785\">\n    864 F.3d at 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this respect, the evidence showed that Iran established a relationship with AAH as part of a comprehensive campaign to deter the U.S. from maintaining a presence in the Middle East by terrorizing and intimidating coalition forces. Ex. 65 at 18; Ex. 66 at 22-23. Iran actively supported AAH by providing funding, weapons, training, and intelligence, and it knew-and intended-that AAH would carry out attacks on coalition forces.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.A.3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. 66 at 55.

In contrast, the high-level intelligence on the Karbala attack-most notably, the conclusions summarized by Brigadier General Bergner during his press conference-consistently conclude that Iran was involved in the planning for the Karbala attack.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201471\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201471\">\n     at 71\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Gartenstein-Ross).
