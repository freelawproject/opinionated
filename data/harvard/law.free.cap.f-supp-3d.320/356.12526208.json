Mojica Did Not Receive Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mojica's contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel is unpersuasive. Mojica alleges that his attorney was ineffective because his attorney failed to: (1) warn Mojica that his \"sentence could not be challenged or changed without direct appeal\" after signing the plea agreement, and (2) inform Mojica that signing the plea agreement involved a waiver of direct appeal. (Civil Docket No. 1, Ex. 1 at pp. 1 &amp; 3.) Although Mojica claims that his attorney failed to explain the ramifications of his guilty plea, Mojica made contradictory representations in his plea agreement, change of plea hearing, and sentencing hearing, which undermine the assertions presented in his motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Restucci v.

In the agreement's \"understanding of rights\" section, Mojica acknowledged that the agreement was translated into Spanish for his understanding, that he comprehended all of his rights in relation to the indictment, and that he had reviewed and understood \"every part\" of the agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 10.

(Criminal Docket No. 92.) The Court asked Mojica, \"Do you underst[and] that if [the Court] do[es] sentence you according to the ... plea agreement, you waive and surrender your right to appeal your sentence and the judgment in the case?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 13.

Throughout the plea and sentencing phases, Mojica's attorney and the Court explained all steps to Mojica, including the consequences of his guilty plea. (Criminal Docket No. 92 at pp. 10-13; Criminal Docket No. 93 at pp. 10-11, 21; Criminal Docket No. 25 at pp. 6-10.) All proceedings were conducted in a careful and candid manner to ensure that Mojica\n   understood he was waiving his right to appeal, and to safeguard that Mojica was waiving his right knowingly and voluntarily.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
