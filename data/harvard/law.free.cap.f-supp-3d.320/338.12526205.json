The contract establishes the minimum qualifications for CSO candidates. (Docket No. 37, Ex. 2 at pp. 16-17.) According to the contract,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   each individual designated to perform as a CSO [shall] ha[ve] successfully completed or graduated from a certified Federal, state, county, local or military law enforcement training academy or program that provided instruction on the use of police powers in an armed capacity while dealing with the public.

In cases where a CSO applicant did not receive a certificate, the Contractor shall provide a signed statement from a supervisory official of the department or agency indicating an applicant was employed as a law enforcement officer and that no certificate or diploma was issued. The statement shall include all dates of employment the individual served in a law enforcement capacity.

L\u00f3pez and Domena worked as CSOs for Akal. (Docket No. 39, Ex. 2 at pp. 14-15, 17.)

They \"were part of the original group of thirteen (13) employees\" hired as CSOs in Puerto Rico, and they maintained their positions over the course of numerous changes in contractors, despite their lack of certificates. (Docket No. 39, Ex. 2 at pp. 6-7, 19-20, 36-37, 57-67.) Indeed, L\u00f3pez and Domena worked for a total of six (6) contractors during the thirty-two (32) year period, and no contractor before Walden had challenged the sufficiency L\u00f3pez's or Domena's qualifications due to their lack of certificates.
