[ECF No. 1]. Now before the Court are\n   Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 44] and Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment [ECF No. 50]. For the reasons set forth below, the motions are denied in part and granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

ED contracts with private loan servicers and private collection agencies (\"PCAs\") to service loans and collect on defaulted loans. Borrowers are entitled to certain benefits, including deferments, forbearances, and options for repayment plans. Additionally, there are programs available after a borrower defaults, such as cancellation due to disability. Servicers and PCAs are responsible for communicating with borrowers about these benefits. ED has developed policies and procedures to enable FSA to conduct oversight of the contractors and PCAs servicing and collecting on loans, including a PCA Procedures Manual that sets forth instructions to the PCAs, such as detailing collection procedures. Plaintiffs seek information concerning ED's oversight of the PCAs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs' FOIA request sought information about Defendant's relationship with PCAs, policies governing PCAs' debt collection activities, the manner in which PCAs are compensated, and information about Defendant's policies for monitoring the impact of student debt on communities of color, if such policies exist. The complete request is set forth in the Declaration of Ann Marie Pedersen. [ECF No. 49 at 2-6].

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Exemption 7\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant withheld certain material concerning its strategies for debt collection pursuant to FOIA Exemption 7, which allows the government to withhold \"records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes\" where,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the records \"would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7). The information at issue here includes portions of the PCA Procedures Manual that provide guidelines for collecting on a defaulted debt, including information about consolidation, wage garnishment, and rehabilitation agreements, as well as an agreement between ED and the Department of the Treasury regarding Treasury Offset Procedures, which sets forth guidance on how the two agencies collect on student loan debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   FOIA does not provide a definition of \"law enforcement purposes,\" and few cases have grappled with the meaning of that phrase in a context similar to the present case. Defendant argues that because it is required by statute to attempt to collect on student loan debt, it is engaged in law enforcement activity when it does so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203711\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (\"The head of an executive ... agency ... shall try to collect a claim of the United States Government for money or property arising out of the activities of, or referred to, the agency....\"). Plaintiffs respond that because borrowers' repayment obligations arise from a contract, and not from a statute or administrative law, the violation of the terms of the contract is not a violation of the law, and the collection of the debt is not a law enforcement activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This question arose in a New York federal district court case in which\n   another advocacy organization requested from Defendant essentially the same documentation at issue here. That court determined that the PCA Procedures Manual did not qualify as a \"law enforcement\" document because \"[t]he term 'law enforcement' pertains to the prevention and punishment of violations\n   <em>\n    of the law\n   </em>\n   ,\" and the agency was seeking \"to prevent violations of the terms of student loan contracts, not violations of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    N.Y. Legal Assistance Grp., Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Educ.\n   </em>\n   , No. 15 CIV. 3818 (LGS),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202973976\">\n    2017 WL 2973976\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (S.D.N.Y. July 12, 2017). Furthermore, the court reasoned, ED could not \"prove that disclosure 'could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law,' because the borrowers would not be circumventing the law-they would be circumventing the terms of their contract.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202973976\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7)(E) ). The Court concurs with this reasoning. \"The term 'law enforcement' in Exemption 7 refers to the act of enforcing the law, both civil and criminal.\"\n   <em>\n    Pub. Emps. for Envtl. Responsibility v. U.S. Section, Int'l Boundary &amp; Water Comm'n, U.S.-Mexico\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323632,3826164\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/195/\">\n    740 F.3d 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 203 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (citing\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   964 (9th ed. 2009) as \"defining 'law enforcement' as the 'detection and punishment of violations of the law' \") (additional citation omitted). When a borrower defaults on a student loan, he or she has not violated the law, and is not subject to criminal or civil sanctions. Thus, Defendant's debt collection activities fall outside the scope of \"law enforcement purposes\" protected by Exemption 7, and Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Exemption 5\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs also challenge Defendant's invocation of Exemption 5 to withhold portions of inter-agency emails, a draft of a plan to remedy deficiencies identified in an internal audit, and an internal litigation manual. Exemption 5 protects from disclosure \"[a]gency documents which would not be obtainable by a private litigant in an action against the agency under normal discovery rules (e.g., attorney-client, work-product, executive privilege).\"\n   <em>\n    Providence Journal Co. v.

The CAP is dated August 25, 2015, but Plaintiffs note that the CAP lists \"action items\" that reflect \"actual completion\" dates in 2014. Plaintiffs argue that these \"actual completion\" dates demonstrate that the redacted material is not predecisional, but instead is a list of final decisions that were made by the agency. In response, Defendant filed the Supplemental Pedersen Declaration, which states that the CAP was drafted \"in response to program deficiencies identified in the [Office of the Inspector General (\"OIG\") ] Audit,\" and that the action items in the CAP and their respective completion dates indicate \"proposed evidence of completed tasks that the FSA could provide OIG to support the argument that FSA had completed the required corrective actions.\" [ECF No. 57-1 at 3]. Thus, the version of the CAP at issue here reflects the subjective opinion of a lower-level staffer as to which items would be most helpful to higher-level officials in formulating the final version of the CAP. Given this context, the Court concludes that action items listed within the draft CAP are predecisional in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs also contend that the redacted portions of the CAP were adopted by the agency by August 2015, and thus lost their status as predecisional material, citing\n   <em>\n    Coastal States Gas Corp. v.

First, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant has not demonstrated that this material is deliberative. Defendant asserts that it is not required to identify a specific decision to which the document corresponds, to explain that it was prepared to assist in the decision-making process, or to state that the document temporally precedes the specified decision, but Plaintiffs are correct that under First Circuit precedent, such a showing is precisely what is required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Providence Journal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1875104\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/981/552/#p557\">\n    981 F.2d at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (document is predecisional if \"agency can (i) pinpoint the specific agency decision to which the document correlates, (ii) establish that its author prepared the document for the purpose of assisting the agency official charged with making the agency decision, and (iii) verify that the document precedes, in temporal sequence, the decision to which it relates\" (citations and quotation marks omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Here, Defendant has met the first factor of the test, but has not provided sufficient information to allow the Court to conclude that Defendant has satisfied the second and third factors. The Pedersen Declaration states that the emails pertaining to the development of Frequently Asked Questions (\"FAQ\") about collection fees \"are part of the [agency's] process of creating future collection policies.\" [ECF No. 49 at 18]. In addition, the declaration states that the emails among agency employees and between agency employees and loan servicers contain \"discussions concerning the appropriate response to borrowers' requests for assistance and the processing of particular borrowers' claims,\" which were \"conducted prior to a final decision with respect to a particular borrower issue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1875104\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/981/552/#p557\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on this declaration, the Court can conclude that the emails correlate to a specific agency decision, the creation of a FAQ or an official agency response to a borrower, and can infer the third factor, that the emails precede the decision in temporal sequence. Defendant has fallen short in demonstrating the second factor, however, because it has not proven that the emails were written for the purpose of assisting the agency official responsible for making the final decision. It is possible that the documents were properly withheld and that Defendant could prove its entitlement to invoke the exemption, so the motions for summary judgment as to these documents are denied without prejudice and with leave to renew.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs are also correct that Defendant has not proven that the emails are deliberative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Providence Journal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1875104\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/981/552/#p557\">\n    981 F.2d at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (predecisional document is \"deliberative\" where it \"(i) formed an essential link in a specified consultative process, (ii)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   reflect[s] the personal opinions of the writer rather than the policy of the agency, and (iii) if released, would inaccurately reflect or prematurely disclose the views of the agency\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ). The Pedersen Declaration and Supplemental Pedersen Declaration do not clearly indicate that the emails \"formed an essential link\" in the process of creating a FAQ or responding to a borrower, nor do they state that the emails reflect the writers' personal opinions (though the Supplemental Pedersen Declaration describes the content as \"preliminary\" [ECF No. 57-1 at 4], this is not the same thing as a personal opinion). The Pedersen Declaration does state that the release of some of the redacted content \"might confuse and mislead the public because certain of the redacted information includes reasoning that was not ultimately adopted by the [agency]\" [ECF No. 49 at 18], though this leaves open the possibility that some of the content was subsequently adopted as agency policy and thus should not be redacted. Therefore, to be entitled to summary judgment as to the withholding of these emails, Defendant must submit evidence with its renewed summary judgment motion demonstrating that the withheld documents satisfy all three factors to qualify as \"deliberative.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiffs contend that the emails may reflect Defendant's \"working law,\" and thus must be disclosed. A document constitutes an agency's \"working law,\" which falls outside the protection of Exemption 5, when it \"is more properly characterized as an 'opinion[ ] [or] interpretation [ ] which embod[ies] the agency's effective law and policy.' \"\n   <em>\n    Brennan Ctr. for Justice v.

The Supreme Court has characterized \"working law\" as being post-decisional-that is, it encompasses \"communications made after [a policy] decision [is made] and designed to explain it,\" in contrast to predecisional communications, which \"reflect the agency's group thinking in the process of working out its policy and determining what its law shall be.\"\n   <em>\n    Sears\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541320\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/132/#p161\">\n    421 U.S. at 152-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541320\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/132/#p161\">\n    95 S.Ct. 1504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Defendant has not yet made the required showing that the documents are predecisional. Second, it is not apparent that the FAQ or a response to a borrower inquiry would be a new policy or decision, rather than an explanation of existing policies. The Pedersen Declaration states that the development of the FAQ is \"part of the Department's process of creating future collection policies\" [ECF No. 49 at 18], but it does not elaborate on what potential future collection policies are at issue, how the development of the FAQ relates to these policies, or why the FAQ would set out new policy, rather than clarifying existing policy. Indeed, the nature of a \"FAQ\" suggests that it would be an explanation of policy that has already been adopted. Next, the Pedersen Declaration asserts that the emails concerning the response to a borrower were \"conducted prior to a final decision with respect to a particular borrower issue\" [ECF No. 49 at 18], but such a decision would not necessarily reflect the formulation of a new policy, rather than the application of an existing policy to a particular set of facts. Accordingly, Defendant is not entitled to summary judgment on this issue at this time, but may include additional evidence in a renewed summary judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Attorney Work Product Privilege\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs also challenge Defendant's withholding of portions of the PCA Procedures Manual pursuant to the attorney work product privilege.

There is no requirement that a document must be written by an attorney to be protected by the privilege.

While it may be true, as Plaintiffs assert, that \"administrative\" information \"concerning such matters as payment of witnesses, papering procedures, sample forms, office organization, and the like\" does not fall within the scope of the privilege,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jordan v.

For example, some sections of the manual explain which loans should be referred to litigation, and how the litigation\n   materials should be prepared. [ECF No. 54-10 at 5-7]. Thus, the information sheds light on Defendant's litigation strategy, thoughts, and plans for the presentation of evidence. Along these lines, the D.C. Circuit recently determined that a manual prepared by DOJ for criminal prosecutions, which contained \"litigation strategies,\" gave \"practical how-to advice ... about how to handle different scenarios and problems,\" discussed \"the types of challenges prosecutors may encounter in the course of prosecutions and potential responses and approaches,\" and \"contemplate[d] facts that may arise in judicial proceedings and evaluate[d] how a court would likely consider those facts\" was protected by the work product privilege.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ass'n of Criminal Def.
