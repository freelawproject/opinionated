In response, Plaintiffs say that vacatur is inappropriate for three reasons: (1) the Conservation Groups lack Article III standing to pursue any relief in this matter; (2) the Conservation Groups failed to timely appeal the court's April 17 Order; and (3) the established practice of vacatur is unwarranted in a case such as this one, where the unsuccessful intervenors' side prevailed on the merits.

Cir. 2009) (alteration in original) ). Although the court denied intervention based in part on lack of standing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   April 17 Order at 1-5, there can be no dispute that the Conservation Groups had Article III standing to appeal from that adverse ruling,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   15A Charles Alan Wright, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice and Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3902 (2d ed.)

Cir. 2001) (\"[D]enial of intervention as of right is an appealable, final order regardless of the merits of the claim for intervention as of right.\"). As the Circuit dismissed the Groups' appeal on mootness grounds but remanded to consider the question of vacatur, the Conservation Groups' standing to seek such relief cannot be in doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs nevertheless insist that the Conservation Groups lack standing because \"there is no longer a live district court case in which to intervene.\" Pls.' Opp'n at 6. But that argument fails because it conflates the concepts of standing and mootness. To put the difference succinctly, \"[t]he requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation (standing) must continue throughout its existence (mootness).\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777409\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/388/#p397\">\n    445 U.S. 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 397,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777409\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/388/#p397\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777409\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/388/#p397\">\n    63 L.Ed.2d 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the Groups' appeal from the order denying intervention is moot, but the Groups' personal stake in the litigation remains unaltered, particularly since the sole remaining issue of vacatur directly affects their interests. The finality of the court's decision on the merits therefore does not strip the Conservation Groups of standing to pursue vacatur of the court's April 17 Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Alternatively, Plaintiffs argue that the Groups lack standing because they cannot demonstrate the requisite injury in fact insofar as they have \"failed to discuss how the district court's decision, which was case- and fact-specific, would have any adverse precedential effect.\" Pls.' Opp'n at 7. Plaintiffs, however, cite no authority for the proposition that, to establish standing, a party or putative intervenor seeking vacatur must show that allowing the adverse decision to remain will have an \"adverse precedential effect.\"\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n. That is not surprising. Accepting Plaintiffs' position would directly contradict the Circuit's instruction that \"typically\" the district court's decision should be vacated when that decision is no longer\n   amenable to review due to mootness or a lack of standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maydak v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3554594,6053150\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/166/\">\n    630 F.3d 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 177 (D.C. Cir. 2010). In any event, requiring a showing of \"adverse precedential effect\" would make little sense, as district court decisions, like the April 17 Order, have no precedential force. Accordingly, the court therefore rejects Plaintiffs' standing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs' timeliness objection is rooted in a flawed reading of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. According to Plaintiffs, Rule 4(a)(1)(B)'s 60-day time period for appeal is inapplicable because, having been denied intervention in this court, the Groups are not a \"party\" within the meaning of that Rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 5-6 (citing Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B) ). As such, Plaintiffs contend, the Groups had only 30 days to appeal,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), and therefore their notice of appeal from the April 17 Order-filed 49 days after the Order-is untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs pressed this same timeliness argument in the D.C. Circuit,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Appellees' Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss Case as Moot and to Vacate,\n   <em>\n    Alfa Int'l Seafood v. Ross\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 17-5138, Doc.

The Court concluded that when the United States \"decline[s] to intervene in a privately initiated [False Claims Act] action,\" the United States is not a \"party\" to the litigation and therefore must bring its appeal pursuant to the 30-day time limit of Rule 4(a)(1)(A).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653672\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/928/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653672\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/928/\">\n    at 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653672\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/928/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Despite the significance Plaintiffs attribute to it,\n   <em>\n    Eisenstein\n   </em>\n   does not stand for the proposition that a proposed intervenor is not a \"party\" to the appeal of the denial of its\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   intervention; rather, it simply affirms the principle that a proposed intervenor is not a \"party\" to a matter in which it has not yet intervened. Indeed, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Eisenstein\n   </em>\n   recognized that, even without intervention, the United States could appeal other types\n   of collateral orders in a False Claims Act action, as in those circumstances, \"the Government is a party for purposes of appealing the specific order at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653672\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/928/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 931 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653672\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/928/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, here, the Conservation Groups are a \"party\" to the appeal of the April 17 Order, and therefore timely filed their notice of appeal within the 60-day deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The court turns last to Plaintiffs' argument against vacatur on the merits. According to Plaintiffs, because the Groups' side in the underlying litigation prevailed when the court upheld the Seafood Traceability Rule-albeit without their intervention-vacatur is inappropriate. In support of its argument, Plaintiffs distinguish the Groups from the appellants in other cases applying vacatur under\n   <em>\n    Munsingwear\n   </em>\n   , highlighting that those litigants were all \"disappointed appellants.\" Pls.' Opp'n at 2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To begin with, the Conservation Groups are not \"lower court winners\" with regard to the intervention decision; in that respect, the Groups are decidedly \"disappointed appellants\" who were denied the relief they sought before this court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, contrary to Plaintiffs' contention, the \"principal\" consideration in determining whether vacatur is warranted is not whether the appellant's \"side\" prevailed on the merits, but instead \"whether the party seeking relief from the judgment caused the mootness by voluntary action.\"\n   <em>\n    Bancorp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1332416\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/18/#p29\">\n    513 U.S. at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1332416,6117237\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/115/386/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[I]f the party who lost below did not cause the case to become moot, that is, if happenstance or the actions of the prevailing party ended the controversy, vacatur remains the standard form of relief.\"\n   <em>\n    N. Cal. Power Agency v. Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9042073,9169884,3434951\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/223/\">\n    393 F.3d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 225 (D.C. Cir. 2004). By framing the vacatur inquiry in terms of fairness and fault, courts ensure that \"those who have been prevented from obtaining the review to which they are entitled are not treated as if there had been a review.\"\n   <em>\n    Camreta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5939592,12459539\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/692/\">\n    563 U.S. at 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5939592,12459539\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/692/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Applying these principles, the court holds that the equities favor vacating the April 17 Order. First, \"the roles of the parties in mooting the case counsel in favor of vacatur.\"\n   <em>\n    Sands\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325889,12310467\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/778/\">\n    825 F.3d at 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs' decision not to appeal the adverse summary judgment decision had the effect of mooting the Groups' appeal of the intervention order. The Groups therefore were not responsible for rendering their appeal unreviewable. Second, the concern underlying\n   <em>\n    Bancorp\n   </em>\n   that parties may seek to \"manipulate the judicial system by rolling the dice in the district court and then washing away any unfavorable outcome through use of settlement and vacatur\" is not present here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Humane Soc. of U.S. v. Kempthorne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3570425,3567284\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/527/181/\">\n    527 F.3d 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 186 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Again, the Conservation Groups' appeal was mooted for reasons\n   outside their control; thus, they cannot be accused of attempting to game the system. Finally, the public interest would be served by vacatur of April 17 Order, as doing so \"clear[s] the path for future relitigation of the issues.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sands\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325889,12310467\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/778/\">\n    825 F.3d at 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bancorp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1332416\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/18/#p29\">\n    513 U.S. at 22-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1332416,6117237\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/115/386/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). To be sure, as Plaintiffs argue, there will be no relitigation of the Groups' right to intervene in this case, as the case is now closed on the merits. But the Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Sands\n   </em>\n   could not have intended \"future relitigation\" to pertain solely to the case at bar. After all, once an appeal is dismissed as moot or for lack of standing, the prospect that the same case will be brought by the same litigants in the trial court always will be remote. Clearly then, the term \"future relitigation\" encompasses other matters. Vacatur of the April 17 Order ensures that, in future bids to intervene, the Conservation Groups will not have to contend with an adverse decision that they were unable to contest on appeal through no fault of their own. In sum, the court concludes that the equities justify vacating its decision denying the Conservation Groups' request to intervene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Circumstances beyond the Conservation Groups' control have rendered moot their appeal of this court's decision denying their motion to intervene. Accordingly, the court adheres to established practice and grants the Groups' motion to vacate the April 17 Order, ECF No. 92.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Plaintiffs' reliance on the Supreme Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Camreta\n    </em>\n    to argue that the Conservation Groups are \"lower court winner[s]\" is misplaced. In that case, government officials appealed a decision granting them qualified immunity from suit, but holding that they violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights.\n    <em>\n     Camreta\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5939592,12459539\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/692/\">\n     563 U.S. at 699-700\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5939592,12459539\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/692/\">\n     131 S.Ct. 2020\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Court concluded that, although the officials prevailed in the court below, their appeal of the adverse constitutional decision constituted an exception to the \"usual rule against considering prevailing parties' petitions.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5939592,12459539\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/692/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5939592,12459539\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/692/\">\n     at 709\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5939592,12459539\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/692/\">\n     131 S.Ct. 2020\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Camreta\n    </em>\n    has no bearing on the instant decision, as, unlike the partially successful government officials in that case, the Conservation Groups did not prevail on the only issue they were permitted to litigate: the right to intervene.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
