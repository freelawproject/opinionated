MCCONNELL, JR., United States District Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Michael Jardin sued his former employer Defendant CoxCom, LLC d/b/a Cox Communications New England (\"Cox\") for age-based employment discrimination. Before the Court is Cox's Motion for Summary Judgment. ECF No. 11. Because the Court finds that the material facts are not in dispute, summary judgment is appropriate. Those undisputed facts, interpreted through the law of age discrimination, are in Cox's favor; as such, the Court GRANTS Cox's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr, Jardin drove a Cox-branded vehicle as a facilities technician, performing maintenance work inside and outside the company from 1996 until 2015. During the course of his employment, Mr. Jardin maintained satisfactory standing and Cox never reprimanded him for any misconduct. On July 9, 2015, Cox terminated him for egregious misconduct as set forth in Cox's Corrective Action Policy, specifically for dumping trash in the parking lot of one of Cox's customers. Mr. Jardin was 53 years old when he was terminated; Cox employed at least 195 other individuals who were Mr. Jardin's age or older,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Jardin argues that he began to have issues at work when Todd Andrukiewicz became interim facilities supervisor and Odell Anderson assumed the role of facilities manager in February 2015. Immediately after Mr, Andrukiewicz started as interim supervisor and five months prior to Mr. Jardin's termination, in two different department meetings, Mr. Andrukiewicz referred to Mr. Jardin as a \"weird old man.\" When Mr. Jardin responded, \"Why do you keep doing this?\" Mr. Andrukiewicz apologized. Mr. Jardin also asserts that Mr. Andrukiewicz gave him fewer projects and assignments and required him to do corporate tracer training, but sent two younger individuals before or instead of Mr. Jardin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   His pay and benefits remained the same and he worked the same amount of overtime hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In June 2015, Cox received a complaint from one of its customers, Pawtucket Public Access, that someone had dropped trash out of a Cox-branded vehicle onto its premises. Cox then began an investigation. After viewing two surveillance videos, Cox made a preliminary determination that Mr. Jardin was likely responsible for dumping the trash at Pawtucket Public Access. On July 9, 2015, Mr. Andrukiewicz, Mr. Anderson, and a Cox Human Resources Manager, William Roccio interviewed Mr. Jardin. During the interview, as well as in\n   his deposition, Mr. Jardin admitted to dropping the trash on the customer's premises and failing to pick it up, but asserted that he did not intentionally litter. Based on this admission, Cox terminated Mr. Jardin for \"egregious misconduct\" under its Corrective Action Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following his termination, Mr. Jardin filed suit against Cox alleging employment discrimination based on age under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20621\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (1967) (\"ADEA\"), the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act, R.I.

The ADEA makes it unlawful for employers to \"discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's age.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20623\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (1967).

Gen. Laws \u00a7 42-112-1 (1990) ; R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 28-5-7 (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green\n   </em>\n   set forth a burden-shifting method to aid in the analysis.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    411 U.S. 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    36 L.Ed.2d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973). Analyzing an employment discrimination case can be challenging due to its subtleties; employment discrimination rarely comes with \"smoking gun\" evidence or eyewitness testimony. Under the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   framework, a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case. The First Circuit has held that proving a prima facie case in a discrimination action is \"not onerous.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Stratus Comput., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521613\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/40/11/\">\n    40 F.3d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 15 n.4 (1st Cir. 1994). \"If the plaintiff successfully bears this relatively light burden, we presume that the employer engaged in impermissible [ ] discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521613\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/40/11/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 15 (citing\n   <em>\n    Texas Dept. of Cmty.

The burden then shifts to the employer, who must then state a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision; if the employer is successful, the inference of discrimination then disappears. The plaintiff is then required to show that the employer's stated reason is a pretext for discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kosereis v.

Shinseki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078339\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/49/#p54\">\n    629 F.3d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 54 (1st Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Cox has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Mr. Jardin's termination, that is, he committed misconduct in violation of Cox policy. The misconduct, which Mr. Jardin does not dispute, was that he knowingly failed to pick up trash that fell out of his Cox-branded vehicle onto a customer's property. Whether dumping the trash was intentional or not, Cox determined that Mr. Jardin violated Cox policy and decided to terminate him. Whether this Court or anyone else would have made that same decision under these circumstances is irrelevant. \"Courts may not sit as super personnel departments, assessing the merits- or even rationality-of employers' nondiscriminatory business decisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Mesnick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524144\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/950/816/#p823\">\n    950 F.2d at 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He has the burden to produce evidence, (1) that Cox fabricated the proffered reason for termination-violation of Cox policy, and (2) that Cox's true motive to terminate him was age discrimination. To show pretext, a plaintiff \"must do more than cast doubt on the rationale proffered by the employer[;]\" \" 'the evidence must be of such strength and quality as to permit a reasonable finding that the ... [termination] was obviously or manifestly unsupported.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ruiz v. Posadas de San Juan Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11902390\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/124/243/#p248\">\n    124 F.3d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248-49 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Tr. of Boston Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529378\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/337/#p346\">\n    891 F.2d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 346 (1st Cir. 1989).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This is where Mr. Jardin's claim of age discrimination begins to unravel. First, the Court notes that Mr. Jardin has produced no evidence that Cox fabricated its reason for firing him. In fact, he admitted\n   that he did not pick up trash that fell out of his truck onto a customer's property. Even if one found, however, that Cox fabricated the reason for firing Mr. Jardin,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Jardin's claim ultimately fails because he cannot prove that the true motive was age discrimination\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On the final element, after reviewing the evidence, the Court finds that Mr. Jardin failed to present evidence that his age was the real reason Cox fired him. He asserts that on two occasions, Mr. Andrukiewicz, his interim supervisor, made a comment within the first few weeks after he started the job, that Mr. Jardin was a \"weird old man\" and that Mr. Andrukiewicz changed his job responsibilities. Regarding the comments, it is undisputed that Mr. Andrukiewicz made the comments and he apologized to Mr. Jardin. After he apologized, there is no evidence that any other Cox employee made age-related comments about Mr. Jardin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cameron v.

January 4, 2013) (\"an age discrimination claim cannot rest on the foundation of a stray remark\"). In addition, although Mr. Andrukiewicz supported the decision to terminate Mr. Jardin for his misconduct, he was not primarily responsible for doing so; Human Resources Manager William Roccio made this final decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Furthermore, Mr. Jardin has failed to draw a causal relationship between the remarks and his termination. Mr. Andrukiewicz made these remarks around four to five months prior to Mr. Jardin's termination. Where isolated remarks-like those attributed to Mr. Andrukiewicz here-lack specific timing or context or linkage to the adverse employment decision, they are insufficient to prove an employer's discriminatory animus.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Straughn v.
