CBX was represented by Mark Fassold; Defendants were represented by Daniel Lane. After careful consideration of the memoranda in support of and in opposition to the motions, and in light of the parties' arguments at the hearing, the Court, for the reasons that follow,\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Ace's motion for partial summary judgment, and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   CBX's motion for partial summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   CBX was the lessee of the Hibdon Lease, a mineral tract located in Zavala County, Texas. (Dkt. # 16 at 7.) As lessee, CBX arranged for the drilling and operation of the Picosa Creek IV Well (\"the Well\") to be performed by Espada Operating, LLC (\"Espada\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In 2011, Espada\n   drilled the well bore, placing almost 900 feet of surface casing and more than 5,700 feet of production casing into the Well, and it installed a fracking system into the production casing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On October 25, 2011, Espada attempted to pressurize the fracking system; a few months later, on January 25, 2012, Espada attempted to pull the production casing out of the well bore. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In pulling out the production casing, Espada discovered a fracture of about 3,400 feet in the Well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Espada determined that the production casing below the fracture could not be recovered from the well bore. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because the casing was irremovable, the well bore could not be restored, and the Well was plugged and abandoned as a result. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Espada was a named insured on a Commercial General Liability (\"CGL Policy\") issued by Ace American, with a coverage period from April 2, 2011, through April 2, 2012. (Dkt. # 16 at 7.) The CGL Policy was accompanied by an \"Underground Resources and Equipment Coverage Endorsement,\" which replaced and/or added exclusions in the CGL Policy, while also adding certain definitions to the CGL Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Espada was also a named insured on an Umbrella Policy issued by Ace Property, which covered the same policy period of April 2, 2011, through April 2, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND-STATE COURT CASE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 21, 2013, CBX brought suit for damages arising from its total loss of the use of the Well against several defendants-but not Espada-in the 293rd Judicial District Court of Zavala County, Texas (\"underlying case\"). (Dkt. # 16 at Ex. C.) In October 2013, CBX amended its state court petition, adding Espada as a defendant, and appending a Certificate of Merit of a licensed engineer who described Espada's role in the failure of the Well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. D.) According to CBX, Espada filed its original answer on November 19, 2013, represented by counsel retained by Ace American after Espada tendered the defense of the lawsuit to Ace.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Exs. E, L.) The state court set a trial in this case for February 9, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. F.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 7, 2015, CBX filed its second amended petition, itemizing alleged damages to its tangible property including: drilling operations, surface casing, unrecovered production casing, the Well and the well bore, the oil and gas itself, and the lease. (Dkt. # 16 at Ex. G.) On August 13, 2015, Espada filed a third party petition, suing three separate parties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. H.) Espada's third party petition stated that it \"alleges that a catastrophic failure of the casing occurred down hole in the Well,\" and that the \"Well allegedly could not be repaired and was plugged and abandoned.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 22, 2015, CBX served a\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   demand upon Espada through its counsel, seeking to fully and unconditionally release its claims for an amount within the limits of the policies issued to Espada by Ace American and Ace Property. (Dkt. # 16 at Ex. I.) By its terms, the\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   demand was set to expire on October 23, 2015, at 5:00pm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   However, on October 15, 2015, the Claims Director for Ace American, Matthew Spector, sent a withdrawal letter to Espada. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. K.) The letter indicated that Ace American intended \"to cease the retention of defense counsel effective fourteen days from that date of [the] letter,\" or, on October 29, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Spector's letter characterized CBX's claims as non-professional\n   liability negligence claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On November 30, 2015, approximately 71 days before the February 9, 2016 trial setting, the state court granted Espada's defense counsel's motion to withdraw as counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Exs. L, M.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A pre-trial hearing was held in the state court case on February 1, 2016; Espada failed to appear at the hearing. (Dkt. # 16 at Ex. N.) Because of Espada's failure to appear at the hearing, CBX requested the state court enter judgment in CBX's favor against Espada.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court ordered that judgment be entered in CBX's favor and set the matter for February 10, 2016, to hear evidence in support of damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On February 10, 2016, the state court heard evidence from CBX's witnesses and exhibits in support of its claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. O.) The state court entered judgment, finding that Espada was negligent and awarded damages and post-judgment interest payable to CBX by Espada. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. N.) According to CBX, the judgment became final and is no longer appealable. (Dkt. # 16 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On November 1, 2016, the state court entered an Order for Turnover Relief (\"turnover order\"), transferring ownership of Espada's causes of action against Ace American and Ace Property to CBX.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. # 16 at Ex. P.) The turnover order also compelled Espada to execute an assignment of those claims to CBX; according to CBX, Espada has complied with that portion of the turnover order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11; Ex. P.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND-FEDERAL COURT CASE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On January 10, 2017, CBX filed suit in this Court against Ace American and Ace Property. (Dkt. # 1.) Its first amended complaint alleges claims against Defendants for (1) breach of the\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   duty to reasonably settle claims within the scope of coverage and for an amount within the limits of the applicable policy; (2) bad faith; (3) breach of contract; (4) deceptive insurance practices; and (5) declaratory judgment regarding Defendants' duties to defend and indemnify Espada in the underlying case. (Dkt. # 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pursuant to the Court's scheduling order entered in this case on April 13, 2017, the parties were allowed to file partial motions for summary judgment regarding Ace's duty to defend the underlying case based on the terms and conditions of the CGL Policy and the Umbrella Policy. (Dkt. # 14.) In accordance with that Order, CBX and Ace filed cross motions for partial summary judgment on Ace's duty to defend in the underlying case. On October 16, 2017, the Court granted Ace's motion and denied CBX's motion, finding that the insurance policy at issue does not apply to the type of property damage alleged by CBX. (Dkt. # 47.) Accordingly, the Court held that Ace did not have a duty to defend Espada in the underlying case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In accordance with the Court's scheduling order, the parties were allowed to file a second motion for partial summary judgment. On October 20, 2017, Ace filed its motion, seeking a declaration that the underlying judgment that CBX obtained against Espada in the underlying case is not binding on Ace nor admissible as evidence of damages in the instant suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   # 46.) CBX filed its motion on the same day, asking the Court to declare that the underlying judgment is binding and admissible and fixes the actual amount of damages of its\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   claim in an amount in excess of the judgment rendered. (Dkt. # 47.) The motions have been fully briefed and are now ready for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    APPLICABLE LAW\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A movant is entitled to summary judgment upon showing that \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact,\" and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ace also asserts that Espada had millions of dollars in liability, and was prohibited from acting as an oil and gas operator by order of the Texas Railroad Commission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, according to Ace, Espada was defunct and insolvent and had no real stake in the outcome of the underlying suit, nor did it have any incentive to defend itself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Ace further highlights its argument by asserting that the very manner in which the $105 million judgment occurred underscores the complete absence of an adversarial proceeding. (Dkt. # 46 at 2.) Ace argues that the exorbitant amount of the judgment is comprised of speculative damages that are not recoverable under Texas law and are in fact barred by Espada's contract with CBX. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Instead, Ace argues the damages portion of the underlying judgment was a sham proceeding that the Texas Supreme Court sought to eradicate when it imposed the fully adversarial requirement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   CBX, on the other hand and in support of its position that the underlying judgment was the result of a fully adversarial trial, asserts that there was no pretrial agreement that eliminated Espada's financial risk of liability for the damages awarded during the underlying trial. (Dkt. # 47 at 12.) CBX also contends that Espada had a meaningful stake in the outcome of the underlying litigation and Espada attempted to hire counsel to sue Ace to force Ace to resume Espada's defense in the underlying suit.

Thus, under the Texas Supreme Court's instruction in\n   <em>\n    Hamel\n   </em>\n   , the Court should normally apply the presumption that the lack of any pretrial agreement in this case suggests that the underlying judgment was the result of a fully adversarial proceeding. However, the facts in\n   <em>\n    Hamel\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable from the facts here. In\n   <em>\n    Hamel\n   </em>\n   , the insured-defendant-represented by counsel-still attended the damages hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386752\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/525/655/\">\n    525 S.W.3d at 665-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, while\n   <em>\n    Hamel\n   </em>\n   contemplated a situation where, as here, the parties did not enter into a pretrial agreement,\n   <em>\n    Hamel\n   </em>\n   did not address the situation before this Court where the insured-defendant failed to show up at all at the time of trial after it lost its defense from the insurer. Ace argues therefore that the presumption in\n   <em>\n    Hamel\n   </em>\n   should not apply in this case because of Espada's failure to show up at all to the trial and damages hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Assuming without deciding that the presumption applies in this case, the Court finds that, in any case, Ace has presented sufficient evidence that Espada had no\n   meaningful stake in the underlying judgment. Once Ace withdrew its defense of Espada in the underlying case, there is no real dispute that Espada lacked the financial resources to retain an attorney to maintain its defense. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 47 at 7; Dkt. # 46-1 Ex. 4 at 72:13-19, Ex. 3 at 26:22-25.) It is also undisputed that the Texas Railroad Commission prohibited Espada from acting as a well operator, thereby prohibiting a major part of its operations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386752\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/525/655/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) While this is some evidence that Espada lacked a meaningful stake, the Court cannot consider a lack of financial resources by itself in making such a determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386752\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/525/655/\">\n    525 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   668 n. 9. Thus, as further evidence, Ace points to the fact that Espada completely failed to show up at all at the trial and subsequent damages hearing. (Dkt. # 46 at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Extending\n   <em>\n    Hamel\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gandy\n   </em>\n   to the most straight-forward interpretation, the fact that Espada failed to appear at docket call in the underlying trial and damages hearing, leads the Court to believe that the trial and underlying judgment was not fully adversarial and therefore cannot be used as evidence in this case. However, to combat this conclusion, CBX asserts that although Espada did not show up at the trial or damages hearing, it had very valid reasons for not attending, none of which were related to its lack of material or financial interest in the outcome. For instance, CBX contends that Espada's president did not attend \"solely because of his physical limitations as a quadriplegic and not because of any other reason.\" (Dkt. # 49 at 13.) CBX also argues that Espada's business manager did not attend because he \"had been told in other cases that individuals could not represent corporate entities\" and because the proceedings were being held in Zavala County and not for any other reason. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Ex. U at 37:14-38:19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   CBX also argues that at the time of trial, Espada still had a meaningful stake in the outcome of the underlying litigation because (1) it held the right to receive a fee in exchange for making several different wells produce and it did not want to have a judgment against it if it wanted to continue its business; (2) it attempted to hire counsel to sue Ace to force Ace to continue its defense in the underlying litigation, but the law firm declined to take the case; (3) to this day, Espada remains a going concern in that the business has never been dissolved and it still presently files tax returns; and (4) as an operating company, Espada did not need any assets to generate revenue because \"its assets were the people that were running it as managers,\" and that it was designed to be insolvent as a result of \"incurring liabilities like for these plugging of wells.\" (Dkt. # 47 at 19-20; Ex. U at 52:20-53:9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In considering all of the evidence together, the Court finds that the $105 million underlying judgment entered against Espada was not the result of a fully adversarial proceeding. While CBX has produced some evidence that Espada did in fact attempt to hire counsel to sue Ace into continuing to defend Espada in the underlying suit (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 47 at 19; Ex. U at 34:20-36:15; 36:16-37:5), CBX has failed to show that Espada attempted to hire counsel to defend\n   <em>\n    itself.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. # 49-25 at 32.) Ace's summary judgment evidence includes deposition testimony from Espada's manager, who stated that Espada never attempted to find an attorney to defend Espada in the underlying suit because it would amount to \"throwing good money after bad.\" (Dkt. # 46, Ex. 4 at 72:3-10.) And while CBX's reasons for Espada's failure to\n   <em>\n    physically\n   </em>\n   show up at the proceedings seem valid on their face, and despite making other arguments that Espada was still a viable company at the time of the underlying judgment, CBX has not explained\n   why Espada was unable to submit a written letter or some other evidence concerning Espada's defense or position on CBX's damages. Thus, even if Espada was in a dire financial situation, there are some steps it could have likely taken to more readily defend itself from the extraordinary $105 million in damages obtained against it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In fact, the only evidence produced at the damages proceeding in the underlying suit was from CBX. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 1-18.) At that proceeding, CBX produced six witnesses and 47 exhibits, without any witnesses or testimony from any other party. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Such a proceeding is antithetical to an \"adversarial proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gandy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10019906\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/925/696/#p714\">\n    925 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   714 ;\n   <em>\n    Hamel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386752\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/525/655/\">\n    525 S.W.3d at 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining \"adversarial\" as \"when the parties oppose each other\").
