L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (6) (1986 ed.). The commission, affirming the decision of the hearing commissioner, determined that Gnerre was liable because he sexually harassed Silverstein during the course of her tenancy. Gnerre argues that the commission\u2019s decision was based on an erroneous standard of law and was not supported by substantial evidence. We do not agree. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">We summarize the facts found by the hearing commissioner. Barbara Silverstein, a single woman, lived with her young son in an apartment located in Revere. At the time of the hearing in 1984, Silverstein had lived in the apartment for seven years. Silverstein\u2019s building contained four apartment units. Antonio Gnerre owned the apartment building in which Silverstein resided. Gnerre also owned the apartment building located across the street from Silverstein\u2019s building. During the course of her tenancy, Silverstein saw Gnerre when he visited his properties to collect rent, to make repairs, or to show apartments to prospective tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Silverstein alleged several acts of sexual harassment. In August, 1981, Silverstein returned home in a car driven by her brother-in-law. As she got out of the car in front of her apartment building, Gnerre came out of an alley located next to his property across the street from Silverstein\u2019s building. Gnerre called out to Silverstein: \u201cHow many times did you get laid this week?\u201d In December, 1981, Gnerre came to Silverstein\u2019s door to collect the rent. Silverstein told Gnerre that she would have the money for him later that day. Gnerre pointed to the fly of his trousers and said, \u201cI got a big sausage, you want?\u201d Silverstein responded that she did not understand what he meant. Gnerre repeated the question, smiled, and left. In May, 1983, Gnerre entered Silverstein\u2019s apartment to make repairs subsequent to an inspection by the Revere board of health. Gnerre replastered a portion of the wall in Silverstein\u2019s bedroom. Silverstein asked Gnerre if he intended to leave the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>repaired wall bare without painting or wallpapering it, to which Gnerre responded, \u201cWell, you can get a picture of a naked man there right over your bed \u2014 you can get a nice picture.\u201d In September, 1983, Silverstein was leaving the apartment building in the company of her then six year old son. Gnerre yelled to Silverstein from the alley next to his property across the street, \u201cNice pair of tits, honey.\u201d Silverstein\u2019s son asked her what Gnerre\u2019s comment meant. Silverstein began to cry.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Silverstein\u2019s mother, Ruth, witnessed the incident of September, 1983, and corroborated her daughter\u2019s account of the event. Ruth Silverstein also said that her daughter telephoned her shortly after the incident of December, 1981, and, crying, related to her what Gnerre had said. Kim Bergen, a former tenant in Silverstein\u2019s building, said that Silverstein came to her apartment sometime in the fall of 1983 and related to her the incident of September, 1983. Bergen said that Silverstein cried as she related this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The hearing commissioner found that Silverstein had suffered severe and prolonged emotional distress as a result of Gnerre\u2019s sexual harassment. Silverstein stated that she felt \u201cterribly embarrassed,\u201d \u201cdegraded,\u201d \u201ccheap,\u201d and \u201clow\u201d after Gnerre\u2019s comments to her. Silverstein experienced physical symptoms of distress after each incident of sexual harassment, and she cried after the incidents of harassment and when she recounted the events to other people. Silverstein was particularly upset that Gnerre\u2019s comment was heard by her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The hearing commissioner also found that, as a result of the repeated incidents of harassment, Silverstein became \u201cterrified\u201d of Gnerre because she did not know what he was capable of doing to her. Silverstein changed her behavior patterns in order to avoid meeting Gnerre and to prevent his making further comments to her. She constantly feared situations in which she might encounter Gnerre. Silverstein stated that her meetings with Gnerre caused her extreme anxiety because she worried about what Gnerre might say to her. The commissioner also found that, as a result of Gnerre\u2019s sexual harassment, Silver-stein\u2019s emotional distress extended to situations not involving Gnerre. Silverstein said that she thought about Gnerre\u2019s com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>merits when she was with other men, and she feared that other people thought about her the way Gnerre did. The commissioner found that Silverstein\u2019s emotional distress, suffered as a result of Gnerre\u2019s sexual harassment, continued to the time of the hearing and was evidenced by Silverstein\u2019s obvious distress while presenting her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The commissioner ruled that a landlord\u2019s sexual harassment of a tenant constitutes sex discrimination in the terms, conditions, or privileges of housing in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (6), even if no specific adverse housing action is threatened by the landlord. The commissioner ruled that Silverstein had proven actionable sex discrimination under G.L.c. 151B,\u00a74 (6), by demonstrating that (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she was subject to unsolicited harassment of a sexual nature; and (3) the harassment was of such a nature as to make the tenancy significantly less desirable than if the harassment had not occurred. The commissioner concluded that, under either a subjective or an objective standard, Gnerre\u2019s repeated harassment reduced the value of Silverstein\u2019s tenancy and, thus, adversely affected the terms, conditions, and privileges of her housing in violation of G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">On the basis of her findings of fact and conclusions of law, the commissioner ordered Gnerre to cease and desist from engaging in any form of sexual harassment or from otherwise discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of G.L.c. 151B, \u00a7 4. The commissioner further ordered Gnerre to pay Silverstein the sum of one thousand dollars plus interest at a rate of twelve per cent per annum from the date the complaint was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The full commission affirmed the decision of the hearing commissioner. Gnerre sought judicial review of the commission\u2019s decision in the Superior Court. The court affirmed the commission. Gnerre appealed. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">1. <em>Applicability ofG. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (6). </em>Gnerre contends that the court below erroneously affirmed the decision of the commission on the ground that \u201c[t]he law requires that sexual harassment, to be actionable, attain to a certain level of pervasiveness and persistence. As a matter of law, [Gnerre\u2019s] isolated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>remarks, no matter how obnoxious, over two years do not begin to attain that level.\u201d We thus must determine whether sexual harassment constitutes a violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (6), and the appropriate legal standard for determining whether such a violation has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We have not previously determined whether a landlord\u2019s sexual harassment of a tenant constitutes discrimination in housing in violation of G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (6), and on what basis a landlord may be held liable. General Laws c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (6), provides in part: \u201cIt shall be an unlawful practice: . . . 6. For the owner, lessee, sublessee, licensed real estate broker, assignee or managing agent of publicly assisted or multiple dwelling or contiguously located housing accommodations or other person having the right.of ownership or possession or right to rent or lease, or sell or negotiate for the sale of such accommodations, or any agent or employee of such a person or any organization of unit owners in a condominium or housing cooperative: -... (b) to discriminate against any person because of his race, religious creed, color, national origin, sex, age, ancestry or marital status ... in the terms, conditions or privileges of such accommodations . . . .\u201d We note also that G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, provides in part: \u201cThe provisions of this chapter shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">In <em>College-Town, Division of Interco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>400 Mass. 156 (1987), we construed analogous language in G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1), as prohibiting sexual harassment that creates a hostile environment in the workplace. We concluded that G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1), prohibited discrimination not only in the hiring, firing and compensation of employees, but also in the \u201cterms, conditions or privileges of employment\u201d and that \u201cwithin the broad sweep of that language falls conduct which creates a sexually harassing work environment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162. Similarly, we conclude that sexual harassment need not affect a tangible condition of tenancy such as eviction, refusal to rent, or rental cost to be a violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (6). General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (6), prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>\u201cterms, conditions or privileges\u201d of housing and we believe that sexual harassment that creates a hostile environment violates this prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">A plaintiff states a prima facie case of sexual harassment in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (6), by demonstrating (1) that the landlord subjected him or her<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to unsolicited harassment of a sexual nature, and (2) that the harassment was of such a nature that it would make the tenancy significantly less desirable to a reasonable person in the plaintiff\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">In determining whether the landlord\u2019s conduct was of such a nature that it made the plaintiff\u2019s tenancy significantly less desirable, we view the evidence of harassment from the view of a reasonable person in the plaintiff\u2019s position.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See Note, Sexual Harassment Claims of Abusive Work Environment Under Title VII, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 1449, 1459 (1984). We examine whether, from the point of view of a reasonable person in the tenant\u2019s position, the landlord\u2019s conduct caused a significant decline in the desirability of the tenancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The question is whether the landlord\u2019s actions have rendered a tenancy less desirable. That issue should may be decided on a case-by-case basis, and we specifically reject Gnerre\u2019s suggestion that we impose, as a matter of law, a quantitative requirement on the incidents of harassment that will constitute actionable sex discrimination. In <em>College-Town, </em>this court did not impose such a requirement in the context of sexual harassment in the workplace. We stated that harassment is actionable if it \u201c[i]s sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>victim\u2019s] employment. . . .\u201d <em>College-Town, supra </em>at 162. Similarly, we decline to impose a quantitative requirement on the incidents of harassment in the context of housing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">We reject imposing any numerosity requirement for two reasons. First, a legal standard that requires a plaintiff to prove a minimum number of incidents of harassment does not recognize the variety of conduct that may constitute sexual harassment. Further, it does not recognize that different conduct, depending on its nature, can more or less quickly render a tenancy less desirable. Very threatening behavior or sexual harassment involving physical contact, for instance, might render a tenancy less desirable after even one incident, whereas offensive sexual speech, depending on its nature, might not make a tenancy less desirable to a reasonable person in the plaintiff\u2019s position if the comments are made infrequently. However, the more offensive the comments the fewer incidents of harassment may be required to demonstrate the objective reasonableness of the claim that the value of the tenancy was diminished for a plaintiff. A numerosity requirement would not allow the commission or a court to balance the severe or the threatening nature of the conduct against its frequency of occurrence in determining whether the plaintiff\u2019s tenancy was rendered less desirable. Second, a numerosity requirement would unfairly penalize the plaintiff who took affirmative steps to avoid further harassment by avoiding the defendant altogether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>and would benefit the plaintiff who did not. Therefore, we decline to impose an arbitrary numerosity requirement as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">2. <em>Substantial evidence. </em>Absent a determination that the commission committed an error of law, our review of the commission\u2019s decision is limited to an inquiry as to whether the commission\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). See also <em>Medi-Cab of Mass. Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>401 Mass. 357, 369 (1987); <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 130, 134 (1976). Substantial evidence is defined as \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6). See <em>Medi-Cab, supra </em>at 369. Under the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court is not empowered to determine the facts anew, or to judge credibility, or to draw different inferences from the facts found by the commission. <em>Id. </em>at 369. Our review of the evidence convinces us that the commission\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law were supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">There was ample evidence that Gnerre subjected Silverstein to unsolicited harassment of a sexual nature. She recounted four separate incidents of offensive speech of a sexual nature. Silverstein also testified that there were other incidents of harassment that she did not recall specifically. Silverstein\u2019s recollection of the four specific incidents of harassment was corroborated by the testimony of Ruth Silverstein and Kim Bergen. Although Gnerre denied that these incidents occurred, the commissioner specifically credited Silverstein\u2019s testimony over Gnerre\u2019s. The commissioner noted the specificity and consistency of Silverstein\u2019s testimony as well as her demeanor while testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Gnerre contends that the incidents of harassment involved in this controversy were insufficient to permit a finding that the desirability of Silverstein\u2019s tenancy was significantly reduced. Thus, he did not discriminate against Silverstein in a term, condition or privilege of her tenancy. We do not agree. The evidence supported the commission\u2019s conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Gnerre\u2019s sexual harassment was very offensive and would cause a reasonable tenant to believe that the tenancy was less desirable.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">The commission\u2019s conclusion that the offensiveness of Gnerre\u2019s conduct made Silverstein\u2019s tenancy objectively less desirable is supported by substantial evidence that Gnerre\u2019s harassment interfered with Silverstein\u2019s ability fully to use and to enjoy the leased premises. First, Silverstein became reluctant to have Gnerre enter her apartment to make repairs because having the apartment repaired required Gnerre\u2019s presence in her apartment. Second, Silverstein did not use fully the facilities of her apartment, namely the back porch to hang laundry, because she knew Gnerre often was around the two buildings he owned and because she feared encounters with Gnerre. Third, because of Gnerre\u2019s harassment, Silverstein said that whenever she saw Gnerre\u2019s truck parked outside the building, she attempted to avoid Gnerre by remaining in her apartment or by continuing to drive around the neighborhood until Gnerre left. Finally, Silverstein stated she was afraid to invite guests into her apartment because she feared that Gnerre would make a sexually offensive comment to her in the presence of her guests.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Substantial evidence supports the commission\u2019s determination that Silverstein\u2019s efforts to avoid encounters with Gnerre were objectively reasonable. Silverstein\u2019s affirmative efforts to avoid further incidents of harassment reduced Silverstein\u2019s ability fully to use and to enjoy her apartment. Thus, Gnerre\u2019s conduct reduced the desirability of Silverstein\u2019s tenancy and discriminated against her in a term, condition, or privilege of her tenancy. Gnerre\u2019s comments clearly were very offensive. Thus, there is no error in the commission\u2019s conclusion that Gnerre\u2019s comments could inhibit a reasonable tenant\u2019s enjoyment of the premises. The commission\u2019s decision that Gnerre violated G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (6), is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\"> In her findings of fact and conclusions of law, the hearing commissioner determined that, in order to state a prima facie case of sexual harassment in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (6), a plaintiff must be a member of a protected class. The commission affirmed that ruling. We do not agree. The statute does not require that a plaintiff be a member of a protected class. The statute only requires that the unsolicited harassment be of a sexual nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b521-9\"> We need not decide whether an unreasonably sensitive plaintiff may recover under under G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (6), if he or she notifies the defendant that certain conduct is offensive, and the defendant persists in the offensive conduct even after notice by the plaintiff. Note, Sexual Harassment Claims of Abusive Work Environment Under Title VII, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 1449, 1459 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b522-5\"> We reject Gnerre\u2019s suggestion that only sexual harassment involving specific demands for sexual favors is actionable harassment under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (6), although we note that at least one of Gnerre\u2019s comments could be construed as a request for a sexual favor. In determining whether Gnerre\u2019s conduct constituted sexual harassment, the commission applied the definition of sexual harassment promulgated by the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission which defines sexual harassment as \u201csexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and <em>other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature\u201d </em>(emphasis added). 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1604.11(a) (1980). We note that the Massachusetts Legislature recently has adopted the same definition in the context of sexual harassment in the workplace. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1, as amended by St. 1987, c. 473, \u00a7 2. We believe that it is appropriate to apply the Legislature\u2019s definition of sexual harassment to the context of housing and thus conclude that sexual harassment is not limited to demands for sexual favors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
