(BBI), the operator of WCVB-TV Channel 5 in Boston, concerning alleged abuses in the insurance industry. The plaintiffs claim to have been defamed by that broadcast, which was the third segment of a three-part series. The plaintiffs and BBI each filed a motion for summary judgment. A judge denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion, and allowed BBI\u2019s. We affirm the denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion, but we reverse the allowance of BBI\u2019s motion and remand for trial on the question whether BBI falsely and negligently defamed the plaintiffs by broadcasting that they had secretly overcharged customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">The parties agree that the oral statements made in the course of the broadcast were the same or substantially the same as those set forth in Appendix A to this opinion. The broadcast stated, in material part, the following: \u201cThe News Center Five Investigative Unit disclos[ed] this week that phony insura[nce] companies have been operating in Massachusetts[.] The companies \u2014 chartered in foreign countries \u2014 have be[en] selling worthless policies. Insurance fraud, however, [is] not limited to foreign companies. Tonight \u2014 in the final repo[rt] of a series \u2014 John Camp outlines other types of schemes. . . . Rockland [Mutual Insurance Company] is a[n or]iginator of a scheme called roll-ons. Roll-ons are secret charges tacked onto insurance premiums.\u201d After discussing asserted \u201croll-ons\u201d and \u201covercharges\u201d by other companies, the broadcast continued: \u201cMost of the overcharges are for automobile club memberships that customers didn\u2019t ask for \u2014 and in many instances \u2014 didn\u2019t know about[.] There are other types of roll-ons. Allston Finance Company specializes in financing auto insurance premiums. Onto most of its contracts \u2014 Allston adds a dollar or so for credit life insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>anee \u2014 a policy guaranteeing that if you die \u2014 your auto insurance will be paid. State banking department records provide some startling statistics about Allston Finance. Since 1974 \u2014 the company has sold nearly 64-thousand credit life policies. Yet \u2014 according to the records \u2014 Allston has never paid a single claim. Nathan Friedman \u2014 who with hi[s] brother \u2014 owns Allston Finance \u2014 disputes the banking department records which he signed under penalties of perjury. Friedman said some claims had been paid. He promised last week to provide names \u2014 but to date \u2014 has not done so[.]</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u201cThere is another curious aspect to the Allston credit life policies. The company states in its 19[76] annual report that the policies] are placed with Resolute Insurance Company. Resolute went out of business in 19[74] when it was bought by another company \u2014 and a spokesman for that company says he has never heard of Allston Finance Company. Nathan Friedman maintains that he paid premiums to an agent representing Resolute. He told Michal Regunberg of our staff that he doesn\u2019t know if the agent forwarded the money to [Rjesolute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The broadcast continued with a statement attributed to the head of the Massachusetts Division of Insurance that \u201cunscrupulous operators are almost fearless because they haven\u2019t been prosecuted in the past.\u201d It closed with the statement that \u201c[f]or the las[t] three nights \u2014 News Center Five has focuse[d] on some of the more blatant and dramatic schemes being employed to rip[ ]-off Massachusetts policyholders[.] Millions are pocketed each year by insurance crooks \u2014 even though they only make up a small percentage of the state\u2019s insurance people. . . . There is an encouraging word. That is that both State and Federal agencies are assigning a higher priority to finding solutions \u2014 and launching campaigns to shutdown the illegal operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Before commencing the present action, the plaintiffs had brought another action for defamation against BBI. That action also arose out of BBI\u2019s investigation of alleged insurance fraud. The evidence focused on an alleged statement made by a BBI employee on August 11, 1978, on the premises of Allston <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Finance Company in the presence of Allston\u2019s employees. The challenged statement was that the BBI employee had information that the plaintiff, Friedman, \u201cwas writing insurance with an insurance company that was not in existence, and that [he] had collected the premiums and never paid them to any insurance company.\u201d The plaintiffs received a favorable verdict from the jury in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Armed with that verdict, the plaintiffs moved in the present case for summary judgment grounded on collateral estoppel principles. The judge rightly denied the motion. Although the statements made at the plaintiffs\u2019 place of business on August 11 and those made in the course of the television broadcast on August 23 related to the same subject, the statements were different on their face. The first statement was virtually a direct accusation that Friedman had written insurance with a nonexistent insurer and had pocketed the premiums. The broadcast statements, however, while suggesting the nonexistence of an insurer and the plaintiffs\u2019 retention of the premiums as warrant-able inferences from public records and other evidence, were far more guarded. Therefore, the issue decided by the jury in the earlier case was not the same as the issue presented by this case, and collateral estoppel, which requires identity of issues, does not apply. <em>See Massachusetts Property Ins. Underwriting Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Norrington, </em>395 Mass. 751, 753 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We turn now to the judge\u2019s order of summary judgment for BBI. Statements of opinion are constitutionally protected and thus are not actionable. <em>King </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>400 Mass. 705, 708 (1987), cert. denied, U.S. , (1988) (108 S. Ct. 1121, 1227 [1988]). \u201c[T]he determination whether a statement is a factual assertion or an opinion is a question. of law if the statement unambiguously constitutes either fact or opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 709, quoting <em>Aldoupolis v. Globe Newspaper Co., </em>398 Mass. 731, 733 (1986). Therefore, a defendant in a defamation action is entitled to summary judgment with respect to challenged statements that reasonably cannot be construed as statements of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Even if the broadcast reasonably could have been understood as charging the plaintiffs with being \u201cinsurance crooks,\u201d engaged in \u201cinsurance fraud\u201d and \u201cblatant and dramatic schemes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>... to rip[ ]-off Massachusetts policyholders,\u201d such conclusory statements, in the context of this case, must be viewed as statements of opinion and not of fact. While it is true that a \u201cstatement cast in the form of an opinion may imply the existence of undisclosed defamatory facts on which the opinion purports to be based, and thus may be actionable,\u201d <em>King, supra </em>at 713, there was no suggestion in this case that the quoted conclusions were arrived at on the basis of undisclosed facts. On the contrary, the broadcast set forth the facts on which the conclusions purported to be based. We must look, then, at those statements of fact to determine whether any of them are actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">For convenience of discussion, the broadcast statements of fact, set forth above, may be separated into two groups. The first group is comprised of statements bearing on \u201croll-ons.\u201d Roll-ons are described as a type of fraudulent scheme in which secret charges are tacked onto insurance premiums. Allston Finance Company was said to have specialized in financing automobile insurance premiums, and to have engaged in the practice of adding \u201ca dollar or so\u201d for credit life insurance. It is clear from the context that that practice was presented as an illustration or example of a roll-on.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The other group of statements is made up of several related assertions: (1) Public records revealed the \u201cstartling statistics\u201d that Allston Finance Company had sold nearly 64,000 credit life insurance policies without ever having paid a claim; (2) Friedman, who was an owner of the company, had promised to identify claims that had been paid but had not done so; (3) \u201canother curious aspect\u201d to the credit life insurance policies was that, in its annual report for 1976, Allston said that the policies were placed with Resolute Insurance Company, but Resolute had gone out of business in 1974, having been bought by another company, and a spokesman for the successor insurer stated that he had never heard of Allston; and (4) Friedman maintained that he had paid the insurance premiums to Resolute\u2019s agent, but he did not know whether the agent had forwarded the premiums to Resolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>The second group of statements, viewed alone or in the context of the entire broadcast, cannot be the basis of liability. These were statements about a matter of public concern, and therefore, even though they are statements of fact rather than of opinion, in order for them to be the basis of a recovery from this media defendant, the plaintiffs must prove not only that the statements were defamatory but also that they were false. <em>Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hepps, </em>475 U.S. 767, <em>777 </em>(1986). The motion judge properly concluded, on the basis of the materials submitted to him, that the statements in the second group were not false. Indeed, the plaintiffs do not contend that any of the individual statements were false, but rather that, altogether, the statements constituted a false accusation that the plaintiffs had kept for themselves premiums paid for nonexistent insurance. However, the statements are not reasonably susceptible of such an interpretation, particularly in light of BBI\u2019s repetition of Friedman\u2019s explanation. Surely, the statements suggest that further investigation might be appropriate, but such a suggestion is no more than an expression of opinion and is not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The first group of factual statements, those addressed to \u201croll-ons,\u201d presents a different picture. Those statements are susceptible of the connotation that the plaintiffs secretly, and therefore, fraudulently, added to automobile policyholders\u2019 premiums, premiums for credit life insurance. A jury would be warranted in finding that such a disclosure would discredit the plaintiffs in the minds of a considerable and respectable class of the community to the financial detriment of the plaintiffs. Thus, BBI was not entitled to summary judgment on the ground that the statements were nondefamatory beyond substantial question. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., supra </em>at 717-718; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 849, 853 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Furthermore, although the plaintiffs have the burden of proving that the statements were false, <em>Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hepps, supra, </em>and that their publication was negligent, <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Taibbi, </em>400 Mass. 786, 799 (1987), <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., supra </em>at 858, the materials provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>to the judge in conjunction with the summary judgment motions do not establish in BBI\u2019s favor that there is no substantial question as to those matters. Rather, the judge had before him Allston Finance Company\u2019s answer to BBI\u2019s interrogatories, which recited, among other things, the following: \u201cHad the Defendant, its agents or representatives examined Allston Finance premium finance notes and investigated the matter thoroughly, they would have seen that Allston Finance\u2019s premium finance notes state in a separate area, \u2018the purchase of Credit Life Insurance coverage is voluntary and not required for credit. \u2019 Directly underneath this statement are two places for the customer\u2019s signature, one is designated \u2018I desire Credit Life Insurance Coverage,\u2019 the other states, \u2018I do <em>not </em>desire Credit Life Insurance Coverage. \u2019 \u201d The answer to the interrogatories also stated: \u201cAny person desiring to purchase credit life insurance had to sign his/her name in the appropriate place [on the premium finance note].\u201d Thus, we agree with the plaintiffs that they may be able to show that the roll-on statements were not only defamatory, but that they were false and negligently made as well, and were therefore actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">We affirm the judge\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. We reverse the summary judgment for the defendant, and remand to the Superior Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Appendix A.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u201cTHE NEWS CENTER FIVE INVESTIGATIVE UNIT DISCLOS[ED] THIS WEEK THAT PHONY INSURANCE] COMPANIES HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN MASSACHUSETTS!;.] THE COMPANIES \u2014 CHARTERED [IN] FOREIGN COUNTRIES \u2014 HAVE BE[EN] SELLING WORTHLESS POLICIES[.] INSURANCE FRAUD, HOWEVER, [IS] NOT LIMITED TO FOREIGN COMPANIES.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\u201cTONIGHT \u2014 IN THE FINAL REPO[RT] OF A SERIES \u2014 JOHN CAMP OUTLINES OTHER TYPES OF SCHEMES. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">\u201cThis is an unlikely looking school \u2014 but in the early 1970\u2019s \u2014\u2022 a lot of insurance agents got an education here.
