L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C [1986 ed.]) (\u00a7 11C). This provision replaced former G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10, and limits the reviewing board\u2019s ability to overturn a decision of a member of the Industrial Accident Board to instances where the decision \u201cis beyond the scope of his authority, arbitrary or capricious, contrary to law, or unwarranted by the facts.\u201d Section 11C also provides that \u201c[t]he reviewing board may weigh evidence, but may not review determinations by the member who conducted the hearing regarding the credibility of witnesses who have given testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 11C <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>became effective on November 1, 1986. See St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The employee sought recovery for an injury occurring on August 26, 1982. Proceedings were held before two separate single members of the Industrial Accident Board in accordance with former c. 152, \u00a7 7 (conference), and former c. 152, \u00a7 8 (hearing).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both members ruled in favor of the employee. The employer, as self-insurer, filed an appeal with the reviewing board pursuant to former c. 152, \u00a7 10, on January 23, 1985. The reviewing board heard the appeal after the effective date of \u00a7 11C, and issued its decision on April 15, 1987. The reviewing board refused the employer\u2019s request that it \u201cdiscount the employee\u2019s explanation of her injury.\u201d The reviewing board concluded that \u00a7 11C, which'forbids board reassessment of witness credibility, was a procedural amendment to c. 152 within the meaning of c. 152, \u00a7 2A (1986 ed.), and therefore \u00a7 11C should be applied retroactively. The reviewing board applied the \u00a7 11C standard of review, i.e., the decision must be upheld unless \u201cbeyond the scope of his authority, arbitrary or capricious, contrary to law, or unwarranted by the facts,\u201d rather than the broader standard of review contained in former \u00a7 10, note 1, <em>supra, </em>and upheld the employee\u2019s award. The employer sought review in the Appeals Court, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The reviewing board did not err in applying \u00a7 11C. Chapter 152, \u00a7 2A, provides as follows: \u201cEvery act, in amendment of this chapter, in effect on the effective date of this section or thereafter becoming effective which increases the amount or amounts of compensation payable to an injured employee or his dependents shall, for the purposes of this chapter, be deemed to be substantive in character and shall apply only to personal injuries occurring on and after the effective date of such act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>unless otherwise expressly provided. Every act, in amendment of this chapter, in effect on the effective date of this section or thereafter becoming effective which is not deemed to be substantive in character within the meaning of this section shall be deemed to be procedural or remedial only, in character, and shall have application to personal injuries irrespective of the date of their occurrence, unless otherwise expressly provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">The employer argues that, without regard to whether \u00a7 11C increases compensation payable to claimants, \u00a7 11C takes away its \u201csubstantive right. . . of having the credibility determination of the single member reviewed by the three person reviewing board,\u201d and therefore, it should be applied prospectively only. The employer\u2019s approach would be proper with some \u201camendments\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2A. See <em>Price </em>v. <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>322 Mass. 476, 482-485 (1948). However, \u00a7 11C is not such an amendment. Despite the employer\u2019s characterization, \u00a7 11C concerns the purely procedural questions of what standard of review will be applied by the reviewing board, and what latitude the reviewing board possesses in reviewing the record generated in the initial proceedings. Section 11C has no impact on the merits questions involved in determining the amount of compensation or the parties\u2019 substantive rights to receive or not to pay compensation. See <em>Goodwin Bros. Leasing </em>v. <em>Nousis, </em>373 Mass. 169, 172-173 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Section 11C is, under \u00a7 2A, procedural and to be applied retroactively. We add that, even if the special definition contained in \u00a7 2A did not exist, \u00a7 11C, as a procedural statute, might well be applied retroactively in accordance with general rules of construction. <em>Id. </em>Such retroactive application would be proper where, as here, the reviewing board held its hearing and issued its decision after the effective date of \u00a7 11C, even though the injury and the proceedings before the single member occurred prior to that date. See <em>id.; Goes </em>v. <em>Feldman, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 84, 88 (1979), citing <em>City Council of Waltham </em>v. <em>Vinciullo, </em>364 Mass. 624, 628 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>The employer\u2019s additional argument that the Legislature \u201cotherwise expressly provided,\u201d see c. 152, \u00a7 2A, that \u00a7 11C should be applied prospectively is without merit. Nothing in \u00a7 11C expressly provides that that section is to be considered substantive for purposes of \u00a7 2A. The Legislature explicitly has made such designations regarding other sections of c. 152. See, e.g., St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 65. Given this legislative action, we will not, as urged by the employer, read an \u201cexpress\u201d provision by implication in \u00a7 11C. See <em>School Comm. of Brockton </em>v. <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd., </em>393 Mass. 256, 263 (1984), <em>quoting Beeler v. Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 616 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"ATR\">The decision of the reviewing board is affirmed. Costs to the employee are to be determined by a single justice of this court under G.
