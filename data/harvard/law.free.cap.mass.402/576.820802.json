One charged him with being a disorderly person, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53 (1986 ed.), and each of the other three charged him with assault and battery on a police officer in the performance of his duty, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13D (1986 ed.). The defendant was convicted on all complaints following a bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The defendant exercised his right to trial de nova in a District Court jury of six session. On the second day of trial the judge, upon the defendant\u2019s motion, dismissed the complaints without prejudice. His reasons for dismissing the complaints were the prosecutor\u2019s tardiness and lack of readiness to proceed on the first day of trial, the prosecutor\u2019s repeated tardiness on the second day of trial, and the unfairness to the jurors, the witnesses, and the defendant inherent in the prosecutor\u2019s undue delays.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the close of the first day of trial, the judge had specifically instructed the prosecutor to arrive punctually at 9 a.m. on the second day of trial. This instruction was not observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The Commonwealth filed a notice of appeal of the dismissals in the District Court, and then filed a motion to vacate the dismissals. The motion to vacate was denied, and the Commonwealth filed its appeal of the dismissals in the Appeals Court. The Appeals Court ordered that the complaints be reinstated and that the case be remanded to the District Court for a trial before a new jury. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 959, 959-960 (1987). We allowed the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review. We conclude that the District Court judge did not abuse his discretion in dismissing the complaints without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The defendant initially contends that the Commonwealth has no right of appeal from the District Court judge\u2019s dismissal of the complaints, or, in the alternative, that the Commonwealth failed to perfect whatever appellate rights it had. We disagree. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E (1986 ed.),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Commonwealth has a right to appeal from the District Court judge\u2019s dismissal of the complaints. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brusgulis, </em>398 Mass. 325, 326 n.1 (1986), and cases cited.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The first clause of the first paragraph of \u00a7 28E explicitly allows the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal. There is no merit to the defendant\u2019s argument that the Commonwealth is somehow denied that right, even if he is correct in his assertion that the District Court judge relied on inherent supervisory power and not on a particular rule of criminal procedure in dismissing the complaints.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The Commonwealth properly perfected its appeal by filing a notice of appeal in the District Court within thirty days of the dismissals. See Mass. R. A. P. 3 (a), as amended, 378 Mass. 924 (1979); Mass. R. A. P. 4 (b), as appearing in 378 Mass. 924 (1979). The Commonwealth\u2019s failure to take further steps to perfect its appeal until after the District Court judge ruled on the motion to vacate the dismissals does not prevent the appeal. See Mass. R. A. P. 3 (a). In fact, had the Commonwealth filed its appeal with the Appeals Court prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>District Court judge\u2019s ruling on the motion to vacate, the District Court judge would have been without jurisdiction to make that ruling. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cronk, </em>396 Mass. 194, 196-197 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">We now turn to the merits. The Commonwealth argues that the judge should not have dismissed the complaints absent a showing of egregious misconduct by the prosecutor or a showing that the defendant is now unable to receive a fair trial. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cronk, supra </em>at 196-198; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cinelli, </em>389 Mass. 197, 210, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 860 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Light, </em>394 Mass. 112, 114 (1985). However, the cases relied on by the Commonwealth involve dismissals with prejudice. Where, as here, the dismissals are without prejudice, the judge\u2019s action should be upheld in the absence of an abuse of discretion. See <em>Commonwealth v. Salman, </em>387 Mass. 160, 168 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pomerleau, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 530, 536 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The District Court judge acted within his discretion in dismissing the complaints without prejudice. The judge was warranted in finding, as he did, that the prosecutor\u2019s unpreparedness and tardiness resulted in unnecessary inconvenience to the jurors and to the defendant. Continued unnecessary delay may well have increased the restlessness, apparent from the record, among the jurors and the defense witnesses, to the detriment of the defendant. In the circumstances, the judge, in exercise of his discretion, would have been warranted in declaring a mistrial on motion of the defendant, and requiring the Commonwealth to retry the case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmonds, </em>386 Mass. 234, 241 (1982), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoffer, </em>375 Mass. 369, 372-373 (1978). The Commonwealth has demonstrated no undue prejudice from the judge\u2019s decision to require instead that it seek fresh complaints and begin the process of prosecuting the defendant anew.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Absent such demonstration of prejudice we discern no abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The defendant also seeks recovery of attorney\u2019s fees for this appeal pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (d), 378 Mass. 882 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>(1979). However, it strains logic to conclude that the authorization of attorney\u2019s fees contained in rule 15 (d) extends to appeals <em>not </em>taken pursuant to rule 15. This appeal could not have been taken under rule 15. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>The appeal is before us pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E, which does not authorize the award of attorney\u2019s fees. In the absence of such authorization, the parties must bear their own cost of litigation. See, e.g., <em>Fuss </em>v. <em>Fuss (No. 1), </em>372 Mass. 64, 70 (1977); <em>Bournewood Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 303, 311-312 (1976). The defendant has no basis for recovery of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The District Court judge\u2019s dismissal of the complaints without prejudice is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\"> The judge stated his reasons for dismissing the complaints during a hearing on the Commonwealth\u2019s subsequent motion to vacate the dismissals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-5\">General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 28E, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAn appeal may be taken by and on behalf of the commonwealth by the attorney general or a district attorney from the district court to the appeals court in all criminal cases from a decision, order or judgment of the court (1) allowing a motion to dismiss an indictment or complaint, or (2) allowing a motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">\u201cAn appeal may be taken by and on behalf of the commonwealth by the attorney general or a district attorney from the superior court to the supreme judicial court in all criminal cases from a decision, order or judgment of the court (1) allowing a motion to dismiss an indictment or complaint, or (2) allowing a motion for appropriate relief under the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\"> The Commonwealth did not state in its notice of appeal the vehicle for its appeal. During the hearing on the motion to vacate the dismissals, the Commonwealth indicated that the appeal would be pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (b), as amended, 397 Mass. 1225 (1986). However, as the defendant notes, rule 15 is inapplicable because the Commonwealth is not taking an interlocutory appeal of a pretrial motion. The Commonwealth\u2019s failure to identify G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E, as the vehicle of its appeal, while not laudable, does not prohibit the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\"> In developing this argument the defendant relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>383 Mass. 529 (1981), which construed the second paragraph of c. 278, \u00a7 28E. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>That language is inapplicable here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\"> Whether the principle of double jeopardy would bar subsequent prosecution is not properly before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
