L. c. 30, \u00a7\u00a7 61-62H, in determining that no environmental impact report (EIR) was required for a mixed use commercial development project proposed by the defendant, Gloucester Landing Associates, to be located on property owned by the defendant, Gloucester Redevelopment Authority. The complaint was dismissed in the Superior Court, and the plaintiffs appealed to the Appeals Court. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion, and we now affirm the Superior Court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">General Laws c. 30, \u00a7 62H (1986 ed.), provides in part: \u201cAn agency or person intending to commence an action or proceeding alleging an improper determination of whether a project requires the preparation of an environmental impact report under section sixty-two A, shall first provide notice of intention to commence such action or proceeding within sixty days of issuance of notice of such determination.\u201d It is undisputed that the plaintiffs provided notice of their intention to commence this action more than sixty days after the secretary issued the developer a certificate stating that no EIR was required. However, it also is undisputed that the plaintiffs provided that notice less than sixty days after the Secretary had published notice of his determination in the Environmental Monitor, a bimonthly publication of the Secretary\u2019s office. The only question argued in the Superior Court, and initially argued here, was whether the sixty-day notice period commenced with the issuance of the certificate, in which case the notice would have been too late, or commenced later when the notice was published in the Environmental Monitor. In the latter case, the notice would have been timely. The motion judge agreed with the developer\u2019s contention that the limitations period commenced with the Secretary\u2019s issuance of a certificate of his determination. Therefore, he allowed the developer\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">On appeal, this court was unwilling to assume, as the parties had, that, if the notice requirements of c. 30, \u00a7 62H, are met, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>members of the public have a right to judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s determination that no EIR is necessary. Accordingly, we ordered further briefs to assist us in resolving that critical question. The question is jurisdictional. Does the Superior Court have subject matter jurisdiction of an action brought by ten or more citizens challenging a determination by the Secretary that no EIR is_necessary? Boston v. <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., </em>364 Mass. 639, 644-645 (1974). Of course, in the absence of such jurisdictioru-further inquiry in this case with respect to the notice provisions-of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62H, would be inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">We phrased the issues for supplemental.briefing-as. follows: \u201c1. Does the Superior Court have subject matter jurisdiction of an action by ten citizens challenging the Secretary\u2019s determination that no Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is required? Is such a determination renewable by the Superior Court? 2. Does the sixty day period for filing a notice of intention to commence suit (NOI) apply to challenges to the Secretary\u2019s determination that an ETR_is <em>not </em>required?\u201d Our questions invited the parties to discuss whether the Superior Court had jurisdiction either on the basis of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A (1986 ed.), which provides for actions by ten persons domiciled within the Commonwealth in certain circumstances, or on any other basis. In their supplemental brief, the plaintiffs \u2019 argument in support of jurisdiction focuses entirely on G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A, G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62H, regulations promulgated by the Secretary, and the Commonwealth\u2019s environmental policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Neither G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62H, nor the Secretary\u2019s regulations confer jurisdiction on the Superior Court. Section 62H does not purport to grant jurisdiction. It simply provides, with respect to actions over which a court has jurisdiction from another source, that such actions must be commenced within a certain period following specified events. It is essentially a statute of limitations. Furthermore, although it is clear from regulations promulgated by the Secretary, as well as from the Secretary\u2019s position in this appeal, that he believes that his determinations that no EIR is required are subject to judicial review, the Secretary cannot confer jurisdiction on the courts by regulation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>and his opinion with respect to the existence of jurisdiction is neither controlling nor entitled to special weight. The Secretary\u2019s expertise with respect to environmental matters does not extend to the question whether, under Massachusetts law, his determinations are subject to judicial review. The question of jurisdiction in this case must be resolved by this court\u2019s construction of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A, as inserted by St. 1974, c. 1114, \u00a7 62. See <em>Babson v. Boston Rent Control Adm\u2019r, </em>371 Mass. 404, 405 <em>(1976); Emery Mining Corp. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Labor, </em>744 F.2d 1411, 1416 (10th Cir. 1984); <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Califano, </em>619 F.2d 865, 869 (10th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">General Laws c. 214, \u00a7 7A, provides in relevant part as follows: \u201cThe superior court for the county in .which damage to the environment is occurring or is about to. occur may, upon a civil action in which equitable or declaratory relief is sought in which not less than ten persons domiciled within the commonwealth are joined as plaintiffs . . . determine whether such damage is occurring or is about to occur and may, before the final determination of the action, restrain the person causing or about to cause such damage; provided, however, that the damage caused or about to be caused by such person constitutes a violation of a statute, ordinance, by-law or regulation the major purpose of which is to prevent or minimize damage to the environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., </em>364 Mass. 639 (1974), a case heavily relied on by the plaintiffs and the Secretary, this court construed G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 10A (repealed), the predecessor of c. 214, \u00a7 7A, and like it in all material respects. The only violations alleged were that the. Authority failed to comply with certain procedural .steps required by statute and regulation. Nevertheless, this court held that \u201ca petition under \u00a7 10A will lie to enforce the procedural as well as the prohibitory provisions of the Department\u2019s [of Public Health] regulations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 646-647. We reasoned that the purpose of MEPA was to protect the environment, and that, therefore, an allegation of a violation of MEPA or a regulation pursuant to MEPA qualified under \u00a7 10A as a claim that \u201cdamage to the environment is occurring or is about to occur.\u201d We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>continue to subscribe to that principle. Therefore, if the plaintiffs in this case were alleging, as did the plaintiff in <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., supra, </em>that a developer or agency proposing a project failed to comply with the procedural requirement of a statute or regulation designed to protect the environment, the Superior Court would have subject matter jurisdiction under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The plaintiffs here, however, do not allege that the developer or agency proposing a project has failed to comply with MEPA or a regulation promulgated pursuant to MEPA. Indeed, the plaintiffs do claim a violation of MEPA, but they identify that violation as the failure of the Secretary to require an EIR. The claim on appeal is that the Secretary, who is the public official charged with administering the Commonwealth\u2019s environmental protection scheme, see G. L. c. 21A, and who, under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62A, determines whether an EIR is required, may be guilty of a violation of MEPA by determining that no EIR is necessary. That is a quite different contention from a contention that a proponent of a project has failed to comply with applicable regulations or statutory directives.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The contention here is also unlike the contention made by the plaintiff in <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., 366 </em>Mass. 755 (1975). In that case, this court agreed with the plaintiff that the defendant\u2019s failure to file an EIR violated G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62. But, at that time, c. 3CL \u00a7 62, required an authority, such as the defendant-in that case, to file an EIR when its proposed project \u201cmay cause damage to the environment.\u201d See G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62, as amended by St. 1974, c. 257, \u00a7 1. No \u201cviolation\u201d by the Secretary was alleged. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., supra, </em>and <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., supra, </em>are inapposite to the present controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The Legislature substantially revised MEPA in 1977. See St. 1977, c. 947. In that act, after declaring its purpose to be \u201cto immediately expedite environmental approvals and rules and regulations thereof under the laws regulating environmental policy in the commonwealth,\u201d the Legislature inserted into G. L. c. 30 a new \u00a7 62A (the current \u00a7 62A), which provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>in part that the Secretary \u201cshall issue a certificate stating whether an environmental impact report is required.\u201d As a result of St. 1977, c. 947, a proponent of a project violates the law by failing to file an EIR only if the Secretary determines that one is required. As we have noted, no claim is made here that the proponent violated the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Neither the Secretary nor the plaintiffs point to any specific provision in MEPA or in any other statute as being susceptible of violation by the Secretary\u2019s incorrect, or even arbitrary, determination that an EIR is not required. There is no such provision, and it would be an unwarranted stretch of statutory language, far in excess of the broad construction adopted by the court in <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., supra, </em>for this court to conclude that the Secretary\u2019s determination that no EIR is required may qualify as \u201cdamage caused or about to be caused\u201d in \u201cviolation\u201d of an environmental statute. Furthermore, the provision in G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A, that the Superior Court may \u201cbefore the final determination of the action, restrain the person causing or about to cause such damage,\u201d suggests in the c. 30 context that the Legislature contemplated only the agency or authority or private person proposing a project, and not the public official who administers the statutory scheme, as \u201cthe person causing or about to cause\u201d environmental damage. See <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Hazardous Waste Facility Site Safety Council, </em>392 Mass. 107, 118 (1984) (\u201cIt is clear that the Legislature did not intend by G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A, to authorize injunctive relief against an agency of the Commonwealth that was created by the Legislature to monitor and implement the process for siting hazardous waste facilities\u201d); <em>Aertsen </em>v. <em>Landrieu, </em>488 F. Supp. 314, 323 (D. Mass.), aff\u2019d on other grounds, 637 F.2d 12 (1st Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The plaintiffs, supported by the Secretary, argue that \u201c[i]n addition to the plain language of the statute and legislative intent thereof, sound environmental policy dictates that a Secretary\u2019s improper determination not to require the preparation of an EIR be actionable. Any other result would thwart MEPA in attaining thorough environmental review prior to a project\u2019s implementation and minimizing environmental damage.\u201d Of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>course, the principal source for discovery of legislative intent is the language of the statute. Furthermore, contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention, sound environmental policy does not necessarily require the availability of judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s determination that no EIR is required. Sound environmental policy does not even permit, much less require, environmental protection to the exclusion of all other legitimate State concerns. A policy that places final determination as to the necessity of an EIR in the hands of a disinterested public official with expertise in environmental matters, shared by his or her staff but not ordinarily shared by judges, cannot be characterized as unsound. This is particularly trac in light of the potential unfairness and social and economic loss that may result from the delay inherent in litigation. Substantial delay due to litigation is inevitable regardless of the standard of judicial review that may be applied. The declared purpose of the Legislature in enacting St. 1977, c. 947, \u201cto immediately expedite environmental approvals . . . under the laws regulating environmental policy in the commonwealth\u201d affirms the undesirability of delay. It may have been jsound policy for the Legislature to authorize judicial review of determinations that no EIR would be required when those determinations were made by interested, and perhaps inexpert, parties, despite the ensuing delay, as was the situation before the enactment of St. 1977, c. 947. However, it cannot reasonably be said that the failure to make judicial review available when those determinations are made by the Secretary is unsound.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">It is true, as the plaintiffs argue, that in <em>Boston Preservation Alliance, Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, </em>396 Mass. 489 (1986), this court considered the merits on appeal of a challenge in the Superior Court to the limitation the Secretary had placed on the scope of a required EIR. The plaintiffs argue that it would make no sense for the Superior Court to have subject matter jurisdiction over a challenge to the Secretary\u2019s determination concerning the required scope of an EIR, but not to have jurisdiction over a challenge to his determination that no EIR whatsoever is necessary. There is logic in the plaintiffs\u2019 contention, but the contention incorrectly assumes that the jur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>isdictional argument was raised in the <em>Boston Preservation Alliance, Inc. </em>case. The court in that case did not hold that a ten-domiciliary action to challenge the adequacy of the scope of an EIR is within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court. There is no suggestion in the court\u2019s opinion that the court addressed that issue. We address it in this case for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In her dissenting opinion, <em>post </em>at 621-622, Justice Abrams identifies certain language in G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62H, which makes little sense if the Secretary\u2019s determination that no EIR is necessary is unreviewable in court. Even so, and if we grant the validity of that observation, it does not follow that judicial review is available. Such review is not available unless authorized by statute, and no statute authorizes it. Chapter 30, \u00a7 62H, clearly does not itself purport to create such jurisdiction. At most, it may reasonably be said that \u00a7 62H contains language which implies a legislative assumption that judicial review is available from another source. However, such an assumption is not the equivalent of a jurisdictional grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Moreover, it is far from clear that, in enacting \u00a7 62H, the Legislature did assume that the Secretary\u2019s decisions not to require an EIR are reviewable. Although \u00a7 62H contains some language suggesting such an assumption, other language suggests the opposite. For instance, the second paragraph, dealing with time limitations for the commencement of actions, provides: \u201cAny action or proceeding alleging an improper determination <em>that </em>a project requires the preparation of an environmental impact report\u201d (emphasis added) shall commence within specified periods. There is no additional language specifying time limits for actions alleging an improper determination that an FIR is <em>not </em>required. Furthermore, although c. 30, \u00a7 62C, expressly requires the Secretary to give public notice of filings and reports, there is no provision in c. 30 expressly requiring public notice of a determination that no EIR is required. One might reasonably expect that public notice of such a determination would be expressly required if the-public wereJhought by the Legislature to have a right to judicial.revi esLof-Sueh a decision if exercised in timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>On the basis of the foregoing reasoning, we conclude that the correct judgment was entered in the Superior Court. It is unnecessary for us to consider, therefore, whether the plaintiffs\u2019 action, focused on a proposed project in Gloucester, County of Essex, but commenced in Suffolk County, must fail because of the provision in G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 7A, that \u201c[t]he superior court for the county in which damage to the environment is occurring or is about to occur may [take specified action].\u201d We need not decide whether that requirement is one of jurisdiction or merely of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b633-6\">Abrams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzO\">(dissenting).

I therefore would reverse the judgment and remand to the Superior Court for a determination on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">1. <em>The statutory framework. </em>\u201cWhen the meaning of any particular section or clause of a statute is questioned, it is proper, no doubt, to look into the other parts of the statute; otherwise the different sections of the same statute might be so construed as to be repugnant, and the intention of the legislature might be defeated. And if, upon examination, the general meaning and object of the statute should be found inconsistent with the literal import of any particular clause or section, such clause or section must, if possible, be construed according to the spirit of the act.\u201d <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Holbrook, </em>1 Pick. 248, 250 (1823). Looking at the entire statutory framework, <em>see Negron </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>373 Mass. 199, 201-202 (1977), I conclude that the Secretary\u2019s determination is reviewable in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">a. <em>The MEPA Process. </em>MEPA requires public agencies and, in some circumstances, private parties,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to prepare EIRs analyz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>ing the environmental effects of certain projects they undertake. The threshold determination whether a project requires an EIR is made by the Secretary of Environmental Affairs, who bases the decision on an environmental notification form (ENF) describing the project, submitted by the agency or person proposing the project, and subsequent consultation with the project proponent. G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62A. By regulation, the Secretary also normally schedules a \u201cpublic consultation session to review the project,\u201d 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.25 (1) (1987), and \u201creceive[s] into the record written comments\u201d from any person or agency. 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.05 (2) (1987).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Secretary must issue public notice of an ENF within two weeks of receiving it, and must determine whether the project requires an EIR within thirty days after issuance of notice of receipt of the ENE. G. L. c. 30, \u00a7\u00a7 62A, 62C.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">MEPA does not state directly the standard for determining which projects require EIRs. However, G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62C, makes clear that an EIR is required for any project \u201cwhich may cause damage to the environment.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port </em>Auth., 366 Mass. 755, 768-770, 772 (1975) (interpreting identical provision in former \u00a7 62). See <em>Marlow </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>369 Mass. 501, 502 (1976). MEPA defines \u201cdamage to the environment\u201d to include \u201cany destruction, damage or impairment, actual or probable,\u201d but exclude \u201cinsignificant damage.\u201d G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>If an EIR is required, the agency or person proposing the project must prepare the EIR and submit it to the Secretary who, twice each month, must \u201cissue [public] notice ... of the availability of all reports received during the preceding half month.\u201d G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62C. After issuance of the public notice, a sixty-day waiting period follows during which no agency may begin work on or grant a permit or financial assistance for the project. Public review of and comment on the EIR is invited during the first half of the waiting period. <em>Id. </em>After the time for public comment, the Secretary issues a final statement whether the EIR \u201cadequately and properly complies with the provisions of [\u00a7\u00a7 62-62H].\u201d <em>Id. </em>After the sixty-day waiting period, the MEPA process is complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 62C, no agency may issue a permit or grant financial assistance for a private project until either (a) the MEPA process has been completed, or (b) the Secretary determines the project requires no EIR. If the Secretary makes a negative EIR determination, the statute mandates no subsequent administrative action. In such a case, the agency proposing the project may begin work or, in the case of a private project, the agency may issue the permits or financial assistance sought for the project. See 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.01(5) (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">b. <em>Judicial review of EIR determinations. </em>Section 62H governs actions challenging the Secretary\u2019s EIR determinations. The second paragraph of \u00a7 62H provides that such actions \u201cshall commence <em>no later than thirty days following the first issuance of a permit or grant of financial assistance by an agency </em>or no later than sixty days after issuance of notice of such determination, whichever occurs later, for a private project . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied). Permits can be issued only after (a) the Secretary determines that no EIR is required, or (b) the EIR already has been filed. See G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62C. Because a project proponent who already has submitted an EIR has no reason to challenge the Secretary\u2019s determination, the statute must contemplate actions challenging determinations where EIRs are not required; otherwise, the language in \u00a7 62H providing for challenges <em>after </em>issuance of permits and grants of financial assistance becomes meaningless surplusage. \u201c[N]o <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>provision of a legislative enactment should be treated as superfluous.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neiman, </em>396 Mass. 754, 758 (1986), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The fact that the second paragraph of \u00a7 62H refers to actions \u201calleging an improper determination <em>that </em>a project requires [an EIR]\u201d (emphasis added) does not require the result reached by the court. Reading the word \u201cthat\u201d so literally as to restrict application of the statute to actions challenging decisions <em>requiring </em>EIRs renders the entire clause governing commencement of actions <em>after </em>the issuance of permits superfluous. Such a reading also is inconsistent with the first paragraph of \u00a7 62H, which calls for notice of actions \u201calleging an improper determination <em>whether </em>a project requires [an EIR]\u201d (emphasis added). \u201cThe words of a statute will not be read literally if to do so would be inconsistent with legislative intent.\u201d <em>Oxford </em>v. <em>Oxford Water Co., </em>391 Mass. 581, 592 (1984). <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, </em>387 Mass. 326, 336 (1982). <em>Lexington </em>v. <em>Bedford, </em>378 Mass. 562 (1979). <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Holbrook, </em>1 Pick. 248 (1823). Furthermore, the explicit provision in \u00a7 62H, making the time periods in that section applicable \u201cin lieu of the notice and waiting period required by [\u00a7 7A],\u201d becomes meaningless if citizen groups cannot challenge negative EIR determinations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>The 1977 amendments to MEPA do not reveal a legislative purpose to cut off judicial review of EIR determinations. Prior to 1977, negative EIR determinations were subject to judicial review. See, e.g., <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., </em>364 Mass. 639 (1974). \u201cHad the Legislature intended ... to [eliminate the court\u2019s] review, it could have expressed the limitation in the statute. It did not do so.\u201d <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>382 Mass. 580, 586 (1981). The court\u2019s conclusion that the amendments were intended to preclude judicial review of negative EIR determinations finds no support in the language of the statute or in principles of statutory construction. It is based on a precarious combination of gaps and silences in the statutory framework, and imports a meaning alien to the actual provisions of the legislation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court\u2019s conclusion ignores the history of judicial review of EIR determinations and the strong legal presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative decisions. See <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park Inc. </em>v. <em>Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 410 (1971) (judicial review of agency decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>precluded only on showing of \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d of a legislative intent to restrict access to judicial review). The court should not infer from legislative silence an intention to effect radical alterations in existing law. See <em>International Org. of Masters </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., </em>392 Mass. 811, 817 (1984); <em>Dexter </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>316 Mass. 31, 53 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">I note, too, that no provision of the 1977 amendments expressly grants the Secretary unreviewable discretion to determine which projects require EIRs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On the contrary, as noted <em>supra, </em>there is an articulated legal standard by which to determine the need for an EIR, and \u201cit is evident that an EIR is required whenever there is a potential for damage to the environment which may be characterized as \u2018not . . . insignificant. \u2019 \u201d <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs v. Massachusetts Port Auth., supra </em>at 769. The operative provision of MEPA that sets forth this standard appeared in the original enactment of MEPA, and was preserved unaltered in the 1977 amendments. See G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62C. The preservation of this language raises a legal presumption that the Legislature intended it to carry the same meaning as before. <em>Andover Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>387 Mass. 229, 240-241 (1982), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">2. <em>Jurisdiction under G.

As to the first condition, an improper determination that a project requires no EIR under MEPA constitutes \u201cdamage to the environment. \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 645-647. See also <em>Boston Preservation Alliance, Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, </em>396 Mass. 489 (1986) (action under \u00a7 7A challenging Secretary\u2019s decision limiting scope of EIR). Cf. <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Watt, </em>716 F.2d 946, 951-953 (1st Cir. 1983). As to the second condition, the plaintiffs allege errors of law and abuse of discretion committed by the Secretary in determining that the proposed project is not one \u201cwhich may cause damage to the environment.\u201d G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62C. Thus, the prerequisites for jurisdiction in the Superior Court under \u00a7 7A have been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">Neither of the cases cited by the court, <em>ante </em>at 616, supports the conclusion that jurisdiction fails in this case under \u00a7 7A. In <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Hazardous Waste Facility Site Safety Council, </em>392 Mass. 107 (1984), the court held that a feasibility study prepared by the Hazardous Waste Facility Site Safety Council was not a \u201cfinal decision\u201d by that administrative agency and thus not subject to judicial review. <em>Id. </em>at 117-118. No immediate consequences or action need follow such a study. <em>Id. </em>Applying the analysis in <em>Warren, </em>it is clear that, unlike a preliminary feasibility study, the Secretary\u2019s determination whether a project requires an EIR is a \u201cfinal decision\u201d which has immediate consequences for project proponents, as well as the public \u2014 a proponent may be required to prepare a costly report or, conversely, the public may be deprived of a thorough environmental analysis of a major project. The finality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>of an order is determined \u201con the footing of its substance.\u201d <em>Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>394 Mass. 671, 677 (1985). The Secretary\u2019s determination clearly is a final decision subject to judicial review.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\"><em>Aertsen </em>v. <em>Landrieu, </em>488 F. Supp. 314 (D. Mass.), aff\u2019d on other grounds, 637 F.2d 12 (1st Cir. 1980), is equally inapposite. In <em>Aertsen, </em>the only issue of State law was whether the project proponents had complied with the procedural requirements imposed on them by MEPA. The Federal District Court judge\u2019s statement that the Secretary\u2019s negative EIR determination was \u201ca complete answer to plaintiffs\u2019 contentions under MEPA,\u201d <em>Aertsen </em>v. <em>Landrieu, supra </em>at 323, does not refer to the merits of the Secretary\u2019s determination; instead, it indicates only that issuance of the Secretary\u2019s determination stood as conclusive evidence of the proponents\u2019 compliance with the procedural requirements of MEPA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Further, the narrow interpretation of \u00a7 7A adopted today was rejected in <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., supra </em>at 646, where this court wrote: \u201cThe legislative intent underlying [\u00a7 7A] is broadly stated in the title under which it was enacted: \u2018An Act establishing a cause of action in behalf of certain persons and political subdivisions for the purpose of protecting the natural resources and environment of the commonwealth. \u2019 St. 1971, c. 732. In submitting the proposed legislation permitting environmental suits to be brought by citizens, the Governor indicated that his intention was to permit \u2018the citizen to join in the enforcement of the battery of anti-pollution laws we have passed in recent years.\u2019 1971 House Doc. No. 5023. We believe that these broad statements of purpose are incompatible with a narrow, technical interpretation of [\u00a7 7A] which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>limit the operation of the statute to the enforcement of only prohibitory environmental laws and regulations.\u201d The court today fails to follow its own words.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Finally, the court today ignores its own recent precedent allowing citizen groups to challenge determinations as to the scope of EIRs under \u00a7 7A. <em>Boston Preservation Alliance, Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, </em>396 Mass. 489 (1986). The court asserts that <em>Boston Preservation Alliance </em>is inapposite because subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 7A was not argued in that case. The fact that the parties did not raise the issue of jurisdiction in <em>Boston Preservation Alliance </em>is irrelevant. The parties in the present action also did not raise jurisdiction as an issue. We raised it in this court sua sponte, as we must, where we question the basis on which parties are before us. <em>Nature Church </em>v. <em>Assessors of Belchertown, </em>384 Mass. 811, 812 (1981). <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>355 Mass. 120, 122 (1969). <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation </em>v. <em>Chilton Club, </em>318 Mass. 285, 287 (1945). The fact that the court did not raise the issue of jurisdiction in <em>Boston Preservation Alliance </em>in my view indicates that the court concluded that jurisdiction was proper. The court today sub silentio overrules <em>Boston Preservation Alliance, </em>a case decided only two years ago. By ignoring its own recent precedent, the court violates a central tenet of principled jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">3. <em>Timeliness of notice. </em>The original issue presented in this appeal was whether the sixty-day notice period in the first paragraph of \u00a7 62H<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> began on the date the Secretary issued a certificate determining that no EIR was required under \u00a7 62A, or the date on which notice of the Secretary\u2019s determination was published in the Environmental Monitor. In 1979, the Secretary promulgated a regulation requiring publication in the Environmental Monitor of all determinations regarding the need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>for EIRs and providing: \u201cThe date of publication of the Monitor shall be the date upon which various periods of time for review specified in these regulations shall commence.\u201d 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.14(1) (1979).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The periods specified in the regulations include the periods described in G. L. c. 30, \u00a7\u00a7 62A, 62H.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">A person challenging a regulation must prove in the judicial proceeding that the regulation is illegal, arbitrary or capricious. E.g., <em>Greenleaf Fin. Co. </em>v. <em>Small Loans Regulatory Bd., </em>377 Mass. 282, 293 (1979). No such showing has been made. Furthermore, the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the statute is supported strongly by the Legislature\u2019s use of the words \u201cof notice\u201d in \u00a7 62H. If the Legislature intended the limitations period to run from the date of the Secretary\u2019s determination, it could have omitted the words \u201cof notice\u201d from \u00a7 62H. Reading those words to refer to the issuance of the certificate under \u00a7 62A produces the same result as omitting them. All words of a statute must be given meaning whenever possible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neiman, </em>396 Mass. 754, 758 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Reading the statutory framework as a coherent whole, the Legislature clearly intended to permit citizen groups to challenge the Secretary\u2019s EIR determinations. It is inconsistent with this basic purpose to conclude that the limitation periods specified in \u00a7 62H begin to run against interested members of the public before they receive notice of the Secretary\u2019s determination. In my view, \u201cissuance of notice\u201d occurs when the Secretary\u2019s determination is published in the Environmental Monitor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The plaintiffs gave timely notice of appeal to the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>4. <em>Conclusion. </em>Precluding judicial review in this case undermines the manifested purpose of the statutory framework. Moreover, precluding judicial review on the basis of the Secretary\u2019s \u201cexpertise\u201d means that \u201c[administrative expertise [will] ... be on its way to becoming \u2018a monster which rules with no practical limits on its discretion.\u2019\u201d <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration inMedicine, </em>383 Mass. 299, 310 (1981). <em>Arthur D. Little, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Health &amp; Hosps. of Cambridge, </em>395 Mass. 535, 566-567 (1985) (Lynch, J., dissenting) and sources cited. Today\u2019s decision takes an unacceptable \u201cstep toward agency nonaccountability and carte blanche,\u201d <em>id., </em>and casts a shadow of uncertainty over our prior decisions on statutory construction. I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-9\"> A private person, such as the defendant Gloucester Landing Associates in this case, only becomes subject to MEPA if that person is applying to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>a public agency for a permit or for financial assistance for a project. G. L. c. 30, \u00a7\u00a7 62A, 62B. \u201cPerson\u201d is defined to include \u201ca private person, firm or corporation, or any governmental entity which is not an agency.\u201d G.

G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b636-6\"> Because I conclude that jurisdiction is proper in this case under \u00a7 7A, see <em>infra, </em>I do not reach the issue whether \u00a7 62H also provides an independent basis for jurisdiction. I note, however, that if \u00a7 62H is interpreted, as the court suggests,- solely as a statute of limitations and not as a provision allowing for judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s EIR determinations, then it is unclear under what provision of law a person <em>required </em>by the Secretary to prepare an EIR may challenge the Secretary\u2019s determination. It is doubtful that the Legislature intended such persons to have no right to judicial review, or that they be limited to bringing constitutional due process claims when they are aggrieved by EIR determinations. If today\u2019s decision is read to suggest that EIR determinations are reviewable under G. L. c. 30A, then it is unclear why the plaintiffs in the present case may not maintain their present action; any objection based on a lack of \u201cstanding\u201d is overcome by \u00a7 7A, which confers on citizen groups the right to bring actions where damage to the environment is involved. Conversely, if, as the court suggests, the Secretary\u2019s EIR determinations are unreviewable, then all the painstakingly detailed provisions in \u00a7 62H governing judicial review must be viewed as meaningless. The court\u2019s interpretation of these provisions as a mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>\u201cassumption\u201d by the Legislature that judicial review is available is unduly grudging and rigid. In my view, these provisions, enacted into law, constitute an expression of legislative <em>intent </em>that EIR determinations be reviewable; it is the duty of this court to give effect to the intent of the Legislature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b637-9\"> The purpose of the 1977 amendments, which was \u201cto immediately expedite environmental approvals . . . under the laws regulating environmental policy in the commonwealth,\u201d Statute 1977, c. 947, was accomplished by several statutory provisions, none of which relate to eliminating judicial review of EIR determinations. The most basic change was to consolidate in the Secretary\u2019s office the EIR determination process, which, prior to 1977, had been spread out among the individual agencies proposing or funding projects. To assure rapid decisionmaking, the Legislature required the Secretary to render determinations within thirty days after publishing notice of receipt of a project proposal. <em>Id. </em>To expedite the EIR process further, the Legislature directed the Secretary to establish \u201cgeneral and special categories of projects and permits which shall or shall not require environmental impact records,\u201d G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62E, which the Secretary has done. See 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 11.03, 11.25-11.27 (1987). Nowhere did the Legislature eliminate judicial review. Instead, it included in the amendments detailed provisions governing judicial review. See G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 62H. The conclusion that eliminating judicial review of EIR determinations constitutes \u201csound environmental policy\u201d is the conclusion of the court, not the Legislature, and usurps the legislative function.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b638-6\"> Even if the Secretary did have discretion to determine the need for EERs, such discretion would not be unbounded as the court today suggests; \u201ca court would not be excluded if the [Secretary] appeared to have been actuated by clearly inapposite or unreasonable considerations.\u201d <em>West Broadway Task Force, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs, </em>363 Mass. 745, 751 (1973).
