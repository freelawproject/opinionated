Radin, a newspaper reporter, for refusing to comply with an order that he answer questions aimed at discovering the identities of confidential sources. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">On April 5, 1982, Globe Newspaper Company published an article, authored by Radin, concerning, inter alla, the application by Richard J. Sinnott (Sinnott), a recently fired chief of the licensing division of the city of Boston, for an accidental disability pension. The article appeared in the wake of a \u201cGlobe Spotlight\u201d report detailing alleged abuses in the awarding of pensions by the Boston Retirement Board (board). According to the article, the contents of Sinnott\u2019s accident statement, made by him as part of his application to the board, were \u201cshared with a Globe reporter by City Hall sources.\u201d As reported in the newspaper article, Sinnott attributed his disability to the emotional impact of his attendance, in his capacity as \u201ccity censor,\u201d at two 1979 rock concerts and at a \u201cfrenzied\u201d licensing hearing during which a participating attorney died.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Five weeks after the article appeared, Sinnott commenced this action against the board, its members, and other city officials. The complaint alleges invasion of privacy in violation of G. L. c. 214, \u00a7\u00a7 IB and 3B (1986 ed.) (counts 1 and 2), and a count said to be based on the plaintiff\u2019s First Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>rights and Ninth Amendment privacy rights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) (count 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">On August 29, 1985, Sinnott subpoenaed Radin to attend a deposition and produce various documents, including any and all which would \u201cidentify the \u2018sources\u2019 referred to\u201d in the article. Relying on (1) the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; (2) art. 16 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution; (3) Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (c), 365 Mass. 772 (1974), and Mass. R. Civ. P. 45, as amended, 387 Mass. 1221 (1983); and (4) the common law, Radin moved to quash the subpoena. The motion was denied on July 16, 1986, without prejudice for its renewal during the course of Radin\u2019s deposition. On July 31, 1986, Radin refused to answer any questions which might lead to the identification of three confidential sources. Radin renewed his motion to quash or, in the alternative, for a protective order, and Sinnott filed a motion to compel further testimony, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 37 (a), 365 Mass. 797 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">On August 8, 1986, a judge in the Superior Court granted Radin\u2019s motions on the ground, inter alla, that there had been no showing that the information sought by Sinnott was not \u201cequally available to the plaintiff were he willing to undertake the investigative effort made by Mr. Radin.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">On December 5, 1986, the same Superior Court judge issued findings of fact and rulings of law on the above noted motions and denied Sinnott\u2019s motion to compel discovery. Applying the principles and considerations enunciated in <em>Petition for the Promulgation of Rules Regarding the Protection of Confidential News Sources &amp; Other Unpublished Information, </em>395 Mass. 164 (1985), the judge weighed Sinnott\u2019s interest in obtaining the names of the individuals who allegedly wrongfully divulged to Radin the information contained in Sinnott\u2019s pension application against Radin\u2019s and the public\u2019s interest in protecting the confidential nature of his sources. This balancing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>was conducted as a necessary component of the analysis required under Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (c) to \u201cassess the competing interests of preventing \u2018annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense,\u2019 . . . and considerations of an efficient and just resolution of the action.\u201d <em>Wansong </em>v. <em>Wansong, </em>395 Mass. 154, 156 (1985). Concluding that \u201cthe public interest in protecting the free flow of information,\u201d <em>Petition for Promulgation of Rules, supra </em>at 172, as demonstrated by the reforms which were in part attributable to the investigative journalism conducted by the Globe Newspaper Company, outweighed the questionable necessity<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the sources\u2019 names for Sinnott\u2019s case and noting the availability of alternative methods of discovery, the judge denied Sinnott\u2019s motion to compel discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The motion judge thereafter denied a subsequent motion to vacate his two previous orders and to compel discovery on the grounds that Sinnott failed to present substantial reasons warranting relief from judgment, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), and that there continued to exist alternatives to compelled disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Sinnott sought relief from a single justice of the Appeals Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118 (1986 ed.). The single justice granted the petition to vacate the previous orders of the Superior Court and remanded the case for entry of an order requiring Radin, inter alia, to disclose his sources. In so doing, the single justice independently applied the considerations set out by <em>Petitionfor the Promulgation of Rules, supraat </em>171-173, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>and concluded that (1) \u201cthe public disclosure of the personal information here in issue is subject to serious limitations and restrictions\u201d; (2) \u201c [i]n view of the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action and the allegations set out in his complaint . . . the plaintiff has shown a real need for the information\u201d; (3) the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cendeavors [to secure the information from alternative sources] cannot be characterized as minimal\u201d; and (4) \u201cit has not been shown that the \u2018asserted damage to the free flow of information is more than speculative or theoretical.\u2019\u201d In sum, the single justice\u2019s own balancing of the asserted interests led her to conclude that she could not \u201cdiscern any public interest to be served by protecting the \u2018free flow\u2019 of information to which the public has, at best, limited and restricted access. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Pursuant to the single justice\u2019s ruling, on February 10,1988, a Superior Court judge entered an order requiring Radin to disclose his sources. On February 18, 1988, after resuming Radin\u2019s deposition, Sinnott moved for an order holding Radin in civil contempt for failing to comply. Sinnott\u2019s motion was allowed and Radin was ordered incarcerated until he provides testimony concerning the sources for the article. That order has been stayed pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">It is apparent that the contrary rulings of the Superior Court judge who denied Sinnott\u2019s motions to compel and of the single justice of the Appeals Court are premised on divergent views of the strength of Sinnott\u2019s underlying claims for invasion of privacy. We need not, nor on this record with the case in its current posture do we think it appropriate to, resolve the various open questions involved in determining whether Sinnott\u2019s complaint states a claim under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7\u00a7 IB or 3B. The narrow question on review in this case is whether the Superior Court judge\u2019s denials of the motions to compel and the motion to vacate those orders constituted an abuse of the \u201cbroad measure of discretion\u201d accorded him. <em>Matter of Roche, </em>381 Mass. 624, 638 (1980), citing <em>Matter of Pappas, </em>358 Mass. 604, 614 n.13 (1971). \u201cAn adjudication of civil contempt against a nonparty constitutes a final judgment appealable pursuant to Mass. R. A. P. 1 (c), 365 Mass. 844 (1974),\u201d and \u201c[the] validity of an underlying discovery order, disobedience of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>has led to an adjudication of contempt, may be challenged on appeal from the adjudication of contempt,\u201d <em>Matter of Roche, supra </em>at 625 n.l. In these circumstances, we review the rulings of the Superior Court judge denying the motion to compel and granting a protective order. Unless that ruling constituted an abuse of discretion, there is no basis for the judgment of contempt. See <em>Baker v. F &amp; F Inv., </em>470 F.2d 778 (2d Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 411 U.S. 966 (1973). We discern no such abuse of discretion and, therefore, reverse the adjudication of civil contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">It is well settled that, in supervising discovery, a presiding judge is \u201cobliged to consider the effect that compelled discovery would have on \u2018the values protected by the First Amendment, [even] though [these values were] entitled to no constitutional privilege.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matter of Roche, supra </em>at 636, quoting <em>Herbert </em>v. <em>Lando, </em>441 U.S. 153, 180 (1979) (Powell, J., concurring). The \u201cneedless disclosure of confidential relationships,\u201d <em>Matter of Roche, supra </em>at 637, is, therefore, to be avoided. While \u201c[a] judge ruling on discovery requests must also take into account considerations of efficiency and economy,\u201d <em>id., </em>the critical inquiry, once there is \u201csome showing that the asserted damage to the free flow of information is more than speculative or theoretical,\u201d <em>Petition for the Promulgation of Rules, supra </em>at 172, requires \u201ca balancing between the public interest in every person\u2019s evidence and the public interest in protecting the free flow of information.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The Superior Court judge was warranted in balancing Sinnott\u2019s need for the information against possible damage to the free flow of information.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nor can it be concluded that the Superior Court judge\u2019s view of the appropriate balance in this case was unwarranted by the record or based on an unreasonable assessment of several areas of unsettled law. Although this court has not recognized the existence of any special status for the institutional press with regard to First Amendment or art. 16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>interests, see <em>Matter of Roche, supra </em>at 631 n.9; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corsetti, </em>387 Mass. 1, 4 (1982), it was not improper for the judge to consider the investigative purpose of and public interest in Radin\u2019s use of confidential sources. Cf. <em>Von Bulow </em>v. <em>Von Bulow, </em>811 F.2d 136, 142-143 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Von Bulow, </em>481 U.S. 1015 (1987), quoting <em>Baker </em>v. <em>F &amp; F Inv., supra </em>at 782 (explaining that the public interest in nondisclosure rested upon the concern that \u201cthe deterrent effect such disclosure is likely to have upon future \u2018undercover\u2019 <em>investigative reporting </em>. . . threatens freedom of the press and the public\u2019s need to be informed\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> His assessment of the relative weight of these public interests cannot be said, as a matter of law, to be incorrect, especially in light of the questionable viability of Sinnott\u2019s invasion of privacy claims and the lack of a clear demonstration of reasons for a need to know the precise identity of Radin\u2019s sources. Further, he correctly considered the availability of alternative sources, and, although Sinnott\u2019s efforts to pursue other avenues were not minimal, neither can it be said that, on balance, the existence of other potential sources was insignificant.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">In addition to making arguments in support of the balance reached independently by the single justice of the Appeals Court, Sinnott focuses his argument on the extensive discovery already undertaken. His central argument is that to be required to continue depositions would be \u201cto continue a game of hare and hounds,\u201d especially where, as here, all individuals previously deposed have either denied disclosing to Radin or have refused to answer on Fifth Amendment grounds. Relying on <em>Matter of Roche, supra, </em>he contends further that, at the very least, Radin should be required to disclose to the extent necessary to determine whether any of the defendants perjured themselves. As to the gamesmanship argument, we need say nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>more than has already been said regarding the discretion of the motion judge. With regard to the possible existence of perjury in this case, we do not view such a possibility as so likely or so central to the case as to constitute grounds for disturbing the ruling of the motion judge. We therefore reverse the judgment of contempt against Charles A. Radin and the February 10, 1988, order directing him to answer deposition questions. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-9\">We do not review the underlying order of the single justice of the Appeals Court which was an interlocutory order granted within the discretion accorded in G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par. (1986 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b597-8\"> It can be deduced from the record that, of the fifteen individuals identified by the board in its answer to an interrogatory as having access to the plaintiff\u2019s pension application, four had not been deposed prior to the August 8, 1986, order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b598-7\"> While the judge questioned whether Radin had standing to argue that Sinnott\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, he considered and rejected Sinnott\u2019s contentions that the precise identities of the sources went to the \u201cheart of the claim.\u201d See <em>Dow Jones &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>364 Mass. 317 (1973). Indeed, the judge reasoned, \u201c[I]t is unclear in the instant case why plaintiff needs to know the precise identity of Radio\u2019s sources. Plaintiff alleges defendants violated his right to privacy by permitting the contents of his application to be released to Radin against Board policy. . . . There is no question that Radin is not a person authorized to have such access, nor is there any question that Radin did have access.\u201d Therefore, the inquiry as to the sources\u2019 identities was deemed \u201cmore of a \u2018needless disclosure of confidential relations\u2019 than a question that goes to the \u2018heart of plaintiff\u2019s case.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b600-7\"> At his deposition, Radin testified to having three confidential sources. He would not divulge whether they were among various individuals already deposed. Contrast <em>Matter of Roche, supra </em>at 635.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b601-5\"> We stress, however, that, as noted by the judge, it is the protection for \u201cinformation gathering [which] must exist if the First Amendment is to serve adequately the. central purpose of facilitating intelligent decisions by self-governing people,\u201d <em>Matter of Roche, supra </em>at 632, rather than the evidence that, in this case, reforms actually resulted from the \u201cGlobe Spotlight\u201d series.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
