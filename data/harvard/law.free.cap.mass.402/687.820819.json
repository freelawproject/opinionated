L. c. 92, \u00a7 63B, added by St. 1948, c. 653,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 9A, added by St. 1982, c. 345.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>moved for summary judgment on a statement of agreed facts and supporting documents. The Superior Court judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We granted direct appellate review. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">We summarize the agreed facts. On August 28, 1978, the plaintiff stopped his car on Brookline Avenue, near Fenway Park, to ask directions from Monk, who was on duty in uniform directing traffic. Monk ordered the plaintiff to move on. The plaintiff found Monk\u2019s manner uncivil and threatening. After parking, the plaintiff walked back to speak to Monk, who now ordered the plaintiff to leave the intersection. The plaintiff again found Monk\u2019s manner inappropriate. Later that evening, the plaintiff telephoned the MDC to complain about Monk\u2019s actions. The plaintiff followed up the complaint with a letter to Monk\u2019s direct superior, Captain Kenneth Elliott. Elliott notified his supervisor, Deputy Superintendent John McDonough, of the complaint, and McDonough sent the plaintiff a letter stating that Elliott would investigate the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Elliott advised Monk of the civilian complaint and requested a report on the incident. Monk responded by seeking a criminal complaint against the plaintiff in the Roxbury District Court for failing to comply with an order to move his car on request of an MDC officer, a violation of MDC Rule 7. According to</p>\n<p id=\"AV6V\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Monk, he did not bring charges earlier because he did not know the plaintiff\u2019s name. McDonough and Elliott suspended their investigation when they learned that Monk obtained a criminal complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They \u201cbelieved that the merits of the incident would be settled in the Roxbury District Court.\u201d The District Court judge found the plaintiff guilty and imposed a fine. On appeal, a Superior Court judge dismissed the complaint. Despite the dismissal, the MDC never reopened its investigation on Monk\u2019s conduct and never disciplined him. Following the District Court trial, McDonough and Elliott felt \u201cthe matter was resolved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The plaintiff subsequently filed a civil rights action against Monk<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in Federal court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982). The plaintiff alleged that Monk initiated the criminal prosecution against him in retaliation for the complaint he filed with the MDC, and that the prosecution violated his right to petition the government for redress of grievances. After jury trial, the plaintiff was awarded $3,500 in compensatory damages. He later was awarded $5,356.17 in attorney\u2019s fees. Punitive damages were sought, but the jury did not award them.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">While the civil rights action was pending, Monk filed a bankruptcy petition. The plaintiff filed an adversary complaint in the bankruptcy proceeding, and the parties resolved the dispute by entering an agreement for judgment that the civil rights judgment was nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523 (a)(6) (1982) ,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the agreement for judgment in bankruptcy, Monk assigned all his entitlement to indemnification from the MDC and the Commonwealth resulting from the civil rights case to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>After the civil rights trial, and pursuant to the assignment from Monk, the plaintiff requested indemnification from the MDC. The commissioner denied the request, because, in his opinion, Monk had acted beyond the scope of his employment when he prosecuted the plaintiff. The plaintiff then filed the present action in the Superior Court. The Superior Court judge granted summary judgment for the MDC. The judge concluded that, based on the agreed facts, Monk had acted outside the scope of his employment and therefore was not entitled to indemnification under either G. L. c. 92, \u00a7 63B, or c. 258, \u00a7 9A.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff asserts that, as a matter of law, he is entitled to indemnification. Alternatively, he argues that his entitlement to indemnification depends upon resolution of genuine issues of material fact, and that the judge therefore erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We agree that summary judgment was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">1. <em>The statutory framework. </em>The plaintiff seeks indemnification under two statutes, G. L. c. 92, \u00a7 63B, and c. 258, \u00a7 9A. The parties dispute which statute applies. The plaintiff argues that \u00a7 9A, which became effective after the award of compensatory damages in his Federal civil rights case (but before the award of attorney\u2019s fees), cannot be applied retroactively to deny him rights he had under \u00a7 63B.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant contends that the requirements of the statutes are cumulative or, in the alternative, that \u00a7 9A governs entitlement to indemnification in this case. We conclude that \u00a7 9A governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>General Laws c. 92, \u00a7 63B, was enacted in 1948. The statute provides indemnification for MDC officers in two situations: where an officer suffers financial loss from his own injury in the line of duty, see <em>Montague </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 62 (1980), and where an officer must pay damages for harm to a third person caused \u201cwhile acting as a police officer.\u201d The statute draws no distinction between negligent and intentional harm caused by an officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">In 1978, the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, G. L. c. 258, effectively repealed \u00a7 63B as to negligent harm caused by MDC officers. The tort claims act expressly provides that public employers, including the MDC, are directly liable for negligent harm caused by public employees acting within the scope of their employment. G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2, first par.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">We conclude that \u00a7 9A of c. 258, added by St. 1982, c. 345, likewise supplants \u00a7 63B in cases involving intentional torts and civil rights violations. Section 9A deals expressly with intentional torts and civil rights violations. It defines specific prerequisites for indemnification in such cases; it covers all police officers employed directly by the Commonwealth; and it provides for the officers\u2019 legal representation. In short, it provides a specific, comprehensive system for indemnification of certain police officers in civil rights and intentional tort cases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The differences between \u00a7 63B and \u00a7 9A are as follows. Under \u00a7 63B, the MDC indemnified the officer; under \u00a7 9A, the Commonwealth is directly responsible for indemnification.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Under \u00a7 63B, the MDC determined the amount of indemnification \u201csubject to appropriation\u201d and approval by the Attorney General; under \u00a7 9A the Commonwealth must provide full indemnification subject to a one million dollar limit (not relevant in this case). Section 63B provided indemnification for acts done \u201cwhile acting as a police officer\u201d; \u00a7 9A covers acts \u201cwithin the scope of the official duties of [the] officer.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finally, under \u00a7 63B the MDC could exercise discretion to determine an officer\u2019s entitlement to indemnification, <em>see Montague </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Metropolitan Dist. Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 64; under \u00a7 9A, if indemnification is disputed, the officer\u2019s entitlement is determined in the Superior Court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201c[W]here two statutes are inconsistent and mutually repugnant, the later statute governs.\u201d <em>Mirageas </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>391 Mass. 815, 819 (1984).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>2. <em>Summary judgment. </em>We will affirm an order for summary judgment, \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). See, e.g., <em>Cassesso </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass. 419, 422 (1983); <em>Godbout </em>v. <em>Cousens, </em>396 Mass. 254, 257 (1985). Because there are at least two issues of material fact unresolved, summary judgment was not appropriate for either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The first factual issue is whether Monk\u2019s violation of the plaintiff\u2019s civil rights (the criminal prosecution) \u201coccurred within the scope of [Monk\u2019s] official duties.\u201d G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 9A. We have not had occasion to consider \u201cthe scope of . . . official duties\u201d under \u00a7 9A. However, under the parallel provision in \u00a7 9 (indemnification of other public employees), we apply common law respondeat superior principles. <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Burlington, </em>399 Mass. 585, 589-590 (1987). We conclude that the same principles apply under \u00a7 9A.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">\u201cThe general respondeat superior test involving intentional torts considers whether the act was within the course of employment, and in furtherance of the employer\u2019s work.\u201d <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Burlington, supra </em>at 590, and cases cited. In determining the scope of employment, the finder of fact must consider whether the conduct complained of is of the kind the employee is hired to perform, whether it occurs within authorized time and space limits, and whether \u201cit is motivated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the employer.\u201d <em>Wang Labs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Business Incentives, Inc., </em>398 Mass. 854, 859 (1986). See Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 228 (1958). Monk\u2019s conduct clearly was of the kind he was hired to perform. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>The issue is Monk\u2019s motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">If an employee \u201cacts from purely personal motives ... in no way connected with the employer\u2019s interests, he is consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>ered in the ordinary case to have departed from his employment, and the master is not liable.\u201d W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts 506 (5th ed. 1984). See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Federated Dept. Stores, Inc., </em>364 Mass. 340, 348 (1973). However, \u201c[t]he fact that the predominant motive of the [employee] is to benefit himself does not prevent the act from coming within the scope of employment as long as the act is otherwise within the purview of his authority.\u201d <em>Wang Labs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Business Incentives, Inc., supra </em>at 859-860. See <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>814 F.2d 1142 (7th Cir. 1987) (intentional false arrest); W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, <em>supra </em>at 506-507. \u201cIf the act complained of was within the scope of the servant\u2019s authority, the master will be liable, although it constituted an abuse or excess of the authority conferred. The master ... is justly held responsible when the servant, through lack of judgment or discretion, or from infirmity of temper, or under the influence of passion aroused by the circumstances and the occasion, goes beyond the strict line of his duty or authority and inflicts an unjustifiable injury on a third person.\u201d <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>480 S.W.2d 55, 57 (Tex. Civ. App. 1972). See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Weinberg, </em>434 A.2d 404, 408 (D.C. App. 1981). Where a party\u2019s state of mind or motive is in issue, summary judgment is disfavored. <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Abernathy, </em>393 Mass. 81, 86 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">The judge concluded that, based on the agreed facts, Monk did not act within the scope of his employment, because he initiated \u201ca private counter-attack or personal vendetta\u201d against the plaintiff, which \u201cno one, including Monk and the plaintiff, could reasonably believe . . . was furthering the mission of the MDC.\u201d The parties, however, did not stipulate as to Monk\u2019s subjective motivation. Monk alleges that he delayed bringing the prosecution because he did not know the plaintiff\u2019s name. Even if Monk was motivated by a degree of vindictiveness, he also may have believed he was serving his employer in prosecuting the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff violated an MDC regulation. Prosecution of criminal complaints for violations of MDC regulations is part of Monk\u2019s job. The fact that Monk\u2019s superiors knew of the retaliatory action is some evidence that they may have endorsed or ratified Monk\u2019s action. See Restate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>ment (Second) of Agency \u00a7 218 (1958); <em>Pusateri </em>v. <em>E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., </em>180 Cal. App. 3d 247 (1986). Whether Monk acted within the scope of his official duties within the meaning of \u00a7 9A is a question of fact.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The second factual question is whether Monk \u201cacted in a wilful, wanton, or malicious manner.\u201d G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 9A. We have not yet considered the scope of this exclusion to indemnification. However, \u201c [provisions for indemnity should be construed in a manner which will effectuate their purpose.\u201d <em>Filippone </em>v. <em>Mayor of Newton, </em>392 Mass. 622, 628 (1984). The purpose of \u00a7 9A is to provide an exception to the general rule excluding public liability for intentional torts of public employees.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The mandatory indemnification statute evidences the Legislature\u2019s determination that intentional torts and civil rights violations arise frequently in the scope of police work, and that indemnification of officers against such claims encourages police service. Cf. <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Burlington, supra </em>at 591. Because intentional torts, by definition, involve some element of \u201cwilfulness,\u201d a literal reading of the exclusion would frustrate the express purpose of \u00a7 9A, and thus must be rejected. \u201cThe words of a statute will not be read literally if to do so would be inconsistent with legislative intent. \u201d <em>Oxford </em>v. <em>Oxford Water Co., </em>391 Mass. 581, 592 (1984). <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, </em>387 Mass. 326, 336 (1982). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Neiman, </em>396 Mass. 754, 757 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>We conclude that, for purposes of \u00a7 9A, in a civil rights context \u201cwilful, wanton, or malicious\u201d conduct means egregious conduct which would warrant imposition of punitive damages in the underlying action. In Federal civil rights actions, which are among the actions for which \u00a7 9A provides indemnity, the United States Supreme Court has interpreted the terms \u201cmalice,\u201d \u201cwanton,\u201d and \u201cwilful\u201d to constitute a standard for punitive damages \u201cwhen the defendant\u2019s conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>461 U.S. 30, 39-40 n.8, 56 (1983). Linking the exclusion from indemnification to the standard for punitive damages achieves the Legislature\u2019s clear intent; it indemnifies officers for intentional torts and civil rights violations occurring within the scope of their official duties, yet excludes indemnification in egregious cases. It also provides a bright line test for precluding indemnification where punitive damages are awarded in the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">We reject the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that he automatically is entitled to indemnification under \u00a7 9A, because the jury in the Federal civil rights action did not award punitive damages. A failure to award punitive damages, unlike a verdict awarding them, does not establish facts that are binding in future litigation. Punitive damages under \u00a7 1983 are not mandatory, \u201cno matter how egregious the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Wade, supra </em>at 52. The award of punitive damages is \u201ca discretionary moral judgment\u201d made after the plaintiff proves sufficiently serious misconduct on the defendant\u2019s part. <em>Id. </em>The Federal jury verdict therefore does not preclude a finding that Monk took himself outside the coverage of \u00a7 9A when he prosecuted the plaintiff. Whether he did is a question to be determined by the finder of fact.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Karas </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>11 Ill.2d 233, 244-245 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>The dissent incorrectly argues that the Federal jury verdict precludes indemnification because that verdict necessarily included a finding that Monk\u2019s action was \u201cwilful, wanton, or malicious.\u201d \u201c[I]t is a condition of such \u2018issue preclusion\u2019 (terminology now favored over \u2018collateral estoppel\u2019) that the determination to be carried over shall not only have been litigated in the first action, but shall have been essential to the judgment in that action.\u201d <em>Rudow </em>v. <em>Fogel, </em>376 Mass. 587, 591 (1978). <em>Wishnewsky </em>v. <em>Saugus, </em>325 Mass. 191, 195 (1950). Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 &amp; comments i and j (1982). Issue preclusion is inappropriate because it is impossible to determine on the record before us whether the jury had to find Monk\u2019s action \u201cwilful, wanton, or malicious\u201d to award compensatory damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The fact that the plaintiff alleged \u201cmalice\u201d in the civil rights complaint does not establish that \u201cwilful, wanton, or malicious\u201d conduct was essential to the judgment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The complaint, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>is the only guide in the present record as to what transpired in the Federal court, includes allegations of violations of the plaintiff\u2019s rights under the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. It is not clearly the case that an award of compensatory damages under \u00a7 1983 on every one of these theories necessarily requires a finding of \u201cwilful, wanton, or malicious\u201d conduct. <em>See Parratt </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 534 (1980) (\u00a7 1983 contains no state of mind requirement); <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 330 (1986) (depending on the violation alleged, plaintiff may have to prove defendant\u2019s particular state of mind). Standing alone, the complaint does not indicate which issues or questions of fact were essential to the judgment; it does not reveal the proof developed at trial, the theory or theories of law on which the judge instructed the jury, or the basis for the jury\u2019s verdict.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Issue preclusion attaches only to \u201cissues or questions of fact actually litigated and determined, not those that merely lurk in the record before the court.\u201d <em>In re Four Seasons Securities Laws Litigation, </em>370 F. Supp. 219, 235 (D. Okla. 1974). <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Felsen, </em>442 U.S. 127, 139 n.10 (1979). See 18 C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4420, at 182, 183 (1981). On remand, it is open to the Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>to attempt to establish that the Federal jury verdict necessarily included a finding that Monk \u201cacted in a wilful, wanton, or malicious manner.\u201d We cannot determine that issue on the present record.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">3. <em>Conflict of interest. </em>Although neither party raises the issue, we comment on the conflict of interest that may arise in indemnification actions under \u00a7 9A. The Commonwealth, at the request of the affected police officer, is required to provide for the officer\u2019s legal representation in a tort or civil rights action. In this case, the office of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth represented Monk in the Federal court civil rights action. The Attorney General\u2019s office now represents the MDC. Although different attorneys handled the two cases, the potential obviously exists for the same lawyer to represent an officer in a civil rights or intentional tort case, and represent the Commonwealth in a subsequent action opposing the officer\u2019s claim to indemnification. Even if different attorneys handle the two cases, a conflict may arise; confidential information from the first action might be used against the officer in the second.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> To avoid claims of conflict of interest, the Commonwealth would be wise to follow the procedures outlined in G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2, second par.,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and, in cases where the Commonwealth plans to challenge the right to indemnification, reimburse the officer for reasonable attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>fees incurred in defense of the underlying action.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> If the officer is found liable in that action, a subsequent action by or against the Commonwealth can determine whether an exception to indemnification applies. If an exception applies, the Commonwealth might then recover from the officer those funds expended for legal services on his or her behalf.

Such determination was sought only after the plaintiff sought indemnification, which he did after \u00a7 9A was in effect. As explained, <em>infra, </em>\u00a7 9A is a procedural and remedial provision, and its retroactive application is permissible because it does not affect any substantive rights Monk or the plaintiff previously had. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>339 Mass. 557, 578-579 (1959). Cf. <em>Nantucket Conservation Found., Inc. </em>v. <em>Russell Management, Inc., </em>380 Mass. 212 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b706-8\"> The statute applies to \u201cmember[s] of the state police, the [MDC] police, the cap\u00edtol police, the registry of motor vehicle police or an employee represented by state bargaining unit five.\u201d G.

However, the MDC \u201cis neither an independent authority nor (like a municipality) a political subdivision, but is, rather, one of the operating departments of the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. Commonwealth, 13 Mass. App. Ct. 524, 525 (1982). Moreover, the Attorney General, who represents the Commonwealth in litigation, represents the MDC in this action. Thus, the Commonwealth has knowledge of this action and its potential liability. In light of our conclusion that \u00a7 9A applies, the Commonwealth, on remand, should be joined as a defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b707-4\"> Section 9A also contains an express exclusion of indemnification for \u201cwilful, wanton, or malicious\u201d acts. Although this exclusion does not appear on the face of \u00a7 63B, we determine that the \u201cacting as a police officer\u201d requirement in \u00a7 63B, along with the MDC\u2019s discretion to determine whether the officer was so acting, is sufficient to support reading a similar exclusion into \u00a7 63B. We therefore read the exclusion in \u00a7 9A merely as making explicit that which was implicit in \u00a7 63B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b707-5\"> No statutory provision is made for administrative determination of the Commonwealth\u2019s mandatory duty to indemnify an officer under G.

Moreover, \u00a7 9 applies to the entire spectrum of public employers in the Commonwealth, see G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 1, whereas \u00a7 9A is limited to police officers employed directly by the Commonwealth. Even where permissive indemnification is involved, we did not limit the scope of review of the public employer\u2019s determination. Unless the employer is an \u201cagency\u201d within the meaning of the State Administrative Procedure Act, see G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1, and its determination is made in an \u201cadjudicatory proceeding,\u201d <em>id., </em>the limits on judicial review in G.

The bankruptcy statute excepts from discharge debts which arise from \u201cwillful and malicious\u201d injury. However, \u201cwillful and malicious\u201d con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>duct under the bankruptcy statute includes conduct which is more than merely negligent or inadvertent. E.g., <em>In re Katz, </em>20 B.R. 394, 397 (Bkrcy. Mass. 1982). A judgment of nondischargeability does not require a determination that punitive damages would be warranted. In addition, a consent judgment generally is not given preclusive effect in future litigation, unless the judgment manifests an intent of the parties that it have such effect. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 comment e (1982); 18 C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4443 (1981). The plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of an assignment of rights to indemnification from Monk <em>after </em>the bankruptcy judgment undercuts any notion that the agreement for judgment was intended to cut off Monk\u2019s right to indemnification. Thus, the agreement for judgment in bankruptcy is not determinative of the exclusion under \u00a7 9A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b712-7\"> It also is irrelevant that the plaintiff alleged the common law tort of malicious prosecution as an alternative theory of recovery in the Federal court action. We do not have before us a special verdict indicating the theory on which the jury awarded compensatory damages. Because it is unclear which theory the jury accepted, preclusion as to the issue of \u201cmalice,\u201d an element of the common law tort, <em>Beecy </em>v. <em>Pucciarelli, </em>387 Mass. 589, 593-596 (1982), but not necessarily of \u00a7 1983, is inappropriate in this litigation.

Chairman of the Bd. of Fire Comm\u2019rs of Springfield, </em>401 Mass. 26 (1987), cert. denied, U.S. (1988) (108 S. Ct. 1078 [1988]). It does not apply to Federal law claims, which are governed by a different immunity standard not requiring subjective bad faith, <em>id. </em>at 31-34, and does not apply to acts which are not \u201cdiscretionary\u201d under State law. <em>Id. </em>at 34-38. The Federal court action in this case included claims under both State and Federal law. There is no indication in the record which immunity standard, if any, was presented to the Federal jury. Nor is there any indication whether the Federal court judge determined the defendant\u2019s actions to be \u201cdiscretionary.\u201d Indeed, the defendant may have failed to raise an immunity defense in the Federal action, and thereby waived it. We cannot tell on the present record. We express no opinion on the question whether the standard for \u201cmalice\u201d under <em>Gildea </em>is the same as the standard for \u201cwilful, wanton, or malicious\u201d conduct under \u00a7 9A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b714-5\"> No allegations of any such impropriety are made in this case.

See <em>Magoun </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>346 Mass. 677, 682-683 (1964); <em>Salonen </em>v. <em>Paanenen, </em>320 Mass. 568, 573-575 (1947). See also <em>Employers\u2019 Liab.

In the circumstances of this case, it is clear that Monk acted maliciously and, hence, that the exception in the indemnification statute for \u201cwilful, wanton, or malicious\u201d acts applies. The Federal \u00a7 1983 action contained two counts against Monk. Count I of the complaint alleged that Monk \u201cillegally and maliciously instituted a criminal process against the plaintiff in order to punish the plaintiff.\u201d Count II, which was for malicious prosecution, contained the same allegation and added that \u201c[t]he prosecution commenced by . . . Monk was instituted . . . without basis and maliciously and with intent to harm the plaintiff.\u201d The jury\u2019s verdict was for the plaintiff. Therefore, whether under Count I or Count II, the jury must have based its verdict on conduct of Monk that was malicious in the sense that it was not only intentional, but was solely intended to harm and punish the plaintiff. It cannot be that the Legislature intended that police officers be indemnified for harm caused by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>their intentional acts done for the exclusive purpose of causing harm to and punishing another. See <em>Gildea </em>v. <em>Ellershaw, </em>363 Mass. 800, 820 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Furthermore, the judge\u2019s conclusion that Monk did not act within the scope of his employment because he initiated a \u201cprivate counter-attack or personal vendetta\u201d against the plaintiff was correct. The plaintiff alleged in the Federal action that Monk\u2019s allegations against him were not only false but known by Monk to be false. In the context of this case that conclusion was not a question of fact to be determined by the jury in the State action because it had already been decided by the Federal jury on the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s own allegations. Pinshaw\u2019s State claim is based upon, and is wholly dependent on, the Federal action. He is, therefore, precluded from asserting facts that are contrary to those upon which the Federal judgment was based. <em>Massachusetts Property Ins.
