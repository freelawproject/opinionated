The board of assessors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>(assessors) took no action on these requests and they were, therefore, deemed denied as of October.8, 1986. See G. L. c. 59, \u00a7\u00a7 63, 64 (1986 ed.). The taxpayer did not appeal the denials to the Appellate Tax Board (board) within three months as was its right under c. 59, \u00a7 65 (1986 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">On January 29, 1987, the taxpayer petitioned the board for permission to enter late appeals of the abatement denials pursuant to c. 59, \u00a7 65C (1986 ed.). Section 65C provides that the board may allow late appeals if the assessors have failed to notify the taxpayer in writing of their inaction on an abatement request within ten days of the deemed denial as required by c. 59, \u00a7 63, and the taxpayer has by \u201cmistake or accident\u201d failed to take its appeal as of right under c. 59, \u00a7 65. The taxpayer contended that it did not receive written notice within ten days and it had mistakenly failed to file under \u00a7 65. The assessors argued that they sent the notice within ten days and this satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 63 regardless of when the taxpayer received the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">The board denied the taxpayer\u2019s petition to file late appeals. After a hearing, the board found that the deemed denial date was October 8, 1986, and that the assessors mailed the notices on October 14 or 15. The board also found that the taxpayer received the notice regarding the property tax abatement\u2019s denial on October 21, and the real estate tax abatement\u2019s denial notice on October 23. Under \u00a7 63 the taxpayer should have been notified \u201cin writing\u201d by October 18, 1986. The board ruled that the taxpayer was notified in writing within ten days within the meaning of \u00a7 63. The board concluded that, by sending the notices within ten days of October 8, the assessors had met their obligations under \u00a7 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">The taxpayer appealed and we granted its application for direct appellate review. The assessors cross appealed, challenging the board\u2019s finding that the taxpayer received the notices on October 21 and October 23. We reverse in part and affirm in part, and order the board to reconsider the taxpayer\u2019s petition for permission to file late appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>1. <em>Construction of \u00a7 63.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The board erred in concluding that the assessors satisfied their statutory obligation by sending notice of the deemed denial date\u2019s passage within ten days. As noted by the dissenting commissioner below, the long-standing rule is that \u201c[i]n the absence of express provision to the contrary, a notice is not given until received by the person to be notified.\u201d <em>Regan </em>v. <em>Atlantic Ref. Co., </em>304 Mass. 353, 354 (1939). See <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lexington, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 441, 443-444 (1975), and cases cited. Section 63 does not provide that the requisite notice may be given by mail within a prescribed time period. See <em>Survey &amp; Research Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>352 Mass. 475 (1967). In this circumstance, we conclude that taxpayers are notified within the meaning of \u00a7 63 upon receipt of the inaction notices, not upon the sending of such notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Contrary to the assessors\u2019 arguments our conclusion is buttressed by the statutory framework of G. L. c. 59 (1986 ed.). In \u00a7 59 of c. 59, the Legislature provided that, where the tax \u201cbill or notice was first sent after September first . . . [then] on or before the thirtieth day after the date on which the bill or notice <em>was so sent,\u201d </em>the taxpayer may file for an abatement (emphasis added). Thus, where the Legislature intended that the date on which the assessors send a notice be controlling it so stated. The Legislature explicitly made the date of sending of notice controlling in \u00a7 59. It failed to do so in \u00a7 63 and we will not imply the necessary language. See <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Judge Baker Guidance Center, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 144, 153 (1982). See also <em>Assessors of Salem </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>371 Mass. 410, 412 (1976) (\u201cIf the Legislature had intended the date of mailing to be the controlling date, it could have easily made the language of the statute explicit in this regard\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">2. <em>The Assessors\u2019 Cross Appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">The assessors contend that the board\u2019s findings that the taxpayer received the notices on October 21 and October 23 are not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>is \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 466 (1981). The board\u2019s findings should be overturned only if on consideration of the entire record it appears that \u201cthe evidence points to no felt or appreciable probability of the conclusion or points to an overwhelming probability of the contrary.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting L.L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 598 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The board found, and it is uncontested on appeal, that the notices were mailed on October 14 or October 15, six or seven days into the ten-day statutory period. It is also uncontested that the notices were imprecisely addressed to \u201cGas Co. Boston\u201d rather than to \u201cBoston Gas Company.\u201d However, the assessors argue that the board improperly relied on inadmissible testimony of a witness offered by the taxpayer. The assessors refer here to testimony from the taxpayer\u2019s officer responsible for tax assessments. They do not question the propriety of his testimony that he received the notices on his desk on October 21 and October 23. However, this employee also testified that he had \u201cno knowledge of property tax bills being lost internally in the mail operations.\u201d The assessors objected to this testimony as being offered without a proper foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">We conclude that the evidence was properly received even though, under Rule 37 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Appellate Tax Board (1987), the general mie is that the ordinary rules of evidence apply in board proceedings. (Contrast G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (2): \u201c[ujnless otherwise provided . . . agencies need not observe the rules of evidence observed by courts\u201d). We agree with the board that it properly received in evidence and considered the witness\u2019s status as a thirteen-year employee and his responsibility for the taxpayer\u2019s assessments. The employee also testified regarding the taxpayer\u2019s internal mail handling procedures. He stated that the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Postal Service makes two deliveries each morning, and that the mail received is then sorted and distributed to the taxpayer\u2019s various departments by a clerk. There was no objection to this testimony. On cross-examination, it became clear that the basis of the witness\u2019s knowledge of the taxpayer\u2019s internal mail procedures was an \u201cinvestigation\u201d he conducted in preparation for trial. While the assessors objected to the later testimony given by the witness on redirect examination, regarding the internal mail procedures as being hearsay or lacking a proper foundation, they made no motion to strike his initial testimony on the subject. This testimony remained in the record and the board was \u201centitled to give it such probative effect as [it] deemed appropriate.\u201d See <em>Abraham </em>v. <em>Woburn, </em>383 Mass. 724, 726-727 n.1 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Given the above evidence a reasonable mind could conclude that the notices were received on October 21 and October 23. It would be reasonable for the board to infer that any delay caused by the address imprecision occurred through the United States Postal Service and not once the mail was in the hands of the rightful recipient. Further, the taxpayer\u2019s employee\u2019s testimony that he had no knowledge of past internal mail handling delays, and his description of the taxpayer\u2019s internal mail handling system supports an inference that the notices were forwarded to him on the days the taxpayer received them. Because he testified that they were on his desk on October 21 and October 23, the board could infer that the taxpayer received them on those dates. The witness\u2019s credibility rests with the board. See <em>Starks </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass. 640, 643 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">In sum, the board\u2019s findings that the notices were received on October 21 and October 23 are supported by substantial evidence. Because these notices should have been received by, and not merely sent by, October 18, the taxpayer was not timely notified in accordance with c. 59, \u00a7 63. This case is remanded to the board for a determination whether the taxpayer\u2019s failure to file appeals under c. 59, \u00a7 65, was the result of an \u201caccident or mistake,\u201d and for a further determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>whether the taxpayer\u2019s petition to file late appeals should be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-10\"> While the board is not subject to the State Administrative Procedure Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (2) (1986 ed.), it is \u201csubject to general principles affecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>administrative decisions and judicial review of them.\u201d <em>Assessors of New Braintree </em>v. <em>Pioneer Valley Academy, Inc., </em>355 Mass. 610., 612 n.1 (1969). Review of its findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence is, therefore, the appropriate test. <em>New Bedford Gas &amp; Edison Light Co. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Dartmouth, </em>368 Mass. 745, 749 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
