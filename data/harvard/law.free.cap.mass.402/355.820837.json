R. Crim. P. 15 (b), as amended, 397 Mass. 1225 (1986), from a determination that evidence obtained during a search of the apartment of the defendant Patricia Treadwell must be suppressed because the \u201cwarrant . . . particularly and specially and specifically describe[d] an apartment located over No. 17 at 50C Memorial Road,\u201d which was not the apartment which was searched. The defendants are charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants filed motions to suppress in the Superior Court. After hearing, the Superior Court judge allowed the motions on the ground of misidentification of the place to be searched. For the reasons stated, we conclude that the judge correctly allowed the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">We summarize the relevant facts from the affidavit that accompanied the application for the search warrant. On January 15, 1986, a reliable informant told Robert M. Spinney, Jr., of the Somerville police department that \u201c \u2018he\u2019 [the informant] had observed the occupant of the 2nd-floor apartment at 50C Memorial Road [in Somerville] selling cocaine to various persons. . . . [The informant] described the apartment as being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>the front apartment on the 2nd-floor <em>directly above No. 17\u201d </em>(emphasis added). On January 17, Spinney and another officer \u201cparked in front of 50C Memorial Road watching <em>the </em>front apartment on the 2nd-floor\u201d (emphasis added). Spinney saw a person in a white jacket enter the building and, moments later, \u201cobserved through a window the door of <em>the </em>2nd-floor apartment open [and] a person wearing a white jacket walk in\u201d (emphasis added). After a few minutes, the same person left the building, entered an automobile driven by someone else, and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">The police followed the automobile, \u201cobserved it to be operating erratically,\u201d and pulled it over. The backseat passenger, who had been seen entering 50C Memorial Road, was found in possession of cocaine, and arrested. After reciting the Miranda warnings, see <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), Spinney asked the passenger about 50C Memorial Road. Spinney reported the answer in his affidavit as follows: \u201c[The person arrested] stated that he had just purchased cocaine on [szc] the 2nd-floor apartment at 50C Memorial Road. <em>He stated that the apartment was above No. 17. </em>He also stated that the apartment was the front apartment [and] <em>his description of the location matched the description given to me by the reliable informant. </em>He stated that on the front door was a yellow bumper sticker stating \u2018Make My Day.\u2019 He stated that there was no number on the door.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Based on the foregoing information, Spinney concluded that he had probable cause to search the second-floor front apartment, \u201cabove No. 17,\u201d at 50C Memorial Road in Somerville. A District Court judge agreed and issued a warrant authorizing an immediate search of \u201cthe front apartment on the 2nd floor above apartment #17 located at 50C Memorial Road . . . having a yellow bumper sticker on it stating \u2018Make My Day. \u2019 \u201d Pursuant to this warrant, the police searched Treadwell\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The configuration of the apartments on the second floor at 50C Memorial Road, Somerville, is as follows. There are three apartments on the second floor, two of which are \u201cfront\u201d apartments facing the street. The Commonwealth concedes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Treadwell\u2019s apartment, which is a front apartment on the second floor, is <em>not </em>the apartment directly above apartment no. 17; Treadwell\u2019s apartment is above no. 16. Each apartment on the second floor has its own door.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The judge found as a fact that the only door bearing a bumper sticker with the words \u201cMake My Day\u201d is the door to Tread-well\u2019s apartment which, as already noted, is <em>not </em>the apartment \u201cabove number 17.\u201d The door also has a nameplate bearing the name \u201cTreadwell.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge also found that the warrant specifically described and authorized a search only of the apartment directly above number 17. Accordingly, the judge excluded the evidence obtained during the search of Tread-well\u2019s apartment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The Commonwealth does not contest the fact that a warrant must describe particularly the place to be searched. The particularity requirement is statutory, see G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a71,2 (1986 ed.), as well as constitutional. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>399 Mass. 141, 143-145 (1987). \u201c[T]he particularity requirements of G. L. c. 276 essentially track the particularity requirements of art. 14 [of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth] and the Fourth Amendment [to the United States Constitution].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>394 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Mass. 381, 389 (1985).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The issue here is \u201cwhether the description is sufficient to enable the executing officer to locate and identify the premises with reasonable effort, and whether there is any reasonable probability that another premises might be mistakenly searched which is not the one intended to be searched under the search warrant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rugaber, </em>369 Mass. 765, 768 (1976), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sklaroff, </em>323 F. Supp. 296, 321 (S.D. Fla. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the \u201cabove No. 17\u201d language in the warrant is a minor misdescription which does not render the warrant invalid as to Treadwell\u2019s apartment. We do not agree. The affidavit contains information from two informants, both of whom specifically and unmistakably locate the apartment to be searched \u201cdirectly above No. 17.\u201d Significantly, the location of the apartment is the only consistent information from both informants.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We therefore cannot treat this information as irrelevant or inadvertent.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The Commonwealth seeks to salvage the warrant by arguing that \u201cthe knowledge of officers on the scene eliminated any danger of a mistaken search of the wrong apartment.\u201d Although the Commonwealth correctly notes that the knowledge of the executing officers can be a relevant consideration in resolving noncrucial ambiguities in a warrant, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rugaber, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Petrone, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 914 (1983); <em>Commonwealth v. Demogenes, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 577, 581 (1982), \u201cpolice may not expand the warrant beyond those facts known to them.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Cefalo, </em>381 Mass. 319, 329 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The record in this case fails to reveal that the police had knowledge of facts sufficient to overcome the ambiguity in the in the warrant. The affidavit does not indicate that the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>knew the name of the occupant of the apartment to be searched. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>In addition, neither the affidavit nor the testimony at the hearing demonstrates that the police had familiarity with the floor plan of the building. They did not know which apartment was no. 17, and made no attempt to locate that apartment. Moreover, although the affidavit states that Spinney saw the man in the white coat enter \u201cthe\u201d front apartment, that information does not contradict the informant\u2019s specific, corroborated statement that he purchased cocaine in the front apartment \u201cabove No. 17.\u201d This is not a case in which the police gained familiarity with the premises through direct observation and then inadvertently misdescribed the premises in an affidavit. The police were given specific information, recorded it accurately, and then searched a different apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The present case is distinguishable from those cited by the Commonwealth in which searches conducted pursuant to arguably ambiguous warrants were upheld. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rugaber, supra, </em>the warrant included the proper street address of the house to be searched and a description of the exterior of the building. The description, however, matched the house next door. Because the correct street address was used, we concluded that the warrant \u201cwas not inadequate on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 769. Further, in <em>Rugaber, </em>it was relevant that police officers on the scene had staked-out the correct house, knew its precise location, and could not possibly mistake it for a separate, free-standing structure. The danger of error was reduced even further because the search occurred at night when the inadvertent misdescription never became apparent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>In the present case, by contrast, the independently corroborated location of the apartment did not match the apartment searched; the police were unfamiliar with the interior floor plan of the building; their observations of the exterior of the building did not isolate with certainty which apartment or apartments the man in the white coat entered; and neither the warrant nor the affidavit indicated that the police knew the identity of the occupant of the apartment to be searched. The specificity of the apartment\u2019s location in the warrant and the location of the bumper sticker on a different apartment door created an obvious ambiguity in the description of the place to be searched. In effect, the warrant left the police with discretion to choose between the apartment directly above no. 17 and the apartment with the bumper sticker on the door, even though probable cause existed to search only one apartment. In these circumstances, we conclude that the warrant failed to describe adequately the premises to be searched, as required by G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2. Thus, the judge properly allowed the motions to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\"> Patricia Treadwell also is charged with illegal possession of two firearms. G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(h) </em>(1986 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b370-9\"> On appeal, the Commonwealth also raises the argument that, even if the warrant is invalid, the evidence should be admitted under the so-called good faith exception to the warrant requirement under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897 (1984). At the hearing on the motions to suppress, the parties limited the issue to misidentification of the premises. The judge specifically ruled that the issue of good faith of the officers and probable cause would be reserved by him. Thus, these issues were not decided and are not properly before us. We add that we have not adopted the <em>Leon </em>good faith exception under art. 14 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. In some contexts, we recognize that art. 14 affords more substantive protection to criminal defendants than prevails under the Federal Constitution. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 373 (1985). Whether we would adopt the good faith exception in a proper case is not determined in today\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\"> The Commonwealth offered testimony at the suppression hearing that the original informant had given the name \u201cTreadwell\u201d to the police and that Spinney and his partner believed at all times they were authorized to search the Treadwell apartment. However, the name \u201cTreadwell\u201d does not appear in the affidavit, and the space on the warrant for the name of the occupant was left blank. Thus, the judge correctly concluded, \u201cwe do not have a case in which the warrant authorized the search of an apartment in the premises occupied by Treadwell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Under G. L. c. 276, we repeat that, on motions to suppress, \u201cthe judge may consider only the affidavit or affidavits presented to the magistrate.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Germain, </em>396 Mass. 413, 415 n.4 (1985). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monosson, </em>351 Mass. 327, 330 (1966). Subsequent oral testimony cannot be relied on to establish probable cause, id., or to expand the officer\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b372-9\"> The motions to suppress relied on the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth, and violation of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3. The judge excluded the evidence \u201c[i]n accordance with [his] reading of the Constitutions, statute, and cases . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\"> No argument was made below and none is made in this court that art. 14 grants greater protection or requires greater particularity than the Fourth Amendment. We therefore do not discuss art. 14 separately. We leave that issue open.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\"> The first informant stated that the apartment was \u201cdirectly above No. 17.\u201d The second informant\u2019s \u201cdescription of the location matched the description given to [Spinney] by the reliable informant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\"> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Petrone, supra, </em>the Appeals Court never reached the issue of misdescription of the location of the apartment as on the \u201cleft hand side,\u201d when it actually was on the <em>right </em>hand side. <em>Id. </em>at 915. The defendant, who was named and described in the warrant, was arrested before the warrant was executed. After arrest, he led the police to the correct apartment and admitted them. In those circumstances, there was no possibility of searching the wrong apartment. In the present case, the police did not know the identity of the occupant of the premises to be searched, and no one led them to the correct apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Demogenes, supra, </em>there was no ambiguity on the face of the warrant. The address was correct, and the location of the apartment was specified. <em>Id. </em>at 579. In addition, the executing officers knew the</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>identity of the defendant, as well as the occupant of the correct apartment. <em>Id. </em>at 578. The fact that the police initially knocked on the wrong, unmarked door in the building did not render the warrant deficient. Based on the information known to them at the time, the police were able to proceed quickly to the premises designated in the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">In <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>380 U.S. 79 (1987), the police knew the identity of the occupant of the premises to be searched, and were led by him to his third-floor apartment. <em>Id. </em>at 81. See <em>Petrone, supra. </em>The police made prior inquiries to determine whether \u201cthe third floor apartment\u201d described in the warrant was divided into multiple units, and received reliable \u2014 albeit incorrect \u2014 information that it was not. <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Garrison, supra </em>at 85 n.10. In addition, only one locked door opened onto the third floor. The United States Supreme Court concluded that the police neither knew <em>nor reasonably should have known </em>that there were two separate dwelling units on the third floor. <em>Id. </em>at 84-89. As a result, the com! held the search of both units valid. In the present case, the ambiguity of multiple front apartments \u2014 one above no. 17, and the other with a bumper sticker on the door \u2014 was readily and objectively apparent to the police. Moreover, as the judge found, neither the police nor the assistant district attorney accompanying them made any attempt to determine whether the apartment searched was the apartment above no. 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Nolan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJj\">(dissenting). I dissent. The trial judge erroneously allowed the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress. The warrant and accompanying affidavit described the premises with sufficient details to meet the constitutional muster. The fact that the apartment was misdescribed should not be fatal because Tread-well\u2019s apartment was the only apartment which sported a bumper sticker of any description. The officers acted in good faith. This is just another example of the court\u2019s straining for gnats in applying a very dubious exclusionary rule. It runs counter to good sense.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b376-4\">O\u2019Connor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS\">(dissenting, with whom Lynch, J., joins). I would reverse the judge\u2019s allowance of the defendants\u2019 motion to suppress, and I would remand for further findings with regard to the following questions: (1) Were the officers who executed the warrant unaware, at that time, of the ambiguity of the description in the warrant as it applied to the physical facts? (2) Based on information in addition to the description in the warrant, did the executing officers possess sufficient knowledge concerning the apartment to which the warrant was intended to apply to eliminate any danger of a mistaken search of the wrong apartment? The teaching of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rugaber, </em>369 Mass. 765 (1976), is that affirmative answers to those questions would require denial of the motion to suppress. There is no significant distinction between <em>Rugaber </em>and this case, and <em>Rugaber </em>was rightly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In <em>Rugaber, </em>this court held that evidence of the fruits of a search conducted pursuant to a facially adequate, but ambiguous, warrant, by officers with first hand knowledge of what premises were intended to be governed by the warrant, should not be suppressed. In that case, the warrant ordered a search of \u201c#3, Fenwick St., Springfield, a two story wooden frame dwelling, color red &amp; grey.\u201d Number 3 Fenwick Street was a brick house with a green porch. The house next door was red, grey, and wooden. The officers who obtained the warrant executed it. They searched No. 3 Fenwick Street. They did so at night and were unaware of the discrepancy in house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>descriptions. <em>Id. </em>at 767. The officers \u201cwere not reckless; at most they were negligent in this respect.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">In <em>Rugaber, supra </em>at 768, the motion judge \u201cconcluded that an officer attempting to execute the warrant with no information other than the description contained within it and the attached affidavit would \u2018most assuredly\u2019 have invaded the wrong property.\u201d This court observed that \u201c[pjerhaps it would be more accurate to say that the warrant was ambiguous in its description of the property to be searched.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is precisely the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The court reasoned in <em>Rugaber, supra </em>at 769, as follows: \u201cThe description here was not inadequate on its face. The executing officers did not become aware of its ambiguity as applied to the physical facts, and they were not reckless in this respect. They had probable cause to search No. 3 Fenwick Street, the address was a sufficient description if the erroneous references to color and type of building material were disregarded, <em>and the knowledge of the officers on the scene eliminated any danger that there might be a mistaken search of the premises next door. </em>In these circumstances we agree with the judge, who ruled that even if the warrant was defective, the exclusionary rule should not be applied, since it could have no deterrent effect.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">In the present case, too, the warrant was adequate on its face, for it described with particularity, although inaccurately, the place to be searched. However, as in <em>Rugaber, </em>the description in the warrant was ambiguous. It described the apartment to be searched as being located over apartment no. 17 and displaying a \u201cMake My Day\u201d sticker on its door, while only one apartment actually displayed such a sticker and a different apartment was over apartment no. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The judge made no finding with respect to whether the officers were aware of the ambiguity when they executed the warrant, but the evidence strongly suggests they were not. Nothing in the evidence suggests that the officers acted recklessly in this respect. Furthermore, the officers had probable cause to search the defendant\u2019s apartment and, as in <em>Rugaber, </em>the description in the warrant was sufficient if \u201cthe erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>references to [location over apartment no. 17] were disregarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Most importantly, there was an abundance of evidence presented at the suppression hearing in this case that \u201cthe knowledge of the officers on the scene eliminated any danger that there might be a mistaken search of the [apartment over apartment no. 17].\u201d Two officers, who applied for the warrant and executed it, testified. Their testimony would have warranted findings that, on January 17, 1986, the officers were in a parked vehicle, engaged in surveillance, when they observed another vehicle drive up to the building at 50C Memorial Road. They watched an individual alight from the vehicle, take money from his pocket, and enter the building. Because the window shades were up, they could see into the apartment on \u201cthe second floor, upper right.\u201d That is the apartment with the \u201cMake My Day\u201d sticker on its door that they ultimately searched. They watched the individual enter and leave the apartment and return to the vehicle in which he had come. The officers followed that vehicle to another location and, when it stopped, they approached it and found the individual, whom they had seen enter and leave the apartment, holding glossine bags containing a white powdery substance. They arrested and talked to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">According to the testimony, the individual described the defendant\u2019s apartment, including its location on the second floor at the upper right of the building as one faces the building from the street. In addition, there was testimony that, before they approached the defendant\u2019s apartment to search it, the officers had been told that the apartment they wanted to search and to which the warrant was intended to apply belonged to Patricia Treadwell. Then, when they arrived at the apartment, they saw the name Treadwell on the door. There was also evidence that the officers gained entry by saying, \u201cCraig sent me.\u201d Upon the saying of those words, the door to the apartment was immediately opened by Michael Treadwell. They did not know his name, but he fit a description given to the officers by the individual whom they had seen in that apartment and arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Nothing in the record suggests that the judge rejected any of the suppression hearing testimony as lacking credibility. Rather, it appears that he disregarded it as irrelevant. However, the evidence as to the officers\u2019 lack of awareness of the ambiguity in the description in the warrant, as well as the evidence concerning the officers\u2019 knowledge concerning the proper apartment to search, was highly relevant. If believed in substantial part, the evidence demonstrates that, even if the warrant was defective, the exclusionary rule should not be applied because it would not deter the type of police misconduct the rule was designed to deter. That is the teaching of <em>Rugaber, </em>and it is sound. I would reverse the order below, and remand for further findings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
