Lapointe, was indicted by a Bristol County grand jury for the murder in the first degree of Edward LeBlanc. Following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of manslaughter and was sentenced to not less than fifteen years nor more than eighteen years at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution (MCI), Cedar Junction. On appeal, the defendant claims: the judge erred in permitting witnesses to testify as to the deceased\u2019s reputation for peacefulness; the judge erred in excluding evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s post-traumatic stress disorder; the judge erred in his instruction on consciousness of guilt and made several errors in instructions on self-defense; the prosecutor made improper comments during his closing argument; and the judge improperly sentenced the defendant. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>The facts that the jury could have found on the evidence before them are as follows. On January 12, 1984, the defendant telephoned the home of his ex-wife, Susan, to inquire about the delivery of Christmas presents to their daughter, Jamie. Susan and Jamie were living with, and Susan was engaged to be married to, Edward LeBlanc. LeBlanc answered the telephone and spoke to the defendant. LeBlanc was \u201ca little angry,\u201d \u201cupset,\u201d and \u201csick of the situation\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when he left Susan to go to the defendant\u2019s house to talk with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">The defendant was living with Linda Canuel and her daughter, Melissa, in the third-floor apartment of a three-family dwelling. Following his telephone conversation with LeBlanc, the defendant took a tranquilizer or \u201cstomach\u201d pill and lay down on the sofa. Canuel and the defendant anticipated that LeBlanc was coming to the house. Canuel was watching from a window for his arrival. She saw LeBlanc park his automobile about two houses away and heard some glass being broken.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Canuel heard LeBlanc come into the house and ascend the stairs. She told the defendant that LeBlanc was coming. He got his loaded Walther 380 automatic gun and placed it in the waistband of his pants. Canuel went with her daughter to the daughter\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">LeBlanc pounded on the front door of the defendant\u2019s apartment. Canuel left the bedroom and urged the defendant to open the door. Canuel never saw a gun. When the defendant unlocked the deadbolt and opened the door, an \u201cenraged\u201d LeBlanc rushed in, his arms in the air. LeBlanc said, \u201cYou die,---,\u201d and advanced on the defendant. Canuel fled into the bathroom. She heard shots fired. When she emerged from the bathroom, the defendant told her to call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The police arrived at the apartment and found LeBlanc\u2019s body on the floor of the living room, covered by a blanket. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>knife was in LeBlanc\u2019s right hand. There were not signs of a straggle in the apartment. The defendant showed the officers a badge, said he was a constable, and had just shot the man on the floor. The defendant said that LeBlanc had come \u201ccharging in with the knife,\u201d and that he had shot him a few times and then shot \u201csome more to make sure he was dead . . . because that\u2019s what they taught him in \u2019Nam.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The defendant told the police about the problems he had been having with his ex-wife and her boy friend, about the telephone call preceding LeBlanc\u2019s arrival, that he had been afraid of LeBlanc, and that, when LeBlanc burst into the apartment, the defendant \u201csaw the flash of something shiny.\u201d When interrupted by the police and told that the police could determine whether the knife had been placed in LeBlanc\u2019s hand,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the defendant admitted putting the knife in LeBlanc\u2019s hand. The defendant also said that he was heavily medicated and was being treated at the Veteran\u2019s Administration Hospital for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The defendant indicated that, when Canuel told him that LeBlanc had parked his automobile, he had gotten his weapon. After LeBlanc came through the door, the defendant shot him, first in the arm and then in the chest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">At trial, the defense was self-defense. The jury returned a verdict, finding the defendant guilty of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">1. The defendant contends that the judge erred in permitting prosecution witnesses to testify over objection as to the victim\u2019s reputation in the community for peacefulness. The defendant asserts that the issue of the victim\u2019s reputation was not raised by the defense, and there was no evidence that the defendant knew of the victim\u2019s reputation. The Commonwealth counters that the defense opened the door to evidence of the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>reputation during opening statements and during the cross-examination of the first of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">A defendant who claims he killed in self-defense may offer evidence of a victim\u2019s reputation as a violent and quarrelsome person. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>368 Mass. 518, 526 (1975), and cases cited therein. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>356 Mass. 617, 625-626, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 843 (1970). However, the evidence of the victim\u2019s reputation is relevant only if the defendant knew of the reputation at the time of the crime. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tircinski, </em>189 Mass. 257, 258 (1905). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, supra </em>at 626. P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 415 (5th ed. 1981 &amp; Supp. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Once the defense has opened the door as to the issue of the victim\u2019s character, the prosecution can, on rebuttal, introduce evidence of the victim\u2019s reputation in the community for peacefulness. 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 246 (Chadbourn rev. 1979). At the time the question regarding the victim\u2019s reputation for peacefulness was posed by the prosecutor on redirect, there was no evidence indicating that the defendant knew of the victim\u2019s reputation. Furthermore, before reputation for peacefulness is admissible, the defense must open the door by presenting <em>some evidence </em>of the victim\u2019s violent character. Opening statements by the defense attorney are not evidence, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>346 Mass. 482, 486 (1963); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fazio, </em>375 Mass. 451, 454-455 (1978), and the questions posed during cross-examination by defense counsel<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> did not open the issue of the victim\u2019s character. Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>judge erred in allowing the testimony about the victim\u2019s reputation for peacefulness. The error, however, was not prejudicial. Our review of the record as a whole, omitting the reputation testimony, indicates that the evidence to convict the defendant of manslaughter was overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">2. The defendant argues that the judge erred in excluding evidence that the defendant suffered from PTSD. Before trial, the defendant filed a notice pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 14, as amended, 385 Mass. 1213 (1982), that the defendant would \u201coffer expert testimony that ... at the time the first shot was fired . . . and that from the moment the first shot was fired the Defendant suffered . . . Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, chronic with intrusive recollections; that such evidence shall be offered as it is relevant to the issue of post-homicide consciousness of guilt, [reflexive] acts, and other actions of the Defendant occurring subsequent to the shooting.\u201d During motion hearings in the absence of the jury, defense counsel argued that the experts on PTSD would testify as to \u201cwhy so many shots may have been fired into the victim rather than just one .... That the state of mind because of the stress disorder, the multiple shots were reflexive acts rather than evidence of deliberation and premeditation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The judge stated: \u201cI <em>would be inclined </em>to exclude any evidence of this Vietnam syndrome except as it pertains to evidence of consciousness of guilt after the incident took place\u201d (emphasis added). Later, the judge said: \u201cPerhaps we can have a voir dire on your psychiatrist. ... I would be <em>tending </em>to exclude [the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony as to PTSD] insofar as it pertains to the general issue of self-defense and number of bullets\u201d (emphasis added). Still later, the judge stated: \u201cI would be ruling that if it\u2019s admissible at all, it\u2019s admissible on the issue of consciousness of guilt.\u201d The prosecutor then requested a voir dire before the defendant\u2019s opening statement to \u201chave the Court at that time make a judgment on whether or not the [PTSD] testimony is admissible and to what extent it\u2019s admissible.\u201d The Commonwealth also filed a motion in limine seeking to prevent the introduction of PTSD evidence. The following day, the judge asked defense counsel whether his PTSD experts would be available. Defense counsel informed the judge that he had not called them in and assured the judge that the subject would not come up during opening statements. No further action was taken by defense counsel, and the subject of PTSD was not pursued at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Although the issue was discussed, the judge was never called upon to rule whether PTSD evidence would, or would not, be allowed. The judge made a number of preliminary statements as to what his ruling might be, but the issue was never presented directly by the defendant to the judge. No witnesses were brought to testify, no voir dire was held, and no offer of proof was made. Because there was no ruling by the judge on this issue, there is nothing for this court to review. See <em>Commonwealth v. Zion, </em>359 Mass. 559, 564 (1971). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mulica, </em>401 Mass. 812 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">3. The defendant takes issue with the self-defense instructions given in this case. Specifically, the defendant contends that the instructions shifted the burden of proof, erroneously defined the duty to retreat, and erroneously defined excessive force. The defendant did not make objections to the first two alleged errors in the instructions, and so we review them to determine whether the charge created a substantial risk of a mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>carriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Germain, </em>396 Mass. 413, 419 (1985). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, 352 </em>Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967). The defendant argues that the judge .relieved the Commonwealth of its burden to prove the absence of self-defense. The defendant points to the portion of the instructions where the judge instructed the jury what to do should they <em>\u201c'find, </em>that there was a.right of self-defense\u201d (emphasis added). It was error for the judge to so instruct. <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>377 Mass. 527, 533-535 (1979). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>370 Mass. 684, 690-691 (1976). However, looking at the instructions as a whole, we conclude that no risk of a miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>391 Mass. 853, 858-859 (1984). The judge instructed the jury three times at the beginning of the self-defense instruction and twice after the instructions that the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense. Furthermore, the judge correctly instructed that, if the jury had \u201creasonable doubt whether or not the defendant acted in self-defense, the verdict is now not guilty.\u201d Like the instructions in <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>and <em>Connolly, supra, </em>the judge made an unfortunate choice of words during an insignificant portion of the instructions, but, unlike those cases, the judge made it clear that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The defendant also raises, for the first time on appeal, the judge\u2019s instruction as to the duty, in self-defense cases, to retreat from an assailant lawfully in the defendant\u2019s home. The judge instructed the jury that the defendant had no obligation to retreat from a person unlawfully in the defendant\u2019s dwelling, but, if the person was lawfully on the premises, then the defendant had a duty to retreat. In response to a jury question during deliberations, the judge further instructed the jury: \u201cThe right to use deadly force by way of self-defense is not available to one threatened until he has availed himself of all reasonable and proper means in the circumstances to avoid combat. And this rule has equal application to one assaulted or threatened in his home by a lawful visitor.\u201d The defendant asserts that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Legislature, in enacting G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 8A,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> from which the judge drew the instructions on duty to retreat, intended to permit a person to respond to a life-threatening assault from a lawful visitor in one\u2019s home. The language of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 8A, does not support the defendant\u2019s claim. Nothing in the statute eliminates the duty to retreat from a person <em>lawfully </em>on the premises. Additionally, the defense counsel indicated that he was content with this instruction. There was no error. The judge properly instructed the jury on the duty to retreat.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">The defendant also takes issue with the instructions regarding the use of excessive force in self-defense. Without getting into the merits of the defendant\u2019s arguments, we note that the defendant was indicted for murder in the first degree but convicted of manslaughter. The importance of the instruction on the use of excessive force in self-defense is that the use of excessive force in self-defense warrants a conviction of manslaughter. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burbank, </em>388 Mass. 789, 795 (1983). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>351 Mass. 203, 211 (1966). Here, unlike the case in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>374 Mass. 583, 594 n.7 (1978), the judge explained excessive force adequately. Although the judge failed to refer to the \u201cinfirmity of human impulses and passions\u201d <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendrick, supra, </em>quoting <em>Monize </em>v. <em>Begaso, </em>190 Mass. 87, 89 [1906]), he used words which adequately conveyed this concept to the jury, as to the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the encounter. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>4. For the first time on appeal, the defendant raises the issue of the propriety of the instructions on consciousness of guilt.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We review the issue to see if there exists a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. The defendant asserts that the instruction did not comply with the requirements for consciousness of guilt instructions set out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toney, </em>385 Mass. 575, 585 (1982): \u201cWe think that a judge should instruct the jury (1) that they are not to convict a defendant on the basis of evidence of flight or concealment alone (see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>368 Mass. 126, 129 [1975]), and (2) that they may, but need not, consider such evidence as one of the factors tending to prove the guilt of the defendant. We do not think it necessary, as suggested by the defendant, that the judge bring to the attention of the jury the defendant\u2019s own innocent explanation for the alleged flight, although the judge may in his discretion do so. A general instruction of the type outlined above will suffice.\u201d The instructions given in this case satisfied the second prong of <em>Toney, </em>but, arguably, not the first. The Commonwealth, however, points out that the judge\u2019s instruction that evidence of consciousness of guilt was \u201cadmissible as evidence <em>tending </em>to prove guilt <em>along </em>with <em>all other </em>evidence\u201d was sufficient to meet the <em>Toney </em>standard (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nadworny, 396 </em>Mass. 342, 371 (1985), cert. denied, <em>All </em>U.S. 904 (1986). We agree. As stated in <em>Nadworny, supra, </em>\u201cthe instruction contained the substance of what we required in <em>Toney.\" </em>In light of the substantial evidence presented to the jury, aside from that evidence indicating consciousness of guilt, on which a manslaughter verdict could have been based, there was no danger that the jury based their verdict solely on the defendant\u2019s actions after the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">5. We next consider the defendant\u2019s claims regarding prosecutorial misconduct. Although no objection was made at the time, the defendant now claims prejudice because the prosecutor, during closing argument, allegedly vouched for a witness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>urged the jury to draw improper inferences, suggested a union between jury and prosecution in the search for truth, and sought sympathy for the victim. At the outset, we note that the judge properly instructed the jury that the arguments of counsel were not evidence but \u201csimply attempts by two lawyers ... to try to persuade [the jury] to certain conclusions on behalf of [the people] that they represent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">We see no error in the prosecutor\u2019s argument that it took \u201ccourage\u201d and \u201ccharacter\u201d for Shirley LePage to testify and that the witness had the prosecutor\u2019s respect. The prosecutor did not comment, from personal knowledge, on the credibilty of a witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, </em>401 Mass. 749, 760 (1988). Similarly, we see no error in the prosecutor\u2019s comments about the defendant. When considered in context,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the prosecutor\u2019s statements do not impugn unfairly the defendant\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s statements which, according to the defendant, created improper sympathy for the victim, were all based on evidence properly admitted at trial. The victim was employed and about to be married to the woman carrying his child. The defendant was unemployed and taking many medications. In closing arguments, \u201c[c]ounsel for each party is permitted and expected to marshal the evidence and to argue for a decision of the controversy in favor of his client. This process often involves pointing out not only the strength of his client\u2019s case, but also the weakness of that of his opponent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>374 Mass. 453, 459 (1978). Nothing in the prosecutor\u2019s argument amounted to an improper appeal for sympathy.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The defendant\u2019s last claim of prosecutorial misconduct alleges that the prosecutor prejudicially provoked a highly emotional response from Susan when he showed her a photograph of the victim\u2019s body as it lay on the defendant\u2019s apartment floor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>After Susan broke into tears, the judge, sua sponte, ordered a recess. Defense counsel moved for a mistrial which the judge denied. Before adjourning for the day, the judge instructed the jurors that they should not \u201cbe affected at all by emotional outburst, justified or not justified.\u201d The defendant contends that the judge abused his discretion in refusing to grant the motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Defense counsel conceded at trial that the photograph had probative value and could have been admitted through many other witnesses. The judge found that the outburst was one \u201cwhich might have been expected or unexpected.\u201d The fact that the evidence was admissible and the witness\u2019s response was not found to be expected, combined with the immediate recess called by the judge and the strong curative instruction, evince no abuse of discretion and no prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">6. The final allegation of error by the defendant raises the issue of the sentence the defendant received. The defendant was sentenced to not less than fifteen and not more than eighteen years at MCI, Cedar Junction. The sentence imposed was within the applicable statutory provision. The judge\u2019s comments at the time of sentencing do not indicate that the defendant was sentenced for a crime other than the offense for which he was convicted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franks, </em>365 Mass. 74, 81 (1974). The judge stated that he was \u201cnot deviating at all from that verdict. I accept that verdict.\u201d The sentence imposed was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-9\"> Following their divorce, the relationship between Susan and the defendant was described by her testimony as \u201cdisagreeable.\u201d They had frequent arguments over money and the defendant\u2019s visitation rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b337-10\"> The windshield of the defendant\u2019s automobile was smashed on the evening of the homicide.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b338-8\"> The results of the autopsy showed six bullet wounds: one to the right temporal region; one to the right ear; one to the right side of the neck; one to the right upper chest; one to the middle chest; and one to the back of the right arm above the elbow. Seven discharged cartridge casings were found at the scene of the homicide.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\"> In later statements to the police the defendant also admitted that the knife was his.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b339-9\"> The Commonwealth claims that the following colloquy which took place during the defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the first prosecution witness opened the issue of the victim\u2019s character.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">The defense counsel: \u201cHow long had [the victim] been taking karate lessons?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-11\">The witness: \u201cBefore I met him and afterwards, after I knew him,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-12\">I would say three years before I met him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-13\">The defense counsel: \u201cSo, he had been taking karate lessons so far as you knew about ten years?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-14\">The witness: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-15\">The defense counsel: \u201cDid he ever tell you his level of expertise</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>at karate?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">The witness: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">The defense counsel: \u201cWhat was it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">The witness: \u201cWell, when I met him, he had a black belt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">The defense counsel: \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-11\">The witness: \u201cThat\u2019s \u2014 That means he\u2019s been studying it for a long time and he was pretty good.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-12\">The defense counsel: \u201cYou mean, you could be pretty destructive when you have a black belt, is that what you mean?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-13\">The witness: \u201cYou could.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-14\">There is nothing in this colloquy that goes either to the reputation of the victim in the community for turbulence and violence, or that relates to the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the victim\u2019s reputation.
