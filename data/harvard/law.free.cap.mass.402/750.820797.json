The plaintiffs challenge the Attorney General\u2019s certification of an initiative petition pursuant to art. 48 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth. Art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs also seek to prevent the Secretary of the Commonwealth from having the initiative measure placed on the ballot in the upcoming State election. See art. 48, The Initiative, IV, \u00a7 5. The single justice reserved and reported the case for consideration by the full court on the parties\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">On July 28, 1987, the initiative petition at issue in this case was submitted to the Attorney General pursuant to art. 48, The Initiative, n, \u00a7 3. The petition, entitled \u201cThe Stop Nuclear Waste Act\u201d by its proponents, would, after July 4, 1989, prohibit \u201cgeneration of electric power by commercial nuclear power plants in the Commonwealth by means which result in the production of nuclear waste.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Attorney General is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>required by art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 3, to certify, inter alla, that petitions submitted to him contain only matters not excluded from the initiative process by art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Among the matters excluded from the initiative are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>propositions \u201cinconsistent with . . . the right to receive compensation for private property appropriated to public use.\u201d The propriety of the Attorney General\u2019s certification of the petition in the face of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that it contained this excluded matter, and the extent of the Attorney General\u2019s fact-finding obligations in the certification process, are the central issues in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">It is undisputed that the plaintiff Yankee Atomic Electric Company and amicus Boston Edison Company (the utilities) separately own and operate the only two nuclear reactors in the Commonwealth. When the Attorney General was considering whether to certify the petition, the utilities argued that the petition should not be certified because it would effect a taking of their property. If, as the utilities argue, the petition effects a taking of their property, its failure also to provide for compensation would make it \u201cinconsistent with\u201d the right to such compensation, see <em>Bromfield </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>390 Mass. 665, 668-669 (1983), quoting <em>Haverhill Bridge Proprietors </em>v. <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Essex, </em>103 Mass. 120, 124-125 (1869) (the act effecting a taking \u201cmust provide for compensation, and a ready means of ascertaining the amount\u201d), and the Attorney General should not have certified to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The Attorney General\u2019s letter to the Secretary of the Commonwealth, certifying the petition, does not indicate what facts he considered in concluding that the petition does not contain an excluded matter, i.e., is not \u201cinconsistent with ... the right to receive compensation for private property appropriated to public use.\u201d The parties have stipulated as follows: \u201c[T]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Attorney General did not engage in a factual analysis to determine what effect the initiative might have on the two currently existing commercial electric nuclear power plants in Massachusetts, if it were passed into law. He did not engage in a factual analysis to attempt to determine the economic value of the two existing nuclear power plants before or after passage of the Petition. . . . The Attorney General takes the position in this litigation that the putative facts proffered by the plaintiffs to establish a taking by way of inverse condemnation are not ascertainable at this stage and/or have no relevance to the certification issue here presented. Accordingly, no stipulations of fact concerning the value of the Yankee plant, the reasonable investment backed expectations of its owners, its value after enactment of the Petition, the availability and/or form of compensation or any alternative uses of electrical power plants have been entered. Plaintiffs contend that if a fact based inquiry had been conducted at the certification stage or were conducted now, it would establish an inverse condemnation of the Yankee Rowe plant without providing compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Before turning to the central issue of the extent of the Attorney General\u2019s fact-finding obligations, if any, in the certification process, two preliminary contentions can be resolved. First, the Attorney General contends that the corporate plaintiff, Yankee Atomic Electric Company lacks standing to maintain this action. Because the named individual plaintiffs do possess standing, we need not determine this argument\u2019s merits. See <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 209, 214-215 (1981), citing <em>Save the Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>366 Mass. 667 , 674-675 (1975). Second, the plaintiffs argue that the petition, assuming it effects a taking, is void, independent of the certification requirement of art. 48, because art. 10 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth provides that takings, even if compensated, can be authorized only by the Legislature. However, arguments regarding the validity of an initiative petition, not based on failure to comply with art. 48, cannot be pursued unless and until the measure has been enacted. See <em>Paisner v. Attorney Gen., </em>390 Mass. 593, 597 (1983), quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number><em>Bowe </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>320 Mass. 230, 246-247 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">That the Attorney General should not ignore the \u201cfactual impact\u201d of a petition, as he has stipulated he did here, in mating his certification determination is clear from general legal principles, from the judicial decisions construing art. 48, from the article\u2019s language, and from the debates surrounding its adoption. In <em>Paisner, supra </em>at 597, involving the Attorney General\u2019s certification that a petition was in proper form, the court noted that the initiative petition places \u201cseveral responsibilities upon the Attorney General which require the exercise of his discretion and legal judgment.\u201d Exercise of legal judgment involves, to some extent at least, applying legal principles to facts even when considering \u201cpure\u201d questions of law. For example, when determining whether a statute is overbroad in a First Amendment context, a number of supposed sets of facts are considered to determine if the statute impermissibly would reach them.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Moving beyond general principles, decisions reviewing certification by the Attorney General that a petition does not contain excluded subjects indicate that this court has considered the factual impact of petitions in conducting its review. In <em>Bowe </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>320 Mass. 230, 248-253 (1946), involving restrictions on political campaign spending, the court concluded the petition at issue was not \u201cinconsistent with\u201d the right to freedom of elections because it did not impair \u201cthe freedom of a voter to express his choice as to men or measures . . . [and it] would tend to increase the freedom of elections by removing influences upon the voter that the use of money can bring to bear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249. The court made similar determinations regarding the impact of the petition in addressing assertions that the petition, in various sections, contained excluded subjects because of its inconsistency with other rights. See also <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>309 Mass. 571, 584-587 (1941) (impact on Legislature\u2019s general supervision of the public treasury is considered in determining if petition contained excluded subject in that it called for a specific appropriation of funds); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>300 Mass. 602, 606-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>607 (1938) (court assesses impact on owners\u2019 real property interests in determining that petition contained only a reasonable police power regulation); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>294 Mass. 607, 609 (1936) (petition\u2019s language limiting its application to towns with more than 12,000 inhabitants indicates that it contained an excluded subject for its operation is restricted to particular localities); <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>269 Mass. 503, 509-513 (1929) (petition\u2019s impact considered in rejecting argument that petition contained excluded subjects).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">That the court reviews the factual impact of a petition, in determining if the Attorney General\u2019s certification decision was proper, logically indicates that the Attorney General should also consider the factual impact in maiding the initial certification decision. In <em>Paisner, supra </em>at 598, the court cited instances where it had previously quashed certifications regarding proper form on the ground that a petition did not propose a law, and concluded that the Attorney General, in certifying later petitions as to form, has the duty to exercise his legal judgment to determine that they do propose a law. Thus, the Attorney General should use the same approach in certifying a petition that the court will use in reviewing his decision. See <em>Amherst </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>398 Mass. 793, 795-797 (1986) (in determining whether by-laws are \u201cinconsistent with\u201d general laws, Attorney General is guided by same principles as the court). As noted above, the court\u2019s approach has been to consider a petition\u2019s factual impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The language of art. 48 also indicates that the Attorney General should consider a petition\u2019s factual impact in determining whether to certify that a petition does not contain excluded subjects. Article 48 provides that the Attorney General is to file received petitions with the Secretary of the Commonwealth if the Attorney General \u201cshall <em>certify </em>that . . . [the petition] contains only subjects not excluded from the popular initiative . . .\u201d (emphasis added). Art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 3. As the plaintiffs argue, it is appropriate to construe the language of constitutional amendments in accordance with the language\u2019s familiar and plain meaning. See <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>371 Mass. 195, 199 (1976), quoting <em>Yont v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number><em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>275 Mass. 365, 366 (1931) (having been approved by the voters, constitutional amendments should be \u201cconstrued according to the familiar and approved usage of the language\u201d). A standard 1913 dictionary definition of \u201ccertify\u201d is as follows: \u201c1. To give certain information of; to make certain, as a fact; to attest authoritatively; to verify. ... 2. To testify to in writing; to make a declaration concerning, in writing, under hand, or hand and seal. ... 3. To give certain information to; assure; make certain.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English Language (G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. 1913).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This definition is not, of course, controlling. However, it would be inconsistent with even this definition\u2019s general sense to conclude that the Attorney General satisfies his duty by confining himself to a facial review of petitions to see if they explicitly involve excluded subjects. Some factual review is necessary before one can in a meaningful way assure, verify, testify to or make certain about a matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Review of the debates surrounding art. 48 concerning the Attorney General\u2019s role in certifying petitions is somewhat inconclusive. There was extended debate regarding his role in certifying petitions as to proper form. See 2 Debates in the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention 1917-1918, at 723-730 (1918). The court has recently stated that the Attorney General\u2019s role in making the proper form certification was intended to be basically one of \u201cavoiding errors of draftsmanship.\u201d <em>Nigro </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., ante </em>438, 446 (1988). But see <em>Paisner, supra </em>at 598 (rejecting narrow construction of Attorney General\u2019s role in certifying petitions as to proper form). Unfortunately, there was virtually no debate when, late in its consideration of the initiative and referendum, the convention adopted the requirement that the Attorney General certify that petitions do not contain excluded subjects. 2 Debates, <em>supra </em>at 1013. However, on reviewing all of the debate concerning the Attorney General\u2019s certification responsibilities, it is fair to say that the convention was relying on that official to ferret out obviously improper initiative petitions. See 2 De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>bates, <em>supra </em>at 671 (Attorney General should \u201cdecide whether a proposed constitutional amendment or a law is the same thing as one that has been submitted within three years\u201d before submission to people rather than Supreme Judicial Court deciding the issue after submission); <em>id. </em>at 727-728 (Attorney General is best suited official to make initial determination regarding form of petitions); <em>id. </em>at 960 (Attorney General is \u201cobviously\u201d the official to determine if petition contains unrelated items). It would be inconsistent with that role for the Attorney General to limit himself to a strictly facial analysis of proposed petitions, i.e., simply reading petitions to see if they explicitly concern excluded matters. See <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>327 Mass. 310, 321-322 (1951) (State officers should not transform safeguards contained in art. 48 into \u201cmere admonitions and recommendations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Having determined that the Attorney General should consider petitions\u2019 factual impact when certifying that they do not contain excluded subjects, the question of the extent of his factual inquiry remains. This is a question of first impression. On review of art. 48\u2019s legislative history, we conclude that the Attorney General is not to become involved with holding extensive hearings to determine the full factual impact of a petition. As the Attorney General points out, a requirement that he hold general hearings on submitted petitions was rejected at the 1918 convention and subsequently. See 2 Debates, <em>supra </em>at 533; Legislative Research Council, Report Relative to Revising Statewide Initiative and Referendum Provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution, 1975 House Doc. No. 5435, at 103 (concern that hearings by Attorney General would further encumber the initiative process). Rejection of a requirement that the Attorney General hold hearings on submitted petitions is in accord with the view, expressed at the convention, that in performing at least some of his certification responsibilities the Attorney General should not act as a censor of the people\u2019s will, 2 Debates, <em>supra </em>at 728, and that the people should be allowed to speak freely through the initiative process. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Rather than holding extensive hearings on submitted petitions, the Attorney General should approach certification deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>sions in the same manner that the court approaches review of those decisions. As discussed above, the general approach of the court in cases reviewing Attorney General certification decisions regarding excluded subjects has been to consider the apparent factual impact flowing from a petition\u2019s language. It is also appropriate for the Attorney General to consider facts which can be officially noticed. See generally Davis, Official Notice, 62 Harv. L. Rev. 537 (1949).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These facts could be quickly determined and the making of such determinations would not involve undue delay which might frustrate the initiative process. In sum, the Attorney General should consider the facts implied by a petition\u2019s language and officially noticeable facts when determining whether to certify that a submitted petition contains only subjects not excluded from the initiative petition\u2019s operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">Because it is not clear from the record that the Attorney General considered the facts implicit in the petition\u2019s language, and facts susceptible to official notice, this matter is remanded to him to consider such facts \u00e1nd to determine whether certification of the petition was proper.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, the Attorney General should not engage in extended inquiries to determine facts which are not within these categories. The Attorney General, having determined the relevant facts he may consider, is free to affirm his certification of the petition if those facts do not establish the presence of an excluded subject.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If it is his deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>sion to affirm his certification, the certification shall be considered to be valid ab initia. His decision is, of course, subject to judicial review should the parties seek such review. See, e.g., <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>306 Mass. 296, 298 (1940), citing <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>269 Mass. 503 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">An order shall be entered in the county court directing the Attorney General to reexamine the petition in a manner not inconsistent with this opinion and to determine whether he shall affirm his certification. The county court shall retain jurisdiction of this petition, in order that the single justice in his discretion may enter orders to expedite and otherwise facilitate proceedings. We are confident that all parties are cognizant of the necessity to avoid unnecessary delay in future proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b765-13\"> All references are to art. 48 as amended by art. 74, by art. 81, and by art. 108 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b765-14\"> The full text of the measure proposed by the initiative petition is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b765-15\">THE STOP NUCLEAR WASTE ACT An Act to prohibit the continued generation of electric power by commercial</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>nuclear power plants in the Commonwealth by means which result in the production of nuclear waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Be it enacted by the People, and by their authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Section 1. <em>Statement of Purpose.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">It is both uneconomical and unwise to continue to generate electric power in the Commonwealth by means which result in the production of nuclear waste when there is no method for disposal of nuclear waste.

We reject this approach. Resourceful opponents of some initiative petitions could point to factual uncertainties regarding those petitions and the possibility that they may contain excluded matters. To construe art. 48 as requiring the Attorney General not to certify petitions on this speculative basis could effectively limit the initiative petition process. Such a construction will not be adopted. See <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>371 Mass. 195, 198-199, 202-203 (1976).
