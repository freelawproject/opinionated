The defendant cites two grounds of error. First, he argues that the Superior Court judge erred in allowing the victim\u2019s friend to testify regarding the victim\u2019s statements, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>made in the friend\u2019s presence, to a rape crisis counselor, without also requiring that the counselor\u2019s questions be placed in evidence. Second, he argues that the prosecutor\u2019s summation contained improper argument which created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">1. Following the alleged rape the victim left the scene, went to a nearby restaurant, and telephoned a friend. The friend drove to the restaurant, met the victim, and drove her to a hospital where she was examined. While at the hospital the victim had a conversation with a rape crisis counselor. The victim\u2019s friend was present during the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">At trial, the prosecutor sought to have the friend testify regarding the conversation. Defense counsel objected, but was overruled. At an ensuing bench conference, reproduced in material part in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the judge correctly ruled that under the fresh complaint rule the witness could relate what he heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>the victim say to the counselor. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>399 Mass. 841, 848-849 (1987). However, in response to defense counsel\u2019s arguments, the judge also ruled that the witness could not relate the counselor\u2019s side of the conversation. Defense counsel did not object to this approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The defendant paradoxically argues that the \u201cjudge erred in admitting as purported fresh complaint the testimony of [the friend] as to only the alleged victim\u2019s portion of a conference with a rape crisis counselor, inasmuch as the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation demanded presentation of the whole of the conversation or none of it.\u201d In the same vein, the defendant also contends, beginning with the premise that fresh complaint statements to be admissible must be voluntary, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanger, </em>357 Mass. 464, 466-467 (1970); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>319 Mass. 627, 630 (1946), that where the counselor\u2019s questions were not in evidence, it is impossible to determine the voluntariness of the victim\u2019s statement to the counselor. However, defense counsel failed to make known to the judge these objections to the ruling. Indeed, his argument to the judge was, essentially, that the counselor\u2019s questions should not be allowed in evidence through the third-party witness. In these circumstances, the arguments, whatever their merit, are not available to the defendant on appeal. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>397 Mass. 244, 250 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallison, </em>383 Mass. 659, 669 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDuffee, </em>379 Mass. 353, 357 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cheek, </em>374 Mass. 613, 615 (1978). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCreary, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 690, 696 (1981) (\u201c[defendant's vague protestations . . . were insufficient to assist the trial judge in making a rational determination of [the evidence\u2019s] admissibility\u201d) quoting <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>580 F.2d 809, 810 (5th Cir. 1978).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In short, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>we conclude, from our reading of the colloquy between judge and defense counsel, that the judge could fairly decide that his ruling was responsive to the defendant\u2019s objection. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">2. The defendant also complains of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. The defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks concerning the testimony of the victim and a police officer contained improper assertions of matters not in evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoppin, </em>387 Mass. 25, 30 (1982). He also contends that through these remarks the prosecutor improperly vouched for the witnesses\u2019 credibility. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Villalobos, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 905, 905 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Because no objection was made to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, the defendant requests that we review the impact of the alleged improprieties to determine whether they created a substantial risk of miscarriage of justice. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bourgeois, </em>391 Mass. 869, 884 (1984), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baptiste, </em>372 Mass. 700, 712 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Earltop, </em>372 Mass. 199, 203-204 (1977). This we need not do, for in the circumstances here we discern no impropriety in the prosecutor\u2019s remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">During his closing argument defense counsel anticipatorily discussed the fact that the victim was willing to testify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>and accuse the defendant of the crimes charged.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Counsel intimated she did so out of guilt and low self-esteem over having engaged in what the defendant described in his testimony as consensual casual sexual activity. Defense counsel also spoke about the police officer, and indicated that his investigation improperly began with the assumption that a rape had occurred, and that his resultant testimony, and the investigation itself, was necessarily biased against the defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> All of this was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>proper argument, based on the evidence or inferences from the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Earltop, supra </em>at 205 (Hennessey, C.J., concurring). Similarly, the prosecutor\u2019s response to these arguments, see <em>supra, </em>note 3, was proper. It is a fair inference that, despite the fact she testified, the victim did not enjoy relating her ordeal in open court and did not look forward to doing so. It was also proper to comment that the police officer had \u201cno ax[e] to grind\u201d and had done \u201chis job well.\u201d The officer had testified concerning his relation to the case and concerning the course of his investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-7\"> The following discussion occurred at the bench conference:</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Defense counsel: \u201cI assume this is being offered under the fresh complaint idea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">The court: \u201cI assume so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">Defense counsel: \u201cWell, the problem I think is that \u2014 whether or not it\u2019s still a fresh complaint is another question, but I think to try to offer it through a third party is not \u2014 is not a productive way to do it. . . . I\u2019m simply pointing out that this is the awkward nature of this thing. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right way to do it. The first question off the box, he [the witness] can\u2019t answer it correctly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">The court: \u201cIt may not be the preferable way to do it, but I think it\u2019s admissible if he were present and he in fact heard the fresh complaint made by her to someone else. In his presence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">Defense counsel: \u201cI understand that. But the question was what conversation did you overhear between those two people. And first of all, I think the rape crisis people are frequently trained \u2014 they have techniques that they employ. If that person is not here to be cross-examined, I don\u2019t think that he [the witness] should be permitted to testify to what she said and then what [the victim] said, and that type of thing, as if it were some kind of a transcript of what was said.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-13\">\u201cI think that that\u2019s not an appropriate way to do it. And I object to it.\u201d The court: \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to permit it insofar as to what he [the witness] heard her say. I\u2019m not going to permit it insofar as to what type of interrogation between the rape crisis counselor, if there was one, and this particular victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">\u201cIt\u2019s limited to what she told the rape crisis counselor in her <em>[sic] </em>presence. And I\u2019ll permit it. As to the interrogation, if there be any, I\u2019ll exclude it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b655-6\"> We note that the defendant was apparently free on cross-examination to inquire of the witness regarding the counselor\u2019s questions under the rule of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britland, </em>300 Mass. 492, 495-497 (1938) (where one party puts part of conversation in evidence, other party is entitled to put in evidence balance of what was said). The judge\u2019s ruling limiting the prosecution\u2019s direct examination did not alter this. In any event, defense counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>failure to even attempt the line of questioning is some indication that he entertained no desire at time of trial, in contrast to the interest expressed on appeal, to have the counselor\u2019s questions placed in evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b656-9\"> The defendant points to the following passages from the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument with emphasis as added by the defendant: \u201cYou saw [the victim]. She came here and testified. <em>She didn\u2019t enjoy being here. She didn\u2019t enjoy being here. She didn\u2019t want to come here and get on the stand and tell you that story of what happened to her. But she came here. She knew that her character and her values would be put in question in this case, and she would be placed on trial. But she knew that she had to do the right thing.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">\u201cAnd then you heard from Sergeant O\u2019Neil. And do you really, really believe that Sergeant O\u2019Neil came here and is trying to set up Barrett Owens in this case? Do you really believe that? Do you really believe that he made up those things that are in his statement, in his police report? . . . <em>Sergeant O\u2019Neil doesn\u2019t have any ax[e] to grind in this case. He has a job to do. And you know what? He did his job real well in this case. That\u2019s the bottom line: He did his job well.\u201d</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b657-5\"> \u201cSo, I want to just try to anticipate one thing which I think he may say, and to respond to it. Anticipatorily, if you will. And that is, why would she come in here and tell this story and say this if it didn\u2019t happen. Now, that\u2019s phrased as if she was driving down Route 6 one day and said: I think I\u2019ll go down to the courthouse and say that Barrett Owens raped me. Okay? Why would a person do that? They wouldn\u2019t do it. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. But that\u2019s not what happens in cases. And that\u2019s not what happened in this case. No question about the time that they engaged in sexual relations and intercourse at 2:00, 3:00 o\u2019clock in the morning, whatever time it was, . . . that morning. And I suggest to you \u2014 and again, I don\u2019t have to answer this question. It\u2019s not incumbent upon the defendant to prove to you why this would happen \u2014 but I want to respond to it because it\u2019s a frequently used red herring by the government to cover up the deficiencies in the case: \u2018Why would she come in here and say this if it weren\u2019t true?\u2019 Well, one of the unfortunate legacies of the sexual revolution is that people learned that through casual sexual relations, and she\u2019d never met him before, she\u2019d met him for ten minutes one night, that sex without love and sex without commitment makes you feel lousy. . . . But in any event, 3:00 or 4:00 o\u2019clock in the morning, not feeling too well about it, she calls up her fianc\u00e9, and she says: T was raped.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Defense counsel continued by arguing that once the victim told her fianc\u00e9 she was raped, she could not abandon that version of the events and eventually testified consistent with it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b657-7\"> \u201cOne thing I want to mention to you as evidence of what I said about Sergeant O\u2019Neil. . . right at the outset there when I asked Sergeant O\u2019Neil: \u2018What\u2019s the first thing you did with regard to this case?\u2019 He indicated he came from home around 5:30. He said: \u201cI talked to someone. \u2019 Talked to officers and so forth. \u2018And then I called the victim.\u2019 He says to you at the \u2014 He doesn\u2019t know a thing about the case. He\u2019s home. He comes in. He hears a preliminary report of the thing orally from some police officer and comes to the conclusion on June 1st, 1985, at 5:30 in the evening, \u2018We\u2019ve got a victim. \u2019 And he operates for the next few days in his investigation of this case from that bias, from that presupposition. He doesn\u2019t say: \u2018Okay, let me make a cold-blooded, objective evaluation of the materials here and see if in fact we have a crime.\u2019 Because obviously you have to have a crime in order to have a victim. He concludes at 5:30: \u2018When I called in from home on a Saturday off I\u2019m going to talk to the victim.\u2019 If he says that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>then what he\u2019s saying is: \u2018I\u2019ve decided there\u2019s been a crime. And if there\u2019s been a crime, there\u2019s been a criminal. And if there\u2019s a crime, that\u2019s Barrett Owens.\u2019 And he went into that interrogation with Barrett Owens with that presupposition. And that colors his interrogation of him, it colors his recitation of his version of that to you people.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
