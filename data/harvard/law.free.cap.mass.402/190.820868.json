L. c. 123, \u00a7 21 (1986 ed.). The plaintiffs sought, inter alia, a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from continuing certain seclusion and restraint practices in violation of c. 123, \u00a7 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">On July 31, 1987, a judge in the Superior Court found that the plaintiffs were entitled to injunctive relief. He deferred entry of a preliminary injunction, however, to allow for completion of a plan intended to bring State practices at Bridgewater to compliance with the mandates of \u00a7 21. At that time, the defendants would be permitted to show cause why the injunction should not enter. The plan was completed on August 10, 1987. Shortly thereafter, the Department of Correction issued draft regulations regarding the use of seclusion and restraint at Bridgewater.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">The judge heard further argument on the request for injunctive relief in light of the new plan and proposed regulations. On September 11, 1987, he granted, in part, the plaintiffs\u2019 application, ruling that monitoring and other associated procedures pertaining to patients in seclusion and restraint at Bridge-water, either as then practiced or as required under the newly proposed regulations, failed to comport with the requirements of c. 123, \u00a7 21. A four-part preliminary injunction issued. The defendants appealed only the portion of the second paragraph of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>the injunction that requires constant observation of patients in seclusion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the defendants\u2019 motion, the judge stayed implementation of the second paragraph, pending appeal. He subsequently denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for relief, pending appeal, or for modification of the stay. A single justice of the Appeals Court denied a similar motion on September 30,1987. We granted the defendants\u2019 application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">1. <em>Mootness. </em>At the outset, we note that the issue of the named plaintiffs\u2019 treatment at Bridgewater is moot; both plaintiffs have been transferred to facilities outside the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs \u2019 counsel, however, apparently are prepared to pursue this action on behalf of one who is currently a resident at Bridgewater, and the defendants do not press a claim of mootness. The matter has been briefed fully, and the rulings of the judge have continued impact on administrative practices at Bridgewater and other State mental institutions. Additionally, the issue raised is likely to arise again and appears \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d <em>Guardianship of Linda, </em>401 Mass. 783, 784 (1988). See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yameen, </em>401 Mass. 331, 333 (1987); <em>Metros </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>396 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>156, 159 (1985). Thus, we exercise our discretion to decide this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">2. <em>The seclusion and restraint statute. </em>General Laws c. 123, \u00a7 21, ninth par., provides: \u201cNo person shall be kept <em>in restraint </em>without a person in attendance specially trained to understand, assist and afford therapy to the person in restraint. <em>The person may b[e\\ in attendance immediately outside the room, in full view of the patient when an individual is being secluded without mechanical restraint, </em>provided, however, that in emergency situations when a person specially trained is not available, an adult[ ] may be kept in restraint unattended for a period not to exceed two hours. In that event, the person kept in restraints must be observed at least every five minutes; provided, further, that the superintendent, director, or designated physician shall attach to the restraint form a written report as to why the specially trained attendant was not available. The maintenance of any adult in restraint for more than eight hours in any twenty-four hour period must be authorized by the superintendent or facility director or the person specifically designated to act in the absence of the superintendent or facility director; provided, however, that when such restraint is authorized in the absence of the superintendent o[r] facility director, such authorization must be reviewed by the superintendent or facility director upon his return.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The defendants argue that the judge engrafted a new requirement to \u00a7 21 by mandating constant observation of secluded patients. The defendants maintain that neither the statutory language nor the legislative history establishes a constant observation requirement. Rather, the legislative purpose was to allow for clinical discretion in administering the use of seclusion. They argue that the \u201cin attendance\u201d language requires only that someone be nearby to understand, assist and afford therapy to the patient, and to diminish the patient\u2019s sense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>solitude. Reading in isolation the phrase \u201cin full view of the patient,\u201d the defendants claim that the statute is written solely from the patient\u2019s vantage point, requiring only that secluded patients be able to see a trained observer if they so wish. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We are mindful that \u201c[t]he general rule is that \u2018[w]here the language of a statute is plain, it must be interpreted in accordance with the usual and natural meaning of the words. \u2019 <em>Gurley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 595, 598 (1973). See <em>Commonwealth v. Vickey, </em>381 Mass. 762, 767 <em>(1980); Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 741, 747 (1945).\u201d <em>Restaurant Consultants, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>401 Mass. 167, 170 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">We have stated also that \u201c[t]he statutory language, when clear and unambiguous, must be given its ordinary meaning. <em>Hashimi </em>v. <em>Kalil, </em>388 Mass. 607, 610 (1983). When the use of the ordinary meaning of a term yields a workable result, there is no need to resort to extrinsic aids such as legislative history. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the statutory language is the principal source of insight into legislative purpose. <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 <em>(1977). Bronstein v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>390 Mass. 701, 704 (1984). In our view, the statute is clear and unambiguous. Hence, we need not refer to the statutory history.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The seclusion and restraint law explicitly mandates that the various forms of restraint \u201cmay <em>only </em>be used in cases of emergency, such as the occurrence of, or serious threat of, <em>extreme </em>violence, personal injury, or attempted suicide\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 21. See also G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 1 (containing a stringent definition of \u201cLikelihood of serious harm\u201d). The \u201cuse of the word \u2018only\u2019 in G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 21, means \u2018for no other purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>390 Mass. 489, 510 (1983). Only when the patient harms, or presents a serious threat of harm, to himself or others, is the use of restraint permitted. Neither doctors nor courts have the power to expand the circumstances in which a patient may be restrained. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Where the requisite emergency situation exists, \u00a7 21, ninth par., further prescribes the manner in which seclusion or mechanical restraint is to be applied. As the judge below found, in an uncontested portion of the preliminary injunction, the use of mechanical restraint necessitates that a specially trained person be \u201csituated in the room\u201d with the patient. The staffer must be able constantly to observe the restrained person. This requirement flows from the first sentence of \u00a7 21, ninth par.: \u201cNo person shall be kept in restraint without a person in attendance specially trained to understand, assist and afford therapy to the person in restraint.\u201d The defendants\u2019 new regulations in effect acknowledge that, in this context, being \u201cin attendance\u201d requires constant observation of the mechanically restrained patient.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The statute provides an option regarding the manner of constant observation when seclusion without mechanical restraint occurs. The second sentence of \u00a7 21, ninth par., then provides that the person <em>\u201cmay b[e\\ in attendance immediately </em>outside the room in full view of the patient\u201d (emphasis added). While the person need not be in the room with the secluded person, repetition of the operative words \u201cin attendance\u201d indicates that the requirement of constant observation remains unchanged.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Plymouth County Nuclear Information Comm. </em>v. <em>Energy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>Facilities Siting Council, </em>374 Mass. 236, 240 (1978) (word used in one part of statute in definite sense should be given same meaning in another part of same statute). If the option of the staff person not to be in the same room with the patient is exercised, however, there is an additional requirement that the secluded patient be able to see the staff person.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">The logic of this statutory scheme rests on the practical differences between seclusion and mechanical restraint. When the latter is used, the patient\u2019s bodily movement is severely restricted. The necessity of having a trained observer to \u201cassist and afford therapy\u201d is evident. Moreover, as the judge found, the nature of restraining devices may preclude the staff person from being \u201cin full view\u201d of the person in restraint. With the former method, however, the patient may move freely about the seclusion room. If, for reasons of the observer\u2019s own safety or otherwise, the observer shall be \u201cimmediately outside\u201d the room in observing the patient, then he constantly must be visible to the patient as if he were in attendance inside the seclusion room.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AKd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that the judge did not err in his interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae7\">3. <em>Preliminary injunctive relief. </em>We consider next whether the judge exercised properly his discretion in ordering a preliminary injunction. The standard for review of a grant or denial of preliminary injunctive relief is whether the judge abused his discretion. Our review, however, is not perfunctory. \u201c[W]e must look to the same factors properly considered by the judge in the first instance. \u201d <em>Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cheney, </em>380 Mass. 609, 615-616 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"Azb\">To obtain a preliminary injunction, the moving party must show that, without such relief, \u201cit may suffer a loss of rights that cannot be vindicated should it prevail after a full hearing on the merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616. The judge must balance the moving party\u2019s chance of success on the merits and its risk of irreparable harm against any similar risk of irreparable harm to the opposing party. The touchstone of the analysis is \u201cthe risk of such harm in light of the party\u2019s chance of success on the merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"ARG\">In the case at bar, the judge found that the plaintiffs would suffer \u201cimmediate and irreparable\u201d harm if a preliminary injunction were not granted. In balancing the anticipated harm to the plaintiffs against the injury to the defendants, the judge concluded that the balance tipped in favor of the plaintiffs. Finally, he concluded that the plaintiffs have a likelihood of success on the merits, and that the public interest supported issuance of a preliminary injunction conforming to the requirements of G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 21.</p>\n<p id=\"AHlk\">Our examination of the relevant factors supports the judge\u2019s conclusions. Without this preliminary relief, the plaintiffs might suffer deprivation of the rights afforded under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 21.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Any violations to their persons could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>remedied retroactively. In light of the substantial risk of harm to the plaintiffs given their chance of success on the merits, there was no error in granting the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The judge may consider whether reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in the pursuit of this appeal should be awarded to the plaintiffs. See G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b206-24\"> Paragraph 2 of the preliminary injunction restrained the defendants (other than the Governor) from \u201c[f] ailing to provide adequate monitoring of a person in that form of restraint which is confinement in a place of seclusion without mechanical restraint, by a person in attendance specially trained to understand, assist and afford therapy to the person in such seclusion. For purposes of this preliminary injunction, the specially trained person may be situated immediately [outside] the room in which the person is secluded without mechanical restraint; in that event, however, if so located, the specially trained person (1) shall be in attendance at a location at all times in full view of the secluded person, and (2) shall be able at all times to observe the secluded person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-35\">The other paragraphs enjoined these same defendants from: (1) restraining a patient except in cases of emergency, as defined in G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 21, third par.; (2) failing to provide constant observation and continuous physical presence, by a specially trained person, for patients in mechanical restraint; and (3) failing adequately to document (in compliance with statutory specifications) the reasons for initiating or continuing any form of restraint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b206-36\"> The judge denied the plaintiffs \u2019 preliminary motion for class certification under Mass. R. Civ. P. 23, 365 Mass. 767 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\">General Laws c. 123, \u00a7 1 (1986 ed.), defines the several forms of \u201cRestraint\u201d as \u201cbodily physical force, mechanical devices, chemicals, <em>confinement in a place of seclusion </em>other than the placement of an inpatient or resident in his room for the night, or any other means which unreasonably limit freedom of movement\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b209-6\"> Specifically, an institutional regulation, 103 BSH 651.10(l)(c) (1987) provides: \u201cWhenever a patient is in seclusion or restraint, a specially trained staff person or specially trained observer as defined in 651.06(4) shall be in attendance of the patient, subject to the following qualifications: ...(c) The staff person may be in attendance of a patient in mechanical restraints by being situated so that the staff person is within verbal contact of the patient and is able to observe the patient in full view at any time. It is not necessary for a staff person in attendance of a patient in mechanical restraints to be in full view of the patient.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b209-7\"> The defendants argue that, in this sentence, the words \u201cin attendance\u201d simply mean \u201cpresent\u201d or \u201cwithin hollering distance.\u201d They offer no explanation why these operative words carry a different meaning in the sentence immediately preceding. Moreover, under the defendants\u2019 interpretation, the words \u201cin attendance\u201d and \u201cimmediately\u201d would be surplusage. A staff person obviously would have to be \u201cpresent\u201d in the area in order to be \u201cwithin hollering distance\u201d and to be observable to the patient. See, e.g., <em>Chatham Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>362 Mass. 216, 219 (1972) (noting \u201cevery word of a legislative enactment is to be given full force and effect\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., </em>352 Mass. 617, 618 (1967) (no statutory words regarded as superfluous).</p>\n<p id=\"Acqd\">We note that, in a different context, we have stated that the words \u201cin attendance\u201d are not ambiguous, <em>Save-Mor Supermarkets, Inc. </em>v. <em>Skelly Detective Serv., Inc., </em>359 Mass. 221, 225-226 (1971) (construing words in a contract of insurance).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b210-19\"> The statute further requires that, \u201cin emergency situations when a person specially trained is not available, an adult[ ] may be kept in restraint unattended for a period not to exceed two hours.\u201d G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 21, ninth par. In that event, there must be observation of the restrained patient \u201cat least every five minutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This exception constitutes a departure from the normal requirement of constant observation.</p>\n<p id=\"A7FO\">Our interpretation of the seclusion and restraint law comports with newly enacted appropriations provisions. Chapter 1 of the Acts of 1988, \u00a7 2, allocates funds to Bridgewater for audiovisual equipment \u201cto monitor patients who are in seclusion and restraint\u201d pursuant to \u00a721. Section 6 provides a new alternative for constant observation of secluded patients: \u201c[N]o person at Bridgewater state hospital shall be kept in <em>seclusion without mechanical restraint </em>without a person <em>in attendance </em>specially trained to understand, assist and afford therapy to the person in seclusion unless the person in seclusion is monitored through the use of electronic audio-visual equipment\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"AkL\"> Seclusion practices in violation of G.
