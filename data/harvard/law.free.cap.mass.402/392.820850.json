L. c. 94, \u00a7 192 (1986 ed.), a State tolerance for daminozide residue in processed apple products is invalid in that it is more restrictive than the Federal tolerance; and (3) other provisions of State law do not abrogate the requirements of G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 192.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A judge of the Superior Court in Suffolk County ordered summary judgment for the defendants. The plaintiffs appeal. It is unnecessary to decide whether the Federal tolerance of twenty parts per million (ppm) of daminozide residue, established for raw apples pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 346 a, by virtue of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 342 (a) (2) (C) (1982), \u201cpasses through\u201d to govern processed apple products. For the sake of argument, we assume that a Federal tolerance is established in this regard. We conclude, however, that under applicable State law the Department of Public Health (department) may establish tolerances more stringent than comparable Federal provisions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">General Laws c. 94, \u00a7 192 (1986 ed.), provides in pertinent part that any standards, tolerances, and definitions of purity or quality or identity for food that the department adopts \u201cshall <em>conform </em>to the standards, tolerances and definitions, if any, of purity or quality or identity\u201d adopted for the enforcement of Federal law (emphasis added). In <em>American Grain Prods. Processing Inst. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>392 Mass. 309, 315 (1984), we held that, under this section, a Federal decision against setting a standard, tolerance, or definition for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>particular chemical pesticide is not binding on the department. Indeed, an examination of c. 94 and of <em>American Grain Prods., supra, </em>indicates that the over-all purpose of \u00a7 192 is to enable the department to conform its standards, tolerances, and definitions to <em>at least </em>the Federally established m\u00ednimums. While Federal levels usually will provide a beacon, leeway is allowed for independent State determinations. Our review of the history of c. 94, \u00a7 192, revealed that the Legislature, in amending the provision in June, 1948, St. 1948, c. 598, \u00a7 6, intended to overrule the Attorney General\u2019s opinion \u201cthat it was the legislative intent that rules and regulations under \u00a7 192 should be for the purpose of implementing the Federal law referred to in \u00a7 192. Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 58 (1948).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315. A State law simply mimicking existing Federal provisions would serve little purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Section 186 of c. 94 buttresses our interpretation of \u00a7 192. This court has recognized already that these two sections should be construed harmoniously. <em>Id. </em>at 316-317. See <em>Grocery Mfrs. of Am., Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>379 Mass. 70, 76 (1979) (grants of detailed authority in various sections of G. L. c. 94 do not limit department\u2019s ability to deal with matters under more general provisions of the chapter). Consonant with the mandate in \u00a7 192 that the department shall \u201cconform\u201d its definitions to Federal law, \u00a7 186 nonetheless \u201cdoes not limit its definition of adulterated food to food which is adulterated within the meaning of the Federal act. \u201d <em>American Grain Prods., supra </em>at 317 n. 12. The department may ban altogether a particular pesticide chemical although Federal law allows its use. <em>Id. </em>at 317. It would be illogical to construe these sections as permitting the department to ban completely a chemical pesticide which Federal law allows, while prohibiting it from setting more stringent regulations for use.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">For the reasons stated above, we are unpersuaded by the plaintiffs\u2019 bald assertion that the stricter standards set for certain processed apple products are necessarily \u201cnonconforming\u201d within the meaning of the statute. \u201cAn agency, of course, has considerable leeway in interpreting a statute it is charged with enforcing.\u201d <em>Grocery Mfrs., supra </em>at 75, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Finally, the plaintiffs argue that this court need not decide whether, under c. 94, \u00a7 192, conformity always necessitates identity with Federal provisions because, so they claim, in the case at bar, the State action levels do not conform to Federal requisites under \u201cany reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 192.\u201d To the extent this is an argument that the department\u2019s action levels are arbitrary or capricious, the record does not support the claim. See <em>American GrainProds., supra </em>at 329, and cases cited (burden met only by proving absence of any conceivable ground to uphold rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b407-6\"> A tolerance or action level is the maximum concentration of a substance allowed by law. See <em>American Grain Prods. Processing Inst. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>392 Mass. 309, 312 &amp; 313 nn. 5 &amp; 7 (1984); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 346 (1982 &amp; Supp. IV 1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\"> The issue of Federal preemption is not before this court. A single justice of the Appeals Court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the two counts concerning Federal law, on condition that the plaintiffs file a stipulation to stay related proceedings on those counts in the United States District Court until final disposition of the matter before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b407-8\"> Under 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 515.008 (1984) (effective October 1, 1986), the action levels for daminozide residues in heat processed apple sauce and juice products is 5 ppm, and in infant and baby foods it is 1 ppm.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b409-5\">Lynch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aul\">(dissenting). The opinion of the court would have it appear that its logic and result are natural extensions of <em>American Grain Prods. Processing Inst. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>392 Mass. 309 (1984), because, \u201c[i]t would be illogical to construe [G. L. c. 94, \u00a7\u00a7 186, 192 (1986 ed.)] as permitting the department to ban completely a chemical pesticide which Federal law allows, while prohibiting it from setting more stringent regulations for use.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 394. This reasoning obscures the critical distinction between the issue squarely posed by the instant case and the issue actually decided in <em>American Grain Prods., supra. </em>Here, the court decides the issue of whether a tolerance set by a State regulation, which is more stringent than a tolerance for the same substance set by Federal regulations, violates the legislative command that \u201c[s]uch standards, tolerances and definitions shall conform to the standards, tolerances and definitions, if any . . . adopted for the enforcement of the federal food, drug and cosmetic act . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 192. In contrast, the reasoning and holding of <em>American Grain Prods., supra, </em>rested on the explicit determination that there had not been an establishment of any Federal standard or tolerance. <em>Id. </em>at 313-316. Indeed, this critical distinction was apparent to the court then, and it should not be ignored now. \u201cWe believe, furthermore, that the two changes in the section show the aim of the Legislature to require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>conformity <em>only </em>with Federal \u2018standards, tolerances and definitions,\u2019 and not with any other kind of rule or regulation\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"><em>American Grain Prods., supra, </em>therefore, stands for the proposition that conformity is required between State and Federal standards and tolerances. Allowing State regulations 400% more restrictive than the Federal standards is to read the conformity requirement out of the statute. Once again, this court has not only taken another \u201cstep toward agency nonaccountability and carte blanche,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 332 (Lynch, J., dissenting), but also now abdicates the judicial function of interpreting the scope of the only source of authority for agency action in this area. In the long run, this court\u2019s refusal to deal with issues concerning the legitimacy of agency decisionmaking can only undermine the legitimate authority accorded agencies by the Legislature. I, therefore, respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
