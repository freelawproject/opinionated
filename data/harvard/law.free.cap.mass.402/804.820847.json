A judge in the Superior Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on June 10, 1987, invalidating the two town meeting votes referred to above. The Groton ratepayers appealed and we granted the parties\u2019 applications for direct appellate review. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The defendant MMWEC is a public instrumentality of the Commonwealth created under c. 775. Pursuant to authority conferred by that statute, MMWEC has developed a bulk power supply system consisting of ownership interests in various electric power facilities which serve, or are planned to serve, the New England area. MMWEC\u2019s members include a number of Massachusetts municipalities. Any Massachusetts municipality may become a member by majority vote of the municipality as defined in G. L. c. 44, \u00a7 1 (1986 ed.). C. 775, \u00a7 3 (a). MMWEC is authorized to contract to sell to its members and others, and its members and others may contract to purchase \u201call or a portion of the capacity and output of one or more specific electric .power facilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 6 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>MMWEC finances its power supply system through the issuance of bonds. The principal and interest on the bonds are payable from and secured by a prior lien upon and pledge of certain of MMWEC\u2019s revenues. MMWEC\u2019s revenues are derived primarily from PSAs between MMWEC and participants such as the Groton electric light department. Under a PSA, MMWEC sells, and each participant purchases, a share of a project\u2019s capability, which is defined as \u201cthe amounts of electric capacity and energy, if any, which the \u2018Project\u2019 is capable of producing at any particular time.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Each participant is required to pay monthly its share of MMWEC\u2019s costs related to the project, regardless whether the project is completed or operating and notwithstanding any subsequent suspension or interruption of output. These payments come from each participant\u2019s electric plant revenues as an operating expense rather than as a general obligation of the town. C. 775, \u00a7 6 <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The town of Groton became a member of MMWEC on April 26,1976, of its own volition, and has remained a member since that time. The town operates a municipal electric system through its light department. The light department is managed by a board of three municipal light commissioners (light board) and a manager appointed by the board. The town participates in several MMWEC projects through PSAs executed on the town\u2019s behalf by the manager of the light department, acting pursuant to authorization of the light board. None of these PSAs was submitted to the town\u2019s voters for approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The Project No. 6 PSA was executed and delivered to MMWEC by the manager on September 27, 1979, pursuant to a vote of the light board on September 12, 1979.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At a special town meeting on October 2, 1979, the town voted under Article 1 of the warrant \u201cto instruct the Groton Electric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Light Department Commissioners not to purchase any ownership or interest in the Seabrook Nuclear Project 6, directly or indirectly, notwithstanding any action taken by said commissioners since September 11, 1979.\u201d Under Article 2 of the warrant, the town voted \u201cto require the Groton Electric Light Department Commissioners to obtain authorization by a two-thirds vote of Town Meeting . . . prior to entering into any power sales agreement with [MMWEC].\u201d This vote provided further that it \u201cis to be binding on [the commissioners] notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in Chapter 775 of the Acts of 1975.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">1. The Groton ratepayers argue that the town meeting votes are a valid exercise of the town\u2019s home rule authority under \u00a7 6 of the Home Rule Amendment, art. 89 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, and \u00a7 13 of the Home Rule Procedures Act, G. L. c. 43B (1986 ed.). In general, these provisions reserve to towns and cities the right to enact local ordinances or by-laws which are not inconsistent with the State Constitution or State legislation. <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>363 Mass. 136, 155-156 (1973). We reject the plaintiffs\u2019 argument because we conclude that home rule principles are inapplicable to the present situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">The conflict here is not between local power and State power, but rather is between two organs of local power \u2014 town meeting and a town\u2019s light board. The question presented concerns the scope of authority of a local light board to enter into certain contracts under c. 775 and the power of town meeting, if any, to limit that authority. The complete answer to this question was clearly forecast in the recently-decided case of <em>Hull Mun. Lighting Plant </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., </em>399 Mass. 640 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">In <em>Hull, </em>the plaintiff had argued, inter alla, that certain agreements between the town\u2019s lighting plant and MMWEC were void ab initia because the lighting plant lacked authority to enter into the'agreements. We observed that c. 775\u2019s \u201clegislative scheme does not require town approval for every power agreement entered into by the lighting plant. When the town authorized membership in MMWEC, as provided in c. 775, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>\u00a7 3 <em>(a), </em>it authorized its municipal light plant to enter agreements on behalf of the town. Municipal light boards have broad power to contract with other parties, seeG. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 55-56 (1984 ed.), and nothing in c. 775 or its legislative history indicates a legislative desire to limit that power in dealings with MMWEC.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 646-647. Thus, <em>Hull </em>teaches that, while c. 775 allocates to a town meeting the authority to decide whether a town will become a member of MMWEC, once the town has become a member, the statute allocates to the light board the authority to enter into PSAs with MMWEC. Through the two votes at issue here, Groton\u2019s town meeting has sought to limit the town light board\u2019s \u201cbroad power\u201d to contract with MMWEC, which it had previously granted, a result squarely prohibited by c. 775, as construed in the <em>Hull </em>case. It follows from <em>Hull </em>that, once having joined MMWEC and having created a light board, the town may not seek to limit that board\u2019s proper authority after the fact. Therefore, the two town meeting votes at issue here do not invalidate the Project No. 6 PSA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">2. <em>G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 56C. </em>The plaintiffs claim that the trial judge erred in ruling that the light board was not required to file a copy of the Project No. 6 PSA with the town auditor, pursuant to G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 56C (1986 ed.).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The judge reasoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>that the light board was exempt from \u00a7 56C\u2019s filing requirements because, under c. 775, \u00a7 19 (c), \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise expressly provided in this act, the provisions of [c. 164] shall not apply to [MMWEC].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Whether or not c. 164 applies to the light board, the light board\u2019s failure to file the PSA does not, in and of itself, render the contract null and void. As the judge below correctly noted, \u00a7 56C itself provides no such relief. Rather, the statute declares that \u201c[a] city or town auditor, municipal light commissioner or manager wilfully failing to comply with this section shall be punished by a fine of not less than ten nor more than one hundred dollars.\u201d Nowhere in the statute does it say that the effect of a failure to file is to render the contract void. Therefore, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 claim under \u00a7 56C.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">3. <em>Disposition. </em>As noted, note 6, <em>supra, </em>it is not necessary to reach the questions whether the articles are inconsistent with c. 775 and thus invalid under home rule principles and whether the filing and public inspection requirements of G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 56C, apply to the light board. Therefore, aside from the portions of the judgment which purport to resolve those questions, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b819-7\"> The plaintiffs concede that other claims raised in their complaint were disposed of by our decision in <em>Hull Mun. Lighting Plant </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., </em>399 Mass. 640 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b820-7\"> A \u201cproject\u201d is MMWEC\u2019s ownership interest in specified electric power facilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b820-8\"> By its terms, Project No. 6 PSA was not effective until \u201cexecution and delivery of [PSAs] by MMWEC and Participants whose Participants\u2019 Shares total 100.0%.\u201d The plaintiffs allege that, at the time of the town meeting votes, MMWEC did not have commitments for 100% of the participant shares of the project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b822-5\"> Therefore, we do not reach the question whether the votes, if adopted before the fact, would be inconsistent with St. 1975, c. 775. We note, however, that the town meeting votes were never submitted to the office of the Attorney General, whose approval is a necessary prerequisite to the enactment of a valid by-law. G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 32 (1986 ed.). <em>Ballantine </em>v. <em>Falmouth, </em>363 Mass. 760, 765 (1973). <em>Concord </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>336 Mass. 17, 22 (1957). Somewhat curiously, the Attorney General argues, as an amicus curiae, that the defendants should be estopped from asserting the failure to file as a ground for invalidity, because it was the town\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the votes were filed. Even were we to accept this argument as to the town, it fails to estop MMWEC. We conclude, therefore, that the failure to file the votes also prevented their taking effect as by-laws.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b822-6\"> General Laws c. 164, \u00a7 56C, provides, in pertinent part: \u201cEvery municipal light commission or manager thereof, who makes or executes a contract on behalf of a municipal lighting plant, where the amount involved is one thousand dollars or more, shall furnish said contract or a copy thereof to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>city or town auditor within one week after its execution. ...
