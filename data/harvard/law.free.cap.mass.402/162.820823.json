Shields, was stopped at a State police \u201csobriety checkpoint\u201d (roadblock) at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>approximately 1:15 a.m. on September 13, 1986. After performing several field sobriety tests, Shields was arrested and charged with operating his vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1986 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Shields moved to suppress the evidence obtained following his stop at the roadblock, contending that it was the fruit of an unlawful seizure. In support of this motion, Shields argued that the Commonwealth must prove that no less intrusive alternative would be as effective as roadblocks in enforcing c. 90, \u00a7 24, before the roadblock seizure could be found to be constitutionally permissible and the evidence obtained at the roadblock admitted. The Commonwealth acknowledged that it must prove that the roadblock was conducted in accordance with the procedures outlined in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, </em>396 Mass. 81 (1985), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGeoghegan, </em>389 Mass. 137 (1983), but denied that it must disprove the existence of equally effective yet less intrusive alternatives to enforcing c. 90, \u00a7 24, before the evidence obtained at the roadblock could be admit-</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The judge noted that resolution of the dispute was likely to be dispositive of Shields\u2019s case, that the issue was likely to arise in similar proceedings, and that an improper determination in the trial court that the Commonwealth must disprove the existence of equally effective, less intrusive alternatives to roadblocks would result in unnecessary expenditure of judicial resources at trial. Accordingly, the judge properly reported the following two questions to the Appeals Court under Mass. R. Crim. P. 34, 378 Mass. 905 (1979): \u201c1. Whether, as a precondition to the admission of evidence obtained as a result of a sobriety checkpoint or roadblock operated by law enforcement personnel, the Commonwealth is required to prove that there was no less intrusive alternative to the checkpoint or roadblock which would have been effective to accomplish the legitimate public safety goals of the Commonwealth. 2. Whether, assuming that the preceding question is answered in the affirmative, the standard of proof by which the Commonwealth must bear its burden is beyond reasonable doubt, by clear and convincing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>evidence or by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d We granted the parties\u2019 application for direct appellate review of these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The defendant grounds his argument in both the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that neither of these provisions requires the Commonwealth to prove that there are no equally effective yet less intrusive alternatives for enforcing G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, than roadblocks. We therefore answer question one in the negative, and need not address question two.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The stop of Shields\u2019s motor vehicle was a seizure. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, supra </em>at 86. This seizure violates the Fourth Amendment and art. 14 only if it was unreasonable. See, e.g., <em>INS </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>466 U.S. 210, 215 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>394 Mass. 381, 391 (1985). Decisions of this court and of the Supreme Court establish that there is \u201cno ready test for determining reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search [or seize] against the invasion which the search [or seizure] entails.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 405 (1974), quoting <em>Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the City of San Francisco., </em>387 U.S. 523, 536-537 (1967) (administrative search). See <em>Trumble, supra </em>at 86 (to determine reasonableness of seizure court balances \u201cthe public interest against \u2018the individual\u2019s right to personal security free from arbitrary interference by law officers\u2019 \u201d), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 878 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Because Shields was seized without a warrant, the Commonwealth bears the burden of proving that the seizure was reasonable. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Antobenedetto, </em>366 Mass. 51, 57 (1974). To carry its burden of proving that the roadblock seizure was reasonable the Commonwealth must show, at least, that the roadblock was conducted in accordance with the guidelines established in <em>Trumble, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mc-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number><em>Geoghegan, </em>389 Mass. 137 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amaral, </em>398 Mass. 98, 101 (1986). Adherence to these guidelines, the content of which need not be recited here, assures that a roadblock seizure is the result of a \u201cplan embodying explicit, neutral limitations on the conduct of individual <em>officers. \u201dBrown </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>443 U.S. 47, 51 (1979). Conducting roadblocks in accordance with such neutral criteria minimizes the risk \u201cthat the individual\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy [will be] \u2018subject to the discretion of the official in the field. \u2019 \u201d <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 655 (1979), quoting <em>Camara, supra </em>at 532. Adherence to the guidelines\u2019 requirements also assures that the surprise, fear, and inconvenience to \u2014 and therefore the intrusion on \u2014 the motoring public is minimized. See <em>McGeoghegan, supra </em>at 143-144. In sum, leaving aside the question of less intrusive alternatives, where the Commonwealth shows that a roadblock employed to enforce c. 90, \u00a7 24, was operated in accordance with the established guidelines, the accompanying seizures, although not conducted on the basis of individualized suspicion, are reasonable under the Fourth Amendment and art. 14. <em>Trumble, </em>supra at 89-90.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Shields, of course, does not leave aside the question of less intrusive alternatives. He argues that, in order for the Commonwealth to meet its burden of showing that the roadblock seizure at issue here was reasonable, it must prove that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>equally effective yet less intrusive alternative to enforcing c. 90, \u00a7 24. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Less intrusive alternative analysis traditionally has not been employed in determining the constitutional reasonableness of searches and seizures. Indeed, in one case involving a vehicle search we declined to employ less intrusive alternative analysis and observed that \u201c[t]he fact that, in the abstract, less intrusive means might have been used does not, by itself, render the search unreasonable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>376 Mass. 349, 357 (1978), citing <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Dombrowski, </em>413 U.S. 433, 447 (1973). Accord <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 687 (1985) (\u201cThe question is not simply whether some other alternative was available, but whether the police acted unreasonably in failing to recognize or to pursue it\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Villamonte-Marquez, 462 </em>U.S. 579, 591 n.5 (1983); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543, 556 n.12 (1976). The defendant does not address the language quoted from <em>Ortiz, supra, </em>nor does he indicate why the principle of that language is inapplicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Article 14 and the Fourth Amendment proscribe only unreasonable law enforcement conduct. As such, these provisions evince a policy of accommodating the legitimate State interest in law enforcement while preventing arbitrary searches and seizures. It would be inconsistent with that policy to rule that, in order to prove that a search or seizure is lawful, the Commonwealth must prove that each of a multiplicity of proffered hypothetical courses of conduct if used would be either less effective or more intrusive. Where the defendant merely conjectures that equally effective yet less intrusive means of enforcing c. 90, \u00a7 24, exist, \u201c[t]he [Commonwealth] is entitled in the interest of public safety to bring all available resources to bear, without having to spell out the exact efficiency coefficient of each component and of the separate effects of any particular component.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>63 N.Y.2d 518, 528-529 (1984). The focus of the inquiry is on the conduct which in fact occurred. The Commonwealth\u2019s burden is to prove that the intrusion generated by that conduct is outweighed by the need to search or seize. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, supra </em>at 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>We reject the defendant\u2019s argument that the result we reach opens the door for suspicionless searches and seizures in other contexts. Police will not be allowed, for example, to cordon off \u201chigh crime areas\u201d and search all the people on the street. Intrusions of this level, even for a limited search, require some degree of articulable individualized suspicion. <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 (1968). Roadblock seizures for enforcing c. 90, \u00a7 24, are virtually sui generis in this regard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Their constitutionality is based in large measure on the lower expectation of privacy traditionally accorded to the motoring public. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, supra </em>at 357-358 &amp; n.7, and cases cited; <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott, supra </em>at 525. We do not view our decision today as eroding the protection against unreasonable searches and seizures afforded by art. 14 and the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Rather than eroding the constitutional protection against unreasonable search and seizure, our decision is consistent with precedent. Roadblock seizures have been upheld in the absence of individualized suspicion and without a showing of no equally effective yet less intrusive alternative. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez-Fuerte, supra </em>at 545, 556-557 &amp; n.12 (1976) (permanent roadblock conducted sixty-six miles from border to detect illegal aliens; less intrusive alternative analysis rejected). See <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, supra </em>at 663 (indicating that roadblock stops of all oncoming traffic are permissible). In the analogous context of courthouse entry searches we have approved an initial search not based on articulable individualized suspicion so long as it \u201cwas no more intrusive than necessary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>383 Mass. 655, 657 (1981). In the case of roadblocks to enforce c. 90, \u00a7 24, compliance with the <em>Trumble </em>and <em>McGeoghegan </em>guidelines assures that the initial seizure is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>no more intrusive than necessary. We perceive nothing in the prior decisions, nor anything in the nature of art. 14 or the Fourth Amendment, which requires the Commonwealth to disprove the existence of equally effective yet less intrusive alternatives to enforcing c. 90, \u00a7 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Although there is some support elsewhere for the defendant\u2019s position, the result we reach appears to be consistent with the weight of authority from other jurisdictions. Some courts which have addressed the constitutionality of roadblocks to prevent intoxicated driving have required a showing of no less intrusive yet equally effective alternatives. <em>State </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>143 Ariz. 45, 48-49 (1984) (State sustaining its burden). <em>State </em>v. <em>Koppel, </em>127 N.H. 286, 292 (1985) (State constitutional grounds). <em>Higbie </em>v. <em>State, </em>723 S.W.2d 802, 805 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Muzik, </em>379 N.W.2d 599, 604 (Minn. Ct. App. 1985) (State must demonstrate either need for roadblock or its superiority to less intrusive alternatives). The majority of jurisdictions discussing the existence of other alternatives, however, either have rejected this requirement, <em>People </em>v. <em>Bartley, </em>109 Ill. 2d 273, 287 (1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1068 (1986), rev\u2019g 125 Ill. App. 3d 575, 578 (1984), which had required a showing of no less intrusive yet equally effective alternative; <em>State </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>500 N.E.2d 158, 162-163 (Ind. 1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1014 (1987), overruling <em>State </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>471 N.E.2d 1125 (Ind. Ct. App. 1984), which had required a showing of no less intrusive yet equally effective alternative; <em>Little </em>v. <em>State, </em>300 Md. 485, 504-506 (1984); <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott, supra </em>at 528-529, or have indicated that the presence of such alternatives is merely one factor to be considered in determining the constitutional reasonableness of the roadblock seizures. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>483 So. 2d 433, 437-438 (Fla. 1986). <em>State </em>v. <em>Deskins, </em>234 Kan. 529, 541 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Question one is answered in the negative. Question two therefore need not be reached. This case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-8\"> Article 14 provides in some circumstances greater protection from searches and seizures than does the Fourth Amendment. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 372-377 (1985) (stricter standard for determining probable cause under art. 14).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b179-8\"> The question of probable cause has not been raised in this case (or in the companion case we decide today). Nor was the subject of probable cause presented or discussed in our earlier opinions concerning roadblocks. The dissent nevertheless volunteers a discussion on the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">The basic issue is the reasonableness of the search, not the presence or absence of probable cause to believe evidence of a crime is likely to be found. In administrative searches a showing of individualized suspicion is not required because of the public interest in the inspection. See <em>Camara, supra </em>at 534-535. The same considerations fairly apply with respect to roadblocks conducted pursuant to established procedures in order to detect drivers operating under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. See 4 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 10.8(d), at 70-71 (1987). That probable cause need not be shown as to the driver who is stopped is implicit in what we said in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, supra </em>at 89-90, when we concluded that a search pursuant to established guidelines would be reasonable under both the Federal and State Constitutions. See also <em>id. </em>at 96 (Abrams, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b181-6\"> The strong State interest in eliminating \u201c[t]he carnage caused by drunk <em>drivers,\u201d South Dakota v. Neville, </em>459 U.S. 553, 558 (1983), sets roadblocks to enforce c. 90, \u00a7 24, apart from roadblocks for other purposes. Although the Supreme Court has indicated that roadblock seizures to enforce license and registration regulations do not violate the Fourth Amendment, <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 739 (1983), it may well be, given the much lower State interest in assuring compliance with license and registration regulations, that roadblocks for that purpose are not permissible under art. 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Liacos, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaB\">(dissenting, with whom Lynch, J., joins). A review of the various decisions of the United States Supreme Court and of this court, dealing with the constitutionality of automobile roadblocks, reveals how the United States Supreme Court and, sadly, this court have slipped away from basic constitutional principles. Additionally, both the Federal decisions and our decisions offer an almost classic illustration of dictum building on dictum to become a rule of law. I write separately, in dissent, because I hope to refocus this debate on the fundamental principles of the jurisprudence of search and seizure law under both Federal and State Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The fundamental principle under both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights has been that no search or seizure is to be deemed \u201creasonable\u201d unless based on a warrant issued on probable cause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This rule, like any other rule of law, has its exceptions, but it is basic. Yet, the court cavalierly brushes this rule aside by stating erroneously that: \u201cThe basic issue is the reasonableness of the search, not the presence or absence of probable cause to believe evidence of a crime is likely to be found.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 165 n.2. We are told that the test of a reasonable search or seizure is that of balancing the need to search or seize against the invasion of privacy which the search or seizure entails. It is true in this case, as well as in the companion case, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lovelace, post </em>1002 (1988), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>decided this day,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the parties also do not address this fundamental issue. It is true that this court did not come squarely to grips with this question in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGeoghegan, </em>389 Mass. 137 (1983), or in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, </em>396 Mass. 81 (1985), or in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amaral, </em>398 Mass. 98 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Additionally, I do not believe that the court has faced up to the potential differences of result as matter of State constitutional law, but rather has followed the vacillating lead of the United States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>McGeoghegan, supra </em>at 141 n.2 (same factors are material under Federal and State Constitutions; no discussion); <em>Trumble, supra </em>at 89-90 (seizure pursuant to <em>McGeoghegan </em>guidelines would be reasonable under State and Federal Constitutions; no discussion); <em>id. </em>at 96 n.3 (Abrams, J., concurring) (no separate argument made by defendants); <em>Amaral, supra </em>at 101 (roadblock invalid under art. 14 and probably so under Fourth Amendment for failure to meet <em>McGeoghegan </em>guidelines; no discussion of differences between State and Federal law \u2014 or of probable cause or the warrant requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Let us start with a look at <em>McGeoghegan </em>in an effort to illustrate where we have gone astray. In that case we ruled that stopping a vehicle in a police roadblock \u201cwas a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d <em>McGeoghegan, supra </em>at 139. We also recognized that \u201c[t]he reasonableness standard usually requires that the facts on which an intrusion is based be measured against probable cause, <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 149 (1925), or, in limited instances, on articulable, reasonable suspicion focusing on the affected individual. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brignoni-Ponce, </em>[422 U.S. 873, 881 (1975)].\u201d <em>Id. </em>We acknowledged also the holding of <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648 (1979), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>that random stops for license and registration checks could not be justified absent \u201cat least articulable and reasonable suspicion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We then went forward, in dictum, to build on the dictum in <em>Delaware </em>v. Prouse,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and set forth guidelines of reasonableness as to roadblocks.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The dictum of <em>McGeoghegan, </em>built on the dictum of <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, </em>seems to have become the rule shortly thereafter in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>in <em>Trumble, supra </em>at 86: \u201cIt is well established that the stopping of each defendant\u2019s motor vehicle was a seizure within the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 653-654 (1979). Our inquiry becomes, therefore, whether the seizures were reasonable. <em>McGeoghegan, supra </em>at 139. <em>Accordingly, we must balance the public interest against \u2018the individual\u2019s right to personal security free from arbitrary interference by law offi</em>cers.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 878 (1975).\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Thus, \u201cbalancing,\u201d not probable cause, reasonable and articulable suspicion, or the presence or absence of a warrant, became the test.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court today falls into the same error when it states, <em>ante </em>at 164: \u201cDecisions of this court and of the Supreme Court establish that there is \u2018no ready test for determining reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search [or seize] against the invasion which the search [or seizure] entails.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Mass. 402, 405 (1974), quoting <em>Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Court of the City of San Francisco, </em>387 U.S. 523, 536-537 (1967) (administrative search). See <em>Trumble, supra </em>[at 86] (to determine reasonableness of seizure court balances \u2018the public interest against \u201cthe individual\u2019s right to personal security free from arbitrary interference by law officers,\u201d)\u2019 quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 878 (1975).\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">I have pointed out already the flaw in the <em>Trumble </em>reasoning. I add just a brief comment as to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, supra, </em>which the court cites for support today. <em>Silva </em>was not a roadblock case but a stop and frisk case involving a disabled passenger vehicle. The ensuing search of the vehicle was held unlawful as being excessive, even though the initial stop was lawful. The \u201cbalancing\u201d done in <em>Silva </em>was not as to the initiation of the stop (seizure), but as to the extent of the intrusion. <em>Silva </em>clearly adheres to the requirement of individualized suspicion and does not support the court\u2019s sweeping assertions in <em>Trumble, </em>or in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The court refers also to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>376 Mass. 349 (1978), as further support for its position. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, supra </em>at 353, however, we stated: \u201cThe Commonwealth bears the burden of showing the existence of both probable cause to believe the car contained contraband and exigent circumstances to justify the seizure without a search warrant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Antobenedetto, </em>366 Mass. 51, 57 (1974).\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>To justify further its position, the court has referred in <em>Trumble, </em>and in this opinion, to the \u201cstrong public interest\u201d <em>(Trumble, supra </em>at 86), in reducing the harm done by drunken drivers. The results the court reaches today are described as \u201csui generis,\u201d limited to this large social need, based also, in part, on the \u201clower expectations of privacy\u201d accorded the motoring public. The approach taken here, we are assured, cannot be extended to \u201chigh crime areas.\u201d One must assume then that (under the Federal case law) only detection of aliens at fixed border roadblocks, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543 (1976), and (under State law) apprehension of drunken drivers raise the level of public interest to the point where we shall put aside traditional rules and balance, instead, public interest against privacy interests. Does this mean that drug dealing and illegal possession of deadly weapons are lesser concerns? Or does it means that pedestrians are safe, but drivers and passengers are fair game? More likely, it means that \u201csui generis,\u201d however well meant, is an illusory promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Automobiles are not beyond the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection. Consider these words in <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>413 U.S. 266, 269 (1973), referring to the exception to the warrant requirement as to automobiles created by <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U.S. 132 (1925): \u201cThe <em>Carroll </em>doctrine does not declare a field day for the police in searching automobiles. Automobile or no automobile, there must be probable cause for the search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The public\u2019s interest in barring the entry of illegal aliens and those interests involving enforcement of liquor laws, including the apprehension of drunken drivers, are not necessarily the same. The Court, in <em>Almeida-Sanchez, supra </em>at 274-275, recognized this when it quoted Chief Justice Taft in <em>Carroll </em>as follows: \u201c \u2018It would be intolerable and unreasonable if a prohibition agent were authorized to stop every automobile on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>the chance of finding liquor and thus subject all persons lawfully using the highways to the inconvenience and indignity of such a search. Travellers may be so stopped in crossing an international boundary because of national self protection reasonably requiring one entering the country to identify himself as entitled to come in, and his belongings as effects which may be lawfully brought in. But those lawfully within the country, entitled to use the public highways, have a right to free passage without interruption or search unless there is known to a competent official authorized to search, probable cause for believing that their vehicles are carrying contraband or illegal merchandise. \u2019 267 U.S., at 153-154.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ajq\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>422 U.S. 891, 896-897 (1975), the Court invalidated a border checkpoint seizure and said: \u201cA search, even of an automobile, is a substantial invasion of privacy. To protect that privacy from official arbitrariness, the Court always has regarded probable cause as the minumum requirement for a lawful search. <em>Almeida-Sanchez, </em>413 U.S. at 269-270; <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 51 (1970). We are not persuaded that the differences between roving patrois and traffic checkpoints justify dispensing in this case with the safeguards we required in <em>Almeida-Sanchez. </em>We therefore follow that decision and hold that at traffic checkpoints removed from the border and its functional equivalents, officers may not search private vehicles without consent or probable cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ac5\">Unfortunately, all of its own strictures were abandoned by the Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543 (1976). There the Court, for the first time, upheld border checkpoint stops on the basis of the \u201csubstantiality of the public interest\u201d and the impracticality of requiring reasonable suspicion as the basis of the stop. <em>Id. </em>at 556. Justice Brennan\u2019s statement in dissent should be our guide: \u201cConsistent with this purpose to debilitate Fourth Amendment protections, the Court\u2019s decision today virtually empties the Amendment of its reasonableness requirement by holding that law enforcement officials manning fixed checkpoint stations who make standard-less seizures of persons do not violate the Amendment. This holding cannot be squared with this Court\u2019s recent decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ortiz, [supra]; United States </em>v. <em>Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873 (1975); and <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>v. <em>United States, [supra]. </em>I dissent.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez-Fuerte, supra </em>at 568-569 (Brennan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">More recently, when this \u201csui generis\u201d concept was extended to drug searches of boats on interior waterways, Justice Brennan commented in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Villamonte-Marquez, </em>462 U.S. 579, 610 (1983) (Brennan, J., dissenting):<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cIn dissent in <em>Martinez-Fuerte, </em>I expressed my fear <em>that the </em>Court\u2019s decision was part of a \u2018continuing evisceration of Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u2019 428 U.S. at 567. The majority chided me for my rhetoric and my \u2018unwarranted concern,\u2019 pointing out that its holding was expressly and narrowly limited: \u2018Our holding today, approving routine stops for brief questioning . . . is confined to permanent checkpoints. \u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 566 n.19. Today the Court breaks that promise. I dissent.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">In my view, the same lapses are infecting this court with a foreseeable expansion of the doctrine reiterated today. We have not hesitated to grant to our citizens greater protection under art. 14,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and we should do so here. In <em>Trumble, </em>Justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Lynch concluded his dissent (in which I joined), by asking the court to justify its departure from its \u201ctraditional concern\u201d for privacy rights. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">\u201cThe court\u2019s holding that the seizures at the Sunderland roadblocks were reasonable contrasts shaiply with other decisions of this court concerning the scope of protection afforded by the Fourth Amendment. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pietrass, </em>392 Mass. 892, 898-900 (1984) (even though there was probable cause to arrest the defendant on charges of aggravated rape and other violent crimes, the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden of showing exigency, so the police were not justified in making a warrantless entry of a dwelling to arrest him); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thibeau, </em>384 Mass. 762, 763-764 (1981) (even though defendant was riding a bicycle, a known means of transporting illegal drugs, and made a sudden left turn as police cruiser approached, police lacked probable cause to arrest him and seize envelopes containing narcotics that were sticking out of his pocket); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>381 Mass. 642, 645-646 (1980) (police were not justified in making investigatory stop of relatively expensive motor vehicle operated by two youthful appearing men, even though one attempted to conceal his face, presumably from police view). I am unable to reconcile the court\u2019s ruling that the Commonwealth has sustained its burden in this case with the traditional concern this court has expressed for protecting Fourth Amendment rights. Here, the court concludes that the warrantless stop of 503 vehicles was justified even though the police lacked a basis for suspecting that any particular operator was or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>had been engaged in criminal activity. The court gives no satisfactory explanation for why it has suddenly lowered the threshold showing which the Commonwealth has traditionally been required to make to justify a warrantless stop or arrest.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Trumble, 396 Mass. 81, 101-102 (1985).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Today\u2019s decision again fails to give a \u201csatisfactory explanation\u201d for \u201clowering] the threshold. \u201d Accordingly, I dissent.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-6\"> The Fourth Amendment states: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights states: \u201cEvery subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches, and seizures, of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions.

Questioning of all oncoming traffic at roadblock-type stops is one possible alternative. We hold only that persons in automobiles on public roadways may not for that reason alone have their travel and privacy interfered with at the unbridled discretion of police officers.\u201d <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\"><em> </em>In McGeoghegan, <em>supra </em>at 143-144, we said, by way of \u201cobservations\u201d: \u201cFor a roadblock to be permissible, it appears that the selection of motor vehicles to be stopped must not be arbitrary, safety must be assured, motorists\u2019 inconvenience must be minimized and assurance must be given that the procedure is being conducted pursuant to a plan devised by law enforcement supervisory personnel. While we do not suggest that advance notice is a constitutional necessity, advance publication of the date of an intended roadblock even without announcing its precise location, would have the virtue of reducing surprise, fear, and inconvenience. Such a procedure may achieve a degree of law enforcement and highway safety that is not reasonably attainable by less intrusive means. Also, while we do not suggest that roadblocks can only be constitutional if prescribed by statute or appropriate governmental regulation, we think that procedures conducted pursuant to such authorizations and standards would be more defensible them would other procedures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">It is worthy to note that the roadblock in <em>McGeoghegan </em>was ruled unconstitutional; Justice Nolan, the author of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trumble, </em>396 Mass. 81 (1985), dissented in <em>McGeoghegan.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b185-10\"> <em>Trumble </em>came to the court on reservation and report of questions which focused on the validity of roadblock guidelines, not on the question of probable cause or the need of a warrant.

The Supreme Court\u2019s citation to <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 (1968), and related cases, put \u201cbalancing\u201d in proper context. The Court, referring to <em>Terry </em>and <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143 (1972), indicated that a lesser standard of probable cause (articulable and reasonable suspicion) limits the nature and scope of the permissible seizure and intrusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b187-7\"><em> </em>The process I describe brings to mind the well-known comment of Justice Frankfurter, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rabinowitz, </em>339 U.S. 56, 68 (1950) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting): \u201cThese decisions do not justify today\u2019s decision.

There, the Court, for the first time, excluded altogether Fourth Amendment consideration from certain law enforcement encounters. The Court held that detailed interrogation of individuals during a factory raid by immigration service agents did not amount to a seizure, notwithstanding the presence of immigration agents moving systematically through the factory asking about immigration status, while other agents stationed themselves at every exit for the duration of a several hour raid. Justice Brennan recognized that \u201cthe Court has become so mesmerized by the magnitude of the [illegal immigration] problem that it has too easily allowed Fourth Amendment freedoms to be sacrificed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239-240 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). <em>Delgado </em>demonstrates all too clearly that constitutional reasoning in one context is ultimately inseparable from other contexts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b190-31\"> See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>400 Mass. 61, 67-75 (1987) (electronic surveillance); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>394 Mass. 421, 426 (1985) (inventory search of automobile); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 373 (1985) (determination of probable cause).
