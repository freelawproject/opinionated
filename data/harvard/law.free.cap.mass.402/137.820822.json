(Madaket), owns two lots of land located in the town of Nantucket. It applied to the town for building permits to construct a single-family residence on each of these lots. The town, by its zoning by-law, Nantucket Code \u00a7 139-27 (1986); has limited the number of building permits available per year, and allocates them on a weekly basis. The town building inspector maintains a permit \u201ccap line,\u201d which is a list of applications for building permits, maintained in the order in which the applications were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>received and will be issued. The building inspector advised Madaket that he would not place its applications in the \u201ccap line,\u201d because the lots had been made subject to time-share ownership (time-sharing), in contravention of a town zoning by-law. About a month later, the building inspector, on the advice of the town counsel, reversed his decision and placed Madaket\u2019s applications in the cap line. The building inspector declined to remove Madaket\u2019s applications from the cap line when requested to do so by the defendant Weinman. Weinman appealed the building inspector\u2019s decision to the Nantucket board of appeals (board). After hearing, the board voted to direct the building inspector not to grant building permits for the lots for as long as the lots were subject to time-sharing.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Madaket appealed the board\u2019s decision to the Land Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, and c. 185, \u00a7 1 <em>(jVz) </em>(1986 ed.). The Land Court judge ruled that the town zoning by-law relating to time-sharing was inapplicable to Madaket\u2019s proposed use of its lots for construction of time-shared single-family residences, and, alternatively, that the zoning by-law at issue, if applicable, was invalid in that it was arbitrary and unreasonable, and because it constituted a regulation of a civil relationship not incident to a lawful exercise of zoning power, in violation of art. 2, \u00a7 7 (5), of the Home Rule Amendment, as appearing in art. 89 of the Articles of Amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution. We granted the defendants\u2019 application for direct appellate review, and now affirm. Because we conclude that the by-law at issue does not apply to Madaket\u2019s lots, we do not reach the constitutional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Madaket\u2019s lots are located in a zoning district which forbids \u201ctransient residential facilities,\u201d including, inter alla, \u201ctime-sharing or time-interval-ownership dwelling units.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>below, in concluding that the time-sharing by-law did not preelude time-share ownership of the proposed residences, reasoned that the term \u201cdwelling unit\u201d referred only to a separate unit within a multi-family residence, and not to the single-family residences that Madaket proposes to build.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayi\">The by-law\u2019s proscription of time-sharing applies only to a \u201cdwelling unit,\u201d and not to a \u201cdwelling.\u201d See note 2, <em>supra. </em>The key to this case, then, lies in the distinction between these terms as they are used in the by-laws. The by-laws define a \u201cdwelling\u201d as, \u201cA <em>structure </em>used or intended to be used by one (1) family or household for living, sleeping, cooking or eating,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a \u201cdwelling unit\u201d as, \u201cA <em>room or enclosed floor space within a dwelling </em>used by, or forming a habitable unit for, one (1) family with facilities for living, sleeping, cooking or eating\u201d (emphasis added). Nantucket Code \u00a7 139-2 (1986). Thus, \u201cdwelling\u201d is defined in terms of the physical structure of a residential building, i. e., the edifice itself, while \u201cdwelling unit\u201d is defined in terms of the subdivision of the physical structure into habitable subparts, each suitable for occupancy by a family.</p>\n<p id=\"AEgY\">Usage throughout the by-laws is consistent with our interpretation of the term \u201cdwelling\u201d as referring to the physical structurc of a residential building, and of the term, \u201cdwelling unit\u201d as referring to the subdivision of such a building into habitable subparts. For example, \u00a7 139-7 (A) (2), permits construction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>a detached \u201csecondary dwelling\u201d on the same lot as the \u201cprincipal dwelling,\u201d while \u00a7 139-7 (C) (1) \u201cprovide[s] an owner of a single-family home the opportunity to install one (1) year-round accessory apartment unit within the exterior walls of his or her home ... in lieu of the right to construct or install a detached secondary dwelling or garage apartment on the property . . . [provided that] (2) (f) . . . [t]here shall be no more than two (2) dwelling units per lot.\u201d Taken together, these subsections allow the owner of a single-family residence to construct on his lot another single-family residential building, \u00a7 139-7 (A) (2), or, alternatively, to install within his existing building an additional accessory apartment, \u00a7 139-7 (C) (1). The former of these is a new building \u2014 a \u201cdwelling\u201d; the latter is a subdivision of an existing building \u2014 a \u201cdwelling</p>\n<p id=\"AGF\">Similarly, \u00a7 139-8 (A) permits use of \u201c(3) A dwelling containing two (2) dwelling units . . . provided that any lot on which the dwelling units are located shall not contain any additional dwellings or dwelling units . . . [and that] ... (4) [d]welling units shall be under the same ownership as the principal dwelling.\u201d Again, these subsections distinguish a \u201cdwelling\u201d from a \u201cdwelling unit,\u201d and support the view that the former term refers to a residential building, and the latter to a subdivision thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"AlM\">The defendants contend that the by-law\u2019s proscription of time-sharing applies to both single-family and multiple-family residences. They argue that a single-family residence is simply a \u201cdwelling\u201d consisting of only one \u201cdwelling unit.\u201d We think that such an interpretation is inconsistent with the sense in which these terms are used throughout the by-laws. As discussed, the by-laws appear to distinguish between these terms, and to use the term \u201cdwelling unit\u201d exclusively to refer to an individual subdivision of a multiple-unit residential building. The evident function of the term is as a device for counting the number of separate households occupying a residential building, i.e., as a measure of intensity of use. Where a section is intended to apply to both single-family and multiple-family residences, the by-laws expressly accomplish this by using both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>terms as, for example, in \u00a7 139-8 (A) (3) and (4), see <em>supra </em>at 140. Thus, the absence of such comprehensive language in the section relating to time-sharing is evidence of the town\u2019s intent to proscribe time-sharing only in multiple-family residences. This is not an illogical distinction. The town meeting may well have reasoned that time-sharing of single-family residences would not engender the same intensity of use and its concomitant problems, as would time-sharing of multiple-family residences.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">We therefore conclude, as did the judge below, that the by-law\u2019s proscription of time-sharing does not apply to the single-family residences that Madaket proposes to build.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\"> \u201cTime-Sharing or Time-Interval-Ownership Dwelling Unit \u2014 A dwelling unit in which the exclusive right of use, possession or ownership circulates among various owners or lessees thereof in accordance with a fixed or floating time schedule on a periodically recurring basis, whether such use, possession or occupancy is subject to either: a time-share estate, in which the ownership or leasehold estate in property is devoted to a time-share fee (tenants in common, time-span ownership, interval ownership) and a time-share lease; or time-share use, including any contractual right of exclusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>occupancy wMch does not fall within the definition of \u2018time-share estate,\u2019 including, but not limited to, a vacation license, prepaid hotel reservation, club membership, limited partnership or vacation bond.\u201d Nantucket Code \u00a7 139-2 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Anv\"> Although the definition of the term \u201cdwelling\u201d appears to comprise only single-family residential buildings, we do not think that the town meeting intended this result. Examination of other sections of the by-laws makes clear that such a literal construction would be unwarranted. For example, \u00a7 139-2, in defining \u201ccustomary home occupations,\u201d and \u00a7 139-7 (A) (1) and (2) (a), refer to a \u201csingle-family dwelling.\u201d Obviously, a distinction is being made between such uses and multiple-family dwellings. The qualify - ing language would be superfluous if by definition the term \u201cdwelling\u201d encompassed only single-family residences. In addition, \u00a7 139-8(A) refers to a \u201cdwelling containing two (2) dwelling units,\u201d and \u00a7 139-18 (I) requires that \u201cmulti-family uses,\u201d in districts where such are permitted, have one parking space \u201cfor each 1.2 dwelling units.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b155-7\">O\u2019Connor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Arq\">(dissenting). The language of the zoning bylaw itself, as well as its legislative history and good sense, \u25a0separately and in combination requires the conclusion that single-family homes subject to time-sharing or time-interval ownership in Nantucket are transient residential facilities, and therefore are not permitted in the zoning district in which the plaintiff\u2019s lots lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">It is unquestioned that the lots lie in a district from which the by-law excludes transient residential facilities. The question is whether the term \u201ctransient residential facilities\u201d includes single-family homes subject to time-sharing, as well as multiunit buildings. Section 139-2 of the by-law defines transient residential facilities as \u201c[hjotels, motels, lodging or guest houses and time-sharing or time-interval-ownership dwelling units.\u201d The court concludes that a single-family home does not fit within that definition; more specifically, that a single-family home, whether or not subject to time-sharing, cannot contain a \u201cdwelling unit.\u201d The court concludes, as did the trial judge, that the term \u201cdwelling unit\u201d necessarily refers to a separate unit within a multi-family residence; a \u201csubdivision\u201d of a structure divided into \u201chabitable subparts.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 139. But, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>nowhere in the by-law is the term \u201cdwelling unit\u201d defined or described as a separate unit in a multi-unit building, or as a subpart or a subdivision. Instead, \u201cdwelling unit\u201d is defined in \u00a7 139-2 as \u201c[a] room or enclosed floor space within a dwelling used by, or forming a habitable unit for one (1) family with facilities for living, sleeping, cooking or eating.\u201d The court does not explain why a room or enclosed floor space within a single-family home, used or appropriate for use as a residence for a single family, does not come within that definition. The court does not explain why such a room or space qualifies as a \u201cdwelling unit\u201d only if it is one of several such rooms or spaces in a single building. Read literally, the by-law treats dwelling units as habitable spaces in single <em>or </em>multiple-unit residences, and the by-law contains no inherent contradiction in language that requires manipulation by the court. A succession of occupants for brief periods is no less a transient use when it occurs in a single-family structure than when it occurs in a structure devoted to simultaneous multi-family use.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">It cannot fairly be said that the Nantucket by-law unambiguously provides that single-family homes subject to time- sharing or time-interval ownership are permissible in zoning districts in which dwelling units in multi-unit buildings subject to time-sharing or time-interval ownership are prohibited. Thus, such a construction may be achieved, if at all, only by the use of interpretive aids traditionally invoked to resolve ambiguities. See <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>363 Mass. 685, 690-691 &amp; n.8 (1973); <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 478 (1986). However, those aids point the other way. One such aid is judicial recognition that \u201c[a] local board of appeals brings to the matter an intimate understanding of the immediate circumstances, of local conditions, and of the background and purposes of the entire by-law; and so, at least in the first instance, the board\u2019s administrative view is valuable and is wanted.\u201d <em>Fitzsimonds </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Chatham, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 53, 57 (1985). Here, the Nantucket board of appeals concluded that single-family homes subject to time-sharing or time-interval ownership are not permitted in the zon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>ing district in which the plaintiff\u2019s lots lie. In its decision, the board of appeals stated the following: \u201cCounsel for [the plaintiff] would have us read the Zoning By-Law as if Time-Sharing Transient Residential Facilities were permitted in every residential zone if limited to a \u2018dwelling\u2019 as distinguished from a multiple \u2018dwelling unit\u2019 use. Or, as put by counsel, [the plaintiff] proposes to construct a Time-Shared \u2018dwelling\u2019 (presumably as a single-family residence permitted in the R-2 zone) without constructing a \u2018dwelling unit\u2019 and thus without the result constituting a \u2018Transient Residential Facility\u2019 barred in R-2. Comparing the definitions of \u2018dwelling\u2019 and \u2018dwelling unit,\u2019 such a \u2018dwelling\u2019 would necessarily not include within it a \u2018room or enclosed floor space\u2019 . . . \u2018forming a habitable unit for, one (1) family . . .\u2019 Clearly, [the plaintiff] strains in asking consideration of such a misreading. \u2018Dwelling unit\u2019 serves in counting units in a single or multi-unit \u2018dwelling.\u2019 \u2018Transient Residential Facilities\u2019 can, by definition, include time-shared dwellings with one or more dwelling units.\u201d It would be difficult to find a board\u2019s administrative view more at variance with the view adopted by the court than in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Another aid to construction, related to that just discussed, is the legislative history of the by-law. <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Belmont, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 994, 995 (1981). Like the view of the board of appeals, the relevant legislative history does not support the court\u2019s result, but, instead, clearly cuts the other way. The provisions of the by-law regarding time-sharing were adopted at Nantucket\u2019s annual town meeting held on April 7, 1982, pursuant to Article 14 on the town meeting warrant. Prior to adoption of that article, the Nantucket Planning and Economic Development Commission submitted a report to the town. A relevant paragraph taken from that report states as follows: \u201cAn important point to remember is that time-sharing does not have to be employed along with condominium ownership or be installed in multi-family structures, although clearly multi-family condos continue to be the principal ownership and structure types chosen for time-sharing thus far on the mainland. This distinction is particularly important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>in Nantucket\u2019s case in view of the fact that Nantucket\u2019s zoning does not now permit the new construction of multi-family residences and those that already exist are not particularly numerous. This means that under current zoning, most future time-sharing projects would probably involve conversion of existing or newly constructed single-family homes, with the exception of what few grandfathered multi-family apartment structure[s] exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Not only does the legislative history contain the report just referred to, but also the town planning board submitted the following recommendation for the guidance of those voting at the town meeting: \u201cThe Planning Board RECOMMENDS FAVORABLE ACTION on Article 14 as written. The Board finds that time sharing or interval ownership constitutes a use of property which is clearly different in intensity, type, and degree from that normally associated with single family home use. The location of time sharing or interval ownership uses in heretofore stable, quiet residential neighborhoods is contrary to the general intent and purpose of the zoning by-law. The use of a structure for time sharing is very similar to the intensity, type and degree of use normally associated with such transient residential facilities as hotels, motels, and guest houses. For that reason, the Board feels that time sharing or interval ownership use should be permitted in districts which now allow transient residential facilities \u2014 Residential Commercial and Limited Commercial.\u201d It is abundantly clear that the town intended by its by-law as amended to prohibit single-family homes subject to time-sharing or time-interval ownership in the district in which the plaintiff\u2019s lots are located.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In view of its interpretation of the by-law, it was unnecessary for the court to reach the constitutional issues addressed by the trial judge and argued on appeal by the parties. In view of the by-law construction for which I argue, it is necessary that I focus on the constitutional questions at least briefly. The by-law as I would construe it does not violate art. 2, \u00a7 7 (5), of the Home Rule Amendment, as appearing in art. 89 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution as a regulation of civil relationships not incidental to a lawful exercise of zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>power. See <em>CHR Gen., Inc. </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>387 Mass. 351, 353-358 (1982). A \u201cfundamental principle of zoning [is that] it deals basically with the use, without regard to the ownership, of the property involved or who may be the operator of the use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356, quoting 1 A. Rathkopf, Zoning and Planning \u00a7 1.04, at 1-21 (4th ed. 1982). However, even if a zoning limitation is phrased in terms of types of ownership, it may be a valid regulation of use. See <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>375 Mass. 197 (1978). In <em>Goldman, </em>the court concluded that \u201c[t]he legislative body of the town could reasonably believe that conversion of a cottage colony to single family use under condominium type ownership would encourage expansion of use beyond the short summer season,\u201d and that the town could restrict that expansion of use by restricting the type of ownership. <em>Id. </em>at 199. Clearly, Nantucket could reasonably have concluded that time-share ownership encourages use of property that is significantly different in intensity and nature from conventionally owned property.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s due process challenge to the by-law is without merit. The test is \u201cwhether the challenged measure bears a rational relation to any permissible public object which the legislative body \u2018may plausibly be said to have been pursuing.\u2019\u201d <em>Sturges </em>v. <em>Chilmark, </em>380 Mass. 246, 256 (1980), quoting <em>Blue Hills Cemetery, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Embalming &amp; Funeral Directing, </em>379 Mass. 368, 372 (1979). As the town argues, control of the nature and intensity of use of residential areas, and the encouragement of use and ownership by persons with a significant stake in the community clearly are public objects which the town meeting \u201cmay plausibly be said to have been pursuing\u201d in adopting the time-sharing provisions of the by-law. I would reverse the judgment below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
