No. 86-280-A. G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5 (1986 ed.). At issue is the decision of the department to accept the probability of dispatch method (POD) of cost allocation proposed by Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMEC).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The department found the following facts. WMEC provides retail electric service to more than 175,000 customers in fifty-nine cities and towns in four western counties in the Commonwealth. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northeast Utilities (NU) and is, along with the Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&amp;P) and Holyoke Water Power Company (HWP), an operating subsidiary of the NU system.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The operating subsidiaries of NU (WMEC, CL&amp;P, and HWP), as well as the Hartford Electric Light Company and Holyoke Power and Electric Company are bound by the Northeast Utilities G&amp;T Agreement (Agreement), which allocates the expenses and revenues associated with generation and transmission among the operating companies in the NU system. These companies plan, construct, and operate their generation and transmission facilities on a one-system basis, although each owns or has ownership shares in these facilities individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">On December 17, 1986, WMEC filed with the department tariff schedules of proposed rate changes intended to increase retail base revenues by $23.5 million, effective on January 1, 1987. The department suspended the rate increase until July 1, 1987, in order to permit further investigation of the propriety of the proposed increase and rate design.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The department granted Monsanto\u2019s petition to intervene in the proceedings. Similar petitions by other parties also were granted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After twenty-eight days of hearings, the department disallowed the proposed tariffs and ordered WMEC to file new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>schedules of rates and charges designed to produce additional gross revenues of only about $12,500,000, approximately one-half the original proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Because the present case is based in part on a 1985 proceeding before the department (D.P.U. No. 85-270), we first discuss a significant aspect of that earlier proceeding. Monsanto Company and Kimberly-Clark Corporation, two of the interveners in this proceeding, had intervened in the earlier proceeding. In D.P.U. No. 86-280-A, the department stated that, in the earlier proceeding, it had \u201cinstructed [WMEC] to use the probability of dispatch (\u2018POD\u2019) method in preparing cost of service studies for its next rate case.\u201d It also had directed WMEC to investigate modifications to the POD method. In the earlier proceeding, the department stated that it recognized that the \u201cAgreement affects [WMEC\u2019s] incurrence of capacity costs; therefore, the parties in [WMEC\u2019s] next rate case are invited to address whether and how the POD allocator should be modified to reflect this fact.\u201d As a result of the department\u2019s directive, the POD method and the department\u2019s reliance thereon are raised as issues in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The department describes the POD method as one which \u201callocates generating unit capacity costs and energy costs over all hours in which a unit operates.\u201d The costs, the department says, are \u201callocated to customer classes consuming electricity during those hours, in proportion to the amount of energy they use during those hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">In the present case, WMEC\u2019s jurisdictional cost of service study, which allocates total revenue requirements between retail and wholesale customers, was based on a \u201c \u2018conventional\u2019 POD approach.\u201d A more limited retail cost of service study, also submitted by WMEC, allocates retail revenue requirements among retail rate classes. The latter study was based on a modification of the conventional POD.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The department found that the modified POD method proposed by WMEC, although it did not reflect the Agreement, did allocate total capital costs, including capitalized energy costs, to all customers who benefited from the generation of various units. The department further found it to be the case that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>it is \u201cmost equitable to allocate the embedded capitalized energy costs of generating units to all . . . now receiving power from those units.\u201d Noting that WMEC\u2019s POD method provides such an allocation, the department accepted its use in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">2. <em>Rejection of Monsanto\u2019s proposal. </em>The department\u2019s acceptance of WMEC\u2019s proposal is the focus of our attention. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>392 Mass. 262, 265 n.2 (1984). Nevertheless, throughout its brief, Monsanto asserts that the methodology it presented to the department should have been accepted. Therefore, we comment briefly on the department\u2019s rejection of Monsanto\u2019s proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Before the department, Monsanto offered the testimony of a utility rate consultant, who stated that WMEC\u2019s generation and transmission costs should be allocated based upon its highest annual 2,000 peak hours, the so-called \u201ccapped POD.\u201d The consultant also suggested an alternative \u2014 that allocation be based one third on the POD method, one third on the average and excess, and one third on the existing base rates. With respect to the proposed \u201ccapped POD\u201d method, Monsanto\u2019s consultant conceded that neither he nor the company had performed the calculations needed to support their conclusions. Because the calculations were not available, the department was justified in ruling that the result of the \u201ccapped POD\u201d method could not be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In discussing Monsanto\u2019s alternative proposal, Monsanto\u2019s expert said it was his \u201ceducated guess\u201d that the result of the alternative proposal in substance would more accurately reflect the Agreement. The department, however, found that it was difficult to determine any relationship between Monsanto\u2019s alternative proposal (one third, one third, one third) and the allocation of costs under the Agreement, and that Monsanto \u201cfailed to provide a theoretical justification for [that] allocation method.\u201d The department correctly rejected Monsanto\u2019s proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">3. <em>Violations of administrative law standards. </em>Monsanto argues that the department\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6) (1986ed.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Monsanto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>does not argue that WMEC did not support its proposal by substantial evidence. Rather, it argues that the decision is not supported by substantial evidence because it does not reflect the Agreement. Thus, Monsanto concludes the department erred in its selection of the POD as the method of cost allocation. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">We reject Monsanto\u2019s claim that, as a result of the department\u2019s determination that none of the proposed methods reflected the cost incurrence approach of the Agreement, that the POD method does not mirror in any manner how customers cause WMEC to incur costs. Monsanto assumes that the Agreement does in fact reflect cost incurrence. The department, however, found that the allocation method applied by the Agreement \u201cappears to have little relationship to cost incurrence for the NU system.\u201d Furthermore, the department said that it was \u201cnot possible to identify a single reason or group of customers which caused a utility to build a unit.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Although the department found that the POD method which it accepted for use in this case did not fully reflect the Agreement, the department concluded that it would be \u201cmost equitable to allocate the embedded capitalized energy costs of generating units to . . . those . . . now receiving power from those units.\u201d The department also found that the POD method did \u201callocate total capital costs, including capitalized energy costs, to all customers who benefit from the generation of various units.\u201d The department also determined that the POD method is representative of how WMEC actually operates. There is no <em>error. The </em>department\u2019s findings and conclusions are supported in the evidence and testimony offered by WMEC. \u201cUnder the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court is not empowered to make a de nova determination of the facts, to make different credibility choices, or to draw different inferences from the facts found by the [department].\u201d <em>Medi-Cab of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>Mass. Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>401 Mass. 357, 369 (1987).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">4. <em>Reasoned consistency. In Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>367 Mass. 92, 104 (1975),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we stated that a party to a proceeding before the department has a right to reasoned consistency in the agency\u2019s decisions. Monsanto argues that the department\u2019s decision violates this principle. We do not agree. The department stated that \u201cthe allocation process should result in an overall level of rates for each class which reflects the costs a company incurs in serving that rate class.\u201d The department had stated in D.P.U. No. 85-270 that nearly eighty-six per cent of the embedded capacity cost is dispatched almost every hour, and that it is appropriate for customers taking service in those hours to bear the costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">We also reject Monsanto\u2019s argument that the department arbitrarily changed its standard of proof by inviting modifications<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to the POD method and later finding those modifications deficient for not \u201cfully\u201d reflecting WMEC\u2019s cost incurrence under the Agreement. We reiterate that the department could determine that Monsanto\u2019s proposal was not supported by appropriate calculations and that its alternative proposal had no theoretical justification. Thus, the department\u2019s decision to reject Monsanto\u2019s proposal is not, as argued by Monsanto, a \u201ccapricious turnaround.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>5. <em>Conclusion. </em>We have determined, for purposes of resolving the issues raised by Monsanto, that the department did not abuse its discretion or act arbitrarily or capriciously, that it fulfilled its obligation to act with reasoned consistency, that the record contains substantial evidence for the department\u2019s finding that the POD method should be used, and that the department did not commit an error of law. The case is remanded to the county court where a judgment is to be entered affirming the department\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b579-9\"> Other interveners in D.P.U.
