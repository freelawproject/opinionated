However, in this case we are presented squarely with a question left open in <em>Electronics Corp. of Am., </em>that is, whether the abatement application of the taxpayer, Supermarkets General Corporation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was timely filed \u201cwithin two years from the date the tax was assessed or deemed to be assessed\u201d under G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 37 (1986 ed.). A preliminary procedural question is presented as to whether the taxpayer waived its right of appeal by not requesting findings and report of the decision of the Appellate Tax Board (board) below.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The procedural history is as follows. On June 9, 1986, the taxpayer filed with the Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner) an application for abatement of its corporation excise for 1982, on the ground that it was entitled to certain unclaimed deductions which the commissioner refers to as the \u201cUJIB deductions.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The commissioner denied the application on the ground that it was not timely filed under G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7\u00a730 and 37 (1986 ed.). The taxpayer appealed to the board under G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 7 (1986 ed.). The commissioner filed a plea in bar with the board, arguing that the board lacked jurisdiction because (1) the abatement application was not filed within the time periods set out in G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 37, and (2) G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 30, did not authorize the taxpayer\u2019s appeal since the claimed deductions were not related to the Federal change in income. The board allowed the commissioner\u2019s plea, and the taxpayer appealed. We took the case here on our own initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>The relevant facts are simple and undisputed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On June 14, 1983, the taxpayer filed its 1982 corporation excise return and paid therewith taxes in the amount of $184,138 and interest in the amount of $15,014. It had made estimated payments earlier in the year and subsequently, when it had filed for an extension of time. The taxpayer did not claim UJIB deductions at any of these times.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">On June 5, 1984, the taxpayer received from the Internal Revenue Service a notice of Federal change in income. On September 5, 1984, the taxpayer filed with the commissioner a Form 355FC Report of Change with Respect to Federal Net Income (Form 355FC), reporting to the commissioner an increase in its Federal net income, and therefore, a corresponding increase in net income attributable to Massachusetts. The taxpayer paid the additional excise due as a result of this change at the time it filed its report. On June 9, 1986, the taxpayer filed with the commissioner its application for abatement claiming the UJIB deductions for the 1982 tax year.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">1. <em>Findings and report under G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13. </em>The commissioner argues that the taxpayer has waived its right to appeal because it failed to request findings and a report of the board\u2019s decision under G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">Under G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13, \u201cthe board shall make . . . findings and report [on its decision] if so requested by either party within ten days of a decision without findings of fact. . . . If no party requests such findings and report, all parties shall be deemed[ ] to have waived all rights of appeal to the appeals court upon questions as to the admission or exclusion of evidence, or as to whether a finding was warranted by the evidence.\u201d By their terms, the section\u2019s prohibitions do not extend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>to pure questions of law which, if not otherwise waived, may be raised on appeal without a request for findings and report.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Here, we are merely asked to determine whether an abatement application was timely filed under G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 37, within two years from the date taxes were assessed or deemed to be assessed. The only fact questions relevant to such an inquiry are the date when taxes were assessed and the date when the application was filed. As will be demonstrated below, such questions are readily answered by reference to undisputed facts in the record before us. Ascertainment of the correct statutory provision from which to draw the limitation period and of the appropriate date from which to measure the running of the limitation period involves legal, rather than factual, determinations. Therefore, we reject the commissioner\u2019s claim that the taxpayer\u2019s failure to request findings and report constitutes a waiver of its right to appeal the question of law presented here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">2. <em>Timeliness under G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 37. </em>The taxpayer filed its abatement application within two years from the date that tax was assessed or deemed to be assessed. Under G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 26, as inserted by St. 1976, c. 415, \u00a7 22, \u201c[tjaxes shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>deemed to be assessed at the amount shown as the tax due upon any return filed under the provisions of this chapter and on any amendment, correction or supplement thereof, or at the amount properly due, whichever is less, and at the time when the return is filed or required to be filed, whichever occurs later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">However, while \u00a7 26 defines the time period when a tax is <em>\u201cdeemed </em>to be assessed\u201d (emphasis added), the running of the \u00a7 37 limitation period starts from \u201cthe date the tax was assessed <em>or </em>deemed to be assessed . . . whichever is later\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, \u00a7 37 clearly contemplates that the dates of actual assessment and deemed assessment need not be identical, and that a taxpayer may benefit from whatever is the later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Such a reading of \u00a7 37 is borne out in the commissioner\u2019s own regulations. For example, under 830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 62C.37.1(3) (1988), \u201c[i]f more than three years have expired from the due date of the return and an application for abatement is filed within two years of an assessment the Commissioner will grant an abatement only to the extent that it relates to that assessment.\u201d The regulation goes on to discuss \u201cadditional assessment^],\u201d and states that, with respect to such additional amounts, a taxpayer \u201cshould not file an application for abatement <em>until </em>and unless the [additional] tax is <em>actually assessed </em>by the Commissioner\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, there is a recognized divergence between the terms \u201cdeemed assessment\u201d and \u201cactual assessment.\u201d To the extent that this points up an ambiguity in \u00a7 37, that ambiguity is to be construed against the taxing authority.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>391 Mass. 630, 632-633 (1984), and cases cited. <em>Eaton, Crane &amp; Pike Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>237 Mass. 523, 530 (1921), <em>S.C., </em>241 Mass. 309 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">In the circumstances of this case, it safely may be said that such an actual assessment of additional tax against the taxpayer occurred when it filed its report of change in Federal income and paid the additional tax due, and the commissioner took no further action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The commissioner himself, in his plea in bar, in fact refers to the September 5, 1984, payment as an \u201cadditional <em>assessment </em>(emphasis added). The assessment was made on September 5, 1984. The taxpayer\u2019s application was filed on June 9, 1986, less than two years later. Therefore, the taxpayer timely filed its application within two years from the date the tax was assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The commissioner argues, however, that the two-year limitation period of \u00a7 37 is simply inapplicable, because the application \u201crequests an abatement for unclaimed deductions, and not an abatement arising out of actual tax assessments or deemed tax assessments.\u201d The commissioner cites no case or other authority to support this somewhat cryptic argument. On its face, \u00a7 37 itself makes no such distinction between taxpayers aggrieved by an assessment alleged to be too high because of unclaimed deductions and taxpayers aggrieved by an assessment for some other reason. The argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The commissioner also contends that, since the taxpayer\u2019s application was based on unclaimed deductions, \u201cthe assessment date for [the taxpayer] for taxes which could have been subject to UJIB deductions would have been the same date by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>which [the taxpayer] was required to claim the deduction and that is September 25, 1982,\u201d the last day of the taxpayer\u2019s fiscal year. This argument is flawed in that it assumes that the last day to claim deductions is the last day of the taxpayer\u2019s fiscal year. Correctly stated, the last day to claim deductions would be no sooner than the date when the taxpayer\u2019s return is to be filed. Moreover, under \u00a7 37, the limitation period runs from the date taxes are \u201cassessed or deemed to be assessed.\u201d Here, as stated above, tax was assessed when the taxpayer filed its Form 355FC, paid the tax due, and the commissioner took no further action. Therefore, we conclude that the taxpayer timely filed its application within two years from the date tax was assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The commissioner\u2019s argument that the decision we reach engenders absurd results is largely addressed in <em>Electronics Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 677. However, one contention merits further comment. The commissioner claims that, under today\u2019s decision, \u201cthe same federal change, no matter how long after the tax year in question, would allow the Commissioner to assess additional taxes he might have missed the first time around even though those changes might be unrelated to the federal change . . . .\u201d While the precise situation is not before us, we note that any such result would appear to be squarely prohibited by the language of G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 30 (1986 ed.). Under that provision, \u201c[i]f ... it shall appear that any tax . . . has not been fully assessed, the commissioner shall, notwithstanding the three-year limitation in section twenty-six, assess an additional tax . . . within one year of the receipt of [the report of change in Federal taxable income] or within two years of the receipt by the commissioner of [relevant] information from the federal government . . . and shall be limited to changes in such person\u2019s tax liability . . . arising out of or related to the items which resulted in the change in federal taxable income . . . .\u201d That section limits the commissioner both as to the time within which additional assessments may be made, and the scope of the issues to which such assessments may relate.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>The commissioner\u2019s other arguments are adequately addressed in <em>Electronics Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra </em>at 674-677.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">3. <em>Disposition. </em>The case is remanded to the Appellate Tax Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\"> The successor in interest to Purity Supreme, Inc., originally the taxpayer in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\"> Under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38F, corporations may deduct amounts for compensation paid to individuals domiciled in an eligible area of substantial proverty. To be eligible for these deductions, the corporation must have a certificate of eligibility from the Federal Urban Jobs Incentive Bureau (UJIB). Thus, we refer to such deductions as the UJIB deductions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b695-10\"> The commissioner\u2019s plea in bar did not contest the facts asserted in the taxpayer\u2019s petition to the board. Therefore, we take the facts set forth in the petition as true. <em>Leonardi </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>355 Mass. 454, 455 (1969). <em>Kalmus </em>v. <em>Kalmus, </em>330 Mass. 41, 42 (1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b695-11\"> The taxpayer simultaneously filed an amended return reflecting the UJIB deductions and requesting a refund.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b696-6\"> The cases cited by the Commissioner are inapposite. In <em>Vespa </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>373 Mass. 857 (1977), a failure to request findings and report constituted a waiver of the right to appeal where the issue was the taxpayer\u2019s domicil. Domicil, as is well recognized, is \u201cmainly a question of <em>fact </em>to be determined from all the evidence\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>358 Mass. 803, 804 (1970), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>284 Mass. 41, 49 (1933). In <em>Assessors of Norwood </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>384 Mass. 699, 700 (1981), and in <em>Stearns </em>v. <em>Assessors of Worcester, </em>376 Mass. 930 (1978), the records were so inadequate that this court was unable to determine whether any issue of law had been raised on appeal. Finally, in <em>Beardsley </em>v. <em>Assessors of Foxborough, </em>369 Mass. 855 (1976), we noted that \u201cthe question whether the evidence warranted a particular finding or a particular ruling of law should be raised by a request filed with the board, and failure to file such a request for a ruling will justify an affirmation of the decision of the board because nothing will be properly before us for review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 856-857 n.3. Here, the simple factual data necessary are properly before us, and the question to be determined is not whether some finding or ruling was warranted by the evidence, but only whether, on the facts which are before us, the abatement applications were or were not timely as a matter of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b697-7\"> The statute is ambiguous. Even if it were to be accepted that the limitation periods on the abatement remedy run from \u201cthe time when the return is filed or required to be filed, whichever occurs later\u201d (G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 26 [a]), we are still left with the question of what is meant by the word \u201creturn.\u201d The term is nowhere defined in the statute. It may be that the word \u201creturn\u201d means \u201cinitial return\u201d or \u201coriginal return,\u201d but no such qualifiers appear in the language of the. statute. Indeed, the commissioner\u2019s own regulations refer to \u201camended returns.\u201d See, e.g., 830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 62C.37.1(4)(b) (1988). It reasonably could be argued that the general term \u201creturn\u201d encompasses both the specifics, \u201coriginal return\u201d and \u201camended return.\u201d It would not be unreasonable to construe that term as also including forms performing the function of a return \u2014 such as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>report of change in Federal income at issue here \u2014 regardless of the label placed on such forms by the commissioner. The Legislature has given no indication as to what is the proper interpretation. We construe the statute in favor of the taxpayer and conclude that the abatement applications here were filed within two years of an assessment under \u00a7 37.
