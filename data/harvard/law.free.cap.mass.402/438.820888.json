Although the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and the answer and amended cross claim of the defendant-interveners raise other issues and claims, all parties agree that the only issue presently before us is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>whether the Attorney General\u2019s certification was erroneous because of the petition\u2019s assertedly inadequate title.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">We first set out a brief overview of the initiative petition process. Under art. 48, \u201cthe people reserve to themselves the popular initiative, which is the power of a specified number of voters to submit constitutional amendments and laws to the people for approval or rejection.\u201d Art. 48, Definition, I. \u201cAn initiative petition shall set forth the full text of the constitutional amendment or law . . . which is proposed by the petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 1. \u201cWhen an initiative petition is originated by ten qualified voters, it is submitted to the Attorney General, who must make certain determinations concerning the form and substance of the measure.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019 n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 209, 217 (1981). If the Attorney General certifies that the petition meets a number of conditions, one of which is \u201cthat the measure and the title thereof are in proper form for submission to the people,\u201d the petition may then be filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth (Secretary). Art. 48, The Initiative, II, \u00a7 3. The Attorney General must prepare a \u201cfair, concise summary\u201d of petitions which he has certified. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis summary is to appear on the top of each blank used to obtain subsequent signatures in support of the measure, and, it will appear on the ballot, if the measure is submitted to the people at a general election.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">If sufficient signatures are timely filed with the Secretary, the Secretary must transmit the measure to the Clerk of the House of Representatives, \u201cand the proposed measure shall then be deemed to be introduced and pending.\u201d Art. 48, The Initiative ,11, \u00a74. If the General Court fails to enact the proposed law before the first Wednesday in May, then the petition will be put on the ballot before the voters if sufficient additional signatures are timely filed. Art. 48, The Initiative, V, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">\u2014 -</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The parties have stipulated as to the following facts. The initiative petition at issue was one of five petitions that were filed with the Attorney General on August 5,1987, each entitled \u201cAn Act repealing the prevailing wage law for the commonwealth and its cities and towns.\u201d These petitions were signed by the same registered voters of the Commonwealth, members of a political action committee dedicated to repealing the \u201cprevailing wage laws.\u201d These petitions were assigned numbers 87-13, 87-14, 87-15, 87-16, and 87-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">On September 4, 1987, the Attorney General certified Initiative Petitions 87-16 and 87-17, and prepared summaries of those petitions. The two petitions were then filed with the Secretary, who provided blank forms for use in obtaining additional signatures of registered voters. Sufficient signatures were obtained on Initiative Petition 87-16 to require its transmission by the Secretary to the Clerk of the House of Representatives. The Secretary transmitted it on January 6, 1988. A sufficient number of signatures was not obtained on Initiative Petition 87-17. Initiative Petition 87-16 was then introduced in the General Court, printed as a bill, and assigned a number in accordance with the usual legislative process. We understand that the Legislature did not enact the bill before the first Wednesday in May, the deadline for legislative action under art. 48, The Initiative, V, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The Attorney General\u2019s summary of the measure states that \u201c[t]he proposed law would repeal state law requiring that the wages, including payments to health and welfare plans, paid to persons employed in the construction of public works be no less than the wages paid locally under existing collective bargaining agreements and understandings, or by the municipality, for the same kind of work. Under the proposed law, the Commissioner of Labor and Industries would no longer set wage rates for such work or classify jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>\u201cThe proposed law would also remove the Commissioner of Labor and Industries\u2019 authority to set the wage rates of employees of contractors who move office furniture and fixtures for the state or a county, city, town or district, and remove the Commissioner\u2019s authority to set the wage rates of operators of vehicles and other equipment engaged in public works.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u201cThe proposed law would not change the way wages are set for laborers employed by the state Department of Public Works and the Metropolitan District Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The measure would accomplish these changes by repealing certain parts of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 26 and 27, and by repealing \u00a7\u00a7 27B, 27F, and 27G in their entirety. Also, a part of the measure not mentioned in the Attorney General\u2019s summary would amend c. 149, \u00a7 27D, by including a definition for the term \u201cpublic works\u201d as used in \u00a7\u00a7 26 to 27C, inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The plaintiffs contend that the initiative petition filed by the defendant-interveners violates art. 48 because the title to the petition, \u201cAn Act repealing the prevailing wage law for the commonwealth and its cities and towns,\u201d is not in \u201cproper form for submission to the people.\u201d They argue that the title to a petition \u201cmust be sufficiently accurate to give fair notice to the legislature and to the voters of the scope and essential nature of the proposed law.\u201d They say that the title to the initiative petition does not meet this standard because the initiative petition would repeal sections of c. 149 that are not part of the \u201cprevailing wage law,\u201d which the plaintiffs confine to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 26-27D; because it does not <em>entirely </em>repeal all sections of the \u201cprevailing wage law\u201d as plaintiffs define that term; and because the title does not give any notice of the definitional change that the petition would make in \u00a7 27D.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We reject the plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, and hold that the Attorney General properly certified the measure and its title as being in \u201cproper form for submission to the people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>As originally adopted, art. 48 merely required the Attorney General\u2019s certification that \u201cthe measure is in proper form for submission to the people.\u201d At that time, art. 48 also provided that the Attorney General had to prepare a \u201cdescription\u201d of the measure. This description appeared both on top of the blanks provided for signers of the initiative petition after the Attorney General\u2019s certification and on the ballot. See <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra </em>at 226-227. \u201cThe purposes of requiring a \u2018description\u2019 were said to be \u2018first, that the signers of an initiative or referendum petition understand the law which they propose to submit to the voters, and, secondly, that the voters understand the law upon which they are voting.\u2019\u201d <em>Bowe </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>320 Mass. 230, 241 (1946), quoting <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>306 Mass. 296, 299 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Problems arose, however, because of the great length and detail required of a \u201cdescription.\u201d <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>327 Mass. 310, 324 (1951). In <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>309 Mass. 631 (1941), the Justices were asked to advise the Legislature on the constitutionality of proposed legislation designed to deal with the fact that a lengthy description tended \u201cto confuse rather than enlighten the voter,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 632. The legislative proposal would have provided for the preparation by the Attorney General of a \u201csummarized description\u201d rather than a \u201ccomplete and comprehensive description\u201d when he believed the latter would be too long and complicated. It also would have provided for the insertion by the Attorney General of a \u201cfair title\u201d for a law proposed by initiative petition, and for the inclusion of that title in copies of the proposed law prepared by the State Secretary. <em>Id. </em>at 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The Justices opined that neither part of the legislation was constitutional. The Legislature could not abridge the detailed description required by art. 48. <em>Id. </em>at 641-644. Furthermore, for the reasons stated below, the Legislature could not require the Attorney General to insert a \u201cfair title\u201d in a proposed law.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">\u201cThe effect of legislation by the people by the initiative method, as of legislation by the General Court, is the enactment of a law. ... It is for the petitioners to determine the text of the law that is to be submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>\u201cIn our opinion the principle above stated applies to the insertion in the petition ... of \u2018a fair title of the proposed law,\u2019 determined by the Attorney General ....</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u201cThough there is no constitutional requirement that an act passed by the General Court bear a title, it has long been the practice that it should do so. And such a \u2018title is in a legal sense apart of every statute and may be considered in determining its construction.\u2019 <em>Wheelwright </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>235 Mass. 584, 586. . . . [T]he title of such an act ... is an expression of the legislative will.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u201c. . . [W]e are of opinion that a title attached to a proposed law contained in an initiative petition constitutes a part of the \u2018full text\u2019 of such proposed law, and that the General Court has no power to authorize the Attorney General to change such \u2018full text,\u2019 either by adding thereto a title where none was attached to the proposed law by the petitioners, or by changing the title of a proposed law attached thereto by the petitioners.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>at 637-640.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">That advisory opinion was handed down on June 23, 1941, and less than three weeks later the General Court in joint session agreed to enact what is now art. 74. It was again agreed to in joint session in 1943, and approved and ratified by the people in 1944. See <em>Bowe </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra </em>at 242. That amendment to art. 48 relaxed the rigid requirements of the \u201cdescription\u201d by requiring the Attorney General to prepare a \u201cfair, concise summary\u201d instead. <em>Id. </em>at 243. As amended by art. 74, art. 48 for the first time also required the Attorney General to certify that \u201cthe measure <em>and the title thereof axe </em>in proper form for submission to the people\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">In <em>Bowe </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra, </em>decided just two years after the amendment of art. 48 by art. 74, we disposed of a challenge to the form of proposed laws and their titles in a manner that effectively refutes the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the title of the initiative petition in this case. We said there that, \u201c[s]o far as the proposed laws may concern matters excluded from the initiative, the questions argued will be considered later. Apart from such matters, there is no legal test by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>which the proposed laws and their titles can be held improper in form for submission to the people. There is still no requirement that a proposed law shall bear a title <em>(Opinion of the Justices, </em>309 Mass. 631, 638, et seq.) except such intimation as may be contained in Amendment 74, \u00a7 1. <em>Nowhere is it provided that the title of a proposed law shall be descriptive of it to any particular degree, or wholly accurate so far as it is </em>descriptive\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 240-241.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">We continue to adhere to our statement in <em>Bowe </em>that \u201c[n]owhere is it provided that the title of a proposed law shall be descriptive of it to any particular degree, or wholly accurate so far as it is descriptive.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accord <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>357 Mass. 787, 801-802 (1970) (majority opinion). The legislative history and structure of art. 48 demonstrate that the \u201cproper form\u201d requirement is not intended to require a title to give fair notice of the scope and essential nature of the underlying measure. Had the Legislature desired a title that was \u201cfair\u201d or that gave \u201cfair notice,\u201d it would have said so, as it did in the proposed legislation commented on in <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>309 Mass. 631 (1941), which would have required that the Attorney General insert a \u201cfair title.\u201d Instead, having been apprised by the <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra, </em>that the title to an act was part of its \u201cfull text,\u201d and \u201can expression of the legislative will,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 640, the Legislature delegated to the Attorney General the task of providing the public with an objective, accurate, and readable account of the measure solely through the preparation of a \u201cfair, concise summary,\u201d rather than through both a \u201cfair summary\u201d and a \u201cfair title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Rather than being scrutinized for fairness, the title, as an integral part of the measure itself, was to be treated the same as the rest of the proposed law and checked only for \u201cproper form.\u201d The debate concerning the original adoption of the \u201cproper form\u201d requirement reveals that the framers of art. 48 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>were primarily concerned with avoiding errors of draftsmanship. See generally 2 Debates in the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention, 1917-1918, The Initiative and Referendum, at 723-730 (1918). Cf. <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 209, 236-237 (1981) (example of drafting error). But cf. <em>Paisner </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>390 Mass. 593, 598 (1983) (rejecting \u201cnarrow and technical\u201d reading of \u201cproper form\u201d requirement while holding that a proposed measure is not in \u201cproper form\u201d if it is not in the form of a law).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Thus, as originally proposed by Mr. Quincy of Boston, certification as to the form of a measure was required by <em>either </em>the Attorney General <em>or </em>an officer of the General Court whose duty was to assist in the drafting of bills. Debates, <em>supra </em>at 723. In moving that Mr. Quincy\u2019s version be amended to restrict certification to the Attorney General, Mr. Churchill of Amherst said that \u201cthe object is this: That we shall have a responsible officer ... to certify that there are no mistakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">. . . That such mistakes are possible, Mr. President, even under the most careful, painstaking handling of the drafting of bills, every member of the Legislature knows . . . [including] mistakes which would change even the complete nature of a bill.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 724. See also remarks of Mr. Quincy at 729-730 (\u201cMy whole effort in originating this suggestion . . . was to provide some competent legal revision of an initiative measure before it started\u201d); remarks of Mr. Walker of Brookline at 730 (if \u201ca measure was not in such form that the Attorney-General thought it wise,\u201d Attorney General could send originators of measure to Legislature\u2019s bill-drafting department, assuming one were to be created); remarks of Mr. Parker of Lancaster at 727 (amendment proposed by Mr. Quincy was \u201cto make provision for verbal correction, possibly for verbal transposition, possibly improvement in the phrase and text of the initiative measure\u201d; the Attorney General was the proper officer \u201cto have the spontaneous wish of the people revised and put in intelligent form\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">However, this check of form was not to become an inquiry into substance, see remarks of Mr. Churchill at 729 (\u201cIt is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>question of what is contained in it; it is a question of its form\u201d). Moreover, according to Mr. Parker of Lancaster, the Attorney General was to be \u201cnot the censor, but the aid and interpreter of the people\u2019s will\u201d; and \u201cif we are to have the initiative and referendum . . . [l]et the people speak freely, act freely; . . . [l]et there be as little restraint as possible, and let it be exercised by that officer who would be most impartial the Attorney-General.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">We believe that the plaintiffs\u2019 suggested standard is incompatible with the goal that \u201cthe people [should] speak freely . . . [and with] as little restraint as possible.\u201d The structure of art. 48 makes it clear that the voters do not need the title of an act to give fair notice of the scope and essential nature of the act. It is the <em>summary </em>that appears both on the ballot and on the top of the signature forms, and <em>not </em>the title (or text) of the Act. The summary serves the same purposes formerly served by the description, to inform both potential signers and voters of the contents of the proposed law. <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>348 Mass. 671, 674 (1965). Although, according to the stipulation of the parties, the title to an initiative petition has appeared as part of the full text of a measure in the voter information pamphlet which is mailed to every voter in the State, see art. 48, General Provisions, IV; G. L. c. 54, \u00a7 53, it is only sent together with the summary and other supporting material. Furthermore, because titles are usually short, <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>309 Mass. 631, 639 (1941), they are not practical vehicles for conveying the desired information, especially if the measure is complex or contains several related subjects. Finally, any harm caused by a misleading title can be corrected by an accurate summary, see <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>at 640-641. There is therefore no need for the title to give the voters fair notice of the contents of the proposed act. Cf. <em>Bowe </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>320 Mass. 230, 240 (1946) (title may not be required at all).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Additionally, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that a sufficiently accurate or descriptive title is required for the benefit of the Legislature, which is given a chance to enact an initiative petition before it is submitted to the voters. Legislators appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>to be in basically the same position regarding the title to an initiative petition as they are in regard to the title of every other bill that comes before the Legislature. See <em>Proprietors of Mills </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>157 Mass. 345, 350 (1892) (no constitutional requirement that subject of bill be expressed in title). In any case, it does not seem unreasonable to expect legislators to read at least the Attorney General\u2019s summary of an initiative, if not the full text. We also reject the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that a sufficiently accurate or descriptive title is required to aid subsequent judicial construction of a law enacted by initiative petition. Cf. <em>Opinion of the Justices, supra </em>at 639-640 (title can.be useful in construing ambiguous statutes). The courts have been able to interpret legislation passed by the General Court in the absence of any requirement that legislative titles provide fair notice of the scope and essential nature of the legislation, and are undoubtedly equally capable when it comes to interpreting laws enacted by initiative petition. We therefore reject the standards proposed by plaintiffs and amicus curiae and reaffirm our holding in <em>Bowe </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The Attorney General was correct in certifying that the \u201cmeasure and the title thereof are in proper form for submission to the people,\u201d and we therefore order that judgment be entered for the defendants on the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b453-4\"> Except as otherwise indicated, references to art. 48 are intended to refer to art. 48 as amended by art. 74, by art. 81, and by art. 108 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b453-5\"> The text of the initiative petition is as follows: \u201cAN ACT REPEALING THE PREVAILING WAGE LAW FOR THE COMMONWEALTH AND ITS CITIES AND TOWNS Be it enacted by the People, and by their authority.

See <em>Paisner </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>390 Mass. 593, 598 (1983) (Attorney General has duty not to certify initiative petitions not in the form of a law).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
