The allegations of the petition as to what was said and done by the police judge at that time being controverted by the return to this court, evidence was received in that behalf.  Upon that issue we find that the judge orally rendered and pronounced judgment and sentence that the defendant pay a fine in the latter\u2019s presence, but did not state to him that he be confined in the county jail in the event that such fine be not paid. However, the judge did then write upon the complaint, \u201cor 180 days,\u201d and two days later the judge wrote on the complaint, \u201cgiven to 'July 3rd to get the fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Respondent interposes a preliminary objection that petitioner has mistaken his remedy, and that even though the facts be as claimed by him, he may secure relief by appeal, and not otherwise. We have no doubt that if petitioner\u2019s contention is sound as to the main legal issue involved, his only speedy and adequate remedy is through a writ of <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The issue presented resolves itself into this: Are the words, \u201cor 180 days,\u201d written by the police judge at the time of pronouncing sentence in open court, legally a part of the judgment? If so, of course, since it is undisputed that the fine has not been paid, the imprisonment is regular and lawful. If not, the commitment is unauthorized and the petitioner\u2019s imprisonment is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">It is most seriously argued that since, if the conviction be of a misdemeanor, section 1193 of the Penal Code permits judgment to be pronounced in the absence of the defendant, the sentence may be written by the court and need not be stated orally. But we think that in so far as the question here involved is concerned the controlling word in the above section is \u201cpronounced.\u201d The only decision which we have been able to find bearing upon the subject suggesting a judicial definition of the word \u201cpronounce\u201d is <em>Ex parte Crawford, </em>36 Tex. Cr. 180 [36 S. W. 92], It is there stated that to \u201cpronounce sentence\u201d is to \u201cutter formally, officially, or solemnly; to declare or affirm.\u201d Wherever in the Penal Code the sentencing of convicted persons is the subject of legislation, the court\u2019s. action in that behalf is designated as the \u201cpronouncement of sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>tence,\u201d or some other form of the word \u201cpronounce\u201d is employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">To \u201cpronounce\u201d always implies uttering, speaking, orally declaring that which is pronounced. Webster defines it as, \u201cto give an articulate utterance to; to make sounds of.\u201d Without an oral articulation of a sentence, it would not he pronounced. To write a sentence is not the pronouncing of it. Nor do we find any provision in the law for judgment being rendered in a criminal case by the court writing it. We conclude that in this instance the only sentence which was given was that which was pronounced orally, and that the words written by the judge, \u201cor 180 days,\u201d form no part of this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The writ is granted and the petitioner is discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Works, P. J., and Thompson, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
