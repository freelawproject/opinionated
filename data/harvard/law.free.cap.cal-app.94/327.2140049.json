In a conversation with the defendant, plaintiff told him of his necessity, and defendant asked what price he would take for the property. Plaintiff named a price, net to himself. A few days later defendant told plaintiff that he had a cash buyer for the property, but that in order to turn it plaintiff would have to increase a mortgage on the property to about half the price. Defendant negotiated and procured a loan for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">Thereafter defendant told plaintiff that the trade he had in mind was the transfer to plaintiff of a note for $8,000 secured by mortgage on land in San Bernardino County; that the maker of the note was then in San Francisco raising the money to pay it off, and it would be practically a cash transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Plaintiff, at defendant\u2019s instance, gave escrow instructions to a bank to deliver the deed of his property upon receiving in exchange, for him, the note and mortgage and assignment of the same. Plaintiff executed his deed to defendant as grantee, the latter having represented to him that the real party in interest did not wish to take the title to the property at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">This transaction was consummated in the latter part of April, 1924, and the original complaint in this action was filed August 13, 1924. Plaintiff\u2019s subsequent investigations disclosed that there was no prospect of the mortgage note being paid and that the property securing the mortgage was worth about $2,500. He made a sale of the note and mortgage after the commencement of the action and realized about $2,000 net.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">This case was tried without a jury, and findings of fact were made by the court establishing the truth of all of the allegations of the complaint, and the conclusions of law drawn from the findings were in favor of the plaintiff, and judgment was rendered accordingly. In his opening brief appellant states that, \u201cthe testimony being in open conflict on practically every material issue involved, appellant on this appeal concedes that unless the judgment is erroneous as a matter of law it cannot be disturbed in view of the conflicting nature of the testimony.\u201d In view of this frank statement we are somewhat at a loss to Imow why this appeal was prosecuted, as all of appellant\u2019s assignments for reversal seem to be based on alleged defects in the evidence. The first assignment is that there is no evidence to support the finding that defendant was plaintiff\u2019s agent in the transaction. A consideration of the brief recital of facts appearing in evidence, given above, shows that the objection is without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The second and third assignments are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">\u201cThe judgment is erroneous, as the plaintiff by his actions waived the fraud.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">\u201cThe judgment is erroneous, as the plaintiff\u2019s rights were lost by laches.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Neither of these matters is set up as a defense by appellant, or was presented to the trial court, and the court made no findings as to either of them. In the absence of pleadings such defenses are not available. <em>(Wienke </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>179 Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>220 [176 Pac. 42]; <em>Larkin </em>v. <em>Mullen, </em>128 Cal. 449 [60 Pac. 1091].) Furthermore, the defenses are not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The fourth and last assignment is that the court \u201cerred in awarding damages prior to foreclosure of the mortgage.\u201d It-is not claimed that the plaintiff did not get full value on his sale of the note and mortgage, and the only argument made in support of the contention is that, \u201cThe code provision of this state directs that an action founded on any note secured on any property must be exhausted against the security itself.\u201d Presumably this is a reference to section 726 of the Code of Civil Procedure, relating to actions for recovery of a debt or enforcement of a right secured by a mortgage. As this is not such an action, the code provision has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Nourse, J., and Koford, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
