There were two others charged in the same information, who were both found not guilty of the charge of grand theft, but one of whom (Joe Young) plead guilty and the other (Villarreal) was found guilty of violating section 146 of the Vehicle Act. (Stats. 1923, p. 517.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">The first contention of appellants is that it was prejudicial error for the court to admit testimony as to certain things which occurred after the ear had been abandoned by all of the defendants, particularly objecting to the testimony of a police officer. However, this evidence came out only by way of rebuttal to the testimony of the appealing defendants that they went directly to their home and that neither of them accompanied the others to the place where the machine was finally abandoned, or where the other defendants got into an altercation with parties not connected with the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">As to the- second objection, that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict as to appellants, an examination of the entire transcript discloses there was sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>circumstantial, if not direct, evidence to show that the defendants were guilty of violating at least that part of section 146 of the Vehicle Act as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-5\">\u201cAny person who assists, or is a party or accessory to or an accomplice in, any such stealing, or unauthorized taking or driving, shall also be deemed guilty of a felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The judgments against the defendants Gilbert Parra and Prank Olazabel, respectively, are hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Conrey, P.
