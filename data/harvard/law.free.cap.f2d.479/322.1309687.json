Also appellant gave a \u201cNo\u201d answer to question 8(a), which was false because he was then under indictment for possession of marijuana, but the giving- of this statement was not charged as an offense. His explanation for answer 8(a) was that he did not understand the question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b379-25\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b379-26\">Appellant was convicted of violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for making, in connection with the purchase of two rifles, a false statement that he had not been convicted of a crime punishable by a term exceeding one year. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-27\">Appellant contends that the government failed to prove that he <em>knowingly </em>made a false statement. Joseph McBride, the person with whom appellant dealt in the gun shop, testified that he read to appellant paragraph 8(b) of Form 4473, Firearms Transactions Record (Department of the Treasury, Revised June 1970). Paragraph 8 of the form appears in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 8(b). McBride then asked appellant to read the statement himself and sign it. Appellant signed the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-28\">Appellant admitted signing the form and acknowledged that McBride read to him the questions under paragraph 8. But he testified that he thought 8(b) meant whether he \u201chad been in prison in over a year.\u201d He admitted to having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>been in prison but stated he did not know that this disqualified him from making the firearms purchases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Earlier cases recognized the difficulties of proving that a false statement had been \u201cknowingly\u201d made in the purchase of a firearm, where the purchaser had signed the original version of Form 4473.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That version provided for the buyer\u2019s signature in a space on the top half of a form, directly under a certification that the signatory was not prohibited from receiving a firearm, but the persons prohibited were only listed at the bottom of the form. The first revision of Form 4473 placed the space for signature directly under a list of persons prohibited from receiving firearms. The second revision included an additional requirement that the buyer give a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer for each separate inquiry concerning each class of prohibited persons. It was this second revised form which was read to appellant and which he signed. Later cases have recognized that the revised forms eliminate much of the difficulty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Proof of knowingly making a false statement is necessarily circumstantial in the great majority of cases. In this case the trier of fact, presented with the evidence we have described, could conclude beyond reasonable doubt that appellant\u2019s statements were knowingly false although he testified that he only misunderstood.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Appellants\u2019 other claims \u2014 that the status of the gun shop as a licensed dealer was not properly proved,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that the record of his prior conviction was not properly authenticated \u2014 are wholly lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-11\">. \u201c\u00a7 922.

Defendant had signed the original version of Form 4473, the government offered no evidence other than the form, defendant twice told the judge he did not know the purchase was prohibited by law, the government offered nothing to contradict defendant\u2019s statements.
