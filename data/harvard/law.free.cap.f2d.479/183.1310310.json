When the Commission refused, the NCTA brought this suit in the District Court for a stay of the rulemaking and for an order to produce the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-18\">Immediately before the hearing for preliminary relief in the District Court, but after the period allowed by the Commission for comments on the rules, the Commission filed a motion and memorandum alleging that \u201ccircumstances\u201d had changed, proffering a number of the documents theretofore denied, and requesting dismissal or summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-19\"> The District Court denied the motion for preliminary relief and no appeal was noted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It held two hearings, received testimony from Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>staff members, and granted summary-judgment for the Commission on the following oral statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\">To me, what you are seeking are the work papers and internal memo-randa of this agency to which I do not believe you are entitled. What you want are the tapes, the yellow work sheets and possibly to pick somebody\u2019s brain. I do not think you have made out a case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">We reverse. Summary judgment may be granted only if the moving party proves that no substantial and material facts are in dispute and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To prevail, the defending agency must prove that each document that falls within the class requested either has been produced, is unidentifiable, or is wholly exempt from the Act\u2019s inspection requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Measured against this requirement, summary judgment was improper. Some of the facts necessary to the Commission\u2019s defenses find no support in the evidence and others of those facts are directly contradicted by evidence elicited by the NCTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">I. The Rulemaking Proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">On February 19, 1970, \u25a0 the Federal Communications Commission released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making which set forth an alteration \u2014 and substantial increase \u2014 in its license \u201cfee schedule.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The February Notice proposed extension of fees beyond applicants for licenses to also include operators of community antenna television (CATV) systems and users of the Commission\u2019s radio frequency equipment testing services. It also proposed that the fees, which had previously been designed to reimburse the government for twenty-five percent of the Commission\u2019s budget, be raised approximately three hundred percent, thus making the Commission self-supporting.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">The result was a predictable storm of protest. At first directed at the Commission\u2019s power to impose the fees, the attack eventually shifted to the way in which the proposed scheme would allocate the costs of regulation among the regulated industries and their constituent members. In response to the latter, the Commission issued a Supplemental Notice in March of 1970.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The March Notice purported to provide a breakdown of the costs of operating the Commission into the cost of operating each of its six major offices and bureaus.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-14\">Taken together, the February and March notices asserted that the proposed schedule would assess each Commission-regulated industry in accordance with a formula that may be briefly described. The cost of operating each office with direct responsibility for regulating an industry was computed. Next, that part of the cost of each office without a direct regulatory responsibility that could be directly traced to a particular industry was charged to that industry. Then all remaining costs were lumped together and each was assigned a share of that cost equal to its percentage share of the directly assigned costs. Finally, the sum of these items, called the \u201ccost factor,\u201d was adjusted to reflect certain intangibles, such as the \u201cvalue to the recipient\u201d of the privileges granted it by the Commission.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>After setting forth this generalized explanation of its approach, however, the Commission failed to supply specifics, either as to the facts from which it had reasoned or as to the mechanical steps it had taken in deriving the final schedule.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Without data concerning the Commission\u2019s costs, it is not possible to determine the basis upon which the Commission allocated its direct and indirect costs among the regulated industries. Without disclosure of the final amount the Commission intended to recover from each industry, it is not possible to determine what, if any, noncost adjustments were made and whether the final schedule had any relation to the cost allocation. And without a definition and quantification of \u201cvalue to the recipient\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it is not possible to determine why and how the Commission might be deviating from a pure system of cost allocation. Thus, the Commission insulated itelf from external criticism of its method and rationale, leaving nothing open to challenge except the legality of its result.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">The NCTA, as the chief trade association of the CATV industry, wished to file comments concerning the proposed fee schedule. Faced with the opaque notices just described, it requested an opportunity to inspect several categories of documents that the NCTA believed the Commission would have in its files.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> One category was \u201cthe documents, listings and records used to determine the \u2018 \u201cvalue to the recipient\u201d of the privileges granted\u2019 as referred to in the [February] <em>Notice.\u201d </em>The other catego-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>r\u00edes all related to the facts and reasons that supported the \u201ccost factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">II. The Documents Sought by the NCTA</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">As a consequence of the Commission\u2019s midnight production of most of the requested materials, after the close of the rulemaking but prior to the first hearing in the District Court, only three of the categories remained to be considered by the Court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since the District Court\u2019s ruling does not indicate the grounds on which it based its grant of summary judgment, we must examine the record on each of these categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">A. The Two \u201cCost Factor\u201d Categories The February Notice stated that the total cost of regulation was that stated in the Commission\u2019s budget for the relevant year.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, the NCTA\u2019s request to inspect documents was phrased in terms of classes of documents that supported the budget and the allocation of budgeted costs among the regulated industries. The first two categories requested were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">1. The supportive documents used to arrive at the Commission\u2019s budget for fiscal year 1971 ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">2. The documents, listings and records used to determine the \u201cdirect and indirect cost to the Government\u201d of the privileges granted the CATV industry for fiscal year 1971.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">Access to the first group of documents would permit the NCTA to check the accuracy of the Commission\u2019s breakdown of its costs. Access to the second would enable it to determine which parts of the budget had been assigned to the cost of CATV regulation, and compare them with the budget breakdown to determine whether all of the costs assigned to CATV were consistent with the budget. By adding together the costs listed under the second category, the NCTA would be able to challenge both the fairness of the charge and the accuracy of the Commission\u2019s addition.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-24\">In response to the first item, the Commission provided the NCTA with a copy of its budget \u201crequest,\u201d a document prepared for the Bureau of the Budget. The \u201crequest\u201d itemized the Commission\u2019s proposed expenditures for fiscal year 1971, but requested fifty percent more money than the Bureau finally cleared for submission to Congress as the \u201cbudget.\u201d The Commission produced nothing in response to the second item.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-25\">At the hearing in the District Court, the Commission produced the head of its budget office for examination by the NCTA. Asked for an explanation of the Commission\u2019s procedures, he testified that he had prepared the budget \u201crequest\u201d from a variety of documents submitted by the Commission\u2019s various organizational units, in accordance with a memorandum of instruction from the Commission itself. He further testified that these documents were still in the possession of the Commission, but he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>argued that these were not \u201csupporting\u201d documents to the final budget, apparently on the theory that the budget \u201crequest\u201d had intervened. The latter, he said, \u201cis really the supportive document\u201d for the Congressional budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The second request was for the documents that supported the assignment of part of the Commission\u2019s budgeted costs to CATV. The Commission\u2019s witness testified that there were no such documents. He said that he had compiled the relevant data from the budget by using yellow sheets of paper and adding machine tapes, and had preserved only the final totals. These, he testified, were the figures included in the March Notice. The NCTA avowed that it could not duplicate the Commission\u2019s figures by this means. While we can sympathize with this statement, for the reason that there appear to be contradictions in this account of the Commission\u2019s procedures,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we think that the Commission has adequately shown that there exist no documents in the category specified in the second request.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">B. The \u201cValue to the Recipient\u201d Category</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The Commission produced the official who had originally refused the NCTA\u2019s request for inspection to testify on the request for \u201cdocuments, listings and records used to determine the \u2018value to the recipient\u2019 of the privileges granted\u201d by the Commission. Adhering generally to the affidavit he had filed in support of the motion for summary judgment, this witness testified that the Commission itself, after receiving from its budget office a figure for the total \u201ccost factor\u201d for each industry, worked from this to obtain the fee schedule by taking account of statutority designated factors, including \u201cvalue to the recipient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ar\">He stated that, as set forth in his letter to the NCTA on behalf of the Commission, the Commission had relied upon \u201cthe knowledge and financial aspects of the communications industry acquired over the years from vast numbers of confidential financial statements, confidential staff memoranda, and various trade publications.\u201d While asserting that the Commission had only relied on them \u201cin part\u201d for its noncost adjustments, he did testify that the Commission still had these documents. He added that the NCTA had been denied them because the request \u201cwas so indefinite that it was difficult to identify and assemble without totally unreasonable expenditure of Commission manpower.\u201d Also, he said, some of the documents were confidential. Elaborating with respect to the internal memoranda, he said:</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">[Q. W]ith respect to the approach taken, the degree used, is there a conclusion reached [in the memoranda] as to the approach as to the degree of value with respect to the CATV industry, all of them mentioned in the Commission\u2019s rule making proposal ? Were any factual conclusions reached that were put on paper?</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">A. It\u2019s very difficult to distinguish between actual conclusions and an opinion of the writer, an advocacy of a certain point of view. This is a very sensitive program and there were some very strongly held views amongst the staff and amongst the Commissioners; and <em>these internal staff memoranda contain these views and these </em>advocacies.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Insofar as the NCTA\u2019s request went to the trade publications and the \u201cconfidential financial statements,\u201d no further testimony was taken. Since the witness had testified that no \u201cfinancial statements\u201d had been received from the CATV industry, it is possible that the NCTA does not want to inspect them. Indeed, the Commission\u2019s affidavit broadly asserted that CATV is \u201cNCTA\u2019s sole concern\u201d \u2014 although this could either be a representation of NCTA\u2019s position or a claim, contrary to the Act, that NCTA needed a more direct interest to support a right to inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">But, since the NCTA could hardly comment on the adjustments for \u201cvalue to the recipient\u201d without knowing the comparative status of other assessed industries, the NCTA\u2019s request seems more likely to encompass all of the Commission\u2019s supporting documents. And, since the actual wording of the request included all of the documents, the question whether they must be produced remains.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">III. Disposition by Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">In response to the Commission\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the District Court ordered the Commission to produce witnesses who could testify concerning the Commission\u2019s procedures and whether documents existed within the categories requested by the NCTA. It then required the NCTA to examine those witnesses, identify the documents it sought, and show that they were not exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">We think this procedure was based on an erroneous construction of the Act\u2019s requirements. The Commission could not rest on the blanket allegations of compliance, unidentifiability, and exemption that it made in its motion for summary judgment and supporting affidavit. Nor did the testimony elicited by the NCTA supply the missing evidence. Rather, it further undercut the Commission\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">The motion for summary judgment should have been denied, and the Commission should have been required to go on and prove the missing elements of its defenses as set forth below. On remand this can be done either in support' of a renewed motion or at a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">A. Identifiable Records</p>\n<p id=\"b246-16\">Apparently ignorant of the Commission\u2019s internal operations and filing system, the NCTA identified the requested documents in terms of the functions they had served in the Commission\u2019s development of the proposed fee schedule. Thus, before the Commission could comply with the request, it would have to identify the documents more specifically, as, for example, by name and file number. To do this the Commission would have to retrace the steps taken in the development of the rulemaking notice. The Commission has steadfastly refused to undertake this task, and the ruling of the District Court upheld this refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-17\">The Freedom of Information Act does not require that a person identify records by providing the agency with a complete description down to the last detail of title and file number. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATE\">[E]ach agency, on request for <em>identifiable </em>records made in accordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees to the extent authorized by statute, and procedure to be followed, shall make the records promptly available to any person.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-18\">This language places part of the responsibility for identifying the records on the agency itself. The responsibility of the person requesting the records is that he provide sufficient information to permit the agency to accomplish this duty.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Problems of construction arise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>when we attempt to determine how much effort the requesting party must make, and how much he may leave to the agency, realizing always that he may be required to reimburse the agency for its efforts.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The legislative history provides us little added guidance, suggesting only that we look to our decisions construing the discovery rules applicable in civil cases and advising that, while requests must be \u201creasonably identifiable,\u201d the requirement should not be used as a device to withhold records.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Our earlier cases have taken a pragmatic approach to this problem, attempting to draw lines that comport with the overall purposes of the Act.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Wfe think our opinion in Bristol-Myers v. F. T. C.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> is controlling in this case. Additionally, it provides guidance in any attempt to articulate more generally the balance to be struck in cases involving attempts to inspect agency documents used to formulate proposed or final rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">In <em>Bristol-Myers </em>the District Court refused to enter an order compelling the Federal Trade Commission to produce documents described and identified by the Company in terms of the function that they served in the development of proposed rules regulating the advertisement of certain drugs. The basis for that ruling was a narrow interpretation of the identifiability requirement in the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-14\">An identifiable record necessarily means a record that is described with sufficient precision in order that by ministerial action of some subordinate the document can be identified and selected out of the files. It does not mean that the head of an agency or his immediate assistant must use judgment in seeking through the file to determine whether a particular document is within the classification asked for. That would be an unreasonable request.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">We reversed, and pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-16\">The F.T.C. can hardly claim that it was unable to ascertain which documents were sought by Bristol-Myers. The Commission relied on certain materials in promulgating its proposed rule, and referred to them in announcing the rulemaking proceeding. These materials are adequately identified in</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>The Federal Communications. Commission now argues, as it did in its motion for summary judgment, that this language is inapplicable in the case before us for the reason that it did not \u201crely on\u201d or \u201crefer to\u201d any documents in its February and March notices, but to its \u201cknowledge\u201d acquired from documents.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We think that the Commission misreads both our opinion in <em>Bristol-Myers </em>and the underlying purpose of our holding there. We did not impose a requirement that the notice directly refer to or rely on the documents to be disclosed. In fact, the request in <em>Bristol-Myers </em>did not differ from the request involved here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">The petition filed by Bristol-Myers with the F.T.C. sought the identification and disclosure of \u201ceach item of material, whatever its form or nature, which . . . has contributed to or constitutes\u201d the \u201cextensive staff investigation,\u201d \u201caccumulated experience,\u201d \u201cavailable studies and reports\u201d and \u201cother things\u201d referred to in the [Federal Trade] Commission\u2019s Notice [of proposed rulemaking.] <footnotemark>25</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">The scope of the agency\u2019s responsibility to identify its own documents may be further delineated by examining a second request by Bristol-Myers, one which we said might present a plausible claim of unidentifiability by the Federal Trade Commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">The petition also sought each item which has contributed to or constitutes information concerning the effect of any analgesic and information concerning the accuracy of appellant\u2019s assertions concerning the effects of various ingredients of its own analgesic products.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-15\">This request undoubtedly extended beyond the documents that the F.T.C. itself possessed. Moreover, it was not apparent that the Commission had at any time either indexed its files in a way that would enable it to locate what it did have, or that it had ever brought the materials together for a common purpose or otherwise acted on them as a group. Thus, the requested documents could not be identified by retracing a path already trodden. It would have required a wholly new enterprise, potentially requiring a search of every file in the possession of the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-16\">Once the request has been made as specific as the agency\u2019s public statements permit, <em>Bristol-Myers </em>teaches: (1) If the agency has previously identified a class or category of documents in the normal course of its affairs, it must produce them in response to a request phrased in terms of the class or category. (2) If the agency has never segregated that class or category, production may be required where the agency may be able to identify that material with reasonable effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-17\">Even where an agency has previously identified a class of materials, the passage of time may work such changes in the agency\u2019s personnel and records that production requires that identification begin anew. In such circumstances, production may be required only if the task imposed on the agency is not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-18\">Where rulemaking proceedings have taken place, the agency has, by definition, already identified its sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>porting documents. Indeed, it would be a most reasonable practice for the agency to retain the documents as a group or index them for future retrieval. It would be most difficult to rebut the presumption that the agency would be able to produce the documents at least until the validity of its rule has been finally adjudicated in the courts.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Finally, <em>Bristol-Myers </em>establishes that the specificity with which the agency has identified documents in its public statements is relevant only to the requirement that the request be as specific as reasonably possible. It is not relevant to the question whether the agency can be required to identify and allow inspection of the requested records under section 552(a) (3).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In the present case the Commission has refused either to state that it did not make use of a mass of financial documents or to identify them. In fact, the District Court openly invited the former response' from the Commission witnesses, but they repeatedly asserted that there was a documentary basis for the Commission\u2019s action, although it had not been identified in the notices of rulemaking.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The NCTA phrased its request as specifically as the Commission\u2019s public notices reasonably permitted. Accordingly, the Commission should have been required to identify, at least by relevant classes and subclasses, all the documents that it had used to support its proposed rule. Then it should have been required to establish which of those documents were exempt from disclosure under the applicable provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">Much of this has now been done, albeit by the NGTA through its examination of Commission staff members. But there remains a substantial factual issue as to whether the Commission relied on trade publications and confidential reports, rather than vague concepts of the profitability of its regulated industries, in preparing its fee schedule. On remand, the Commission should be required to specify, by relevant category and subcategory, which \u2014 if any \u2014 of these materials it used.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">For the future we think that these matters should be settled through the discovery process as much as possible. The civil rules governing pretrial discovery provide ample tools for use in compelling the agency to identify and disclose the documents it has that fall within the class or category requested.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In addition to facilitating the disposition of these cases by summary judgment, this approach will enable the requesting person to narrow his request if he discovers that he wants only a part of the supporting documents that the agency identifies in response to his discovery requests.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>B. The Commission\u2019s Exemption Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Because of the confusion involved in identifying the documents that existed within the scope of the NCTA\u2019s request in this case, the District Court was entirely diverted from the necessary inquiry into the exemptions now claimed by the Commission. Indeed, the oral ruling of the District Court denied the NCTA\u2019s entire request on the ground that the \u201cyellow work sheets\u201d and adding machine tapes used to prepare the \u201ccost factor\u201d from the budget were exempt. Yet, so far as we can determine, these were the only \u201cdocuments\u201d that the hearing showed not to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">On the record before us, we perceive two possible exemptions that might justify withholding part of the material that the Commission admits it possesses. Under the applicable case law, however, neither would justify nondisclosure on this record, and the Commission must be required to establish the exemptions on the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">1. Intra-agency Memoranda</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The Commission asserted below that inspection of the memoranda used in the preparation of the budget \u201crequest\u201d and the memoranda used to determine the \u201cvalue to the recipient of the privileges granted\u201d could not be ordered. It pointed to section 552(b) (5) of the Act, which exempts \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The District Court made no further inquiry into the matter, and the Commission produced nothing except a flat assertion that the documents \u201ccontained\u201d policy arguments and were \u201cconfidential.\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-16\">Both our own cases <footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding in Environmental Protection Agency v. Mink<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> make it clear that this is insufficient. In <em>Mink </em>the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-17\">Congress sensibly discarded a wooden exemption that could have meant disclosure of manifestly private and confidential policy recommendations simply because the document containing them also happened to contain factual data. That decision should not be taken, however, to embrace an equally wooden exemption permitting the withholding of factual material otherwise available on discovery merely because it was placed in a memorandum with matters of law, policy or opinion.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-18\">This distinction is particularly important here, where the memoranda at issue relate to the development of a fee schedule said to have been derived from cost data and collections of financial reports. The Commission must show that any factual matter in the memoranda is so \u201cintertwined with policymaking processes\u201d that it would violate the purpose of the exemption to disclose it.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-19\"><em>Mink </em>went on to point out that the District Court may use a variety of tools in making this determination, including, but not limited to, <em>in camera </em>inspection of some or all of the documents.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Additionally, we note that the District Court in the Southern District of New York has recently resolved such a Freedom of Information Act case by appointing a Master and delegating the task of <em>in camera </em>inspection to him.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>2. Confidential Financial Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">It is equally unclear whether the \u201cconfidential financial statements\u201d that the Commission allegedly used in determining \u201cvalue to the recipient of the privileges granted\u201d fall within the scope of the Act\u2019s exemption for \u201ctrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The exemption does not protect all data contained in such filings, but only that information which cannot be rendered sufficiently anonymous by deletion of the filing party\u2019s name and other identifying information.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In those cases in which the party that filed the statement is so large or unique that disclosure of the data itself would destroy the confidentiality of that party, it is conceivable that total nondisclosure would be justified. But the Commission\u2019s witnesses testified that there are many thousands of such statements filed over a long period of time, and it seems highly improbable that the Commission will be able to establish that they must all be withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">This, too, will be an appropriate subject for the District Court on the remand, armed with the flexible tools cited by <em>Mink. </em>In particular, the Court should take note of the Supreme Court\u2019s suggestion that representative samples of the statements be examined, rather than the thousands that apparently exist.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> But, before this examination is undertaken, the Commission should be required to state which, if any, of these documents were used in the preparation of its rules. As we have pointed out, the scope of the NCTA\u2019s request was coextensive with the scope of the Commission\u2019s documentary basis for its rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-10\">. The Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (1970), requires that each agency publish or make available certain classes of information. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 552(a) (1)</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">(2). All other information covered by the Act must be available for inspection in accordance with \u00a7 552(a)(3), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-12\">[E] ach agency, on request for identifiable records made in accordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees to the extent authorized by statute, and procedure to be followed, shall make the records promptly available to any person.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b241-21\">. To justify a stay of an agency proceeding pending the litigation of a Freedom of Information Act request, a probability of irreparable injury must be shown. <em>See </em>Bannercraft Clothing Co. v.

The original letter requested \u201cthe annual and inventory reports of all user charges of the Commission submitted to the Bureau of the Budget on Standard Form No. 4 on or about September 30, 1969,\u201d the documents \u201cused to prepare the Standard Form No. 4, report,\u201d the \u201cCommission\u2019s budgetary <em>request </em>for fiscal year 1970, beginning July 1, 1970, <em>whieli was submitted to the current sessions of Congress,\u201d </em>including supportive documents,\u201d and \u201cthe Commission\u2019s budgetary requests for fiscal years 1970, . . ., and 1969.\u201d The italicized language manifests the NGTA\u2019s ignorance of internal Commission proceedings discussed below.

The Commission\u2019s administrative processing of the NCTA\u2019s request deserves some comment. Although the right to inspect documents is not dependent on need, the speed of the agency\u2019s response may drastically affect the requesting party\u2019s ability to participate in a pending agency proceeding. In the context of a 30-day comment period related to a rulemaking proceeding, the Act\u2019s requirement that production be \u201cprompt,\u201d becomes critical.</p>\n<p id=\"ave-dedup-0\">The Commission, however, took approximately 23 days to issue a total refusal. Moreover, it relied in part on a claim that some of the documents were the property of the Bureau of the Budget, yet it violated its own regulations mandating that in such a case the request be forwarded to the appropriate agency. <em>See 47 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 0.451(b) (3) (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-28\">We find all of this particularly troublesome in view of the fact that the Commission pi-oduced the documents requested in a majority of the NCTA\u2019s categories before moving for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b244-29\">.

The witness explained that the latter-figure also included CATV\u2019s share of unassigned costs.</p>\n<p id=\"A1A\">This explanation seems inadequate because the March Notice included separate amounts for the operation of offices not directly responsible for regulating any particular industry.

Tiie full statement is: \u201cThe records must be identifiable by the person requesting them, \u00ed. <em>e., a reasonable description enabling the Government employee to locate the requested records. </em>This requirement of identification is not to be used as a method of withholding records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b247-9\">. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a) (3) (1970).

They establish an alternate procedure for answering interrogatories that require the responding party to examine its own records. The responding party now may make the records available for inspection instead of searching out the information himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-18\">But this rule does not exempt the responding party from all responsibility for identifying documents in his own files. Only if the requesting party can perform that task with equal facility can he be required to cull the responding party\u2019s files.
