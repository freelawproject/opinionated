The trial date had been set in an order filed by the District Judge on July 21, 1972, and the order further provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-9\">No additional continuance will be granted, and it is FURTHER ORDERED that in the event John Ruf-falo, Sr. is unable to proceed on the date heretofore indicated, replacement counsel will be prepared to proceed as aforesaid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-15\">Although the order of dismissal purported to be without prejudice, the three-year statute of limitations (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56) had run on one of plaintiff\u2019s claims, and the statute ran on plaintiff\u2019s other claim two weeks later.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-16\">Appellant\u2019s counsel argues that he did not appear to try the case because he had been ill and had so apprised the court in July.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He claims that he endeavored to telephone the District Judge a few days before the trial date but that the Judge was unavailable. (This period included the Labor Day weekend.)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-17\">We regard the attorney\u2019s efforts as totally insufficient. He could have but did not write to the court to request a continuance. He could have but did not ask another lawyer to answer the call of the case to explain his absence and to request a continuance. He could have but did not arrange for his client to be present to explain the indisposition of his lawyer and to request a continuance. He could have but did not obtain replacement counsel to try the case in his stead (he did manage to secure replacement counsel by October 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-18\">The failure to accord opposing counsel and the court this minimum consideration and courtesy in these days of crowded calendars would ordinarily have fully justified the drastic sanction of dismissal of the cause. However, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>are special circumstances here. The record does not indicate that Mr. Edsall knew of the requirement in the July 21 order that he be prepared to proceed with replacement counsel if Mr. Ruffalo should have been unavailable, and in the absence of the affirmative showing of such knowledge we are reluctant to punish the client for the behavior of the lawyer. Further, plaintiff\u2019s claims are now time-barred and the dismissal thus effectively prevents plaintiff from ever having his day in court. And, the relief he seeks is based on a remedial and humanitarian statute that was specially enacted by Congress to afford relief to employees from injury incurred in the railway industry. <em>See </em>Urie v. Thompson, 337 U.S. 163, 69 S.Ct. 1018, 93 L.Ed. 1282 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Accordingly, as we said in Berardi v. Pure Oil Corporation, 456 F.2d 98, 99 (6th Cir. 1972), \u201cwe are hard-pressed to find an abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s dismissal, and do so only because we believe that the interests of justice require that [appellant] be afforded one more opportunity to conform [his actions] to the court\u2019s orders.\u201d Any further delay occasioned by appellant or his counsel will not evoke the same special solicitude on our part, and we expressly reject counsel\u2019s contention that the court was without power to enter the dismissal order. We reverse only because in balancing the equities, the interest of the employee who claims injury (not his counsel) outweighs, if only slightly so, the interest of the railroad and the concern of the court for its calendar, on these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">We decline to consider the issues relating to discovery because as the ease now stands they are interlocutory in nature and review of them may never be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith. Costs will abide the outcome of the case on its merits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-10\">. The letter, dated July 20, 1972, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-11\">Dear Judge Krupansky:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-12\">I am enclosing herewith a letter from Dr. John N. McCann of Youngstown, Ohio in respects to his medical advice relating to my present physical condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-13\">Dr. McCann, as you will note, advises that I cease activities for a period of one month and will evaluate me again at that time as to the likelihood of my resuming my activities or whether to continue on the basis of his original medical advice or on a restricted activity basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-20\">I regret that I am unable to fulfill my obligations at this time but matters concerning my health must be given first priority. As soon as my physician advises me that I can return to active duty, I will notify you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-21\">SS: John Ruffalo</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
