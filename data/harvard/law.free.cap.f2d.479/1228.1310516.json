Factual Background </em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>1</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-25\">By order entered March 29, 1968 in Civil Action 2915-67, appellee Myrtle B. Duvall was appointed trustee to convey the interest of John Wesley Duvall, her 16 year old son, in certain real estate in the District of Columbia, \u201cprovided that she file an undertaking in the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>$14,000.00 with approved surety. * * *\u201d A surety bond in that amount executed by appellee National Surety Corporation was duly filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">On June 10, 1968, Mrs. Duvall filed a \u201cSixty Day Report under Rule 22\u201d showing that she held a certificate of deposit in the amount of $12,609.61 in the American Heritage Bank and Trust Company in Colorado Springs in the name of \u201cMyrtle B. Duvall, Trustee in C.A. 2915-67 for John Wesley Duvall.\u201d No certificate of deposit, however, was ever issued to Mrs. Duvall by Heritage Bank and Trust Company.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1286-6\">Also on June 10, 1968 Mrs. Duvall executed in Colorado for filing in the District of Columbia an \u201cAnnual Report under Rule 22\u201d showing a deposit of $12,609.61 in the National Bank of Washington in the name of \u201cMyrtle B. Duvall, Trustee in C.A. 2915-67 for John Wesley Duvall.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The deposit of $12,609.61- \u2014 representing the proceeds of the sale \u2014 was in fact made in the National Bank of Washington on June 21, 1968. With interest of $126.09 credited October 1, 1968 the account totalled $12,735.70.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-7\">At about this time Mrs. Duvall, with her son, apparently decided to take up permanent residence in Colorado. She began a series of steps to transfer her son\u2019s estate from Washington, D. C. to Colorado, and to obtain authority from the Colorado courts to act as his fiduciary in that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-8\">On July 9, 1968 Mrs. Duvall was appointed Guardian of John Wesley Du-vall, Jr., by the Probate Court of the City and County of Denver and State of Colorado and filed a personal bond in the sum of $500.00 \u201cuntil money is received from Washington, D. C.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-12\">On August 28, 1968 Mrs. Duvall filed in the District Court for the District of Columbia a \u201cpetition to transfer trust funds\u201d to \u201cherself in the State of Colorado\u201d, reciting her domicile and appointment as guardian dn Colorado. On the same date the court entered an order providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-13\">\u201c1. That the Trustee, Myrtle B. Duvall, submit a final account and report with regard to the Trust account of John Wesley Duvall, Jr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-14\">\u201c2. FURTHER ORDERED that after approval by the Court of the report on [sic] the Auditor on the final account and report of Myrtle B. Du-vall, trustee, and the payment of administrative costs, the trustee is hereby authorized to transfer the balance of the assets to Myrtle B. Duvall guardian of the estate of John Wesley Duvall, Jr., Minor in the Probate Court in and for the City and County of Denver and State of Colorado, No. P-47737.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1286-15\">A \u201cfinal account\u201d filed August 30, 1968 for the period March 29, 1968 to August 2, 1968, and executed by Mrs. Duvall on August 2, 1968, reports the sale of the real estate for $12,601.61. An \u201cAnnual Report under Rule 22\u201d and \u201cSixty Day Report under Rule 22\u201d, both filed September 24, 1968, show the deposit of that amount in the National Bank of Washington, in Mrs. Duvall\u2019s name as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-16\">On October 18, 1968 Mrs. Duvall withdrew $10,500.00 from the trustee savings account in the National Bank of Washington, obtaining a cashier\u2019s check for $10,000.00 payable to \u201cMyrtle B. Duvall, for credit to #D 64740-8, c/o Columbia Savings and Loan Association\u201d,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Colorado Springs, Colorado. On October <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>17, 1968 Mrs. Duvall had applied for a savings account at Columbia Savings and Loan Association in her name, No. D-64740-8, as Trustee for John Wesley Duvall, Beneficiary, a Totten trust agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On October 21, 1968 the check for $10,000.00 was deposited in that account, and $10,000.00 was withdrawn the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">An additional $2,000.00 was withdrawn from the account in the National Bank of Washington on January 14, 1969 through a cashier\u2019s check payable to \u201cMyrtle B. Duvall\u201d, and $200.00 was withdrawn on March 8,1969.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">On May 26, 1969 the \u201cReport of the Auditor\u201d was filed. The report reviewed the account for the period March 29, 1968 through August 2, 1968, referring to the \u201cSixty Day Report filed June 10, 1968, First-and-Final Account (designated Final) filed August 30,1968, Amended Sixty Day Report filed September 24, 1968 and Report filed September 24, 1968 of Myrtle B. Duvall, Trustee.\u201d It concluded that the unpaid distributive shares, as of August 2, 1968, consisted of:</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-7\">\u201cTo: Edna Belle Duvall $ 156.75</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-8\">Myrtle B. Duvall 19.00</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-9\">John Wesley Duvall, Jr. 12,718.86\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-10\">The auditor\u2019s report concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-11\">\u201c8. After confirmation of the Report of the Auditor, order to be prepared and presented by the Trustee, and after full settlement and distribution has been made and a verified statement to that effect filed with the Clerk of the Court as provided by Rule 22(g), together with vouchers, receipts, or canceled checks evidencing final distribution, the Auditor recommends that the Trustee and her surety stand discharged, except as to prior defaults, if any.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1287-19\">By order dated June 20, 1969 the court confirmed the report of the auditor and \u201cordered that Myrtle B. Duvall file the Certificate of Distribution and Settlement in compliance with Local Civil Rule 22g, after which, trustee and the Surety on his undertaking shall stand discharged, except for prior defaults, if any.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-20\">On August 22, 1969 the trustee filed a \u201cCertificate of Distribution and Settlement by Fiduciary under Paragraph (g) of Local Civil Rule 22\u201d, reciting that she had \u201cmade complete distribution of the funds entrusted to her * * * in compliance with decree of March 29, 1968.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This was executed May 5, 1969 \u2014 before the report of the auditor was filed. No certificate has been filed stating that the trustee has made distribution pursuant to the auditor\u2019s report and order of the court confirming the report or the court order entered August 28, 1968; nor does the file contain any evidence that \u201cvouchers, receipts or can-celled checks evidencing final distribution\u201d were filed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-21\">On August 4, 1969 Mrs. Duvall opened two more savings accounts in the Colorado Savings and Loan Association, both in the form of Totten trusts, in the name of Myrtle B. Duvall as trustee for John Wesley Duvall. Account No. 05-87375-5 was opened with $8,000.00, and No. 05-60571-2 with $1,293.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>On January 5, 1970 Mrs. Duvall borrowed $14,540.98 from the Columbia Savings and Loan Association, giving them her note and pledging the three savings accounts. On May 5, 1971 the account balances were:</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-4\">D-64740-8 $ 8.03</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">05-87375-5 7,743.53</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">05-60571-2 15.78</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-7\">On October 30, 1970 an order was entered by the probate court in Colorado removing Mrs. Duvall as guardian of the estate of John Wesley Duvall, Jr., upon a finding that the estate \u201cwas not properly administered.\u201d Bernard E. Schilt, appellant, was appointed successor guardian, and letters of guardianship were issued to him on May 3,1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-8\">By letter dated July 19, 1971 the Columbia Savings and Loan Association refused appellant\u2019s demand for the surrender of the Totten trust accounts by reason of the fact that they had been pledged to secure Mrs. Duvall\u2019s loan and the loan was delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-9\">The motion to surcharge the trustee and her surety was filed by appellant on January 3, 1972. Following the oral argument on February 24, 1972 the motion was denied, the court concluding that the \u201cmotion comes too late to try to surcharge the surety * * * \u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A formal order was entered on March 7, 1972. Appellant filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied on April 5, 1972, the court finding.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-10\">\u201c(1) That petitioner\u2019s motion to surcharge rests on a single authority, D.C. Code \u00a7 28-2504, which is directed toward attorney/trustees and sureties thereof, and that such provision is inapplicable to the case at bar, <em>see </em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guarantee Co. v. Klein, 60 App.D.C. 354, 54 F.2d 828, cert. denied 285 U.S. 544 [52 S. Ct. 394, 76 L.Ed. 936] (1931);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-12\">\u201c(2) That the report of the auditor in this case, disclosing no illegal or improper transactions on the part of the trustee, has not been the subject of any objection;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-13\">\u201c(3) That the trustee and surety have been discharged by order of the Court; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-14\">\u201c(4) That petitioner has made no showing that the funds \u2014 removed from this jurisdiction by the trustee prior to the order confirming the report of the auditor and discharging the trustee and surety \u2014 were expended by the trustee against the interests of her minor son\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1288-15\">Two related issues are presented on this appeal: (1) whether the trustee and her surety were discharged from liability by the order confirming the auditor\u2019s report and certificate of distribution and settlement filed by the trustee; and (2) whether there was a misappropriation of funds in the District of Columbia, constituting a \u201cprior default\u201d under the order confirming the auditor\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-17\">\n<em>B. Effect of Order Confirming Auditor\u2019s Report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-18\">Both the auditor\u2019s report and order confirming it required the filing of a certificate of distribution and settlement in compliance with Rule 22(g), \u201cafter which\u201d the trustee and her surety would \u201cstand discharged, except for prior defaults, if any.\u201d The certificate filed by the trustee failed completely to meet the requirements of either the court order or Rule 22(g). Although filed subsequent to the order confirming the report, it was actually executed prior to the report. It recited compliance with the order appointing the trustee to convey the property and receive the proceeds of the sale. Nothing was ever filed to show compliance with the recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>mendations of the auditor and the court order confirming his report.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-5\">All of the withdrawals from the National Bank of Washington were made prior to the filing of the auditor\u2019s report. In making the withdrawals the trustee failed to comply with the order of August 28, 1968: (1) that she submit a final account and report, and (2) that after approval of the report of the auditor on her final account she transfer the balance of the assets to \u201cMyrtle B. Du-vall, guardian of the estate of John Wesley Duvall, Jr., Minor in the Probate Court In and for the City and County of Denver and State of Colorado, No. P-47737.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-6\">The so-called \u201cfinal account\u201d filed on August 30, 1968 was executed on August 2, 1968 and covered the period ending on that date. No true \u201cfinal account\u201d covering the period subsequent to that date was ever filed. Between August 2, 1968 and May 5, 1969, when Mrs. Duvall executed the so-called \u201ccertificate of distribution\u201d, she made the improper and unauthorized withdrawals of the trust funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">Appellee surety argues that the auditor presumably had all documents and must have known of the transfer of the funds to Colorado at the time of the audit. There is no evidence to support that assumption. As noted, the audit covered the \u201cfinal account\u201d for the period ending August 2, 1968. On that date the funds were still on deposit in the National Bank of Washington. All of the defaults occurred subsequent to the period covered by the report, but prior to the filing of the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-8\">Under these facts we find no merit in appellee\u2019s contention that the order confirming the auditor\u2019s report became <em>res judicata. </em>Nor was appellant required to seek to set aside the auditor\u2019s report.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1289-9\">\n<em>C. Trustee\u2019s Default and Misappropriation of Trust Funds</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-10\">16 D.C.Code \u00a7 601 (Supp. V, 1972) provides for entry of a judgment against a trustee and surety \u201cupon default by the principal in any of the conditions\u201d of the undertaking or bond. The judgment may be entered, upon motion, in the action in which the undertaking is filed, as an alternative to an independent action. Schmidt v. Smith, 120 U.S.App.D.C. 74, 344 F.2d 168, 169 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-11\"> Appellee surety contends that there was no default through misappropriation of funds in the District of Columbia and that any misappropriation or misuse of trust funds took place in Colorado while Mrs. Duvall \u201cwas guardian.\u201d It is true, as appellee argues, that where a trustee transfers property to \u201chimself in another capacity in accordance with his duty or authority\u201d, the surety is not liable for subsequent defalcations.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Here, however, the trustee failed to transfer the assets to herself in her capacity of guardian, as required by law and express order of the court. Instead the funds withdrawn from the account in the National Bank of Washington were paid to her individually or to her credit in a Totten trust in Colorado.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This was in itself a misappropriation of the trust funds. It contributed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>eventual conversion by making the minor\u2019s funds available for Mrs. Duvall to pledge them for her own use. This would not have been possible had she deposited the funds in the guardianship account pursuant to the court\u2019s order of August 28, 1968. 5A Michie, Banks and Banking, \u00a7\u00a7 57e, 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">The unauthorized withdrawals of the trust funds constituted \u201cprior defaults\u201d for which the surety is liable.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">\n<em>D. Sufficiency of Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">Appellee surety contends finally that (1) the documents upon which appellant relies were not properly in evidence and (2) there was no proof of the amount of any misappropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-9\">In its opposition to appellant\u2019s motion appellee set forth as one of eleven grounds that the motion was filed \u201cwith allegations, opinions and conclusions unsupported by affidavit or admissible evidence.\u201d Thereafter appellant filed his affidavit reciting that the statements in the motion were true to the best of his knowledge, information and belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-10\">The hearing consisted of statements of counsel for the respective parties.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Counsel for the surety contended (1) that the \u201cattempt now to attack the report of the auditor\u201d came too late, and (2) \u201cthat the auditor, at the time of the report was aware of the fact that funds had already been transferred to Colorado and were not in this jurisdiction.\u201d He argued also that the motion \u201ccontains a series of allegations, none of them under oath, none of them verified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-18\">The court did not rule upon the admissibility of the evidence, but concluded that a \u201ccertificate of distribution is in the file,\u201d and that the \u201cmotion comes too late to try to surcharge the surety.\u201d Before the court at the hearing were the motion with attached copies of documents, appellant\u2019s affidavit, and appellee surety\u2019s written opposition to the motion. While it does not appear that the original documents were formally offered in evidence, neither does it appear that it was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-19\">In its opposition to the motion the appellee did not deny the authenticity of any of the documents or deny any of the statements of fact set out in the motion or in the documents. The order of the district court recited that it was based \u201c[u]pon consideration of the pleadings filed herein\u201d. Under these circumstances, it appears that the court gave judgment on the pleadings, and that it was not necessary for the appellants to offer the documents into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-20\">Since the pleadings show a misappropriation and a prior default under the terms of prior court orders, appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>lant was entitled to judgment on the pleadings. The pleadings do not, however, indicate the final amount of the misappropriations, including interest due.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-8\">The order of the district court is reversed, and we remand for a determination of the amount of the surcharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-9\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1285-15\">. The proceedings and transactions with which the court is concerned are somewhat complicated and confusing and may be best understood by setting them out in chronological order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1286-9\">. A letter from the president of the American Heritage Bank and Trust Company, dated December 23, 1971 states that on May 13, 1968 Mrs. Duvall brought to the bank a check for $12,609.61 with the request that it be placed in a certificate of deposit. She was informed that the check would have to be sent for collection before this certificate could be delivered. She did not make the deposit but did obtain a photo copy of the certificate, which was never issued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1286-18\">. It is uncertain when this report was . filed. The filing date of June 20, 1968 was stamped on the report, but crossed out.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1286-20\">. The remaining $500.00 of the withdrawal is apparently unaccounted for.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1287-12\">. A Totten trust is a tentative trust, revocable at will. The beneficiary has no right or title to the deposit until the death of the trustee. While the trustee lives, he has full control over the deposit. <em>See </em>10 Am.Jur.2d Banks, \u00a7 392.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1287-13\">. On May 29, 1969, a deposit of $109.25 was made in the National Bank of Washington account, and on July 1, 1969 a check for $127.17 was issued to \u201cMyrtle B. Duvall.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1287-22\">. This was the order confirming the contract for the sale of the property and appointing Mrs. Duvall trustee to convey the minor\u2019s interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1287-23\">. Rule 22(g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1287-24\">\u201c(g) <em>Statement of Distribution and Settlement. </em>Promptly after full distribution and settlement of a trust estate the fiduciary shall file <em>with the Clerk </em>a verified statement to that ef-. feet, <em>together with vouchers, receipts, or cancelled cheeks evidencing final distribution.\u2019\u2019 </em>(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1288-11\">. This was the primary contention of ap-pellee trustee at oral argument in the District Court, although it is not urged in its brief on this appeal. The court relied upon the order confirming the auditor\u2019s report and his conclusion that a certificate of distribution had been filed in compliance therewith.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1289-12\">. A certificate of distribution and settlement properly prepared in compliance with the court\u2019s orders would have revealed the withdrawal of the trust funds from the National Bank of Washington.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1289-13\">. There is no evidence that the auditor\u2019s report was in any respect incorrect. It sets forth accurately the accounting transactions pertaining to the sale of the property and <em>the proper allocation </em>of the proceeds as of August 2, .1968.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1289-14\">. This was the holding in Poole v. Garrett, 56 App.D.C. 378, 15 F.2d 892 (1926), upon which appellee surety relies. There an ancillary administrator collected assets and delivered them to himself as domiciliary administrator, and thereafter converted funds. The court held that the surety bond of the ancillary administrator was not liable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1289-16\">. As noted above, the deposits in the Columbia Savings and Loan Association were Totten trusts. A letter to appellant dated May 5, 1971 from the Association\u2019s resident counsel stated that as far as he could determine the \u201cAssociation had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>knowledge that any of these funds were in fact belonging to the minor\u2019s estate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1290-12\">. The District Court assumed, improperly we think, that appellant\u2019s right to recover depended upon D.C.Code \u00a7 28-2504 (1967), and cited United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co. v. Klein, 60 U.S.App.D.C. 354, 54 F.2d 828 (1931), cert. denied, 285 U.S. 544, 52 S.Ct. 394, 76 L.Ed. 936 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-16\">In the <em>Klein </em>case, however, there was no basis for recovery other than the cause of action asserted under \u00a7 28-2504. That is, there was no question that both the sale trustee and his surety had been fully and properly discharged at the time of the transfer; the testamentary trustee to whom the transfer was made took full possession of the sale proceeds in his fiduciary capacity; all conditions of the discharge order were fully performed by the sale trustee; and there was no allegation that the sale trustee had in any way deviated from or breached the terms of his undertaking prior to his discharge. As a result, disallowance of the purported statutory claim left plaintiff with no cause of action against the surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-22\">In the case at bar, as in <em>Klein, </em>no cause of action lies under \u00a7 28-2504. But appellant also contends that there were misappropriations of funds prior to the discharge proceeding.
