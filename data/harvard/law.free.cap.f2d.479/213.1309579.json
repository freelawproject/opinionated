Clark who pleaded guilty, with conspiracy (18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371 (1969)) to violate the conflict of interest statute (18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 203),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and conspiracy to violate the obstruction of justice statute (18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1505),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>spectively. In the third count, defendant was accused of interstate travel (18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1952) to facilitate federal bribery (18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 201).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In counts four through eight, defendant was charged with five acts of perjury (18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1621 (1969)) before a federal grand jury in the District of Maryland. Defendant was sentenced to imprisonment and to pay a fine on each count. The sentences were consecutive in part and concurrent in part, so that the aggregate sentence was imprisonment for eighteen months and a fine of $25,000. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Defendant attacks his convictions on two principal grounds: first, that the indictment and the government\u2019s proof thereunder impugned his legislative acts as a member of the House of Representatives; and second, that certain tapes resulting from electronic surveillance and transcriptions of conversations should not have been admitted into evidence, principally with respect to the perjury counts. Specifically, with regard to the first ground of attack, defendant contends that substantial portions of the allegations of the indictment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and of the proof at trial revolved around his actions as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Investigations of the House of Representatives Committee on the District of Columbia in investigating whether a complaint, made to all of the members of the committee, warranted subcommittee hearings; and that his actions and motivations in this regard were immune from judicial scrutiny under the \u201cspeech or debate\u201d clause of the constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In regard to the admission into evidence of the tapes and transcriptions, defendant makes numerous objections. He claims violation of his fourth amendment rights, entrapment of him by the United States Attorney, duress upon the party to the taped conversations who purportedly consented to the taping, and violation of the constitutional concept of separation of powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">We agree that defendant\u2019s convictions on the two conspiracy counts (counts one and two), the interstate travel count (count three), and the first two of the five perjury counts (counts four and five) were obtained by the use of evidence which infringed the speech or debate clause, but we conclude that the trial of the remaining perjury counts (counts six-eight) was not tainted by the evidence improperly admitted to prove the other counts. Moreover, we see no valid objection to the admission of the tapes and transcriptions with respect to the remaining perjury counts (counts six-eight) of the indictment. We also conclude that violations of counts one-five might have been proved without improper inquiry into legislative acts. We therefore reverse as to counts one, two, three, four and five, affording the government the right to try them anew if it be so advised, and affirm as to counts six through eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">To establish the context in which defendant\u2019s various contentions arise, we state first what the government\u2019s proof, if believed, and certain uncontroverted proof, offered by the defendant, showed. Other facts will be stated elsewhere in the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Congressman Dowdy, at the time of trial, was a member of the House of Representatives, representing the Second Congressional District of Texas. He had been a member of Congress since 1952. At all times pertinent to the trial of the case, he was a member of (1) the House Judiciary Committee, and (2) the Committee on the District of Columbia, and Chairman of that committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Investigations. By House Resolution 44, adopted February 16, 1965, the Committee on the District of Columbia, acting as a whole or by subcommittee, was authorized to conduct a full and complete investigation and study of the operation and administration of any department of the Government of the District of Columbia, and the operation and administration of any independent agency or instrumentality operating solely in the District. In 1963-1964, defendant\u2019s subcommittee had held extensive hearings and investigations of urban renewal within the District of Columbia. Defendant wrote an article on the subject, published in a magazine of national circulation, and made a number of speeches throughout the United States in opposition to governmental urban renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">A certain Nathan H. Cohen was an owner and President of Monarch Construction Corporation (Monarch). Monarch employed Myrvin C. Clark as its Sales Manager and Cohen\u2019s \u201cright-hand man.\u201d Monarch was engaged in the home improvement business in Maryland and in the District of Columbia. In the early part of 1965, it was under investigation by various agencies of the federal and District of Columbia governments for its sales and financing practices. Apparently there was little question that Monarch and some of its principals had engaged in wholesale violations of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Defendant made a speech to Monarch employees about urban renewal on June 1, 1965. Cohen first met the defendant at this time. Several months later, Cohen approached Clark with the idea that defendant could arrange immunity for Cohen from possible criminal proceedings by allowing Cohen to testify before the subcommittee about Monarch\u2019s operations. Clark communicated with defendant and mentioned that Cohen had information of national importance, wanted to testify before the committee, but wanted immunity because he feared self-incrimination. Clark told defendant that the Cohen family was wealthy and that Clark would \u201chit\u201d the Cohens for a \u201cpolitical contribution\u201d for defendant. Defendant agreed to talk with Cohen.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">On or about September 16, 1965, Cohen met with defendant at defendant\u2019s office. Hayden Garber, Esquire, counsel to the committee, was present during part of the meeting. While Cohen and defendant were alone, Cohen informed defendant that his purpose in wishing to testify was to gain immunity and thereby avoid criminal prosecution. Defendant assured Cohen that he could handle the matter and a \u201cfee\u201d of $25,000 was agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Earlier that same month, Clark counseled Cohen to use what Cohen termed \u201cthe front door-back door approach,\u201d that is, \u201cof using a legitimate reason and legitimate excuse proffered at the same time that you tried to pay somebody or bribe somebody or get them on your side behind the scenes.\u201d To that end, Clark and Cohen prepared a series of documents asking for an investigation and hearing by the District of Columbia Committee and sent them to every member of the committee, along with a covering letter from Cohen\u2019s private attorney. Clark knew and informed Cohen that defendant would be in charge of any \u201cinvestigation\u201d which might result from this submission. Clark also informed Cohen that Clark had sought and obtained defendant\u2019s prior approval of the submission to all members of the committee. Shortly after this submission, the Cohen complaint was assigned to defendant\u2019s subcommittee for investigation by the Chairman of the House Committee on the District of Columbia, Hon. John L. McMillan of South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>On September 22, 1965, Cohen and his associates packed $25,000 in cash in an attache case, which Clark handed to defendant later that day at the Atlanta Airport, Atlanta, Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Shortly after September 22, 1965, defendant advised Clark that Cohen could not receive immunity by appearing as a witness before the committee, but that there was more than one way to handle the situation. On September 30, 1965, Cohen and defendant met in a Washington hotel and discussed the fact that the immunity plan would not work. The defendant advised Cohen that there was \u201cmore than one way to skin a cat\u201d and if Cohen was not satisfied with results, defendant would return Cohen\u2019s money to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Meanwhile, Garber studied the material which Cohen and Clark had submitted to the committee and arranged a meeting with Cohen, which was held prior to October 5, to discuss the details of his complaints. Garber decided that he should find out what the License and Inspection Division of the District of Columbia had in its files. He prepared a subpoena, took it to defendant on October 13, and defendant signed it upon Garber\u2019s advice. Garber obtained the documents and took them back to his office for study.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Next, Garber communicated with the Department of Justice, seeking information concerning Monarch\u2019s affairs. He was directed to the attorney who was familiar with them, and Garber arranged for that attorney to meet with defendant and Garber at defendant\u2019s office. The meeting was held in October, 1965. They discussed the Justice Department\u2019s case against Monarch and apparently the production of certain of the government\u2019s written reports of investigations of Monarch\u2019s affairs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The jury was told fully of the matters which were discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">During October, 1965, defendant made certain documents available to Clark. Clark had them copied, giving the copies to Cohen and returning the originals to defendant. These documents were internal investigative files of the Housing and Home Finance Agency (HHFA) and records of the District of Columbia Department of Licenses and Inspections. The custodian of these records testified that they had been turned over to Gar-ber on October 13, 1965, presumably in response to the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">Garber also arranged a meeting between defendant, Garber, and two officials of the Federal Housing Administration, parent agency to HHFA, in defendant\u2019s office on October 22, 1965. The findings and status of the Monarch investigation were discussed and certain internal investigative reports were left with defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">Following these meetings, defendant told Clark that he had \u201cexplained [his] personal interest in the situation, a private interest\u201d to the Department of Justice, i. e., the first Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Columbia who was in charge of the Monarch investigation in that office, and that defendant did not think that the assistant would \u201cpush this thing any further.\u201d Clark testified, \u201cI asked him [defendant] if that meant there would not be a prosecution, and he winked at me and sort of pushed me a little, and said he thought it was all taken care of and that I wouldn\u2019t have any more problems with Monarch Construction Corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Cohen and defendant had no further communication until 1967, when Cohen became aware that a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia was investigating Monarch for possible postal violations. Defendant assured Cohen that he would not be indicted, since \u201cthe last thing the Government did before it dropped the case was to give it to the Post Office Department.\u201d In 1968, a special federal grand jury was impaneled in Washington to investigate certain home improvement frauds. Cohen, in May 1969, learned that Monarch was a prime target and he and Clark again sought defendant\u2019s help. At first, defendant said that he could not help due to the change in administrations. But when Clark offered defendant $5,000 if no criminal prosecution resulted, defendant agreed to help. Defendant referred Cohen to a Washington attorney who was a good friend of the prosecutor and who, it was represented, could \u201ctake care of the problem.\u201d They consulted the attorney, who said that he could fix the case for a fee of $30,000. At Cohen\u2019s request, defendant met with the attorney and the prosecutor, and then reported that \u201che was confident that it could be handled this way, that he was sure there would be no prosecution.\u201d Cohen made a partial payment of the agreed amount and six months passed without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Then, Cohen became the subject of an unrelated federal investigation in Maryland. Cohen reached an understanding with the United States Attorney for the District of Maryland pursuant to which Cohen disclosed the nature and details of his relationship with defendant in exchange for immunity. On January 20, 1970, Cohen had a conversation with defendant in defendant\u2019s office in Washington, which Cohen recorded without defendant\u2019s knowledge. Defendant was a party to a number of statements, some of which were made by him and some of which were made to him. When defendant appeared voluntarily before the federal grand jury in Baltimore on March 4, 1970, he flatly denied under oath either making or being a party to them. These statements served as the basis for perjury counts six, seven and eight of the indictment: defendant\u2019s representation to Cohen that he had told Clark in 1965 that Cohen\u2019s problems would have to be \u201chandled\u201d in some way other than Congressional immunity and that had it not been for defendant\u2019s efforts Cohen would probably have already been prosecuted ; Cohen\u2019s representation to defendant that Cohen had paid defendant $25,000 in 1965 and that this payment had \u201cdone its job;\u201d and defendant\u2019s representation to Cohen that defendant would try to learn the status of the Monarch investigation and defendant\u2019s expressed hope that he could \u201cdo something\u201d for Cohen about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Perjury counts four and five were based upon defendant\u2019s denial under oath before the federal grand jury that he had met Clark in the airport in Atlanta, Georgia, and that he had received any monies for or on behalf of Cohen or Monarch other than an honorarium of $500 for making the June 1, 1965 speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\"> The speech or debate clause on which defendant\u2019s first principal contention is grounded, was adopted by the Constitutional Convention without debate or opposition.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Its roots lie in the conflict between Parliament and the Crown,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that experience has taught that:</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">In order to enable and encourage a representative of the public to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>charge his public trust with firmness and success, it is indispensably necessary, that he should enjoy the fullest liberty of speech, and that he should be protected from the resentment of everyone, however powerful, to whom the exercise of that liberty may occasion offence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">To effect this protection, the speech or debate clause not only provides a defense on the merits, but spares the legislator from having to devote his time and efforts to defending himself in court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The law governing Congressional immunity under the speech or debate clause<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> has been most recently discussed in three cases: United States v. Johnson, 383 U.S. 169, 86 S.Ct. 749, 15 L.Ed.2d 681 (1966) <em>(Johnson II), </em>aff\u2019g 337 F.2d 180 (4 Cir. 1964) <em>(Johnson I), </em>on remand 419 F.2d 56 (4 Cir. 1969) (Johnson III), cert. denied 397 U.S. 1010, 90 S.Ct. 1235, 25 L.Ed.2d 423 (1970); United States v. Brewster, 408 U.S. 501, 92 S.Ct. 2531, 33 L.Ed.2d 507 (1972); and Gravel v. United States, 408 U.S. 606, 92 S.Ct. 2614, 33 L.Ed.2d 583 (1972).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We shall consider these cases and undertake to apply their holdings to the instant ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">In <em>Johnson II, </em>the Supreme Court held that the speech or debate clause provided immunity to a Congressman from indictment and trial under a general conspiracy statute for conspiracy to defraud the government where proof of the charge involved inquiry into his motivations for a speech given in the Congress. \u201cThe- essence of such a charge in this context is that the Congressman\u2019s conduct was improperly motivated, and . . . that is precisely what the Speech or Debate Clause generally forecloses from executive and judicial inquiry.\u201d 383 U.S. at 180, 86 S.Ct. at 755. The Court ruled that the concept of \u201clegislative act\u201d should be broadly construed to effectuate the purpose of ensuring the independence of the legislature. 383 U.S. at 182, 86 S.Ct. 749, 15 L.Ed.2d 681.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But with regard to other counts charging that Johnson improperly interceded with the executive, the Court stated: \u201cNo argument is made, nor do we think that it could be successfully contended, that the Speech or Debate Clause reaches conduct, such as was involved in the attempt to influence the Department of Justice, that is in no wise related to the due functioning of the legislative process.\u201d 383 U.S. at 172, 86 S.Ct. at 751. The Court did not pass on our holding in <em>Johnson I </em>that the evidence of legislative acts improperly admitted with regard to the speech count fatally contaminated Johnson\u2019s conviction on the improper attempt to influence the executive counts.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>mand, the district court dismissed the substantive count based upon delivery of the speech, but convicted Johnson on the improper influence counts; and we affirmed in <em>Johnson III. </em>In short, under <em>Johnson II, </em>the speech or debate clause does not bar a prosecution founded on a general criminal statute which \u201cdoes not draw in question the legislative acts of the defendant member of Congress- or his motives for performing them.\u201d 383 U.S. at 185, 86 S.Ct. at 758. The Court expressly reserved whether the speech or debate clause barred a prosecution \u201centailing inquiry into legislative acts or motivations . . . founded upon a narrowly drawn statute passed by Congress in the exercise of its legislative power to regulate the conduct of its members.\u201d 383 U.S. at 185, 86 S.Ct. at 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\"><em>Brewster </em>held that the speech or debate clause did not compel dismissal of an indictment for bribery, even though the <em>quid pro quo </em>for the bribe was a patently legislative act, since it would not be necessary for the government to inquire into legislative acts or their motivations \u2014 \u201cto inquire into how [Brewster] spoke, how he debated, how he voted, or anything he did in the chamber or in committee\u201d \u2014 in order to prove a violation of the bribery statute. 408 U.S. at 526, 92 S.Ct. at 2544. Thus, <em>Brewster </em>invoked and applied the first exception articulated in <em>Johnson II: </em>prosecution under a general statute which does not draw into question the Congressman\u2019s legislative acts or motivations. In reaching this conclusion, the Court seemingly contracted the broader interpretation of legislative act apparently advanced in <em>Johnson </em>II.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Brewster </em>defined protected legislative acts as \u201can act generally done in Congress in relation to the business before it.\u201d 408 U.S. at 512, 92 S.Ct. at 2537. The Court ruled that acceptance of a bribe does not fall within this definition and therefore judicial inquiry into such receipt would not be an impermissible inquiry into a Congressman\u2019s motivation for a legislative act. The Court again expressly reserved the \u201cnarrowly drawn statute\u201d exception. 408 U.S. at 529 n. 18, 92 S.Ct. 2531, 33 L.Ed.2d 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\"><em>Gravel </em>further elaborated the definition of legislative act as any act constituting \u201can integral part of the deliberative and communicative processes by which Members participate in committee and House proceedings . . . with respect to matters within the jurisdiction of either House.\u201d 408 U.S. at 625, 92 S.Ct. at 2627. Particularly pertinent here is its holding that the speech or debate clause protects a Congressman from inquiry \u201cexcept as it proves relevant to investigating possible third party crime, concerning any act, in itself not criminal, performed by [him] ... in the course of [his] employment, <em>in preparation for the subcommittee hearing.\u201d </em>408 U.S. at 629, 92 S.Ct. at 2629 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">Defendant contends that under these cases, the various counts of the indictment and a substantial part of the government\u2019s proof offered thereunder offended the speech or debate clause and transgressed defendant\u2019s immunity in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-14\"> A. <em>The Indictment. </em>If the indictment is read standing alone, we think its various counts are unobjectionable, with the sole exception of overt act 19 of the first two counts of the indictment. Overt act 19 charges that defendant caused to be issued a subpoena to the District of Columbia Department of Licenses and Inspections commanding the production of certain documents before defendant\u2019s subcommittee. Although counts one and two do allege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>(overt act 5) that Monarch made a complaint to the full committee, the other overt acts do not spell out that its chairman designated defendant\u2019s subcommittee to investigate it. The only fair inference that can be drawn from the statement of overt act 19 is that defendant was alleged to have performed a legislative act, because, absent an allegation that procurement of a subpoena was fraudulently obtained, we can infer that the subpoena was issued for some purpose of the subcommittee. <em>Gravel </em>teaches that inquiry concerning the business of a subcommittee, irrespective of the motives and purposes of a member thereof, is forbidden by the speech or debate clause because it is as much a legislative act as a speech on the floor of the House or a vote on pending legislation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See also <em>Brewster, </em>408 U. S. at 525, 92 S.Ct. at 2544 (\u201cacts which occur in the regular course of the legislative process\u201d); Dombrowski v. Eastland, 387 U.S. 82, 84-85, 87 S.Ct. 1425, 18 L.Ed.2d 577 (1967) (Per Curiam); Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S. 367, 376-378, 71 S.Ct. 783, 95 L.Ed. 1019 (1951); Doe v. McMillan, 459 F.2d 1304, 1311-1314 (D.C.Cir.), cert. granted 408 U.S. 922, 92 S.Ct. 2505, 33 L.Ed. 2d 332 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\"> However, if the speech or debate clause, as interpreted by <em>Johnson II, Brewster </em>and <em>Gravel, </em>is to be given meaning, the validity of an indictment must be determined in the context of the proof which is offered to sustain it, or in the context of facts adduced on a motion to dismiss it. Otherwise, the validity of an indictment would depend solely on what the prosecutor elected to allege, and he would be limited only by his sense of self-restraint in alleging all facts, including those unfavorable to his case. Since the cases make clear that the clause protects against the burden of defending,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> as well as creates a substantive defense, we think that the speech or debate clause constitutes a limitation on what may be alleged as well as what may be proved, although it may be necessary to go beyond the indictment to obtain the full meaning of what appear facially to be perfectly proper allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Specifically, overt acts 20-23 fall into this category. Overt act 20 alleged that the defendant requested that an Assistant United States Attorney meet with him; overt act 21 alleged the fact of the meeting; overt act 22 alleged defendant\u2019s meeting with officials of FHA and HHFA; and overt act 23 alleged the receipt and acceptance of documents from officials of FHA and HHFA. The indictment nowhere alleged that defendant was chairman of a subcommittee which was assigned the investigation of Monarch\u2019s complaint to determine if formal hearings should be held, or that defendant conferred with various officials and obtained various government documents in regard to other investigations of Monarch\u2019s affairs, or that these conferences and the obtention of these documents were, at least arguably, the performance of defendant\u2019s legislative functions. Absent such allegations or proof of them, overt acts 20-23 are plainly proper under <em>Johnson II, </em>for they can be read as charging that the defendant improperly attempted to influence the executive branch. But when these overt acts are read in the light of the facts adduced at trial, then it is evident that these same overt acts might be interpreted as preparation for a subcommittee hearing on Monarch and, as such, would be protected legislative acts under <em>Gravel. </em>When we read overt acts 20-23 in the light of the proof at trial, we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>elude that they transgress the speech or debate clause, as we shall discuss further.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">However, it does not follow that counts one and two should be dismissed because of the inclusion of this improper matter. Rather, the offending overt acts could have been stricken and the counts would still be legally sufficient since 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371 requires, in addition to an agreement to commit any offense against the United States, only that \u201cone or more of such persons do <em>any </em>act to effect the object of the conspiracy . . . \u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Otherwise, the various counts of the indictment are not barred by the speech or debate clause. Under <em>Johnson II </em>and <em>Brewster, </em>the speech or debate clause does not bar an indictment under a general statute where the government can make a prima facie case without inquiring into legislative acts. It follows that the speech or debate clause did not bar count one, as modified, since the government can show that defendant conspired to receive compensation in relation to a legislative proceeding without proving defendant\u2019s efforts to influence the outcome of the proceeding. Similarly, it did not bar count three, since the government could show that defendant traveled across state lines to accept money for an act to be performed without proving that he later performed the act. Likewise, the perjury counts are not barred, because the government could prove perjury without reference to any legislative acts. Since count two (obstruction of justice), as modified, count four (perjury regarding the meeting at the Atlanta Airport), and count five (perjury regarding the acceptance of money at the Atlanta Airport) would not require inquiry into legislative acts and motivations to show guilt thereunder, these counts do not transgress the speech or debate clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">B. <em>The Proof. </em>While we conclude that none of the various counts were barred in their entirety by the speech or debate clause, we view the evidence offered at trial differently. The proof fell into three general categories: (1) defendant\u2019s conversations and arrangements with Clark and Cohen, (2) his grand jury testimony, and (3) his conversations and arrangements with the United States Attorney, FHA and HHFA concerning Monarch. In connection with the last category, a considerable amount of documentary evidence of reports of investigations which defendant and Garber obtained was admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">We have no doubt that evidence falling into the first two categories was not barred by the speech or debate clause. With respect to the first category, <em>Brewster </em>ruled that the government may allege and prove that a Congressman \u201csolicited, received, or agreed to receive, money with knowledge that the donor was paying him compensation for an official act.\u201d 408 U.S. at 527, 92 S.Ct. at 2545. With regard to the second category, since voluntary testimony before a federal grand jury is not \u201can act generally done in Congress in relation to the business before it,\u201d it follows that the government may allege and prove facts concerning such testimony. 408 U.S. at 512, 92 S.Ct. at 2537.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">But, we are equally firm in our conclusion that evidence falling into the third category was barred. This evidence was an examination of defendant\u2019s actions as a Congressman, who was chairman of a subcommittee investigating a complaint, in gathering information in preparation for a possible subcommittee investigatory hearing. As such, it was an examination of legislative acts, as defined by <em>Gravel,</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>condemned by <em>Johnson II </em>and <em>Brewster </em>when the prosecution proceeds under a statute of general application. It was a complete disclosure of all that transpired including proof of documents that were obtained and, hence, was a general inquiry into the legislative acts of a Congressman and his motives for performing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">We conclude that the proof was not received in a prosecution under a narrowly drawn statute, a possible exception suggested by <em>Johnson II, </em>383 U. S. at 185, 86 S.Ct. 749, 15 L.Ed.2d 681, and <em>Brewster, </em>408 U.S. at 529 n. 18, 92 S.Ct. 2531, 33 L.Ed.2d 507. Of course, what is a \u201cnarrowly drawn statute passed by Congress in the exercise of its legislative power to regulate the conduct of its members,\u201d <em>Johnson II, </em>383 U.S. at 185, 86 S.Ct. at 758, is defined in neither <em>Johnson II </em>nor in <em>Brewster. </em>In the instant case, the government concedes, with respect to count two, that neither the underlying obstruction statute nor the conspiracy statute qualify as narrowly drawn statutes. It argues, however, with respect to count one, that the object of the conspiracy was to violate a narrowly drawn conflict of interest statute, that, with respect to count three, the object of the interstate travel was to violate a narrowly drawn bribery statute, and that in both counts the narrowly drawn underlying statutes determine the nature of the prosecution notwithstanding that the conspiracy and the interstate travel statutes are general in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">We cannot agree that the statutes underlying counts one and three are \u201cnarrowly drawn.\u201d The language of the Chief Justice writing for the Court in <em>Brewster, </em>in which the suggestion in <em>Johnson II </em>was given continued life, was: \u201cwe express no views on the question left open in <em>Johnson </em>as to the constitutionality of an inquiry that probes into legislative acts or the motivation for legislative acts if Congress specifically authorizes <em>such </em>in a narrowly drawn statute.\u201d 408 U.S. at 529, 92 S. Ct. at 2546. (Emphasis added.) We read the Court to be saying that if Congress, in recognition that either House is ill-equipped to conduct a trial, or that a trial interferes unduly with other legislative business, or for any other reason, concludes to permit judicial inquiry into legislative acts or motivations to relieve itself of that burden, it will do so in clear and unmistakable language. In short, there must be a specific and express delegation of authority to inquire into legislative acts or motivations. Both the conflict of interest statute and the bribery statute, although they are applicable to Congressmen and others, are lacking in an express delegation of this nature. Although Congress explicitly authorized the executive and judicial branches to prosecute Congressmen under these statutes, there is no specific expression of intent on the part of Congress that these prosecutions be allowed to proceed beyond the bounds of <em>Johnson II </em>and <em>Brewster </em>by probing into legislative acts and the motivations therefore. Since the speech or debate clause so clearly vests the authority to make such an inquiry exclusively in Congress, delegation of that power is not to be implied. And there is no need, as we show elsewhere in this opinion, to imply the power in order to give meaning and make effective the statutes underlying counts one and three.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">We therefore conclude that the speech or debate clause as interpreted in <em>Johnson II, Brewster, </em>and <em>Gravel </em>prohibited this proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Of course, defendant\u2019s actual motives in communicating with various government officials and in obtaining certain government documents could have been, as the government contends, for improper non-legislative purposes. But we reject the government\u2019s argument that it was proper for the jury to receive all of the evidence and to pass upon the issue of what activities were legislative, protected from examination by the speech or debate clause, and what were not. In the first place, the government\u2019s argument is nothing more than a <em>post hoc </em>justification of what was done; the case was not tried on the theory which is now urged. Other than to be told to disregard proof of overt act 19 in arriving at a verdict on counts one and two of the indictment, the jury was not told how to weigh and consider the evidence before it. It was not instructed to consider first admissibility and, only if it concluded that the evidence was admissible under standards stated by the court, to consider the evidence on the issue of guilt or innocence. Rather, it was free to consider the evidence in arriving at its verdict irrespective of whether it concluded that defendant was performing a legislative act.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Secondly, the question of admissibility of evidence is generally a question solely for the court. IX Wig-more, Evidence \u00a7 2550 (3d ed. 1940); McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 53 (2d ed. Cleary 1972). See Rule 26, F.R.Cr.P. This salutary rule undoubtedly stems, in part, from general recognition of the difficulty that a juror, untrained in the law, may have in divorcing from his mind the probative value of the evidence even if, under proper instruction, he concludes that it was inadmissible. See <em>Johnson I, </em>337 F.2d at 204. Cf. Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">But, an even more basic flaw in the government\u2019s argument is its implied assertion concerning the scope of protection afforded by the speech or debate clause; namely, that it is applicable only when a pure legislative motive is present. The clause does not simply protect against inquiry into acts which are manifestly legislative. In our view, it also forbids inquiry into acts which are purportedly or apparently legislative, even to determine if they are legislative in fact. Once it was determined, as here, that the legislative function (here, full investigation of the Monarch complaint to determine if formal subcommittee hearings should be held) was <em>apparently </em>being performed, the propriety and the motivation for the action taken, as well as the detail of the acts performed, are immune from judicial inquiry. In Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U. S. 367, 377-378, 71 S.Ct. 783, 788 (1951), it was pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">The claim of an unworthy purpose does not destroy the privilege . . The privilege would be of little value if they [legislators] could be subjected to the cost and inconvenience and distractions of a trial upon a conclusion of the pleader, or to the hazard of a judgment against them based upon a jury\u2019s speculation as to motives . . . . The courts should not go beyond the narrow confines of determining that a committee\u2019s inquiry may fairly be deemed within its province.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">See Coffin v. Coffin, 4 Mass, at 27; Doe v. McMillan, 459 F.2d at 1312-1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">We are not impressed by the government\u2019s argument that a consequence of our holding will be that dishonest Congressmen will evade prosecution by creating a smokescreen of arguably legislative activity to camouflage illegal non-legislative acts. Constitutionally permissible sanctions are available: Under <em>Johnson II </em>and <em>Brewster, </em>the government can go far in indicting and proving a case of criminal conspiracy and other substantive offenses without alleging or proving that the illegal objectives of the conspiracy were fully realized by the Congressman. Congress may have the right to enact a narrowly drawn statute proscribing the illegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>conduct. <em>Johnson II; Brewster. </em>In any event, the House or Senate clearly has jurisdiction to try any member who is a wrongdoer and punish him for his derelictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Having concluded that evidence was adduced at trial and considered by the jury in violation of the speech or debate clause, we turn to a consideration of the effect on each of defendant\u2019s convictions. The most pertinent authority to be considered is <em>Johnson I. </em>There, where Johnson was indicted for conspiracy and for substantive offenses which were the objects of. the conspiracy, we held that evidence violative of the speech or debate clause fatally infected the jury\u2019s consideration of Johnson\u2019s guilt or innocence of the substantive offenses with which he was charged. 337 F.2d at 204.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Our conclusion was based upon our notions of fairness and prejudice to Johnson, and it did not stem from considerations of constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">It is manifest that defendant\u2019s convictions under the conspiracy counts one and two must be reversed, since the proof to support them included, in our view, clear violations of the speech or debate clause. But as to them, since the essence of the offenses charged was an illegal <em>agreement </em>to accomplish illegal objectives, guilt could be established by proof of the agreement, accompanied by proof of one or more non-legislative overt acts to carry it out, without proof of legislative acts immunized from inquiry by the speech or debate clause. It follows that the government should be afforded the right of retrial. See <em>Brewster.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">The same is true with regard to the count charging interstate travel to commit bribery (count three). The erroneously admitted evidence of legislative acts was arguably relevant to proof of bribery, and we cannot confidently say that the jury did not consider it in finding guilt. Moreover, the travel count arose from an alleged conspiracy to accomplish certain illegal legislative acts, and was tried in the context of prohibited disclosure of those legislative acts. We can only conclude, on the authority of <em>Johnson I, </em>that the violation of the speech or debate clause so tainted the trial of this substantive count that defendant\u2019s conviction on it should be set aside. Since count three could be proved without reference to legislative acts, a new trial will be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">With respect to counts four and five, alleging perjury in defendant\u2019s denial of the meeting in the Atlanta Airport and his receipt of $25,000, we conclude once again that the erroneously admitted evidence of legislative acts fatally infected the convictions. The evidence on these counts was sharply conflicting. Unrestricted by any limiting instruction, the jury, in passing upon the credibility of the government\u2019s witnesses, was permitted to rely upon evidence of legislative acts to conclude that the meeting and delivery of the money had occurred and, hence, that the denials were willful material untruths. Since we cannot say that the jury did not, defendant\u2019s convictions on counts four and five should be set aside; but since these counts could have been proved without reference to legislative acts, a new trial will be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">The remaining perjury convictions (counts six-eight) stand on a different footing. These counts allege perjured denials of statements made in recorded or transcribed conversations with Cohen. Defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence of them depended in no part upon the accuracy of the statements he made to Cohen in defendant\u2019s office in Washington, or upon the accuracy of what Cohen said to him at that time in that place. Rather, his guilt or innocence depended solely upon whether, when he denied what he and Cohen had said before the Maryland federal grand jury, his de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>nial was a willful untruth.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Because the earlier conversations had been taped and the grand jury testimony steno-graphically reported, the evidence to show guilt on these counts was overwhelming. Unlike counts four and five, the falsity of the denials before the Maryland federal grand jury was beyond dispute. The sharp juxtaposition of defendant\u2019s baldly conflicting statements after he had been given every opportunity before the grand jury to tell the truth not only proved willfulness, but made slight the possibility that the jury had resort to the erroneously admitted evidence of legislative acts. The instant case is quite unlike United States v. Beach, 296 F.2d 153 (4 Cir. 1961), because <em>Beach </em>did not prescribe an inflexible rule and the rule of <em>Beach </em>should not be applied where the types of perjury are clearly different, where the proof as to some is overwhelming, and where the likelihood that a defendant was prejudiced because a jury was permitted improperly to conclude guilt on some was highly remote. Thus, while we conclude that it might have been preferable for defendant to have been tried on perjury counts six-eight under laboratory conditions which excluded any disclosure of legislative acts, we cannot say that there was sufficient prejudice to defendant by their disclosure to warrant overturning these convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Because we deem the perjury convictions on counts six-eight otherwise valid, we are brought to the question of whether certain tapes and transcriptions of defendant\u2019s conversations with Cohen, including the one which occurred in defendant\u2019s office in Washington on January 20, 1970, were illegally obtained so as to render them inadmissible in evidence and whether there was any other ground of illegality in the use of this evidence in obtaining these convictions. First, it is necessary to state additional facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Cohen made his arrangement with the United States Attorney for the District of Maryland to make a full, truthful disclosure of his dealings with defendant in exchange for immunity on December 30, 1969. Thereafter, he embarked upon a program of active cooperation with the United States Attorney and the FBI.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">On January 12, 1970, he placed a long distance call from Baltimore to defendant\u2019s office in the District of Columbia. With Cohen\u2019s consent, the call was monitored by an agent of the FBI, but it was not recorded. Cohen was unable to reach defendant, but he obtained several telephone numbers where defendant could be reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">The following day, attorneys for the government sought and obtained an order from the United States District Court for the District of Maryland authorizing the FBI to intercept \u201cby means of electronic devices to be placed, with the consent of Nathan Cohen, on his person and on telephones utilized by him, conversations, telephonic or in person . . .\u201d between Cohen and defendant. The order was limited to a ten-day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>period. As soon as the order was obtained, Cohen placed a call to defendant in Texas from the offices of the FBI in Baltimore and, with Cohen\u2019s consent, their conversation was electronically recorded by the FBI on a cassette recorder. This recording was subsequently admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">On January 19, 1970, Cohen placed a telephone call to defendant\u2019s office in the District of Columbia. The call originated in Baltimore and, again with Cohen\u2019s consent, the conversation was electronically recorded. This recording was also admitted into evidence. During the conversation between the two, Cohen made an appointment to see defendant in the latter\u2019s office in Washington on the next day, January 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">At the January 20, 1970 meeting, Cohen had permitted the placement on his person of a recording device and the entire conversation between the two was recorded. Subsequently, the recording was transcribed and both the recording and the transcription were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">On January 22, 1970, the government sought and obtained another order from the district court, again authorizing the use of electronic devices to be placed, with the consent of Cohen, on his person and on telephones utilized by him to record conversations between him and defendant. On January 28, after the entry of the second order, Cohen placed a final call from Baltimore to defendant in the latter\u2019s office in the District of Columbia, and with Cohen\u2019s consent this conversation was electronically recorded. This recording and a transcript of the conversation were also admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Defendant\u2019s first claim with respect to the recordings and the transcriptions is that his rights under the fourth amendment were violated. We think the complete answer to this contention is United States v. White, 401 U. S. 745, 91 S.Ct. 1122, 28 L.Ed.2d 453 (1971) (plurality opinion), which held that the fourth amendment requires no prior judicial authorization for governmental electronic recording of a private conversation where one of the parties to the conversation has consented to the surveillance. Since Cohen consented to each recording, it follows that each recording and the transcriptions made from some did not violate defendant\u2019s fourth amendment rights and were therefore admissible into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">It also follows that we need not consider the validity of the court orders authorizing the recordings. They were sought and obtained prior to the decision in <em>White, </em>undoubtedly as a precautionary measure on the part of the government. Since <em>White </em>makes clear that no warrant or order is needed, any discussion of whether the district court in Maryland may authorize the recording of a conversation with a party in the District of Columbia or in Texas would be academic.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">We reject defendant\u2019s argument that Cohen\u2019s consent was not freely and voluntarily given since it was extended under the pressure of a potential indictment and in return for a promise of immunity. Three circuits have rejected this argument, United States v. Silva, 449 F.2d 145, 146 (1 Cir. 1971), cert. denied 405 U.S. 918, 92 S.Ct. 942, 30 L. Ed.2d 787 (1972); United States v. Jones, 433 F.2d 1176 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied 402 U.S. 950, 91 S.Ct. 1613, 29 L.Ed.2d 120 (1951); Good v. United States, 378 F.2d 934, (9 Cir. 1967), and we agree. United States v. Laughlin, 226 F.Supp. 112 (D.D.C.1964) cited by defendant, which holds to the contrary, has been superseded by United States v. Jones, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\"> Defendant cites no authority, and we are aware of none, indicating that the recording and transcription of a Congressman\u2019s conversations violate the constitutional principle of the separation of powers. We also reject defendant\u2019s suggestion that in the exercise of our supervisory power over district courts we should suppress consensual electronic surveillance as \u201cdirty business.\u201d Cf. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. 819 (1943). The Supreme Court has considered and rejected this very argument on at least two occasions. Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S. 427, 440, 83 S.Ct. 1381, 10 L. Ed.2d 462 (1963); OnLee v. United States, 343 U.S. 747, 754-758, 72 S.Ct. 967, 96 L.Ed. 1270 (1952). See also Osborn v. United States, 385 U.S. 323, 87 S.Ct. 429, 17 L.Ed.2d 394 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Finally, we have examined the record in detail and we can find no support for defendant\u2019s argument that he was entrapped by the United States Attorney in testifying before the grand jury, where he denied the conversations which had been recorded. The essence of the crime of perjury is a willful untruth, under oath, in a material statement. While the United States Attorney, by inviting defendant to testify before the grand jury, may have provided defendant with the opportunity to commit perjury, the record is absolutely devoid of any evidence that the United States Attorney suggested what defendant should say when he testified. Legally, as well as factually, there was no entrapment. Certainly there was no obligation on the part of the United States Attorney to advise the defendant of evidence which the former had in his possession or of which he was aware. See United States v. Winter, 348 F.2d 204 (2 Cir.), cert. denied 382 U.S. 955, 86 S.Ct. 429, 15 L.Ed.2d 360 (1965); LaRocca v.

The Grand Jury realleges paragraphs (1) through (5), inclusive, of Count One of this indictment and incorporates them herein by reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-17\">2.

Cohen, herein named as a co-conspirator but not indicted, and with other persons, did unlawfully, willfully and knowingly combine, conspire, confederate and agree together and with each other within the State and District of Maryland and elsewhere to commit an offense against the United States, to wit, that JOHN DOWDY would corruptly influence, obstruct, and impede and would corruptly endeavor to influence, obstruct, and impede the due and proper administration of the law under which a proceeding was then being had before a department of the United States; said proceeding was an investigation then pending before the Department of Justice, and in the office of the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, concerning possible violations of criminal statutes of the United States and the District of Columbia by Monarch Construction Corporation, Nathan H. Cohen, MYRVIN C. CLARK and others associated with the business and af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>fairs of Monarch Construction Corporation; all in violation of Section 1505 of Title 18 of the United States Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The overt acts then alleged in the second count are identical to those alleged in the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">In the third count, defendant, together with Myrvin C. Clark, was charged with traveling in interstate commerce from Maryland to Georgia, and causing to move in interstate commerce between those places the sum of $25,000 in cash, with intent to accomplish the bribery of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Counts Four through Eight all charged perjury before a Grand Jury for the District of Maryland on March 4, 1970; each count being based upon a separate allegedly material false statement. In Count Four, the actionable statement of defendant was his denial that he met Clark in an airport in Atlanta, Georgia on or about September 22, 1965. Count Five assigned as perjury defendant\u2019s denial that he received $25,000 in cash at this meeting with Clark.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Counts Six through Eight assigned as perjury defendant\u2019s Grand Jury testimony concerning conversations with Cohen which occurred in January, 1970. Count Six was the denial that defendant had told Clark that Cohen\u2019s prospective prosecution would have to be \u201chandled\u201d in a way other than obtaining Congressional immunity for Cohen and that if it had not been for defendant\u2019s efforts, Cohen would have already been prosecuted. Count Seven alleged as willfully untrue defendant\u2019s denial that Cohen had said to him that defendant had been paid $25,000 by Cohen and that the payment had \u201cdone its job.\u201d Count Eight alleged as criminally actionable defendant\u2019s denial that he had sought to assist Cohen by determining the status of an investigation of Monarch pending before the Department of Justice and in the office of the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia and that he had expressed the hope that he could \u201cdo something\u201d for Cohen in regard to the investigation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-15\"> A summary of the indictment is attached as an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-16\">.

The government sought and obtained a writ of certiorari extending to this aspect of our decision as well as to the proper scope of the speech or debate clause.

Insofar as the Clause is construed to reach other matters, they must be an integral part of the deliberative and communicative processes by which Members participate in committee and House proceedings with respect to the consideration and passage or rejection of proposed legislation or with respect to other matters which the Constitution places within the jurisdiction of either House.</p>\n<p id=\"app-dedup-0\"><em>Gravel, </em>408 U,S. at 625, 92 S.Ct. at 2627.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b279-14\">. See n. 12, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b280-6\">. Much of our analysis with respect to the indictment and the proof is premised on the holding in <em>Gravel </em>that the speech or debate clause bars inquiry into a Congressman\u2019s preparation for a subeom-mittee hearing. 408 U.S. at 628-629, 92 S.Ct. 2614, 33 L.Ed.2d 583. <em>Gravel </em>articulated two exceptions to this rule. Inquiry would be permissible: (a) \u201c[if] it proves relevant to investigating possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>third party crime,\u201d and (b) if the Congressman\u2019s act is itself criminal. 408 U.S. at 629, 92 S.Ct. at 2629. Although these exceptions, if read literally, might conceivably be applied in this case, we conclude that the context in Gravel\u2014 alleged theft and receipt of stolen classified papers \u2014 limits their application to cases where the inquiry focuses on the manner and methods of obtaining certain information, and not to cases where the inquiry focuses on the Congressman\u2019s motivations for obtaining certain information. Otherwise, these exceptions would engulf the rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b283-9\">. See n. 16 for the history of this holding. We would be less than candid if we did not state that we think its correctness has been severely shaken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\">. The jury was fully and correctly instructed as to the law of perjury. Although the district court instructed the jury to apply the rule requiring a witness and corroboration \u2014 the \u201ctwo-man\u201d rule \u2014 with respect to perjury, notwithstanding that there was a record of what defendant had said on each of two occasions (cf. United States v. Wood, 14 Pet. 430, 437, 441, 10 L.Ed. 527 (1840)), the jury\u2019s attention was directed to the tapes and transcriptions of the conversations with Cohen and to the transcript of the grand jury testimony. The jury was told to convict only if they found beyond a reasonable doubt that the grand jury testimony was a willful material untruth. Additionally, the jury was told that each count of the indictment charged a separate offense and that \u201c[e]ach charge and the evidence pertaining to it should be considered separately. The fact that you may find the accused guilty or not guilty as to one of the offenses charged should not control your verdict as to any other offense charged.\u201d As stated in the text, we think that under the circumstances of this case the quoted language should be given greater effect than in United States v. Beach, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
