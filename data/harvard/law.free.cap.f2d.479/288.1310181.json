Alleging that his injury was caused by the unseaworthiness of the vessel and the negligence of its crew, Sian brought this action against the vessel\u2019s owners, A/S Det Danske-Franske D/S. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the issue of negligence; subsequently the jury found that the vessel was not unseaworthy. Sian appeals; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Sian\u2019s injury occurred when a cargo sling broke, causing a load of rubber bales to fall back into the hold where Sian was standing. The plaintiff\u2019s claim of negligence on the part of the vessel is based on the assertion that the ship\u2019s officers failed in their duty to discover that the rope sling, which was a part of the stevedore contractor\u2019s equipment, was defective. The evidence was conflicting as to whether the sling collapsed under the weight of the cargo due to its defective condition or broke as a result of the negligence of the winch operator, a fellow employee of Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, in causing the sling to smash against the hatch coaming as the load was being lifted from the hold.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff and the winch operator testified that the sling broke because it was rotten. The record, however, is devoid of any proof that this alleged condition was evident to the ship\u2019s officers prior to the accident. Indeed, testimony showed that even the longshoremen who were handling the sling immediately before the accident and could observe it at close range did not notice any defect. Absent proof upon which the jury might find that the ship\u2019s officers had knowledge of the defective condition or that the condition should have been discovered by a reasonably prudent mate, the directed verdict on the negligence claim was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">Sian also appeals from the jury verdict on unseaworthiness. He asserts that the court refused to charge the jury that where a party fails to introduce important evidence which is within its control, the jury may infer that such evidence would disclose facts adverse to the non-producing party. The requested instruction embodies a well-recognized evidentiary rule which in the instant case was designed to call attention to the failure of the ship owner to produce the cargo sling which broke. However, this was not an appropriate case for the proposed instruction. Extensive discovery proceedings showed that the sling was neither in the possession' of the vessel owner nor of the stevedore contractor who had assumed defense of the case. Furthermore, the defending parties had no knowledge of its whereabouts. The trial record indicates that the broken sling had been routinely abandoned on dockside and simply disappeared shortly after the accident. Under these circumstances, no unfavorable inference could be drawn from the failure to produce the cargo sling at trial. See Savard v.
