Busse (the taxpayer) and Myrtle Busse<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of Randolph, Wisconsin. The parties stipulated all the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>Sometime before March 20, 1958, taxpayer invented a method and machine for stacking cans on pallets. On that date, he assigned an undivided one-half interest in the invention to his brother. A patent covering the invention issued to taxpayer on August 16, 1960. By reason of the assignment, taxpayer and his brother each owned one-half of the patent. When the brother died on July 10, 1962, his interest passed to his widow. Taxpayer and the widow organized Busse Bros., Inc., a Wisconsin corporation, on January 2, 1966, in which at all relevant times each owned 50 per cent of the issued and outstanding stock. On the same day the corporation was organized, taxpayer, his sister-in-law and the corporation entered into an oral agreement by which each shareholder sold his entire interest in the patent to the corporation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In return, the corporation agreed to pay taxpayer and his sister-in-law quarterly installments, during the life of the patent, equal to five per cent of the corporation\u2019s net selling price (as that term was defined in the agreement) of devices covered by the patent claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">During 1967 the corporation paid taxpayer $36,029.01 as his one-half share of the payments required under the agreement. Although taxpayer\u2019s 1966 assignment to the corporation was plainly \u201c[a] transfer * * * of property consisting of * * * an undivided interest [in all substantial rights to a patent] which includes a part of all such rights, by any holder <footnotemark>3</footnotemark>,\u201d as described in \u00a7 1235(a) of the Code, taxpayer was not able to treat the 1967 payments as long-term capital gain under \u00a7 1235. Such treatment was precluded by the operation of \u00a7 1235(d), because taxpayer\u2019s assignment to the corporation was a transfer between related persons, speei-fically, in the words of \u00a7 267(b) (2) as modified by \u00a7 1235(d)(1), between \u201c[a]n individual and a corporation 25 percent or more in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned * * * by * * * such individual.\u201d However, taxpayer was able to and did report the entire amount of the 1967 payments as long-term gain received upon the sale of a capital asset, under the general provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 1221 and 1222.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commissioner, pursuant to the appropriate regulations under \u00a7 483, nevertheless concluded that only $33,011.81 of the 1967 payments constituted capital gain, while the remaining $3,017.20 was unstated interest on an installment sale, taxable at ordinary income rates. In line with this analysis, the Commissioner determined an income tax deficiency for 1967 of $1,659.47. He rejected taxpayer\u2019s contention that \u00a7 483(f)(4) protected the 1967 payments from unstated interest treatment. Taxpayer petitioned the Tax Court for a redetermination, and that court determined that there was no 1967 deficiency. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-12\">The Tax Court\u2019s decision was of a narrow legal question: Given a patent transfer which is described in \u00a7 1235(a) of the Code but which does not receive its capital gain treatment under \u00a7 1235, should some part of the payments received pursuant thereto be treated as unstated interest under \u00a7 483, or is such treatment precluded by the exception contained in \u00a7 483(f)(4)? We agree with the Tax Court that such payments do qualify for the statutory exception<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, accordingly, affirm the decision and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-13\">Section 483, \u201cInterest on certain deferred payments,\u201d was added to the Code by the Revenue Act of 1964, Pub.L.No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>88-272, \u00a7 224(a), 78 Stat. 19, 77. The section provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbK\">\u201c(a) * * * [I]n the case of any contract for the sale or exchange of property there shall be treated as interest that part of a payment * * * which bears the same ratio to the amount of such payment as the total unstated interest<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> under such contract bears to the total of the payments * * * which are due under such contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1206-4\">\u2022X* \u2022X* *X* if \"X1 \u2022}\u00a3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1206-5\">\u201c(c) * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AR4D\">\u201c(1) * * * Except as provided in subsection (f), this section shall apply to any payment on account of the sale or exchange of property which constitutes part or all of the sales price and which is due more than 6 months after the date of such sale or exchange under a contract\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"arn-dedup-0\">\u201c(A) under which some or all of the payments are due more than one year after the date of such sale or exchange, and \u201c(B) under which * * * there is total unstated interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1206-8\">. The report of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which accompanied the Revenue Act of 1964 on its sojourn through the Congress, explained the general reasons for the new provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1206-9\">\u201cYour committee sees no reason for not reporting amounts as interest income merely because the seller and purchaser did not specifically provide for interest payments. This treats taxpayers differently in what are essentially the same circumstances merely on the grounds of the names assigned to the payments. In the case of depreciable property this may convert what is in reality ordinary interest income into capital gain to the seller. At the same time the purchaser can still recoup the amount as a deduction against ordinary income through depreciation deductions. Even where the property involved is a nondepreciable capital asset, the difference in tax bracket of the seller and buyer may make a distortion of the treatment of the payments advantageous from a tax standpoint. Your committee believes that manipulation of the tax laws in such a manner is undesirable and that corrective action is needed.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1206-14\">As specifically mentioned in subsection (c)(1), <em>supra, </em>subsection (f) contains outright exceptions to the applicability of \u00a7 483. There are five exceptions in all, of which only that contained in subsection (f)(4) concerns us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1206-15\">\u201c(4) Sales or exchanges of patents. \u2014This section shall not apply to any payments made pursuant to a transfer described in section 1235(a) (relating to sale or exchange of patents).\u2019,\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1206-16\">On brief, the Commissioner agrees that the payments made pursuant to the 1966 assignment \u201cappear to fall within the literal language of Section 1235(a).\u201d It would seem, then, that taxpayer is entitled to be excepted from the operation of \u00a7 483 by the \u201cplain, unambiguous and understandable\u201d words of the statute. United States v. Chused, 8 Cir., 209 F.2d 548, 550 (1954). This situation calls to mind the words of the late Circuit Judge Major for our court in Durkee Famous Foods, Inc. v. Harrison, 136 F.2d 303, 307 (1943), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 320 U.S. 718, 64 S.Ct. 367, 88 L.Ed. 422:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1206-17\">\u201cThis clear and unambiguous language calls for the application of an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>other rule, long recognized by the courts but too often, we fear, honored only by lip service. In United States v. Standard Brewery, 251 U.S. 210, 217, 40 S.Ct. 139, 140, 64 L.Ed. 229, the court said: \u2018Nothing is better settled than that in the construction of a law its meaning must first be sought in the language employed. If that be plain, it is the duty of the courts to enforce the law as written, provided it be within the constitutional authority of the legislative body which passed it.\u2019 Again, in United States v. Merriam, 263 U.S. 179, 187, 44 S.Ct. 69, 71, 68 L.Ed. 240, 29 A.L.R. 1547, the court said: \u2018But in statutes levying taxes the literal meaning of the words employed is most important, for such statutes are not to be extended by implication beyond the clear import of the language used.\u2019 Again, in United States v. Missouri P. R. Co., 278 U.S. 269, 277, 49 S.Ct. 133, 136, 73 L.Ed. 322, the court said: \u2018We are therefore bound by the words employed and are not at liberty to conjure up conditions to raise doubts in order that resort may be had to construction. * * * Construction may not be substituted for legislation.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1207-5\">\u201cAnother rule often overlooked in construing a revenue statute is that in a doubtful situation the taxpayer is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. As was said by the court in United States v. Merriam, supra, 263 U.S. at page 188, 44 S.Ct. at page 71, 68 L. Ed. 240, 29 A.L.R. 1547: \u2018If the words are doubtful, the doubt must be resolved against the government and in favor of the taxpayer.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1207-10\">We do not consider that the law in this area of statutory construction has changed appreciably since Judge Major expressed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-11\">Nevertheless, the Commissioner seeks to avoid the consequences of strict construction by invoking the judicially developed rule which justifies \u201ca departure from the letter of the law\u201d when adherence to the letter would cause an absurdity \u201cso gross as to shock the general moral or common sense\u201d and when it is plain that Congress intended \u201cthat the letter of the statute is not to prevail.\u201d Crooks v. Harrelson, 282 U.S. 55, 60, 51 S.Ct. 49, 50, 75 L.Ed. 156 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-12\">The best indication of the intent of Congress is, of course, the literal wording of the statute itself, which we have held is not ambiguous. Discussion of subsection (f) (4) in the congressional committee reports is minimal and perfunctory,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> shedding no light on the intent the Commissioner purports to see of avoiding the result the Tax Court decision dictates. Contemporaneous agency interpretation of the statute, as represented by Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.483-2(b) (4),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is largely a restatement of the statute and, when considered in the light most favorable to the Commissioner\u2019s position, is ambiguous in a way that the statute is not. To turn from a clear statute to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>an unclear regulation for guidance is hardly an accepted method of interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\">To support his contention that the plain language of the statute leads to absurd results, the Commissioner cites two examples of what he terms \u201canomalous situation[s].\u201d The first of these examples proceeds from the Commissioner\u2019s assumption that Congress created a favored class of taxpayers in enacting \u00a7 1235, a class of which the present taxpayer is not a member. Characterizing the exception of \u00a7 483(f)(4) as \u201ca benefit essentially ancillary to the benefits provided by Section 1235,\u201d the Commissioner is disturbed by the specter of the present taxpayer obtaining some of the benefits of class membership without qualifying for actual membership in the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">The second example springs from the interrelationship of words and phrases within the various subsections of \u00a7 1235. The word \u201cholder\u201d in subsection (a) is defined in subsection (b). As we have noted previously,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> taxpayer qualifies as a holder under subsection (b) (1) because he \u201ccreated\u201d the property transferred. The Commissioner points out, however, that subsection (b)(2)(B) makes eligibility for holder status by persons other than \u201ccreators\u201d turn on their not being related to the creator within the meaning of subsection (d). Thus, for example, should Busse Bros., Inc., assign the patent rights to a third party at some future time, it may not claim the benefit of the \u00a7 483(f)(4) exception even if, like taxpayer, it can qualify the transfer for capital gain treatment under \u00a7\u00a7 1221 and 1222. Or, as the Commissioner states the situation in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1208-10\">\u201cPut another way, Section 1235-type transactions disqualified because of an unauthorized \u2018transfer\u2019 would not be subject to imputed interest, but Section 1235-type transactions disqualified because of failure to meet the definition of \u2018holder\u2019 would be so subject. The proper distinction should lie, in our view, not in <em>how </em>the transaction became disqualified, but rather in <em>whether </em>the transaction was disqualified under Section 1235.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1208-11\">However much the statute, in operation, may offend the Commissioner\u2019s sense of symmetry and propriety, we cannot say that the results it causes are either absurd or unintended by Congress. Courts have no power (just as the Commissioner has no power in his capacity as an administrative official) <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cto rewrite legislative enactments to give effect to\u201d their \u201cideas of policy and fitness or the desirability of symmetry in statutes.\u201d United States v. Shirah, 4 Cir., 253 F.2d 798, 800 (1958). The powers of repeal and amendment are uniquely legislative in their nature. <em>See </em>Lang v. Commissioner, 289 U.S. 109, 113, 53 S.Ct. 534, 77 L.Ed. 1066 (1933) ; Iselin v. United States, 270 U.S. 245, 250-251, 46 S.Ct. 248, 70 L.Ed. 566 (1926); Arkansas Valley Industries, Inc. v. Freeman, 8 Cir., 415 F.2d 713, 718 (1969). We find additional support for our position in the opinion of the Eighth Cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>cuit in Helvering v. Rebsamen Motors, Inc., 128 F.2d 584, 587-588 (1942):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1209-5\">\u201cIt is not our understanding that a taxing statute is only to be read literally when a literal reading favors the Government. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1209-6\">\u201cOne may honestly and reasonably believe that in drafting a taxing act Congress uses the language which most nearly expresses the legislative intent, and that if the language used fails properly to express that intent, corrections should be made by Congressional action and not by Treasury regulations or by judicial construction. This is not to say that the language of such an act should not be accorded its full meaning or should be given an unduly restricted interpretation or one which will defeat a clearly apparent Congressional purpose. It seems to us, however, that neither the taxing authorities nor the courts are justified in virtually amending a taxing act because they are of the opinion that Congress may have had or should have had a different intention than that which was expressed in the act. There would seem to be nothing unreasonable in a rule of construction which requires legislative bodies, in enacting taxing statutes, to use language of sufficient clarity to be understood by an ordinarily intelligent taxpayer as well as by those who are required to administer and to interpret the statutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1209-7\">In sum, taxpayer\u2019s 1966 assignment to the corporation was \u201ca transfer described in section 1235(a).\u201d Payments received pursuant to the assignment thereby qualified for the exception from unstated interest treatment contained in \u00a7 483(f)(4). Since there is every reason to give effect to the plain language of the latter statute, the Commissioner erred in determining a deficiency in taxpayer\u2019s 1967 income tax. The United States Tax Court was correct in so holding, and we affirm its decision and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1204-24\">.
