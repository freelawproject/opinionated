Respondent has filed no response to this application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-10\">Upon review of the record filed with this Court by Petitioner it appears that Respondent failed to file timely objections to the Trial Examiner\u2019s decision, as required under Section 10(c) of the Act and under Sections 102.46 and 102.48 of the Rules and Regulations of the National Labor Relations Board, Series 8. Respondent has failed to show this Court any extraordinary circumstances which might excuse this failure, and it is therefore precluded under Section 10 (c) of the Act from raising any objections to Petitioner\u2019s Order before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-11\">It is therefore ordered that said application for summary entry of judgment enforcing Petitioner\u2019s Order be and the same is hereby granted and that said Order be and the same is hereby enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
