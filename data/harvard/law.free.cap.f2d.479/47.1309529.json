The attorneys represented a creditors\u2019 committee. The proceedings originated under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, but when an Amended Plan of Arrangement presented by the debtor was eventually disapproved, the Chapter XI proceedings were dismissed and the debtor was adjudicated a bankrupt. The attorneys for the creditors\u2019 committee then sought fees, for their services to the committee, in the amount of $2135. The claim was disallowed by the Referee, the Referee\u2019s Order in that respect was upheld by the District Court, and this appeal followed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-18\">Section 339(2) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 739, provides for allowance of fees to attorneys for a creditors\u2019 committee in chapter proceedings, but the statute contains the explicit provision that such fees are allowable if, and only if, \u201cthe arrangement is confirmed.\u201d As we have hitherto recited, the propos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>ed Chapter XI arrangement was not confirmed ; hence, the Referee had no choice, under section 339(2), save to reject the fee application.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The appellants contend that the proviso of section 339(2) is unconstitutional, since, according to them, it provides for the taking of property without compensation and establishes an arbitrary classification. They also urge that the proviso penalizes the exercise of the free speech right established by the First Amendment. In our opinion, this second argument, while ingenious, has no merit whatsoever. We reject the first argument on our conclusion that the Congress adopted a perfectly reasonable and rational basis in providing that fees to the attorneys for creditors\u2019 committees shall be allowed from the estate of a debtor in chapter proceedings only in cases wherein plans of arrangement are confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The appellants also rely upon section 64(a) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 104. Assuming arguendo as urged by the appellants, that the statute allows attorneys fees such as those here claimed when \u201cthe confirmation of an arrangement . . . has been refused . upon the objection and through the efforts and at the cost and expense of . . . .\u201d a creditors\u2019 committee, one of the Referee\u2019s findings undercuts the validity of the appellant\u2019s reliance upon the section. The Referee found, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[a]t no time did the creditor\u2019s committee object to the arrangement . . . .\u201d and \u201c[t] his court therefore concluded that the creditors\u2019 committee through its attorneys had performed no act which caused the confirmation of the arrangement to be refused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">The Referee\u2019s quoted finding and conclusion are, essentially determinations of fact. They were upheld by the District Court, and since they are supported by substantial evidence, we are in no position to disturb them.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
