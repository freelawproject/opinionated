After holding an evi-dentiary hearing on the petition, the district court denied all relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-27\">The involuntariness claim is premised on Evans\u2019 contention that his oral and written statements were the product of promises by the interrogating officers that he would not receive the death penalty if he confessed to the crime. This factual issue was fully litigated and fairly resolved against Evans in the state trial court; that determination was affirmed on appeal by the Louisiana Supreme Court, where the question received full and careful consideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-28\">Our review of the original trial record and the transcript of the federal eviden-tiary hearing reveals more-than-substantial evidence to support the state courts\u2019 factual resolution and the federal habeas court\u2019s conclusion that the confessions were free and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-29\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1101-23\">.
