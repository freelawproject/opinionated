We think so, and, for reasons to be stated, the decision of the district court will be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The subcontractor, Coastal Steel Erectors, Inc., brought this action under the provisions of the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 270a et seq., in the name of the United States against Algernon Blair, Inc., and its surety, United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company. Blair had entered a contract with the United States for the construction of a naval hospital in Charleston County, South Carolina. Blair had then contracted with Coastal to perform certain steel erection and supply certain equipment in conjunction with Blair\u2019s contract with the United States. Coastal commenced performance of its obligations, supplying its own cranes for handling and placing steel. Blair refused to pay for crane rental, maintaining that it was not obligated to do so under the subcontract. Because of Blair\u2019s failure to make payments for crane rental, and after completion of approximately 28 percent of the subcontract, Coastal terminated its performance. Blair then proceeded to complete the job with a new subcontractor. Coastal brought this action to recover for labor and equipment furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">The district court found that the subcontract required Blair to pay for crane use and that Blair\u2019s refusal to do so was such a material breach as to justify Coastal\u2019s terminating performance. This finding is not questioned on appeal. The court then found that under the contract the amount due Coastal, less what had already been paid, totaled approximately $37,000. Additionally, the court found Coastal would have lost more than $37,000 if it had completed performance. Holding that any amount due Coastal must be reduced by any loss it would have incurred by complete performance of the contract, the court denied recovery to Coastal. While the district court correctly stated the \u201c \u2018normal\u2019 rule of contract damages,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we think Coastal is entitled to recover in quantum meruit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">In United States for Use of Susi Contracting Co. v. Zara Contracting Co., 146 F.2d 606 (2d Cir. 1944), a Miller Act action, the court was faced with a situation similar to that involved here \u2014 the prime contractor had unjustifiably breached a subcontract after partial performance by the subcontractor. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-13\">For it is an accepted principle of contract law, often applied in the case of construction contracts, that the promisee upon breach has the option to forego any suit on the contract and claim only the reasonable value of his performance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-14\">146 F.2d at 610. The Tenth Circuit has also stated that the right to seek recovery under quantum meruit in a Miller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Act ease is clear.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Quantum meruit recovery is not limited to an action against the prime contractor but may also be brought against the Miller Act surety, as in this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, that the complaint is not clear in regard to the theory of a plaintiff\u2019s recovery does not preclude recovery under quantum meruit. Narragansett Improvement Co. v. United States, 290 F.2d 577 (1st Cir. 1961). A plaintiff may join a claim for quantum meruit with a claim for damages from breach of contract.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">In the present case, Coastal has, at its own expense, provided Blair with labor and the use of equipment. Blair, who breached the subcontract, has retained these benefits without having fully paid for them. On these facts, Coastal is entitled to restitution in quantum meruit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">The \u201crestitution interest,\u201d involving a combination of unjust impoverishment with unjust gain, presents the strongest case for relief. If, following Aristotle, we regard the purpose of justice as the maintenance of an equilibrium of goods among members of society, the restitution interest presents twice as strong a claim to judicial intervention as the reliance interest, since if A not only causes B to lose one unit but appropriates that unit to himself, the resulting discrepancy between A and B is not one unit but two.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-17\">Fuller &amp; Perdue, The Reliance Interest in Contract Damages, 46 Yale L.J. 52, 56 (1936).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-18\"><em>The </em>impact of quantum meruit is to allow a promisee to recover the value of services he gave to the defendant irrespective of whether he would have lost money on the contract and been unable to recover in a suit on the contract. Scaduto v. Orlando, 381 F.2d 587, 595 (2d Cir. 1967). The measure of recovery for quantum meruit is the reasonable value of the performance, Restatement of Contracts \u00a7 347 (1932); and recovery is undiminished by any loss which would have been incurred by complete performance. 12 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 1485, at 312 (3d ed. 1970). While the contract price may be evidence of reasonable value of the services, it does not measure the value of the performance or limit recovery.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rather, the standard for measuring the reasonable value of the services rendered is the amount for which such services could have been purchased from one in the plaintiff\u2019s position at the time and place the services were rendered.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"abq-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Since the district court has not yet accurately determined the reasonable value of the labor and equipment use furnished by Coastal to Blair, the case must be remanded for those findings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When the amount has been determined, judgment will be entered in favor of Coastal, less payments already made under the contract. Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, the decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Reversed and remanded with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-8\">.
