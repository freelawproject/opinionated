We hold that it did so, and reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-21\">The defendant was convicted on Counts I, II, III and XI of the indictment which charged him with violating the mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The evidence showed that the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>fendant operated the Midwest Mutual Casualty Company and its management company, Gibraltar Management Corporation. The essence of the charge was that the defendant had fraudulently misrepresented the financial status of the insurance company so that it could continue doing business for the defendant\u2019s benefit, despite its failure to maintain the assets required by state law. The first three counts charged that the defendant had mailed fraudulent financial reports to the State of Missouri Division of Insurance. Count XI charged that he had caused the Division of Insurance to mail fraudulent information concerning the financial status of the company to an individual who had made inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">The trial judge correctly instructed the jury that the following essential elements of the offense must be established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-5\">\u201cFirst, the defendant\u2019s act or acts of having devised and having intended to devise a scheme or artifice to defraud and to obtain money and property from Gibraltar Management Corporation, and Midwest Mutual Casualty Company and its policyholders and claimants by means of the false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises as submitted to you in this charge; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-6\">\u201cSecond, the defendant\u2019s act or acts of using or causing the use of the mails as submitted to you; and \u201cThird, the defendant\u2019s wilful and knowing doing of said act or acts with intent to execute the scheme or artifice to defraud, as submitted to you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"akm-dedup-0\">However, at the close of his instructions, the court made the following comments to the jury with respect to the defendant\u2019s intent to defraud and execute the scheme to defraud:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-7\">\u201cLet\u2019s take the cross-checks which occurred at the end of each month in respect to the particular statements which are involved in Counts One, Two, Three and Eleven. <em>It seems to me that this evidence shows beyond a reasonable doubt that under an arrangement which was dictated by the defendant, </em>and recorded by the witness Doris Howard, about drawing a check on Gibraltar account at the end of the month payable to Midwest, and holding it up until a check was thrown back from Midwest to Gibraltar on the first of the month, or the first business day following the close of the last month, <em>that this arrangement was designed to and did misrepresent the financial condition of Midwest Casualty Company on the books of the company and on the statements submitted to the Insurance Department.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-9\">\u201cIn the first place, I read you the paragraph in the management contract which provided that the management fees would not be due and payable to Gibraltar from the premiums written during the month until sometime on or before the 15th day of the month following that in which the business was written. And you have heard the evidence which, in my judgment is clear, and shows beyond a reasonable doubt that Gibraltar was in fact in violation of that contract drawing premiums before they were due on estimates in amounts which were quite substantially higher than when they became due. And this would adversely affect the financial position of Midwest if it were honestly reported in the financial statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-10\">\u201cAnd to show you why I believe the evidence establishes this beyond a reasonable doubt, I am going to refer to the fact that the arrangement, as shown by the document in evidence that Mrs. Howard identified with her manuscript on it that she was told this procedure by the defendant, to follow it, there was a specific direction that the Gibraltar check which was drawn on the 31st and which was supposed to put back this overdraw and for which there was no money in the bank, was not to be deposited until the first when Midwest had given it back another check which created a new overdraw on the management fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>and for which Midwest had money in the bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-5\">\u201cThe net result of this transaction is that Midwest was itself paying back, restoring to Gibraltar, the overdraw which it pretended to have paid off by drawing a check and dating it on the 31st of the month and then holding it up and not depositing it in the bank. \u201cA good way to test that in your mind is to just assume that Midwest had drawn a check on the 31st, since the end of the month is said to be a normal accounting period, and was so used by Gibraltar for the amount that it drew on the first. It would have reduced Midwest\u2019s cash balance by that amount on the 31st. So in this way, a check which was never deposited, which was not intended to be deposited on the 31st of a month, was misrepresented in the statements as cash, a deposit in transit, when as a matter of fact it had not been deposited under the understanding and was not deposited until the first of the month. And I am sure that the evidence shows this beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">The trial court may express its opinion on the guilt of the accused only where all facts are admitted by the accused and only a question of law remains. United States v. Murdock, 290 U.S. 389, 54 S.Ct. 223, 78 L.Ed. 381 (1933); Billeci v. United States, 87 U. S.App.D.C. 274, 184 F.2d 394 (1950). See, United States v. Spica, 413 F.2d 129, 133 (8th Cir. 1969). Where the question of intent to commit the offense charged is disputed, an expression of opinion on the guilt of the accused is reversible error. United States v. Murdock, supra; United States v. Musgrave, 444 F.2d 755, 763 (5th Cir. 1971); United States v. Smith, 399 F.2d 896, 899 (6th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-13\">In the present case, the trial judge instructed the jury that the evidence showed \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that the defendant had \u201cdictated\u201d an arrangement which \u201cwas designed to and did misrepresent the financial condition of Midwest Casualty Company on the books of the company and on the statements submitted to the Insurance Department.\u201d This statement made it clear to the jury that, in the trial judge\u2019s opinion, the government had produced proof beyond a reasonable doubt of two of the three essential elements of the offense \u2014 that the defendant had acted with specific intent to defraud, and that he had, with intent to execute his scheme to defraud, submitted reports to the Division of Insurance. Yet, the issue of intent was disputed by the defendant in cross-examination, through defense witnesses and in his argument to the jury. In our view, the trial judge\u2019s comments were equivalent to a partial directed verdict and expression of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-14\">The government urges, however, that in this case, the trial judge\u2019s comments are not reversible under <em>Murdock </em>because the trial judge did not actually use the term \u201cguilt\u201d in stating its opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find this distinction to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>without merit. Where the essential element of intent is in dispute, the defendant is just as effectively prejudiced whether the court states, as in <em>Murdock, </em>that the defendant is \u201cguilty,\u201d or if it states, as here, that the government has established the disputed element of intent beyond a reasonable doubt. See, McBride v. United States, 314 F.2d 75 (10th Cir. 1963); Bennett v. United States, 252 F.2d 97, 99 (10th Cir. 1958); Davis v. United States, 227 F.2d 568 (10th Cir. 1955). <em>Cf., </em>United States v. Ornstein, 355 F.2d 222, 224 (6th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">In McBride v. United States, <em>supra, </em>the defendant was also charged with mail fraud. He argued that there was no intent to defraud. At the close of that trial, the judge also commented on the evidence. He did not state that he believed the defendant to be \u201cguilty,\u201d but made it clear that he believed that fraudulent intent had been established.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reversed, relying on United States v. Murdock, <em>supra, </em>and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-13\">\u201c * * * The comments must * * * be taken as a statement of the court that the accused was guilty, and this was not warranted under the circumstances. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-15\">McBride v. United States, <em>supra, </em>314 F. 2d at 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-16\">While we believe that the trial judge\u2019s statement of opinion with regard to the element of intent constitutes reversible error under United States v. Murdock, <em>supra, </em>we believe his other comments provide additional reasons for reversing this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As Judge Stephenson recently said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-17\">\u201c* * * ^he trial court commands the attention and respect of the jury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>Great care must be exercised so as to avoid the appearance of advocacy for a particular party. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Scruggs v. United States, 450 F.2d 359, 363 (8th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, Chambers v. United States, 405 U.S. 1071, 92 S.Ct. 1521, 31 L.Ed.2d 804 (1972). Accord, United States v. Dunmore, 446 F. 2d 1214, 1218 (8th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1041, 92 S.Ct. 726, 30 L.Ed.2d 734 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The Supreme Court has recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-7\">\u201c* -\u00bb * iphg influence of the trial judge on the jury \u2018is necessarily and properly of great weight\u2019 and \u2018his lightest word or intimation is received with deference, and may prove controlling\u2019. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Quercia v. United States, 289 U.S. 466, 470, 53 S.Ct. 698, 699, 77 L.Ed. 1321 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">In Weare v. United States, 1 F.2d 617, 618 (8th Cir. 1924), rev\u2019d, 276 U.S. 599, 48 S.Ct. 321, 72 L.Ed. 724 (1928), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-13\">\u201cThe instructions, however, should not be argumentative. The court cannot direct a verdict of guilty in criminal cases, even if the facts are undisputed. * * * It should not be permitted to do indirectly what it cannot do directly, and by .its instructions to in effect argue the jury into a verdict of guilty.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-15\">The trial judge\u2019s analysis of the evidence was, by its terms, an argument for his view of the evidence. See, Har<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>dy v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 253, 335 F.2d 288 (1964). Throughout his comments, he made argumentative statements which emphasized his belief that a fraudulent intent had been proven. Furthermore, while the trial judge summarized the evidence favorable to the government, it failed to do the same with respect to the evidence submitted by the defendant. This was error, United States v. Dunmore, <em>supra, </em>446 F.2d at 1218; Boatright v. United States, 105 F.2d 737, 739 (8th Cir. 1939), even though the evidence supporting the defendant was insubstantial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The only mention of evidence produced by the defendant was a negative one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-4\">\u201cMr. Burgee\u2019s testimony [the defendant\u2019s accountant], in some respects, left a great deal wanting, in my mind. He assumed some things were loans from Able that were shown on the books to be not loans. He also tried a cut-off date for his computation to show how much of the agents\u2019 collections had been realized at the time Gibraltar made this statement. And even then, his own evidence, making those assumptions, showed that at the time the $150,000.00 was completely paid, that there was a large part of those agents\u2019 collections which went into the payments. And I think you should scrutinize that transaction very carefully.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">Moreover, the prejudice to the defendant from these erroneous comments was not cured by the trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury that they were the sole judge of the facts, and that they must determine whether there was an intent to defraud beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> United States v. Smith, <em>supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>399 F.2d at 899; McBride v. United States, supra; Davis v. United States, <em>supra. </em>A similar instruction was given by the trial judge in the <em>Murdock </em>case. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court reversed. This Court has recognized that \u201ca mere withdrawal of words and a direction to the jury that the question is for them, is not always sufficient.\u201d Rudd v. United States, 173 F. 912 (8th Cir. 1909). See, United States v. Dunmore, <em>supra, </em>446 F.2d at 1217 n. 2; Cook v. United States, 18 F.2d 50 (8th Cir. 1927). Furthermore, in giving the alleged curative instruction, the trial judge emphasized his authority by pointing out his long legal experience and indicating that he was more likely than the jury to understand the \u201ccrucial\u201d or \u201cprimary\u201d matters on which he commented.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">We regret the necessity of reversing this judgment on the grounds that the experienced, able and fair-minded judge exceeded permissible comment on the evidence. The ease against the defendant was a strong one, but the court\u2019s statement that the defendant\u2019s fraudulent intent had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, along with his comments on the evidence, substantially interfered with the defendant\u2019s right to trial by jury, and require that the defendant be given a new trial. See, United States v. Hayward, 136 U.S.App.D.C. 300, 420 F. 2d 142, 145 (1969); United States v. Porter, 386 F.2d 270, 276 (6th Cir. 1967); United States v. Ornstein, <em>supra; </em>Davis v. United States, <em>supra, </em>227 F.2d at 570; United States v. Link, 202 F.2d 592, 595 (3rd Cir. 1953); Rudd v. United States, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-14\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-13\">. The defendant argues that it was error to admit evidence of acts committed beyond the period prescribed by the statute of limitations. This argument is without merit. United States v. Andreas, 458 F.2d 491 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 848, 93 S.Ct. 54, 34 L.Ed.2d 89 (1972); United States v. Blosser, 440 F.2d 697, 699 (10th Cir. 1971); United States v. Gross, 416 F.2d 1205, 1210 (8th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1013, 90 S.Ct. 1245, 25 L.Ed.2d 427 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">The defendant argues that the trial judge did not adequately instruct with respect to the evidence of the defendant\u2019s actions prior to the statute of limitations, and that he did not adequately instruct with respect to those actions which constituted violations of state law. This argument is without merit. The instructions taken as a whole were quite sufficient in these respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-15\">The defendant argues that the proof of mailing was insufficient. The evidence as to mailing, particularly with respect to Counts I and XI, was clear. With respect to Count I, there was evidence of a practice of mailing in the defendant\u2019s office, and the envelope containing the defendant\u2019s financial report was produced. The envelope contained a prepaid postage mark and certified mail tags. With respect to Count XI, there was evidence of an unvaried practice of mailing at the Department of Insurance, and there was testimony by the individual who had mailed the letter and by the recipient that it had been mailed. With respect to Counts III and IV, the evidence was not so strong but was, nonetheless, sufficient. Compare, United States v. Brickey, 426 F.2d 680, 684 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 828, 91 S.Ct. 55, 27 L.Ed.2d 57 (1970); Winel v. United States, 365 F.2d 646, 648 (8th Cir. 1966). But see, United States v. Baker, 50 F.2d 122 (2nd Cir. 1931). In oral argument before this Court, the defendant appeared to suggest that the only fundamental issue in the case was that of the defendant\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-23\">Finally, the defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient to show that his insurance company was insolvent, or that he had fraudulently misrepresented the company\u2019s financial status. These contentions are also without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b887-24\">. None of the other counts of the indictment went to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b889-7\">. The only element on which the trial judge did not offer his opinion was whether the mails were in fact used. However, as we indicated in n. 1, <em>supra, </em>the evidence on mailing was clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">The government relies on Hartzell v. United States, 72 F.2d 569 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 293 U.S. 621, 55 S.Ct. 216, 79 L.Ed. 708 (1934). In <em>Hartzell, </em>however, the Court found that an exceptional situation under United States v. Murdock, 290 U.S. 389, 54 S.Ct. 223, 78 L.Ed. 381 (1983), existed in that a violation of the statute, with which the defendant was charged, existed on the basis of the undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-16\">In United States v. DePugh, 434 F.2d 548, 554 (8th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S, 978, 91 S.Ct. 1208, 28 L.Ed.2d 328 (1971), the defendant was convicted of bail jumping. This Court sustained the conviction even though the trial judge had instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-17\">\u201cAnd as I told you, under the law I think it would be a fair finding that the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he deliberately left Norborne, Missouri, absented himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>from there where \u2014 the only, address the government had for him, and did not return to the Western District of Missouri for further proceedings in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">In <em>DePugh, </em>unlike the present case, the Court of Appeals specifically found that the trial judge had fairly summarized the evidence and had not assumed the role of an advocate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b890-7\">. In McBride v. United States, 314 F.2d 75, 76 (10th Cir. 1963), the trial court had instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-8\">\u201c 'Now at this point I should like to say, as the third member or thirteenth member of the jury, that this is a rather simple case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-9\">\u201c \u2018The facts are clear in my mind that this little corporation was organized but for one purpose, and that is to use the mails and to defraud people, little people, out of money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-10\">\u201c T believe from the evidence that Mr. Rogers had no intention at any time to be in good faith in his work, in the organization of the company, the use of the mails, sending salesmen out to go out and prey upon people who were in desperate need of some financial help.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-11\">\u201c \u2018Now we get down to later; this accused was employed or engaged.

He is bound to have known it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-20\">\u201c \u2018Now I don\u2019t know. He says that he did it in good faith and that he was employed and that he worked as an employee, that he reported these things in order that somebody might, the company might make these loans.

The trial judge commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-26\">\u201cNow, the third and crucial \u2014 not crucial, but third and one of the primary issues in the case \u2014 is the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>diversion of $127,000 worth of alleged premium remittances to Midwest to the bank account of the Gibraltar Management Corporation in Kansas City, and the alleged use of that money to pretend to make a contribution to surplus. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say exactly in what amount the proceeds of that $127,000 worth of checks from agents and from Able Investment Company were premium collections, and the exact amount that was used in a pretense to make a contribution to capital. But the evidence in my judgment shows beyond a reasonable doubt that somewhere between fifty-odd thousand dollars, as I think is properly inferable from the defendant\u2019s evidence or ninety-something thousand dollars, and possibly the $127,000 of Midwest\u2019s money was used by Gibraltar in a pretense of making a contribution. In other words, <em>the evidence shows beyond a reasonable do%M </em>that the Insurance Department <em>was deceived, </em>into believing that somewhere between fifty-some odd thousand dollars and $127,000.00 was contributed to surplus of Midwest when it was a matter of fact the proceeds of checks belonging to Midwest which were <em>surreptitiously </em>carried physically from St. Louis to Kansas City, and the checks were cuased [sic] to be endorsed by a minor employee named Lukers on behalf of Midwest to Gibraltar Management Corporation, and were put in Gibraltar Management Corporation\u2019s accounts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-16\">\n<em>\u201cI know sometimes the hand is quicker than the eye, but this time it is pretty sloio, and it would be a peculiar lack of perception and vision to be able to not see through this.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-17\">\u201cYou will remember that up to this time in March, those premiums had gone through directly to Midwest and been deposited in Midwest\u2019s account. No one had claimed that they should go through Gibraltar\u2019s account in the first instance and the checks were made payable by Able and others to Midwest Mutual Casualty for these remittances. Then the crisis of March cameup [sic] when the Insurance Superintendent demanded $150,000.00 contribution to surplus of Midwest Mutual Casualty Company, and despite the provisions of the contract, and despite the repeated overdrafts which were maintained througli the cross-check matter, under Gibraltar\u2019s management fee account, the whole practice was changed. The checks were endorsed directly to Gibraltar Management Corporation and never entered on Midwest Mutual Casualty Company\u2019s account. I believe the evidence shows this beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-18\"><em>\u201cAnd to further cover up the transaction, </em>they weren\u2019t even deposited in any St. Louis account.

And you should give consideration to these things. But I think there are some primary issues in this case on which the evidence is quite clear and I want to tell you what I believe the evidence has shown on these particular items which are, in my judgment, some of the most important in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"acd-dedup-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>\u201cOn the issues I don\u2019t discuss, I don\u2019t feel that my comments would be of any help to you.

We think that the ABA Standards, Trial by Jury (Tentative Draft, May 1968) \u00a7 4.7, provide some sound standards for the trial judge who does feel a commentary is necessary in a particular case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-21\">\u201c4.7 Summary of and comment on evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>\u201c(a) The court, at the time it instructs the jury, may summarize and comment on the evidence, provided the jury is clearly and unequivocally instructed that it is the exclusive judge of the facts, that it is to determine the weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses, and that it is not bound by the comments of the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-15\">\u201c(b) The summary and comment permitted in subsection (a) is governed by the following principles:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-16\">\u201c(i) The court may analyze the evidence, draw the attention of the jury to important portions of the evidence, and fairly and accurately summarize the contentions of both the prosecution and the defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-17\">\u201c(ii) The court may not suggest a verdict of guilty or not guilty, nor may the court directly express an opinion on the guilt or innocence of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-18\">\u201c(iii) The court may not present any item of evidence as a proven or undisputed fact unless the matter has been affirmatively conceded or is the subject of judicial notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-19\">\u201c(iv) The court may state the law and comment on matters in evidence bearing on the credibility of any witness, but may not directly express an opinion that certain testimony is worthy or unworthy of belief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">The tentative draft of the ABA Standards, Trial by Jury were submitted to the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association along with the recommendation of the Council of the Section of Criminal Law that \u00a7 4.7 be omitted.

Others in opposition were primarily motivated, however, by recent developments which would make such comment particularly hazardous in cases where the defendant does not take the stand, and by the fact that permitting it only when the defendant does take the stand might pose other problems with respect to the defendant\u2019s right to testify which outweigh the value of such comment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">See, Griffin v.

As Judge Matthes summarizes in his dissent, \u201cif a judge deems it desirable for the sake of achieving a just result to comment upon the evidence solely for the purpose of aiding and guiding the jury in arriving at a just and fair verdict he is privileged to do so; <em>but he must be. careful not to intrude upon the province of the jury to make an unfettered and uninfluenced determination of fact matters submitted for their consideration.\u201d </em>(My emphasis.)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">When does a trial judge cross the line? If the district judge did not invade permissible boundaries here, then we might as well forget the rhetorical warnings and simply instruct lawyers that in the future this court will not entertain error relating to prejudicial judicial comment. If, as is asserted here, the evidence is so overwhelming, why must any trial judge advise a jury that in his opinion the essential elements of the criminal offense have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt?</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">I sense comments such as this are fomented because of a lingering doubt by some jurists that jurors as a whole are not really intelligent enough to come to the <em>right </em>conclusion. This lingering doubt has been the basis down through the years for the continuing invidious attack against the jury system. How wrong this is. Judges have no gifted insight or peculiar competence in determining facts; their view as to what is right and just must always be equated with that of the common man. In this area of the law the benevolent judgment of a judge deserves no higher consideration on the scale of justice than any other man. The danger of such comment is that it places the defendant at an unfair disadvantage since it allows the presid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>ing judge to testify as a professional witness and in a manner no other witness would ever be allowed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">When a judge informs a jury that in his opinion the essential elements of a crime have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, he instructs the jury that the defendant is guilty. To attempt to hold otherwise is to shadow box with reality. When this is done, the judge serves as a fact finder. Yet as a fact finder he possesses the same human frailties, biases and prejudices as the ordinary juror. In fact, he falls far short of the valued expertise of the jury, for the priceless value of the <em>composite </em>jury is its ability to <em>equate </em>conduct in terms of community values and common affairs of life. A single judge cannot possess a similar sense of community values.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">We should not forget, as Justice Strong noted almost a century ago in Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 308-309, 25 L.Ed. 664 (1879): \u201cThe very idea of a jury is a body of men composed of the peers or equals of the person whose rights it is selected or summoned to determine; that is, of his neighbors, fellows, associates, persons having the same legal status in society as that which he holds.\u201d This postulate is destroyed if the judge assumes the thirteenth chair in the jury box.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">In a criminal proceeding, whenever any trial judge comments on the evidence in such an unfair manner so as to tell the jury, directly or indirectly, that a defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, it is my judgment that, regardless of the strength of the evidence, the defendant has been denied a fair trial and due process requires a reversal of the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b895-8\">MATTHES, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AccM\">(concurring in part \u2014 dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">The rejection of appellant\u2019s contentions of error set forth in the margin of the majority opinion, footnote 1, has my full approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">But, for reasons stated below, I respectfully disagree with the holding that the district judge impermissibly commented upon the evidence in his charge to the jury, and I therefore dissent from the reversal and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">We are considering an appeal from a judgment of conviction following a protracted jury trial which commenced on February 11, 1971, and terminated by the return of verdicts on March 3, 1971. This ease is typical of many prosecutions for violating the mail fraud statute, in that the scheme and artifice to defraud was so designed as to require the manipulation and juggling of the bank accounts, certain assets and the records of the two companies involved, namely, Midwest Mutual and Gibraltar Management Company. This manipulation over a span of more than four years placed the Government in the position where it was required to introduce into evidence voluminous documents and the testimony of many witnesses in order to sustain and carry the burden of proving the appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. There were 18 Government witnesses and three testified on behalf of the appellant (appellant did not testify). In this setting, the court\u2019s charge was, of necessity, quite lengthy. It required 43 typewritten pages of the trial transcript to reproduce the court\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-13\">From this brief background, we turn to the question in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-14\">We need cite no authority for the settled principle that the charge must be viewed and considered in its entirety and as a whole. It is also a cardinal principle of federal jurisdiction that the trial judge in a criminal case is more than a mere moderator. He is charged with the heavy responsibility of so conducting the trial that justice is rendered. To that end, the judge may assist the jury in arriving at a just conclusion by explaining and commenting upon the evidence and by expressing his opinion upon the facts, provided, of course, he makes it clear that all factual questions are left to the jury for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>Nearly a century ago, the Supreme Court of the United States stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-4\">\u201cIn the courts of the United States, as in those of England, from which our practice was derived, the judge, in submitting a case to the jury, may, at his discretion, whenever he thinks it necessary to assist them in arriving at a just conclusion, comment upon the evidence, <em>call their attention to parts of it which he thinks important, and express his opinion upon the facts; </em>and the expression of such an opinion, when no rule of law is incorrectly stated, and all matters of fact are ultimately submitted to the determination of the jury, cannot be reviewed on writ of error.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Vicksburg &amp; Meridian R. R. Co. v. Putnam, 118 U.S. 545, 553, 7 S.Ct. 1, 2, 30 L.Ed. 257 (1886), cited with approval in Ray v. United States, 367 F.2d 258, 262 (8th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 913, 87 S.Ct. 863, 17 L.Ed.2d 785 (1967). This principle was adhered to by the Supreme Court in Quercia v. United States. 289 U.S. 466, 469, 53 S. Ct. 698, 77 L.Ed. 1321 (1933), and again in United States v. Murdock, 290 U.S. 389, 394, 54 S.Ct. 223, 78 L.Ed. 381 (1933). Cases decided by the federal courts of appeals standing for the same principle are legion. It is sufficient for the purpose of this dissent to cite only Hartzell v. United States, 72 F.2d 569 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 293 U.S. 621, 55 S.Ct. 216, 79 L.Ed. 708 (1934), and Franano v. United States, 310 F.2d 533 (8th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 373 U.S. 940, 83 S.Ct. 1545, 10 L.Ed.2d 694 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">In the <em>Franano </em>case, which I authored on behalf of a unanimous court, I delineated the function of a trial judge in presiding over a criminal case and cited many authorities to support my conclusions. I adhere to everything written in the <em>Franano </em>opinion, and would pursue the same course in disposing of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">In the final analysis, as I see the situation, every case must rest upon its own bottom. I find no quarrel with the proposition that a trial judge should exercise care and discretion in expressing an opinion and should never identify his position so as to appear partial. In brief, and to the point, if a judge deems it desirable for the sake of achieving a just result to comment upon the evidence solely for the purpose of aiding and guiding the jury in arriving at a just and fair verdict he is privileged to do so; but he must be careful not to intrude upon the province of the jury to make an unfettered and uninfluenced determination of fact matters submitted for their consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">The comments which the majority condemns here are quite different in my view than the charge that was found fatally defective in Quercia v. United States, <em>supra </em>and United States v. Murdock, <em>supra. </em>In <em>Quercia, </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-9\">\u201c \u2018And now I am going to tell you what I think of the defendant\u2019s testimony. You may have noticed, Mr. Foreman [of the jury] and gentlemen, that he wiped his hands during his testimony. It is rather a curious thing, but that is almost always an indication of lying. Why it should be so we don\u2019t know, but that is the fact. I think that every single word that man said, except when he agreed with the Government\u2019s testimony, was. a lie.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">289 U.S. at 468, 53 S.Ct. at 698. In <em>Murdock, </em>the condemned charge was submitted in this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-11\">\u201cThe court feels from the evidence in this case that the Government has sustained the burden cast upon it by the law and has proved that this defendant is guilty in manner and form as charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">290 U.S. at 393, 54 S.Ct. at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-13\">In Hartzell v. United States, supra, the trial judge gave this instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-14\">\u201cNow, with that caution I will say to you, gentlemen, that I have listened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>to all this evidence as intently as you have I think, and in the opinion of the court the government has established the facts which ought to convince reasonable men beyond a reasonable doubt, and taking the evidence as a whole I think the government has established the allegations of these several counts that remain in the indictment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">72 F.2d at 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">It seems to me that the <em>Hartzell </em>instruction was far more poisonous than that portion of Chief Judge Becker\u2019s comments which the majority condemns as impermissible and prejudicial. Yet, in the <em>Hartzell </em>case, also involving a mail fraud prosecution, this court held that the court\u2019s comment was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">After careful consideration of Judge Becker\u2019s charge in its entirety I have reached the conclusion that Judge Becker\u2019s assailed comments were not so impermissible as to constitute prejudicial error. At the outset of Judge Becker\u2019s charge, he informed the jury of the presumption of innocence and that it was necessary for the Government to prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In fact no less than four times was the jury told that before they could convict, the Government was required to produce evidence which convinced the jury the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Nowhere in the instructions, including the comments which are complained of, did Judge Becker even remotely suggest that he felt that the Government had proved the appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and he cautioned the jury to decide the case on the basis of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">As I view this record, there was negligible conflict in the evidence concerning three of the devices, commented upon by the judge, which were successfully used by the appellant in perpetrating the fraudulent scheme which eventually resulted in the financial collapse of the companies involved: (1) the check kiting procedure; (2) the improper and unlawful pledging of the United States Treasury bills owned by Midwest to secure Gibraltar loans; and (3) the diversion of a substantial amount of premium remittances (between $50,000 and $127,000) for the purpose of deceiving the Missouri Division of Insurance. Since the matters were proved beyond doubt, I am not willing to fault the judge for telling the jury that they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">Certainly, I recognize the appellant was entitled to a fair trial, but not a perfect one. I am convinced that the able and seasoned trial judge exercised restraint and caution throughout the trial and in submitting the case to the jury. The evidence of guilt was strong and convincing. Consequently, I cannot bring myself to believe that Judge Becker\u2019s comments, which are the sole ground for sending the case back for another long trial, improperly influenced the jury. I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
