We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-8\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-9\">The goods are substantially identical and are sold in overlapping channels. Though appellant\u2019s brief emphasizes use of appellee\u2019s dyes in \u201cplastics, paints and inks,\u201d the testimony of record establishes use on fabrics and for inking fabrics. Though appellant\u2019s .brief lists numerous non-textile oriented magazines in which appellee advertises, the record includes appellee\u2019s ads in \u201cTextile World.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-10\">The marks, considered in their entireties and under all the circumstances of this case, are sufficiently similar to cause a likelihood of confusion, deception or mistake. Appellant argues strenuously that the common prefix \u201cHeli\u201d is descriptive of dyes, citing derivative definitions found in <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>(1961). No evidence establishes familiarity of purchasers with those definitions or necessary application of those definitions by purchasers to appellee\u2019s marks. Appellant then alleges that appellee\u2019s marks are themselves substantially descriptive while its own mark HELIANE is arbitrary, coined and without meaning in the dye world. The record however contains appellant\u2019s statement to the examiner that its mark \u201cis from the Latin word \u2018Helianine\u2019 which has a meaning of a red coloring compound.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-12\">The record further establishes appellee\u2019s and its predecessor\u2019s exclusive use in the United States, beginning almost half a century ago, of marks beginning with \u201cHeli\u201d and appellee\u2019s active and successful efforts to maintain that exclusivity. In 1965-66, annual sales approximated $76,000 under HELIO and $6,000,000 under HELIOGEN. The case is thus unlike those illustrated by Air Products, Inc. v. Marquette Manufacturing Co., Inc., 301 F.2d 348, 49 C.C.P.A. 973 (1962), wherein prefixes used by both parties and constituting terms of common descriptive connotation were disregarded in determining a likelihood of confusion. We think viewers of HELIANE who are familiar with the fact that marks beginning with \u201cHeli\u201d have for so long indicated a single source of dyestuffs could believe HELIANE to be another dye from that source.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-13\">If there be doubt, the present case is an appropriate one for application of the practice of resolving doubt in favor of the long established user and against the newcomer to whom the entire lexicon is available for construction of an unquestionably distinct mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-14\">Appellant argues strongly that the board erred in refusing its motion to strike appellee\u2019s brief. Appellee filed a single brief, designated \u201cReply Brief,\u201d after appellant had filed its brief. Appellant has not made its brief of record here and we cannot therefore judge whether appellee included material not properly in reply to it. The board, in denying the motion, said it would not consider anything in appellee\u2019s brief which was not properly in <em>reply </em>to appellant\u2019s brief. We find support in the record for each holding of the board and are thus convinced that the board did exactly as it said it would. The failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1404\">*1404</page-number>to file a timely main brief to which appellant could have responded is not to be encouraged. We do not feel, however, that the board was influenced by or made its decision in response to any \u201cnon-reply\u201d type material in appellee\u2019s brief and cannot see therefore how appellant was in any way prejudiced by the action of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-4\">Similarly, the board refused to allow appellant to rely on material introduced by appellee because (1) it was not introduced by appellant under the Trademark Rules and (2) because it was irrelevant, being related only to use of marks having the prefix \u201cHeli\u201d outside the United States. Since the board was clearly correct as to (2), appellant\u2019s arguments regarding (1) are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-5\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we find no controlling error in any aspect of the decision below. Accordingly, it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1459-15\">.
