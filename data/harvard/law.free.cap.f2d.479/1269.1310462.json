The referee dismissed all seven specifications. The district court, however, sustained specification number two, vacated the referee\u2019s order, and denied discharge. Federal Supply contends that the court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>affirming dismissal of specifications one, four and seven, and Semel claims that the court erred in sustaining specification number two.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">We find no error in the court\u2019s ultimate disposition of this matter, and will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-5\">We do, however, wish to clarify the facts surrounding specification number two, which charges a violation of 18 U. S.C. \u00a7 152. Section 152 subjects to criminal liability anyone who \u201cknowingly and fraudulently makes a false oath of account in or in relation to any bankruptcy proceeding.\u201d The Bankruptcy Act provides that a discharge will be denied whenever the court determines that the petitioner has violated section 152. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 32(c)(1). In sustaining this specification, the district court observed that in a \u201cprior\u201d bankruptcy proceeding, Semel avoided bankruptcy by testifying that his assets included over $250,000 in accounts receivable, and that he was in possession of records and books indicating that there existed some possibility of collection. Yet, in the present voluntary bankruptcy proceeding, Semel admitted that he never kept records of accounts receivable, that any amounts owed to him could be ascertained only by reviewing individual files, and that virtually all of these debts were uncollectible. Thus, in the instant proceeding, Semel\u2019s schedule of assets listed nothing under \u201cdebts due petitioner on open account,\u201d and under \u201cunliquidated claims of every nature,\u201d reported \u201c[pjossible claims for professional services rendered, damages, possible fees on legal matters . . . costs and disbursements advanced for clients\u201d with an estimated value of $100.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-7\">During cross-examination, Semel admitted that he \u201cwas in error\u201d when he failed to list outstanding debts owed to him, and conceded that \u201cif somebody undertook to check out these people now, institute suits, prosecute them, that money would be recovered.\u201d Soon thereafter, upon order of the referee, Semel submitted a lengthy list of these debts. <em>See, </em>In re Semel, 427 F.2d 651, 654 (3d Cir. 1970). Thus, at the inception of the instant proceeding, Semel denied the existence of debts owed to him, whereas under cross-examination' \u2014 in the same proceeding \u2014 he admitted that monies were owed him, that certain of these might prove collectible and furnished a list of these debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-9\">We agree with the district court that \u201cSemel\u2019s palpable untruths cannot be overlooked,\u201d and recite the foregoing only to demonstrate that these untruths occurred in the present proceeding, and not a prior proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-10\">The order of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
