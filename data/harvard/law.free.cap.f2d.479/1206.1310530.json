We deny the motion for summary reversal and, <em>sua sponte, </em>summarily affirm the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-18\">On the basis of this record, we find that the hospital\u2019s evidence raised sufficient questions about appellant\u2019s mental stability and about the adequacy of its own investigation into his mental status to support the-trial judge\u2019s denial of Ecker\u2019s conditional release in February of 1973. This determination does not prejudice future recommendations for conditional release or attempts by the hospital to clarify the questions raised in this record, now five months old.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-20\">The facts of this case need be only briefly recited. In 1968, appellant Ecker was acquitted by reason of insanity, in an uncontested proceeding, of the rape-murder of a young Congressional secretary. He was committed to St. Eliza-beths with a diagnosis of severe soeio-pathic personality disturbance, sexual deviance (sadism) with organic features.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He spent a total of four years in maximum security in the John Howard Pavilion, and nineteen months in mini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>mum security prior to the hospital\u2019s request for his conditional release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">This request, dated January 4, 1973, encompassed the pursuit of an educational program at a technical institute in Virginia and visits to <em>his </em>parents\u2019 home at the discretion of the hospital. A hearing was held on January 30, 1973, in the District Court. Dr. George Saiger, appellant\u2019s ward psychiatrist since July of 1971, was the only witness. He testified at length as to appellant\u2019s case history and hospital record, and gave his evaluation of Ecker\u2019s current mental status. The Government did not oppose the hospital\u2019s request for release for schooling,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but did oppose the request for visits to Ecker\u2019s parental home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-5\">At the conclusion of the testimony and arguments, the District Judge found that Ecker was still suffering from mental illness; and that there were indications that many issues were still unresolved so that appellant, still in turmoil, could not control his impulses. Because of this uncertainty and instability, the judge denied the hospital\u2019s recommendation since, \u201cif released into the community, [Ecker] might be likely to injure himself or others.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1264-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-7\"> While the findings below are not a model of precision or completeness, we think the record offers a sufficient basis for the trial court\u2019s determination to withstand appellant\u2019s attack under the high standard set for motions for summary reversal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, we think that the interests of justice are best served by a <em>sua sponte </em>affirmance<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the trial court since a careful study of the record convinces us that such relief is clearly warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-16\">Without exploring and exposing the details of appellant\u2019s mental condition at greater length than necessary, we find that the testimony of Ecker\u2019s psychiatrist raises not only ambiguities, but real doubts about the sufficiency of the investigation of Ecker\u2019s condition, and the conclusions drawn therefrom that he was ready for a dramatic increase in both responsibility and unsupervised leave time from the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-17\">These doubts are raised by three aspects of Dr. Saiger\u2019s testimony. First, the extremely short period of time during which Ecker had been without medication.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, the apparent haste to subject him to psychological testing and the inner turmoil still reflected therein.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Third, Ecker\u2019s elopement from the hospital shortly after being told to assume a great deal of \u201cresponsibility\u201d for his own future.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>These factors all raise doubts about appellant\u2019s reliance on the \u201cdown-to-earth persuasiveness\u201d of Dr. Saiger\u2019s testimony. They point out at least the need for further observation and information. Furthermore, they call into question the hospital\u2019s conclusion that the likelihood of Ecker\u2019s being dangerous to others was reduced to such a degree in January so as to permit his extensive, although not unconditional, release. Doubts about the expert\u2019s conclusion were reflected in the trial judge\u2019s concern that it was still \u201clikely\u201d that Ecker might be dangerous if released into the community.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The consequent refusal to allow conditional release at that time, based as it was on the facts and uncertainties revealed by the hospital\u2019s evidence, was not without a substantial basis in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">Appellant challenges the validity of the trial judge\u2019s exercising such a broad power of review over the hospital\u2019s decision to release him. The thrust of this attack is that the differential handling of the release of civilly committed patients from those who, like Ecker, were civilly committed after a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity, deprives the latter of the equal protection of the laws. In Bolton v. Harris,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> this court upheld the release provisions of D.C.Code \u00a7 24-301 (e) which require court approval of the hospital\u2019s recommendation. We did not think \u201cequal protection is offended by allowing the Government or the court the opportunity to insure that the standards for the release of civilly committed patients are faithfully applied to [so-called \u201ccriminally\u201d committed] patients.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1265-13\">Appellant re-asserts the proposition that <em>any </em>differential treatment of the release of the two groups of patients violates equal protection. But he fails totally to assert any facts or reasons why the <em>Bolton </em>rationale should be abandoned.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At best, he argues that the trial court\u2019s function must be severely re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>stricted to the limited review of an essentially \u201cmedical\u201d judgment, along the lines of the standard set forth in Tribby v. Cameron.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That the issue of what standard of review should be applied to release decisions is a question of constitutional dimensions is beyond dispute. This court is continually called upon to test the validity of the substantive and procedural terms of commitment against the requirements of the Constitution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, it does seem relevant to examine more closely the statutory requirements of D.C.Code \u00a7 24-301 in light of current developments in the law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">However, this case does not provide the opportunity to do so. Even under the standard outlined in <em>Tribby, </em>that the court assess whether the hospital has made a \u201cpermissible and reasonable decision in view of the relevant information and within a broad range of discretion,\u201d the trial court\u2019s judgment must be sustained. In the record before us, we find to be crucial the lack of extremely relevant information concerning the termination of Ecker\u2019s medication. Not only is this important factor virtually brushed off by the psychiatric expert, but the period of time elapsed since the termination appears to us too short to provide any opportunity for adequate observation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We have noted previously the relevance of this type of medication to psychiatric evaluations of mental status <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and we find that the failure to deal with this issue undermines the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the hospital\u2019s decision. Similarly, we note that the recommendation for conditional release was based on only five months of liberalized privileges since Ecker\u2019s elopement. Such a time span raises further doubts about whether the hospital\u2019s decision was based on adequate relevant information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-12\">We have decided to take the somewhat unusual step of affirming the judgment in this case <em>sua sponte </em>for a variety of reasons. First, because we are convinced that the standard for summary disposition is met, on this record, by the Government. Second, we see no real prejudice to the rights of appellant in so doing. \u2022 The emergency nature of appellant\u2019s motion \u2014 to obtain release for schooling in February \u2014 has already been frustrated. Rather than simply deny summary reversal and allow the appeal to follow its normal course, it will better serve the interests of justice to terminate now what we would see to be a process which could not in the end provide the relief requested and might therefore only waste both the parties\u2019 and the court\u2019s resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-13\">Moreover, our affirmance should in no way be interpreted as foredooming future recommendations for conditional release. We respect St. Elizabeths\u2019 obvious efforts to secure a meaningful ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>ucational experience for this patient and we would urge that these efforts not cease. There is nothing finally determined by the denial of conditional release \u2014 particularly so in this case where the record raised questions and doubts which can, and may, be readily answered by the passage of time. Refusal by the court to allow release as of January in no way prejudices future attempts, and should not discourage the hospital from seeking release arrangements for its patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-4\">If we were not convinced of the good faith of the trial judge in considering the hospital\u2019s recommendations solely in light of the statutory standards for conditional release, we would be more deeply troubled by his reference at the hearing to the length of prison term to which Ecker might have been sentenced had he been convicted of murder. Ecker was not found to be legally responsible for his acts, he was not convicted, and he is not being punished. No considerations other than the terms of his release, his mental condition, and the possibility of dangerousness to himself or others should influence the decisions of either the hospital staff or the court. In this regard, we were appalled to read in the record that Dr. Saiger was instructed to contact the Senate Office in which Ecker\u2019s victim had worked prior to her death to find out if Ecker\u2019s release would \u201cbother\u201d anybody, a matter wholly irrelevant to the decision to be reached by those charged with responsibility in the matter.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> And we assert again that the theoretical limits of Ecker\u2019s theoretical imprisonment are of no relevance in determining whether he should be conditionally released from the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">The motion for summary reversal is denied, and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1263-21\">.

Tr. at pp. 18, 38. Ecker received heavy doses of tliorazine at the time of his admission, and had been receiving other unnamed medication until December of 1972.

In November of 1972, a psychological tester found continued turmoil in Ecker\u2019s unconscious fantasy life. Dr. Saiger explained this by adverting to the fact that the psychologists had asked him to delay the testing because Ecker had begun individual therapy, and because one expects unconscious turbulence in anyone in individual treatment. Dr. Saiger responded that it would not be possible to delay testing since \u201cthe notion of school in the spring\u201d was already being discussed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1264-20\">.

This ease illustrates, of course, all the difficulties and ambiguities in setting standards for a patient\u2019s <em>conditional </em>release from St. Elizabeths. Such standards have, unfortunately, received scant judicial attention. This is primarily due to the rapidity with which patients\u2019 circumstances can be, and are changed, and the consequent frustration of adequate judicial review. <em>See </em>Jackson v. Robinson, 155 U.S.App.D.C. 94, 476 F.2d 539 (Issued March 20, 1973). As we have construed the conditional release provision of D.C.Code \u00a7 24-301 (e), complete recovery from a mental illness is not required. Indeed, for some patients conditional release may be an important and essential part of \u201crecovery.\u201d To approve such release, \u201cthe court must conclude that the individual has recovered sufficiently so that under the proposed conditions . . . \u2018such person will not in the reasonable future be dangerous to himself or others.\u2019 \u201d Hough v. United States, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 192, 195, 271 F.2d 458, 461 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"AWd\">Whether this interpretation continues to be sound may be open to future examination. It is clear, however, that the nature of the conditions set for release play an important part in a determination of \u201csufficient\u201d recovery and lack of dangerousness. Since neither determination may be capable of absolute precision or certainty, the standards are elusive. It is important, therefore, that both the hospital and the trial court elucidate with specificity those factors which weigh heavily in their decisions. Only by such explication on the record can there develop standards for review of conditional release decisions more meaningful than merely the \u201cpersuasiveness\u201d of psychiatric testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1265-14\">. 130 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 395 F.2d 642 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1265-15\">. <em>Id. </em>at 11, 395 F.2d 652.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1265-16\">. \u201cEqual protection does not require that all persons be dealt with identically, but it does require that a distinction made have some relevance to the purpose for which the classification is made.\u201d Baxstrom v.

The point is that the issue of medication was passed over, and we are not convinced either of its irrelevance, or of the hospital\u2019s implicit conclusion that 4-6 weeks was a sufficient span of time to observe Belter\u2019s adjustment to the withdrawal of medication.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1266-17\">.
