BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1084-20\">The Secretary of Labor sought an injunction under \u00a7 17 of the Fair Labor Standards Act (29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 201 et seq.) to interdict continuing violation of the Act\u2019s minimum wage, overtime, and record keeping requirements<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by these multicorporate employers. The District Court found (i) that the Employers, taken together, constituted an \u201centerprise\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3(r) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Act, and (ii) that the enterprise was and is \u201cengaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3(s)(l)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>Act, and (iii) that three of the four named employers failed to qualify for the exemption to coverage under FLSA contained in \u00a7 13(a)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With these findings, and (iv) the finding that the goods sold \u2014 propane gas \u2014 had not lost its identity as goods which have moved in interstate commerce, the District Court ordered the payment of $19,442 in back wages to named employees of the three non-exempt employers and enjoined future violations of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">Accepting (i) above but challenging (ii), (iii) and (iv), all of which are essential to the District Court\u2019s decision, the Employers ask us to reverse. Finding the decision of the District Court to be without error we affirm.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">The Employers \u2014 Greene\u2019s Propane Gas Service, Inc., [the Thomaston store], Greene\u2019s Propane Gas Service, Inc., of Perry,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Greene\u2019s Propane Gas Service, Inc. of Macon, and Greene\u2019s Propane Gas Service, Inc. of Albany\u2014 are retailers of propane gas and related gas appliances in the state of Georgia. Harvey R. Greene is the majority shareholder in each of these four corporate employers, the defendants here. But the Greene complex does not stop with these employers. The four employer stores buy their propane gas from Greene\u2019s Transport Company, Inc. They lease the tank trucks with which they make deliveries from Greene\u2019s Equipment Company (a corporation) and store the gas delivered by Greene\u2019s Transport in tanks leased from Greene\u2019s storage companies (four other corporations). Gas originating in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi is shipped to Georgia by pipeline and is purchased by Greene\u2019s Transport Company at Pipeline Terminal Facilities in Milner and Albany, Georgia. Greene\u2019s Transport receives the gas at the terminal facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-16\">It is understandable that Employers do not challenge the holding below that they \u2014 together with the rest of the occupants of the veritable corporate cornucopia of legal entities which Mr. Greene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>controls <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 constitute an \u201centerprise\u201d. The main thrust of employers\u2019 non-coverage argument has nearly as little vitality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">Employers contend that \u201centerprise\u201d coverage, added to the FLSA in 1961 by amendment, depends on individual employees being \u201cengaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce\u201d. They assert that all the 1961 amendments \u2014 namely \u00a7 203(s) and its subdivisions \u2014 did was to extend coverage to all the employees of an enterprise some of whose employees were \u201cengaged in interstate commerce\u201d. Employers cite much of the legislative history in support of this proposition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">\n<em>What Requisite Interstate Involvement?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">Even if we faced this argument on a question of first impression we could not ignore the apparently plain language of \u00a7 203 (s) which states that \u201centerprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce\u201d includes \u201cemployees\u2019 handling, selling, or otherwise working on goods that <em>have been </em>moved in or <em>produced </em>for commerce by any person\u201d. (Emphasis added). The tense is in the past. There is no requirement of continuity in the present. If the legislative history were compelling \u2014 and it is not<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>- \u2014 we might still be forced to hold that what Congress has enacted, even though something different from what it thought it enacted, would still be applicable since the language of the statute is so plain.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But we face no such prospects, for our opinion in Schultz v. Kip\u2019s Big Boy, Inc., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 530, 533 is disposi-tive. There the Court held that \u201cthe legislation was designed to regulate enterprises dealing in articles <em>acquired intrastate </em>after travel in interstate commerce\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (emphasis in original) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>the Court said that given (as is true in this case) the stipulation of enterprise sales in excess of $1,000,000 \u201cthe only test is that \u2018goods amounting to $250,000 a year\u2019 must be purchased or received for resale and have moved across state lines <em>at sometime in the flow of commerce to the retailer, </em>2 U.S. Code Cong, and Admin.News, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., 1961, p. 1645\u201d.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original). We think that further discussion on this point is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-4\">\n<em>Which Gas?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">Having lost in its frontal assault against the holding that the employees were covered by FLSA Employers attempt a flanking maneuver by asserting that the goods in which they deal are not the goods which have traveled in interstate commerce. That is, they argue that the propane gas loses its out-of-state identity because it is dehydrated and filtered free of accumulated debris at the time it leaves the pipeline to go into storage tanks at the pipeline terminal. The transformation \u2014 if removing the dirt and water that entered the pipeline during transit were not enough- \u2014 is completed when a chemical odorizer called petrocapitane is \u2014 as required by law in the state of Georgia \u2014 inserted into the propane at the rate of one and one-half -pounds for every ten thousand gallons of liquid propane. This odorizer allows the consumer to detect a leak in his propane system which would otherwise go unnoticed because propane is odorless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-10\">The result is that the gas is in better condition and it can now be safely used by consumers at the burner tip, but it is still the gas that originated in the depths of Texas or Louisiana. Extraction of impurities, removal of water and odorization do not change the commodity, certainly not in a practical sense. The analogy with our holding in Placid Oil Co. v. F.P.C., 5 Cir., 1973, 483 F.2d 880 (1973) causes us to think that this \u201cnew\u201d gas, moleeularly indistinguishable from the \u201cold\u201d gas, must bear the financial burden of FLSA like an added atom in its carbon ring.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-11\">Further, even where out-of-state goods have been altered in form the courts have not hesitated to hold that the goods still retained their interstate identity for -purposes of Section 3(c).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In Schultz v. Kip\u2019s Big Boy, <em>supra, </em>this court citing <em>Melos, supra, </em>with approval specifically referred to its holding that it was immaterial that the out-of-state goods upon which coverage was based had been shipped in commerce \u201cin another form, i. e., raw stage\u201d.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Court in <em>Melos </em>predicated coverage on the local purchase of ready-mix concrete which was prepared by the supplier from cement acquired out of the state. The Second Circuit stated that \u201c[t]he interstate character of the cement as a product that \u2018has been moved\u2019 in interstate commerce is not destroyed by the fact that it is used to make a different product, ready-mix concrete, which is then purchased by <em>Melos.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>The argument is a nice try, but it doesn\u2019t work either molecularly or juridically. The gas is the gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">\n<em>Who An Establishment ?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">Having failed to exclude themselves from mclusion Employers, by a reverse twist, attempt to include themselves in an exclusion \u2014 \u00a7 13(a)(2).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This Section exempts from coverage those \u201cestablishments\u201d which though they are included in a covered enterprise, have an annual dollar volume of sales less than $250,000. That is, an establishment which is part of an enterprise will be exempt from coverage if that establishment does less than the quarter million dollars sales outflow figure, even though the remainder of the enterprise is covered under FLSA. Employers stipulated that the annual dollar volume of sales for each of the Thomaston, Albany, and Macon Corporations was in excess of $250,000. Nonetheless they claim the exemption on the basis that each of the separate route trucks operating from these stores is a separate establishment <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and that therefore the deliveries made by the route trucks operating out of each respective store cannot be counted in the three stores. On such a conclusion none of the three would have sales exceeding the statutory minimum requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">The position that the route-men are separate business establishments is untenable in the light of the facts produced at the trial.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It cannot be factually disputed that these trucks though they may be separate physical units, constitute pieces of single businesses of which they are a functional part. These trucks are simply selling agents of the store to which the route salesmen are attached. The majority of customers were billed regularly from the sales offices, which took care of ordering all supplies and equipment. In short the routemen were simply delivery agents for the store\u2019s sales and service office which together with its delivery routes constituted the establishment. As we have said before in Wirtz v. Keystone Readers Service, Inc., 5 Cir., 1969, 418 F.2d 249, 255 and now reiterate salesmen do not themselves qualify, either individually or collectively, as an \u201cestablishment\u201d within the meaning of the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-10\">The Trial Court\u2019s decision comported with the canonical rule that exemptions from FLSA are to be given a niggardly construction against the employer. Mitchell v. Kentucky Finance Co., 1959, 359 U.S. 290, 295, 79 S.Ct. 756, 759, 3 L.Ed.2d 815, 819; Brennan v. Great American Discount and Credit Co., Inc., 5 Cir., 1973, 477 F.2d 292; Schultz v. Instant Handling, Inc., 5 Cir., 1969, 418 F.2d 1019. While it is true we are a peripatetic undulating people, constantly on the go, driven on the wheels or wings of energy consuming power units, we are not ready to endorse a contrary holding which might make every delivery driver, milkman, and other outside salesmen an exempt establishment on wheels under \u00a7 13(a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1084-10\">.

Wilson Building, Inc., 5 Cir., 1973, 478 F.2d 1090 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-10\">The Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966 (80 Stat. 830, 831) further extended the Act\u2019s \u201centerprise coverage\u201d by reducing the dollar volume requirement and deleting the $250,000 \u201cinflow\u201d test of \u00a7 3(s) (1). These amendments do not affect the coverage issue involved here, since the Secretary is claiming the higher wage and stricter overtime standards prescribed in \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 7 for employees brought under the Act by the 1961 Amendments, and has proved his ease under.those standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1085-11\">.

The Employers claim the exception under \u00a7 13 (a) (1) only for their routemen but claimed the exemption under \u00a7 13(a) (2) for all their employees. Greene\u2019s Propane Gas Service, Inc. of Perry came within the exception under \u00a7 13(a) (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1085-19\">. The Secretary filed a cross appeal alleging that the District Court erred in finding that Appellant\u2019s routemen were \u201coutside salesmen\u201d. The Secretary has abandoned that appeal. For this case it means that he now acquiesces in the District Court\u2019s ruling on that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1085-20\">. See note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1086-7\">. Whatever the legislative history may show, the history of this legislation makes it apparent that Congress, after enactment, thought that it had legislated broadly enough to cover facts like these. In the Senate Report on the 1966 Amendments, Senate Report No. 1487, 89th Congress (1966) as reported in U.S.Code Cong, and Admin.News 1966, p. 3009, it was pointed out that \u201calso, the operations through substantial ownership or control of a number of firms engaged in similar types of business activities constitute, in the committee\u2019s view, related activities performed through unified operation or common control within the meaning of the definition of enterprise. The fact that the firms are independently incorporated or physically separate or under the immediate direction of local management, as in Wirtz v. Hardin, 16 Wage Hour Cases 722 (N.D.Ala.) [253 F.Supp. 579 (N.D.Ala.1964) ] is not determinative of this question.\u201d And see Shultz v.
