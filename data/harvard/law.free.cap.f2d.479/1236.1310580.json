The apartments are quasi-public, having been constructed and now being operated by defendant, Joseph Paul Apartments, Inc., under Section 221(d)(3) of the National Housing Act. The district court held that the^ plaintiff could properly be evicted since her tenancy had expired under the terms of the lease, and that no other cause need be assigned for the eviction. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-24\">The plaintiff, Thelma Joy, is the head of her household and with her four minor children constitutes a \u201cfamily\u201d within the statutory scheme. Her effective monthly income <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of $222.20 is a \u201clow income\u201d for purposes of the federal housing programs, and she thus qualifies for occupancy in the Joseph Paul Apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>ments. On September 2, 1970, plaintiff leased one of defendant\u2019s apartments. The standard form lease provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-4\">At the end of one year, lease is automatically renewed from month to month, rent to be payable in advance without demand on first day of each month. Either party may terminate lease at end of term or any successive term by giving 30 days\u2019 notice in advance to other party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">On September 11, 1971, the defendant gave plaintiff 30 days\u2019 notice to vacate, no cause being assigned.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It appears that the plaintiff has continued to occupy her apartment on a month-to-month basis, with her tenancy dependent on the outcome of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-6\">Section 221(d)(3) of the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 17151(d)(3) (1971), is a statutory scheme for encouraging housing for low income families. To participate in this program, defendant was required to conform to a regulatory agreement with the Federal Housing Administration governing, inter alia, the construction, occupancy, and daily operations of the project. The FHA also grants defendant rent supplements for the plaintiff and other tenants under Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701s(b) (1971). Plaintiff, for example, enjoys occupancy of an apartment worth $157.00 per month at a cost to her of $48.00. FHA pays the difference, <em>i.e., </em>$109.00 per month, directly to defendant. As a prerequisite to participation in the rent supplement program, there must be local government approval. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.15(c) (1971). The County Council specifically approved rent supplements for Joseph Paul Apartments on August 6, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-12\"> Initially we must determine if the fourteenth amendment is applicable, <em>i.e., </em>whether the action of defendant in seeking to evict plaintiff can be said to be \u201cstate action\u201d since it is well settled the fourteenth amendment does not inhibit the conduct of purely private persons in their ordinary activities. Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co., 398 U.S. 144, 169, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970). The Supreme Court has never attempted to fashion a precise formula of what constitutes \u201cstate action\u201d and the question frequently is difficult to determine. Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 172, 92 S.Ct. 1965, 32 L.Ed.2d 627 (1972); Burton v. Wilmington Parking Auth., 365 U.S. 715, 722, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961). \u201cState action\u201d may result from administrative, regulatory, legislative, and judicial action. <em>Moose Lodge No. 107, </em>407 U.S. at 179, 92 S.Ct. 1965. The determination must be made on a case-by-ease basis. \u201cOnly by sifting facts and weighing circumstances can the nonobvious involvement of the State in private conduct be attributed its true significance.\u201d <em>Burton, </em>365 U.S. at 722, 81 S. Ct. at 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-13\">In the present case the defendant receives mortgage benefits from the FHA and is thus subject to the attendant FHA regulations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, the defendant has undertaken to utilize the eviction procedures authorized by South Carolina.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While these fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>tors, either separately or combined, have been held insufficient to constitute \u201cstate action\u201d they are relevant and material in the assessment of other evidence of state involvement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">The defendant receives rent supplements from the FHA. Prerequisite to obtaining these supplements, the defendant received specific authorization from the County Council. We view this involvement of the state (power delegated to local government) in this case as similar to the zoning power which, with state eviction proceedings, resulted in a holding of \u201cstate action\u201d in Lavoie v. Bigwood, 457 F.2d 7 (1st Cir. 1972).<footnotemark>5a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-6\">The participation of the federal government in such housing projects is conditioned upon state approval. The state is thus involved for there would otherwise be no federal direct funding through rent subsidies and indirect funding through mortgage benefits. We think that these factors coupled with utilization of state eviction procedure have \u201cso far insinuated [the state] into a position of interdependence\u201d with the defendant that the challenged activity \u201ccannot be considered to have been so \u2018purely private\u2019 as to fall without the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Burton, </em>365 U.S. at 725, 81 S.Ct. at 862. <em>See </em>McQueen v. Druker, 438 F.2d 781, 784 (1st Cir. 1971). Accordingly, we hold there is sufficient state involvement to constitute \u201cstate action\u201d for pui\u2019poses of the fourteenth amendment. We also hold that the facts are sufficient to satisfy the \u201cunder color of\u201d law clause of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Adickes, </em>398 U.S. at 161-172, 90 S.Ct. 1598; <em>Lavoie, </em>457 F.2d at 15; McQueen v. Druker, 317 F.Supp. 1122, 1133 (D.Mass.) (Wyzanski, C. J.), aff\u2019d in part, 438 F. 2d 781 (1st Cir. 1971). Accordingly, the district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1295-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-13\">The district court concluded that plaintiff had no right of occupancy upon expiration of the term of the lease. Plaintiff contends that despite expiration of the term she may be evicted only for \u201cgood cause\u201d and is entitled to the protection of procedural due process in the determination of whether cause exists. Since procedural due process applies only to the deprivation of interest protected by the fourteenth amendment, <em>i.e., </em>liberty and property, we must first determine plaintiff\u2019s substantive rights. <em>See </em>Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 569, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972); <em>McQueen, </em>317 F.Supp. at 1128.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-14\">As stated in Board of Regents v.# Roth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-15\">Certain attributes of \u2018property\u2019 interests protected by procedural due process emerge from [the Court\u2019s] decisions. To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it. It is a purpose of the ancient institution of property to protect those claims upon which people rely in their daily lives, reliance that must not be arbitrarily undermined. It is a purpose of the constitutional right to a hearing to provide an opportunity for a person to vindicate those claims. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>Property interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law \u2014rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. at 2709.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-5\">A person\u2019s interest in a benefit is a \u2018property\u2019 interest for due process purposes if there are such rules or mutually explicit understandings that support his claim of entitlement to the benefit and that he may invoke at a hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1296-6\">Perry v. Sinderman, 408 U.S. 593, 601, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 2699, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972). Thus we must now look to applicable statutes, governmental regulations, and the custom and understandings of public landlords in the operation of their apartments to determine if a public tenant has a \u201cproperty interest\u201d in a tenancy beyond the term of the lease except for cause.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1296-12\">When Congress legislated with regard to mortgage insurance benefits which defendant receives, it provided: \u201cThe Congress affirms the national goal, as set forth in section 1441 of Title 42, of \u2018a decent home and suitable living environment for every American family\u2019.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701t. This policy of improving the \u201cliving environment of urban areas\u201d was also the policy of Congress in enacting the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965. Pub.L. 89-117, 79 Stat. 451 (Aug. 10, 1965). \u201cThis [policy] includes adequate, safe, and sanitary quarters. But it also implies an atmosphere of stability, security, neighborliness, and social justice.\u201d <em>McQueen, </em>317 F.Supp. at 1130. <em>Cf., </em>Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, 93 S.Ct. 364, 34 L.Ed. 2d 415 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-13\">In addition to the policy statements contained in the relevant funding statutes, Congress has also expressed itself in part on how these programs should be run. \u201cNo person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d. The policy of this statute, a person\u2019s right to be free of invidious discrimination in federally assisted programs, is contained in many statutes, <em>see, e.g., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000a.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-4\">This legislative establishment of policy carries significance beyond the particular scope of each of the statutes involved. The policy thus established has become itself a part of our law, to be given its appropriate weight not only in matters of statutory construction but also in those of decisional law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., 398 U.S. 375, 390-391, 90 S.Ct. 1772, 1782, 26 L.Ed.2d 339 (1970).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">Not only the statutes, but also FHA regulations authorized under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701s(f), imply a right to be free from arbitrary and discriminatory action. For example, 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 221.-536 (1971) provides that a landlord in a \u00a7 221(d)(3) apartment may not discriminate against any family because of children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">The House Report dealing with the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 said, with regard to the rent supplement program:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-8\">If his income increases sufficiently so that he can pay the full economic rent with 25% of his income, rent supplement payments on his behalf would cease to be made. The tenant could, however, continue to live in the project and would not be required to pay more than the full economic rent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1297-9\">H.R. Rep. No. 365, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965), 1965 U.S.Code Cong, and Ad. News, pp. 2614, 2618. This suggests the Congress was contemplating more occupancy entitlement than limited leasehold terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-14\">The tenant\u2019s expectation of some degree of permananey, seemingly shared by the Congress, if not by the landlord, is bolstered by \u201ccustom.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Just\\ as there may be a \u201ccommon law\u201d of tenure at a college or university, there may be a common law of tenancy in public housing projects. <em>See Perry, </em>408 U.S. at 602, 92 S.Ct. 2694.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-15\">The actual workings of the subsidized housing program must be examined to determine whether there is a reasonable basis for tenants to expect that in normal circumstances they will be permitted to remain in the housing indefinitely. And indeed one finds that the normal practice in subsidized housing, as in private housing, is to permit tenants to remain beyond the expiration of a lease unless a reason has arisen for eviction; termination is the exception, not the rule. Thus, tenants do have a reasonable expectation deserving of protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1297-16\">Note, Procedural Due Process in Government-Subsidized Housing, 86 Harv.L.Rev. 880, 905 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-17\">In view of. the congressional policies of providing a decent home (with stability and security) for every American family, and of prohibiting arbitrary and discriminatory action, bolstered by the FHA regulations and custom, we find in the scheme of the National Housing Act and the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 a property right or entitlement to continue occupancy until there exists a cause to evict other than the mere expiration of the lease. We therefore hold that the lease provision purporting to give the landlord power to terminate without cause at the expiration of a fixed term is invalid. <em>Accord, </em>Rudder v. United States, 226 F.2d 51, 96 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>U.S.App.D.C. 329 (1955); Brown v. Housing Auth., 340 F.Supp. 114 (E.D.Wisc.1972); <em>McQueen, </em>317 F.Supp. at 1131.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">In Caulder v. Durham Housing Auth., 433 F.2d 998 (4th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 1003, 91 S.Ct. 1228, 28 L.Ed.2d 539 (1971), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-5\">The \u201cprivilege\u201d or the \u201cright\u201d to occupy publicly subsidized low-rent housing seems to us to be no less entitled to due process protection than entitlement to welfare benefits which were the subject of decision in <em>Goldberg </em>or the other right and privileges referred to in <em>Goldberg.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1298-6\">433 F.2d at 1003. The court then held tenants entitled to notice, confrontation of witnesses, counsel, and a decision by an impartial decision maker based on evidence adduced at a hearing. 433 F.2d 1004. As stated by the court below, it could be inferred that the plaintiff here was to be evicted for cause. If so, she would be entitled to the same procedural safeguards set forth in <em>Caulder. </em>To allow a quasi public landlord to evict upon expiration of a fixed term is to enable secret and silent discrimination and would wholly emasculate the procedural safeguards of <em>Caulder. See </em>Robinson v. Diamond Housing Corp., 150 U.S.App. D.C. 17, 463 F.2d 853, 860 (1972). <em>Cf. </em>Ohio Bell Tel. Co. v. Public Util. Comm\u2019n, 301 U.S. 292, 302, 57 S.Ct. 724, 81 L.Ed. 1093 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-7\">Indeed, the entitlement of plaintiff to continue occupancy of public housing, like the interest of a covered employee under the Social Security Act, is, we think, \u201cof sufficient substance to fall within the protection from arbitrary governmental action afforded by the Due Process Clause.\u201d Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S. 603, 611, 80 S.Ct. 1367, 1373, 4 L.Ed.2d 1435 (1960).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A position beyond that espoused in <em>Flemming </em>has been urged.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1298-12\">But that under appropriate circumstances one\u2019s interest in his government job, his publicly financed home, his food stamp meals, or his state university educational opportunities may indeed be constitutional rights in the positive-law sense ought no longer be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1298-13\">Van Alstyne, The Demise of the Right-Privilege Distinction in Constitutional Law, 81 Harv.L.Rev. 1439, 1463-64 (1968). However, in view of our holding that the congressional scheme and custom give plaintiff a right to remain in her apartment we need not decide whether her claim is also protected by equal protection<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and \u201csubstantive\u201d due process.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-15\">Finally we must determine what procedural due process requires by way of protection of plaintiff\u2019s right to tenancy except for cause. In Johnson v. Tamsberg, 430 F.2d 1125 (4th Cir. 1970), we noted that the South Carolina eviction scheme requires the landlord to prove in court his allegations, allows trial by jury, and we concluded that \u201cpublic housing tenants are not actually ejected until basic due process requisites are satisfied.\u201d 430 F.2d at 1127.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>That is enough. A prior administrative hearing is not required so long as the tenant may at some stage receive a plenary judicial hearing. 430 F.2d 1127. Since we now hold that a Section 221(d)(3) landlord must before eviction give his tenant a good-cause notice and prove such cause exists, and since the South Carolina eviction procedure is constitutionally adequate, we perceive no reason for retention of jurisdiction in the federal court to consider the question of good cause for eviction. Landlord-tenant law is traditionally the province of the states. State judges are bound as are we by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. U.S.Const, art. VI; Glover v. Housing Auth., 444 F.2d 158, 161-62n.4 (5th Cir. 1971); <em>McQueen, </em>317 F.Supp. at 1131.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-4\">On remand the district court will enter its decree invalidating the lease expiration clause and enjoining the defendant from attempting to evict the plaintiff except for cause under the procedural and substantive law of South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1293-25\">.

The principal benefit is a lower rate of interest than available commercially. The court in McGuane v.

It has been aptly noted that \u2018[s]ociety today is built around entitlement. The automobile dealer has his franchise, the doctor and lawyer their professional licenses, the worker his union membership, contract, and pension rights, the executive his contract and stock options; all are devices to aid security and independence. Many of the most important of these entitlements now flow from government: subsidies to farmers and businessmen, routes for airlines and channels for television stations ; long term contracts for defense, space, and education; social security pensions for individuals. Such sources of security, whether private or public, are no longer regarded as luxuries or gratuities; to the recipients they are essentials, fully deserved, and in no sense a form of charity.
