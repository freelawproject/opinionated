Brown, D. C. Cir., 470 F.2d 285, we vacated a judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Walter Bruchhausen, <em>Judge, </em>sentencing Wesley Clyde Brown to a term of two and one-half years imprisonment upon his plea of guilty to a one-count indictment charging him with refusal to report for induction in violation of 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 462(a). The case was remanded for re-sentencing by another judge. We held that the refusal of the sentencing judge to make the presentence report available to Brown, pursuant to a uniform policy the judge had followed, constituted a failure to exercise his discretion under Rule 32(c)(2), F.R.Cr.P., which we found requires the discretion to be \u201cexercised on a case-by-case basis, not by a blanket policy of non-disclosure.\u201d 470 F.2d at 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-17\">Upon remand the case was assigned by lot to Judge Travia, who made the presentence report available to Brown and his counsel before sentencing and, after holding a sentencing hearing, re-sentenced Brown to the same term that had previously been imposed. From this second sentence Brown, who has been incarcerated since January 27, 1972, appeals. He contends that Judge Travia, upon the resentencing, committed various errors which necessitate still anoth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>er resentencing. We cannot agree and must affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">Since the background of the case up to the point of our remand is set forth in our earlier opinion, we need not repeat it here. Upon this appeal Brown urges that Judge Travia erred in (1) failing' to give any legally justifiable reasons for reimposing the same sentence, (2) failing to identify the facts in the presentence report relied on by him, (3) basing the sentence on Brown\u2019s political beliefs and on erroneous information in the presentence report, (4) failing to \u201credo\u201d the entire sentencing process, and (5) abusing his sentencing discretion in reimposing the two and one-half year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">To the extent that Brown asks us to review on the ground that the sentence was excessive, we must decline the invitation. We are still bound by the basic principle against appellate review of sentences except in extraordinary circumstances. United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 447, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972); Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386, 393, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1958); Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 305, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). Although cracks in the wall are beginning to develop, see Woosley v. United States, 478 F.2d 139 (8th Cir. 1973) (en banc) (5-year sentence imposed pursuant to a rigid policy upon a Jehovah\u2019s Witness for refusing induction vacated on ground that district court had \u201cmanifestly or grossly abused its discretion\u201d and \u201c[t]he severity of the sentence shocks the judicial conscience\u201d), the present case is not an appropriate one for departure from the policy against appellate review. Here the sentence was one-half of the permissible five-year statutory limit. In characterizing the two and one-half year sentence imposed on Brown as \u201charsh\u201d in our earlier opinion \u2014a view from which we do not retreat \u2014we were referring to that fact as an additional reason for requiring the sentencing judge to exercise his discretion on an individual basis in this case. That discretion has now been exercised in favor of full disclosure of the presentence report with respect to Brown, and Judge Travia, in imposing sentence, has acted within the discretionary limits afforded to the district_jmurt, which are broad. United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443, 447, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972); United States v. Sweig, 454 F.2d 181, 183-184 (2d Cir. 1972); McGee v. United States, 462 F.2d 243, 245 (2d Cir. 1972), Absent the sentencing judge\u2019s reliance on constitutionally impermissible factors or upon material inaccuracies, it is not our function to review a sentence falling within statutory limits. United States v. Mitchell, 392 F.2d 214 (2d Cir. 1968); Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 305, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932); United States v. Holder, 412 F.2d 212, 214 (2d Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-8\">Brown\u2019s contention that the district court erred by failing to state the reasons for reimposing the same sentence and by failing to designate the portions of the presentence report relied upon by it must also be rejected. Were we writing on a clean slate, we might well be persuaded in favor of a requirement that the sentencing judge state his reasons. Such a rule would be \u201ca powerful safeguard against rash and arbitrary decisions\u201d at this crucial stage of the criminal process where the defendant\u2019s liberty is at stake. M. Frankel, Criminal Sentences \u2014 Law Without Order 41 (Hill and Wang 1972). It would serve \u201cto promote thought by the decider, to compel him to cover the relevant points, to help him eschew irrelevancies \u2014and, finally, to make him show that these necessities have been served.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40. It would also promote fairness by minimizing the risk that the sentencing judge might rely on misinformation or on inaccuracies in the presentence report. See United States v. Needles, 472 F.2d 652 (2d Cir. 1973). If a misapprehension on the court\u2019s part were disclosed, the defendant and his counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>would then have the opportunity to answer and explain, pointing out the error. A Sphinx-like silence on the court\u2019s part precludes anyone (including the parties, the judge, and an appellate tribunal) from learning whether he acted in error. Furthermore, a statement of reasons by the court could prove to be of considerable assistance to prison and parole au-thoritites in later determining the type of institution in which the defendant should be incarcerated and the time and conditions of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">In the present ease it would have been of considerable assistance to have had the rationale of the conscientious sentencing judge, since the information found in the presentence report and accompanying documents, all of which we have examined, is for the most part favorable to Brown. He has no known criminal record, has frankly admitted his offense, and has based his refusal to report for induction on moral grounds. The report describes him as a person who has had a better than average background and education. He has enjoyed the support of his parents and siblings, an average scholastic rating, and a good behavior record in school. He is not addicted to narcotics and, prior to his incarceration, he was reasonably self-supporting. An impressive array of letters have been sent to the court by persons offering Brown employment, and by clergymen, teachers and other members of the community, which emphasize his sincerity and talents. With respect to Brown\u2019s attitude and refusal to serve in the war effort the presentence report states that he has \u201cdeep personal convictions\u201d and that while he is not a member of the Black Panther Party his refusal to serve is based on \u201cbeliefs as set forth in the Black Panther Party tenets from which he quotes extensively.\u201d In the face of this profile the reasoning behind the court\u2019s two and one-half year prison sentence is difficult to grasp.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">Although a sentencing judge should in our view be encouraged to state his reasons and such a statement would have been welcomed here, we have repeatedly held that in view of the trial judge\u2019s very broad discretion, see decisions cited page 1172, <em>swpra, </em>\u201che is generally under no obligation to give reasons for his sentencing decisions,\u201d McGee v. United States, 462 F.2d 243, 247 (2d Cir. 1972). Clarification has been required only under circumstances not found here, e. g., where a sentence was imposed upon the basis of (1) misinformation of constitutional magnitude; such as an inaccurate criminal record, Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S. 736, 741, 68 S.Ct. 1252, 92 L.Ed. 1690 (1948), (2) a record comprising prior unconstitutional convictions, e. g., United States <em>v. </em>Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972), (3) the effect of a simultaneous sentence and conviction upon a more serious count of the indictment, which was later invalidated, McGee v. United States, 462 F.2d 243 (2d Cir. 1972), or (4) failure of the court to receive and consider mitigating circumstances, United States v. Malcolm, 432 F.2d 809, 818 (2d Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-8\">With one possible exception, discussed below, we here fail to find evidence of any materially false assumptions on the part of the sentencing judge or reliance by him on material inaccuracies or on constitutionally impermissible factors. After Brown and his counsel had been afforded the opportunity to read, review and discuss the presentence report, Judge Travia convened court, made a record of Brown\u2019s motion papers and of the numerous letters with respect to Brown that had been received and read by the court and by the Probation Office. Brown\u2019s counsel then directed the court\u2019s attention to several inaccuracies in the presentence report, which were reviewed in detail by Judge Travia, who indicated either, that they were immaterial or that he would not give them weight. For instance, the judge stated that as far as he was concerned Brown was not considered to be a member of the Black Panther Party. None of the alleged errors in the report, which we have reviewed, are of sufficient impor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>tance to be of constitutional significance. Accordingly we must reject Brown\u2019s contentions that his sentence be vacated because of the sentencing judge\u2019s failure to state his reasons or because of inaccuracies in the presen-tence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">There remains the question whether Judge Travia, although he did not state his reasons, relied upon a constitutionally impermissible factor, i. e., Brown\u2019s expressed sympathy with the political and <em>social </em>views of the Black Panther Party. In a letter to his Local Board dated March 5, 1969, quoted in the presentence report, Brown stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-5\">\u201cPoint six of the Black Panther Party platform and program states: 'We want all Black men exempt from military service. We believe that Black people should not be forced to fight in the military service to defend a racist government that does not protect us. We will not fight and kill other people of color in the world who, like black people are being victimized by the white racist government of America. We will protect ourselves from the force and violence of the racist police and the racist military, by whatever means necessary.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-7\">\u201cThis is the position I adhere to. Therefore, since the government grants no rights, I owe it no duties. And if you can't relate to that, you can [obscenity].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1230-8\">After reading in open court the foregoing portion of Brown\u2019s letter, the court made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"axy-dedup-0\">\u201cThe Court: He should also take the responsibility for saying those words. That brings us to the quote of Voltaire. And I don\u2019t have to quote from there.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1230-15\">Thereupon Judge Travia, after complimenting appellant\u2019s counsel upon his efforts in the .matter and stating that he had thoroughly reviewed all sentencing data and given the matter a great deal of thought, advised \u201cI cannot change the judgment of the Court as previously set forth\u201d and reimposed the two and one-half year .sentence, subject to the condition that Brown might, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a)(2), become eligible for parole at such time as the Board of Parole might determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-16\">Seizing upon the above-quoted remarks of the district court, Brown contends that the district judge improperly based the sentence upon his distaste for Brown\u2019s political and moral beliefs. We disagree. Although Judge Travia\u2019s statement that Brown must \u201ctake responsibility for saying those words\u201d is not entirely free from doubt, we are satisfied from the sentencing minutes, considered as a whole, that he did not base the sentence on his revulsion arising out of Brown\u2019s social or political views, which would be improper. United States v. Mitchell, 392 F.2d 214, 217 (2d Cir. 1968) (concurring opinion of Judge Kaufman); cf. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969). Read in context, the court\u2019s remarks were apparently directed toward Brown\u2019s statement that he would protect himself from what he considered force and violence by the police or military \u201cby whatever means necessary.\u201d Although Brown\u2019s counsel stated that these words did not amount to a \u201ccall to violence on his part,\u201d the remark, when considered with Brown\u2019s statement to the Probation Officer that \u201chis obedience to the laws of the land is limited, if these laws conflict with certain of his personal beliefs,\u201d could properly have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>raised a serious question in the sentencing judge\u2019s mind as to whether Brown posed a threat of violent or anti-social conduct to the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">The record reveals that Judge Travia, before imposing sentence, carefully and conscientiously considered all relevant information that was available to him, including the recommendation of the two members (in addition to Judge Bruch-hausen) of the earlier sentencing panel,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who had recommended sentences of two years and four years, respectively, and of the Probation Office, which had recommended three years. Since Judge Travia was imposing the same sentence as that previously imposed by Judge Bruchhausen, a statement of reasons would have removed any lingering doubt that he had acted arbitrarily or according to a rigid, discretionless formula. However, under the circumstances we cannot say that the sentence was not reasonably related to a legitimate sentencing purpose. Assuming that Judge Travia\u2019s duty was \u201cto redo the entire sentencing process,\u201d McGee v. United States, supra, 462 F.2d 243, 247 n. 8, that obligation was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1230-10\">. The reference to the \u201cquote of Voltaire\u201d is puzzling. Assuming that the judge was alluding to the famous remark \u201cI disapprove of what you say but will defend to the death your right to say it,\u201d S. G. Tallentyre: The Friends of Voltaire, the reference appears inconsistent with the idea that Brown must \u201ctake responsibility\u201d for his words by risking jail. Possibly the court was referring to another quote from Voltaire: \u201cMen use thought only as authority for their injustice, and employ speech only to conceal their thoughts,\u201d Dialogue 14, Le Chap\u00f3n et la Poulard (1763).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1231-10\">. <em>See </em>generally, Zavatt, Sentencing Procedure in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, 41 F.R.D. 469 (1966), 54 F.R.D. 327 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1231-7\">FEINBERG, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ATzy\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-8\">In March 1969, Wesley Clyde Brown, a young black man, delivered himself of some bitter comments on American society. To this judge, sitting in his quiet chambers, Brown\u2019s words may seem extreme and unwarranted; to some, they may be most offensive. But to none, I submit, should Brown\u2019s strictures justify a two and one-half year jail sentence. Because that is apparently what occurred here, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-9\">It is essential to put the sentence in this case into perspective. Brown, a teacher and writer, was not yet 24 years old when he wrote the 1969 letter to his draft board, expressing sympathy with point six of the Black Panther Party platform, quoted in the majority opinion. When Brown reappeared in the district court in December 1972 after our remand, he had no criminal record other than his conviction in this case. Up to that time, apparently, he had never engaged in an act of violence, nor had he even been in any serious trouble. Brown came from a good home and had a fine behavior record in school. He frankly admitted his offense, and no one questions that his refusal to report for induction was based on moral grounds. As the majority opinion points out, \u201cthe information ... in the presen-tence report and accompanying documents ... is for the most part favorable to Brown.\u201d The judge on resen-tencing also had before him \u201c[a]n impressive array of letters which emphasize [Brown\u2019s] sincerity and talents.\u201d There was not the faintest suggestion from anyone or in any document or report \u2014 other than the letter already referred to \u2014 that Brown posed a threat of violence to anyone. The majority picks up a statement by Brown to the Probation Officer, whose report of it is quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the pre-sentence report indicates, the context of this remark is that Brown would not serve in the armed forces if '\u201chis conscience would not permit him to .\u201d This, of course, is why he was being sentenced in the first place, after pleading guilty to failure to report for induction. Any graver implication is unwarranted. Moreover, Brown\u2019s conduct, his actual mode of life from March 1969 to January 27, 1972, when he was incarcerated, gave no basis for a belief that he was a threat to society. It is painfully obvious \u2014 at least to me\u2014 that the judge referred to Brown\u2019s political and social views, as expressed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>letter, when he said that Brown must \u201ctake responsibility for saying those words.\u201d The majority agrees that a sentence based on \u201crevulsion arising out of Brown\u2019s social or political views . would be improper.\u201d But apparently that is what happened, and the sentence therefore should not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">If there is any doubt about the matter, the judge should at least be required to state his reasons for imposing the same two and one-half year sentence that Brown received before. Such a statement, as the majority points out, would \u201chave removed any lingering doubt\u201d that the judge had acted improperly. Moreover, our own prior decision in McGee v. United States, 462 F.2d 243, 247 (1972), furnishes ample precedent for requiring clarification in this case See also United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443, 447-449, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972); Townsend v. Burke, 334 U. S. 736, 741, 68 S.Ct. 1252, 92 L.Ed. 1690 (1948); United States v. Malcolm, 432 F.2d 809, 819 (2d Cir. 1970). The majority cites these cases but confines them to their own facts; such a narrow construction is unjustified. <em>McGee </em>stands for the proposition \u2014 which the other decisions implicitly support \u2014 that under some circumstances a sentencing judge may be required to give reasons for his sentence, although this is not ordinarily done. This case is clearly an appropriate instance, since the record certainly suggests that a sentence that we all agree was harsh was imposed for a constitutionally impermissible reason. In a case \u201cnot entirely free from doubt,\u201d as the majority puts it, this court should not strain to avoid a strong inference of invalidity; if there was a proper reason for the sentence, the judge should state it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-5\">Accordingly, I would remand for re-sentencing. Alternatively, at the very least, we should require the judge to give \u201ca summary explanation of his reasons\u201d for the sentence. See McGee v. United States, <em>supra, </em>462 F.2d at 247.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1231-13\">.
