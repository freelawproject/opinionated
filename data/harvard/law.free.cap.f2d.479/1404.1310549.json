The sole independent claim is claim 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-24\">1. A papermakers felt comprising a tightly woven multi-layer fabric in which first crosswise yarns are reinforced by twisting in combination with second crosswise yarns having superior tensile and compressive strength and in which means for securing the crosswise and lengthwise yarns against relative movement is provided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1460-25\">Claim 3 says the \u201cmeans\u201d is the tightness of the weave. Claim 4 specifies the \u201cmeans\u201d as bonding at the intersections of crosswise and lengthwise yarns. Claim 5 limits the lengthwise yarns to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1405\">*1405</page-number>nylon and the crosswise yarns to asbestos twisted about monel wire and limits the fabric to two layers. Claims 6 and 7 call for bonding with cured re-sorcinol-formaldehyde resin and cured urethane resin, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-4\">\n<em>The Rejection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-5\">Claims 1 and 3 were rejected as obvious in view of Barrell 2,098,993, disclosing a two-ply woven papermaker\u2019s felt with crosswise yarns of twisted asbestos and cotton or asbestos with cotton braided thereon, and Hall 2,506,667, disclosing a twisted asbestos and nylon yarn for papermaker\u2019s felts. Wagner 3,248,802, disclosing chemical bonding at yarn intersections in a papermaker\u2019s belt, was' added in rejecting claims 4, 6 and 7. Bacheldor 1,811,573, disclosing a filter fabric having a yarn formed by twisting abestos about a wire, was added to Barrell and Hall in the rejection of claim 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-14\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-15\">Appellant argues that his contribution lies in \u201cdisplacing\u201d the crosswise yarns \u201cfrom the neutral axis\u201d which creates \u201ca base beam construction\u201d or a \u201ctruss like structure.\u201d Appellant\u2019s difficulty is that the <em>claims </em>don\u2019t say so, directly or indirectly. Appellant\u2019s reply brief says the \u201cmulti-layer fabric\u201d of the claims is understood in the art to mean a single fabric whereas Barrell discloses two fabrics fastened together. The record, however, contains no evidence of such understanding in the art. Barren\u2019s plies are joined by a warp strand and his felt is described as \u201cwoven\u201d in two plies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-16\">Appellant also argues that the prior art does not show \u201ctightly\u201d woven fabrics, yarns of \u201csuperior * * * compressive strength,\u201d or \u201csecuring\u201d by \u201ctightness of the weave.\u201d We agree with the examiner and the board that \u201ctightly,\u201d \u201csuperior,\u201d and \u201csecuring\u201d are nebulous terms incapable in this case of rendering the claimed <em>structure </em>unobvious over the prior art, the record containing no evidentiary basis for comparison of appellant\u2019s weave tightness or yarn strength with those of the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-8\">We find in the references the clear suggestion of their combination as rer lied upon by the tribunals below and no impediment thereto. Accordingly, the decision rejecting the appealed claims is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
