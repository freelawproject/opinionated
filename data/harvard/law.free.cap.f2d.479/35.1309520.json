Upon denial of that motion, appellant had appealed and this court affirmed the denial in Craig v. United States et al., 413 F.2d 854 (9th Cir. 1969), cert. denied 396 U. S. 987, 90 S.Ct. 483, 24 L.Ed.2d 451 (1969) <em>(Craig I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-16\">Appellant contends that the amendment now sought merely corrects a \u201cmisnomer\u201d and thus the second sentence of Rule 15(c), F.R.Civ.P.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> does not apply. The second sentence of Rule 15 (c) was added by 1966 amendment accompanied by the following Advisory Committee Note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-17\">\u201cRule 15(c) is amplified to state more clearly when an amendment of a pleading changing the party against whom claim is asserted <em>(including an amendment to correct a misnomer or misde-scription of a defendant) </em>shall \u2018relate back\u2019 to the date of the original pleading. [Emphasis added.] [3 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 15.01(9)]\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-18\">Rule 15 (c), therefore, is applicable to the proposed amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-19\"> In <em>Craig I, </em>we applied the rule and held (1) that within the statutory period, Litton had not received notice, formal or informal, of the institution of the action, and (2) that due to its non-receipt of such notice, Litton would be prejudiced in maintaining its defense on the merits, should the amendment be al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>lowed. Also in <em>Craig I, </em>appellant contended Litton had had notice because prior to the running of the statute it had investigated the incident resulting in her decedent\u2019s death in which a seaman also had been injured and had filed suit. We held there that \u201cIt cannot be said that [Litton\u2019s] notice of the incident, but not of the institution of this action, within the statutory period, did not prejudice Litton in maintaining its defense to the action.\u201d The issues of notice and prejudice may not be relitigated as appellant now attempts.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-12\">. In pertinent part Rule 15(c) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-13\">(c) Relation Back of Amendments. Whenever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading. An amendment changing the party against whom a claim is asserted relates back if the foregoing provision ls satisfied and, within the period provided by law for commencing the action against him, the party to be brought in by amendment (1) has received such notice of the institution of the action that he will not be prejudiced in maintaining his defense on the merits, and (2) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against him.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
