The Union alleged that Clarytona Manor, Inc. (Clarytona), an Illinois corporation that operates nursing home facilities at Lewiston, Illinois, refused to bargain with the Union, in violation of section 8(a)(5) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq. The month before, over Clarytona\u2019s objections, the Board had certified the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of an appropriate unit of Clarytona\u2019s employees. In response to the Union\u2019s charge, the Board\u2019s General Counsel issued a complaint against Clarytona and moved for summary judgment. The Board granted that motion and now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>seeks enforcement of its order issued on August 19, 1971,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requiring Clarytona to cease and desist from its unfair labor practices and, upon request, to bargain collectively with the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">It is undisputed that Clarytona has refused to bargain with the Union. The primary issue here, as in the prior administrative proceedings, is whether the Board should have set aside the representation election held on November 20, 1970, because of allegedly improper campaign conduct by the Union.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Union had won that election by a vote of 36 to 25. A secondary issue is whether Clarytona had presented substantial and material factual issues warranting a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">Shortly before the election, on November 18 and 19, the Union had distributed two leaflets to Clarytona\u2019s employees. The leaflet distributed on November 18th clearly displays the Union\u2019s name at the top. Just below the name is what the Board accurately characterizes as \u201cobvious campaign propaganda and an appeal for votes for the Union.\u201d The challenged portion of the flyer is as

It is a fact that the Federal Government has an agency called the National Labor Relations Board that assists Labor and Management in reaching agreements. In fact it is the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) that will be conducting the election on Friday and this NLRB office is headquartered in Peoria.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">Further on, the flyer quotes statements generally supportive of collective bargaining and the labor movement attributed to several church organizations and leaders. It concludes with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-8\">\u201cSome famous leaders of our Country have made note as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-9\">ABRAHAM LINCOLN \u2014 \u2018If a man tells you he loves America, yet hates labor he is a liar.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-10\">DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER \u2014 \u2018Only a handful of unreconstructed reactionaries harbor the ugly thought of breaking unions and of depriving working men or working women of the right to join the union of their choice.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-11\">FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT \u2014 \u2018If I were a worker, the first thing I would do would be to join a union.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-16\">Clarytona argues that the simulated ballot in the November 18th handbill violated the Board\u2019s rule, as enunciated in Allied Electric Products, Inc., 109 NLRB 1270 (1954), against the reproduction of official Board documents altered to appear to favor one party in an election. The use of the ballot allegedly was a sufficient basis for setting aside the results of the election. Alternatively, with reference to the portions of the leaflets we have quoted above, Clarytona asserts that they are \u201cblatant and unambiguous . direct and indirect statements implying governmental preference\u201d for the Union and would independently warrant setting aside the election. Also, some of the statements supposedly are gross misrepresentations of fact. Furthermore, if the ballot and the objectionable statements are considered together, they allegedly mandate the setting aside of the election results.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-18\">As we pointed out in Rockwell Mfg. Co., Kearney Div. v. NLRB, 330 F.2d 795, 796 (7th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 890, 85 S.Ct. 161, 13 L.Ed.2d 94, \u201cWhether to set aside an election because of incidents during the campaign period is a matter for the sound discretion of the Board.\u201d See also NLRB v. A. J. Tower Co., 329 U.S. 324, 330-331, 67 S.Ct. 324, 91 L.Ed. 322 (1946). Clarytona apparently is arguing that the Board committed two errors: it abused its discretion in April 1971, when it upheld the Regional Director's overruling of Clarytona\u2019s objections to the election and certified the Union (see footnote 2 of this opinion); and it further abused its discretion by refusing, in ruling on the General Counsel\u2019s motion for summary judgment in August 1971, to reexamine the decision it had made in April.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>bargain is not a violation of the Act if the Board has acted improperly in certifying the union as a statutory bargaining representative. <em>See </em>NLRB v. Krieger-Ragsdale &amp; Co., Inc., 379 F. 2d 517 (7th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 1041, 88 S.Ct. 780, 19 L.Ed.2d 831; Macomb Pottery Co. v. NLRB, 376 F.2d 450, 452 (7th Cir. 1967). The party challenging the validity of an election\u2014 Clarytona here \u2014 bears the burden of establishing that the Board abused its discretion. NLRB v. Mattison Machine Works, 365 U.S. 123, 124, 81 S.Ct. 434, 5 L.Ed.2d 455 (1961); NLRB v. Red Bird Foods, Inc., 399 F.2d 600, 602 (7th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">In <em>Allied Electric Products, Inc., supra, </em>upon which Clarytona relies, the Board created an exception to the general rule that the Board does not \u201c \u2018police or censor propaganda used in the elections it conducts, but rather leaves to the good sense of the voters the appraisal of such matters . . . . \u2019\u201d Linn v. United Plant Guard Workers, 383 U.S. 53, 60, 86 S.Ct. 657, 662, 15 L.Ed.2d 582 (1966). The union in <em>Allied Electric Products </em>had circulated a document that purported to be a sample copy of the Board\u2019s \u201cOfficial Secret Ballot\u201d as shown on the Board\u2019s notice of election. The sample ballot had, however, been altered: (1) the word \u201cYes\u201d was printed in large type at the left of the \u201cYes\u201d box; (2) there was an \u201cX\u201d in the \u201cYes\u201d box; and (3) an additional statement had been added at the bottom of the ballot and read: \u201cDo not mark it any other way \u2014 Mark \u2018YES\u2019 box only.\u201d The Board concluded that the sample ballot exceeded the bounds of legitimate campaign propaganda because it tended to suggest that the Board was not impartial but instead favored a particular choice in the upcoming election. The Board then declared that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-8\">\u201cin the future [the Board] will not permit <em>the reproduction of any document purporting to be a copy of the Board\u2019s official ballot, </em>other than one completely unaltered in form and content and clearly marked sample on its <em>face, and </em>upon objection validly filed, will set aside the results of any election in which the successful party has violated this rule.\u201d 109 NLRB at 1272 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1036-9\">The Board\u2019s discussion in <em>Allied Electric Products </em>and its subsequent application of the rule of that case convince us that the initial basis for finding <em>Allied </em>to be germane is the distribution of material which is a replica or a suggestive facsimile of an official Board document. While the thought might be ventured that the likelihood is rather minimal of most laboring people today being fooled by the use of copies of official documents into thinking that the Board is thereby expressing approval of one party or the other, and while the <em>Allied </em>rule would seem arguably not to pay proper deference to the native intelligence of people and their intuitive ability to discern deception such as this would be, nevertheless, we cannot quarrel with the genuine concern of the Board even with the appearance of the misuse of its processes to secure partisan advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">Accepting then the <em>Allied </em>rule as based on sound policy, we find the initial prong for activation of the rule missing. Although the Board in its brief did refer to the material in question as a \u201cprototype ballot,\u201d we conclude here that not only did the reproduction not purport to be an official Board ballot, but a comparison between the handbill\u2019s simple, rather sketchy ballot with the official form reveals so many differences that it is unreasonable to assume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>that the former could be mistaken for the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">Unlike the ballot in <em>Allied Electric Products, </em>the one here did not convey the impression that the Board was endorsing the Union. It was at most <em>\u201ca </em>graphic admonition to vote for a particular participant, without any implication of Board approval.\u201d Phelps-Dodge Copper Products Corp., 111 NLRB 950, 951 (1955). The Board\u2019s determination comports with such prior decisions as Houston Shell and Concrete Div., McDonough Co., 118 NLRB 1511, 1512 (1957); Paula Shoe Co., Inc., 121 NLRB 673, 675 (1958); The Glidden Co., 121 NLRB 752, 755-756 (1958); Rett Electronics, Inc., 169 NLRB 1111 (1968); and Joslyn Mfg. and Supply Co., 171 NLRB 54 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">In <em>Allied, </em>however, the Board also observed that \u201cespecially does it believe that no participant in a Board election should be permitted to suggest either directly or indirectly to the voters that this Government Agency endorses a particular choice.\u201d 109 NLRB at 1272. Taken out of context, the statement immediately following the ballot form, \u201cOUR U. S. GOVERNMENT AGREES \u2014\u2018UNIONS ARE GOOD,\u2019\" might seem to constitute a skating toward the thin edge of protection from <em>Allied </em>inundation. However, taking the statement out of isolation and in the climate of a union election, we agree with the Board that the statements in the leaflets \u201cdo not inherently suggest governmental approval of the material issued\u201d or that the Government looked with favor upon the Union\u2019s being selected exclusive bargaining representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">The quoted statement in the November 18th handbill about encouraging collective bargaining is an accurate paraphrase of the policy statement contained in the Act. The source of the statement is given; and the leaflet clearly indicates that the Union, not any governmental unit, is the issuer. As for the quotations attributed to former Presidents, although Clarytona hints that the statements were taken out of context, it neither substantiates this veiled charge nor directly challenges the accuracy of the quotations. <em>Compare </em>Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. v. NLRB, 447 F.2d 1136 (5th Cir. 1971), denying enforcement to 180 NLRB 880 (1970), on remand from 406 F.2d 1272 (5th Cir. 1969). Further, to construe such general expressions of sympathy for the working man by three deceased leaders as suggestions of approval of the Union by the current Government is to distort simple, obvious campaign propaganda.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">On ultimate analysis, the significant factor in determining whether there is a tendency to mislead, insofar as the present point is concerned, is the utilization of official Board documents in connection with a partisan communication, even though that message may on the whole be innocuous. Thus, in a recent case in this court, it was stated that to say the message there involved \u201c \u2018could in no manner be interpreted by the employees as an endorsement by the Board of the Union\u2019 flies in the face of reason and experience.\u201d NLRB v. John S. Barnes Corp., 478 F.2d 1105 at 1107 (7th Cir., 1973). In that case, the message was considered to be in conjunction with an official Board document, and this court held the <em>Allied </em>rule to be applicable. Here, however, as we have indicated, the foundation of the use of the official Board document is lacking. Of course, we do not in dealing with the <em>Allied </em>question mean to suggest that if a party to an election attempts to mislead by asserting that the Board is in favor of its position it might not be fatal to the validity of the election even in the absence of the use of an official document. That, however, is not the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-10\">In the administrative proceedings, Clarytona contended that the portion of the November 19th handbill we quoted above was \u201cclearly intended to advise the employees that strikes will not occur, and that it is the Board\u2019s responsibility to see that they do not.\u201d Allegedly a significant issue during the campaign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>had been that strikes might occur if the Union organized the nursing home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Clarytona maintains that the Union\u2019s \u201celeventh-hour\u201d misstatement violated the <em>Hollywood Ceramics Co., Inc. </em>doctrine, 140 NLRB 221, 224 (1962), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1038-4\">\u201cWe believe that an election should be set aside only where there has been a misrepresentation or other similar campaign trickery, <em>which involves a substantial departure from the truth, </em>at a time which prevents the other party . . . from making an effective reply, so that the misrepresentation, whether deliberate or not, <em>may reasonably be expected to have a significant impact on the election. </em>However, the mere fact that a message is inartistically or vaguely worded and subject to different interpretations will not suffice to establish such misrepresentation as would lead us to set the election aside. . . . But <em>even where a misrepresentation is shown to have been substantial, </em>the Board may still refuse to set aside the election if it finds upon consideration of all the circumstances that the statement would not be likely to have had a real impact on the election.\u201d (Footnotes omitted; emphases added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1038-7\">In our opinion the Board did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Clarytona\u2019s contention that the distribution of the November 19th flyer warranted the election\u2019s being set aside. Contrary to Clarytona\u2019s argument, the objected-to passage does not aver that \u201cit is the Board's responsibility to see that [strikes] do not [occur].\u201d The passage does suggest that union representation does not necessarily result in work stoppages. It also indicates that the Board \u201cassists\u201d the parties in reaching agreement. Even if the figure of 90% peaceful settlements is inaccurate, the substance of the Union\u2019s message is an acceptable interpretation of the applicable law and of existing conditions. The passage might conceivably imply that the Board affirmatively intervenes in negotiations and to that extent be incorrect. But we do not believe that the implication is sufficient to warrant holding the election to be invalid under <em>Hollywood Ceramics.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-9\">In sum, we do not find any of the individual items to which Clarytona objects to be so improper as to justify our overturning the Board\u2019s decision. Further, we reach the same conclusion when we consider the combined impact of all of the items, as the employer urges us to do. Communications to employees in the pre-election period seldom reach the status of being belletristic contributions, and that was so here. That they may have been persuasive to the voters\u2014 something was \u2014 is not the test but rather it is whether they were improperly so. We cannot say they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-10\">Under the Board\u2019s rules, post-election hearings are conducted only where \u201csubstantial and material factual issues exist which can be resolved only after a hearing.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(c). See also 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(e). We agree with the Board that Clarytona\u2019s objections raised no substantial and material issues of fact. Therefore, no hearing was or is required. See Judge Sprecher\u2019s recent discussion of this point in Louis-Allis Co. v. NLRB, 463 F.2d 512, 519-520 (7th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-11\">Accordingly, we grant the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement of its order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1034-15\">. The Board\u2019s order is reported at 192 NLRB No. 114 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1034-16\">. After the election, Clarytona had filed objections to certain conduct by the Union which allegedly had affected the election results. The Board\u2019s Regional Director thereupon conducted an investigation and recommended that the employer\u2019s objections be overruled in their entirety. He made these findings without resort to an evidentiary hearing. Subsequently, Clarytona filed timely exceptions to the Regional Director\u2019s report and recommendations ; Clarytona reasserted its objections to the election and requested that the election be set aside or, in the alternative, that \u201cthe minimum relief the Board must provide . . is a hearing.\u201d On April 2, 1971, after considering the objections, the Regional Director\u2019s report, and Clarytona\u2019s exceptions thereto, the Board adopted, without a hearing, the Regional Director\u2019s findings, conclusions, and recommendations and certified the Union as the exclusive bargaining representative.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1035-14\">. In its order of August 19, 1971, the Board summarized Clarytona\u2019s defense to the complaint lodged against it and concluded that the employer was seeking to relitigate the same issues the Board had considered and resolved against Clarytona when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>Board had decided in April 1971 to certify the Union as the exclusive bargaining representative. The Board then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1036-7\">\u201c[T]he Respondent does not offer to adduce at a hearing any newly discovered or previously unavailable evidence, nor does it allege that any special circumstances exist herein which would require the Board to reexamine the decision made in the representation proceeding. We therefore find that the Respondent has not raised any issue which is properly litigable in this unfair labor proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1038-12\">. We note that Clarytona did not claim that this had been a significant issue in the campaign until it filed with the Board its exceptions to the Regional Director\u2019s report,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
