By the time of passage, it had become abundantly clear that the use of consumer credit was expanding at an extremely rapid rate. From the end of World War II through 1967, the amount of such credit outstanding had increased from $5.6 billion to $95.9 billion, a rate of growth more than 4% times as great as that of the economy. Yet, as the congressional hearings revealed, consumers remained remarkably ignorant of the nature of their credit obligations and of the costs of deferring payment. Because of the divergent, and at times fraudulent, practices by which consumers were informed of the terms of the credit extended to them, many consumers were prevented from shopping for the best terms available and, at times, were prompted to assume liabilities they could not meet. Joseph Barr, then Under Secretary of the Treasury, noted in testifying before a Senate subcommittee that such blind economic activity is inconsistent with the efficient functioning of a free economic system such as ours, whose ability to provide desired material at the lowest cost is dependent on the asserted preferences and informed choices of consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">\u201cThe Truth-in-Lending Act was designed to remedy the problems which had developed. The House Committee on Banking and Currency reported, in regard to the then proposed legislation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-7\">\u2018[B]y requiring all creditors to disclose credit information in a uniform manner, and by requiring all additional mandatory charges imposed by the creditor as an incident to credit be included in the computation of the applicable percentage rate, the American consumer will be given the information he needs to compare the cost of credit and to make the best informed decision on the use of credit.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">This purpose was stated explicitly in \u00a7 102 of the legislation enacted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-12\">\u2018The Congress finds that economic stabilization would be enhanced and the competition among the various financial institutions and other firms engaging in the extension of consumer credit would be strengthened by the informed use of credit. The informed use of credit results from an awareness of the costs thereof by consumers. It is the purpose of this sub-chapter to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">\u201cThe hearings held by Congress reflect the difficulty of the task it sought to accomplish. Whatever legislation was passed had to deal not only with the myriad forms in which credit transactions then occurred, but also with those which would be devised in the future. To accomplish its desired objective, Congress determined to lay the structure of the Act broadly and to entrust its construction to an agency with the necessary experience and resources to monitor its operation. Section 105 delegated to the Federal Reserve Board broad authority to promulgate regulations necessary to render the Act effective. The language employed evinces the awareness of Congress that some creditors would attempt to characterize their transactions so as to fall one step outside whatever boundary Congress attempted to establish. It indicates as well the clear desire of Congress to insure that the Board had adequate power to deal with such attempted evasion. In addition to granting to the Board the authority normally given to administrative agencies to promulgate regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>designed to \u2018carry out the purposes\u2019 of the Act, Congress specifically stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1F\">\u2018These regulations may contain such classifications, differentiations, or other provision, and may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for any class of transactions, as in the judgment of the Board are necessary or proper ... to prevent circumvention or evasion [of the Act], or to facilitate compliance therewith.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">The Board was thereby empowered to define such classifications as were reasonably necessary to insure that the objectives of the Act were fulfilled, no matter what adroit or unscrupulous practices were employed by those extending credit to consumers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., 1973, 411 U.S. 356, 93 S.Ct. 1652, 1657, 36 L.Ed.2d 318, (1973) (footnotes omitted), reversing 5 Cir. 1971, 449 F.2d 235. Further, in the words of Chief Justice Burger we are told:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-6\">\u201cThe Truth-in-Lending Act reflects a transition in congressional policy from a philosophy of let-the-buyer-beware to one of let-the-seller-disclose. By erecting a barrier between the seller and the prospective purchaser in the form of hard facts, Congress expressly sought \u2018to . . . avoid the uniformed use of credit.\u2019 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601. Some may claim that it is a relatively easy matter to calculate the total payments to which petitioner was committed by her contract with respondent; but at the time of sale, such computations are often not encouraged by the solicitor or performed by the purchaser. Congress has determined that such purchasers are in need of protection ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-8\">\u201cThat the approach taken may reflect what respondent views as an undue paternalistic concern for the consumer is beside the point. The statutory scheme is within the power granted to Congress under the Commerce Clause. It is not a function of the courts to speculate as to whether the statute is unwise or whether the evils sought to be remedied could better have been regulated in some other manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-11\"><em>Id., </em>411 U.S. at 377, 93 S.Ct. at 1664 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-12\">This is a case raising three important questions of first impression regarding the proper application of various provisions of the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z. More specifically, we are here concerned with Regulation Z\u2019s requirement that creditors include the cost of \u201ccredit life insurance\u201d in the computations of \u201cfinance charges\u201d and \u201cannual percentage rates\u201d that they are required to disclose to consumers. <em>See </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.4(a)(5). We are called upon to decide (1) whether \u201copen end credit accounts\u201d in existence prior to the effective date of the regulatory scheme must nonetheless strictly comply with those disclosure requirements, (2) whether the statutorily minimum damages may be imposed for each incorrect disclosure of this information and thus are not limited to one imposition per customer account, <em>i. e., </em>whether minimum damages may be imposed for each violative \u201cperiodic statement,\u201d and (3) whether attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded for work done on appeal on behalf of a successful litigant. Only the first two of these questions were before the trial judge, and he answered both in the affirmative. We agree that these issues were correctly decided, and we affirm both holdings. As to the third issue, we conclude that attorney\u2019s fees are authorized for appellate legal work, and we here award such fees in an amount to be determined by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-13\">I. THE FACTUAL SETTING &amp; ACTION BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b798-14\">The facts giving rise to this action are not seriously disputed. Plaintiff, Fannie Thomas, opened an \u201copen end credit account\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>Myers-Dickson Furniture Company, on October 16, 1968, at which time she made an initial purchase. She made additional purchases on April 14, 1970, September 25, 1970, and November 13, 1970, and each time the amount of the purchase was added to her account balance. During the period here in question, September 1970 to August 1971, defendant sent plaintiff eleven monthly statements of her account and plaintiff made one payment each month.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z became effective on July 1, 1969. On June 28, 1969, defendant had mailed plaintiff a \u201ccredit disclosure\u201d letter in compliance with \u00a7 226.7(f) of Regulation Z.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Among the terms disclosed in the letter was the cost of credit life insurance carried on plaintiff\u2019s account with defendant. Defendant thereafter continued sending plaintiff monthly statements of her account, including the eleven statements here in question, none of which included the cost of credit life insurance <em>as an element of the \u201cfinance charge\u201d </em>stated on each document. Each of the monthly statements did, however, contain a separately stated charge for credit life insurance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since plaintiff was not required to and never chose to pay the entire outstanding balance on her account at one time, each \u201cperiodic statement\u201d imposed a different and additional \u201cfinance charge\u201d (computed on the then outstanding balance) as well as a new and different credit life insurance charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">One of the disclosure requirements created by the Act and Regulation Z was that the \u201cfinance charge\u201d must include, <em>inter alia, </em>the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-11\">\u201c(5) Charges or premiums for credit life, accident, health, or loss of income insurance, written in connection with any credit transaction unless</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-12\">(1) The insurance coverage is not required by the creditor and this fact is clearly and conspicuously disclosed in writing to the customer ; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-13\">(2) Any customer desiring such coverage gives specific dated and separately signed affirmative written indication of such desire after receiving written disclosure to him of the cost of such insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.4(a)(5). It is uncontested that plaintiff never gave defendant a separately signed and dated insurance authorization and that defendant sent plaintiff eleven monthly statements after the effective date of the regulatory scheme that did not include the cost of credit life insurance charges within the \u201cfinance charge\u201d itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Plaintiff filed this action under the Truth in Lending Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> alleging that defendant\u2019s failure to include the insurance charges in the \u201cfinance charge\u201d constituted violations of \u00a7 226.4(a)(5). The court below agreed and, following a non-jury trial, entered judgment for plaintiff. Ruling that each statement that failed to include the insurance charge in the \u201cfinance charge\u201d constituted a separate violation, the court granted plaintiff damages of $1,100, the statutory minimum for each violation being $100 and there being eleven such defective \u201cperiodic statements.\u201d Finally, the court heard testimony regarding an award of attorney\u2019s fees, which is specifically authorized by \u00a7 130 of the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640, and awarded plaintiff $500 in attorney\u2019s fees as well as the costs of her action.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Defendant brings this appeal, arguing that it was not required to comply with \u00a7 226.4(a)(5) as to pre-existing accounts and that, even if it was, the Act contemplates only one award of minimum damages per account. Plaintiff cross-appeals, arguing that the award of attorney\u2019s fees already granted is insufficient and an abuse of discretion and that attorney\u2019s fees for work done on appeal ought also to be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">II. APPLICABILITY OF DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS TO PREEXISTING ACCOUNTS</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">There is no question that a violation of \u00a7 226.4(a)(5) would have been shown here if plaintiff had opened her account with defendant <em>after </em>the effective date of the Act. In each of the eleven challenged \u201cperiodic statements,\u201d defendant failed to include the insurance charge within the \u201cfinance charge\u201d shown on the statement, even though defendant did not have a \u201cspecific dated and separately signed\u201d insurance authorization from plaintiff. Indeed, if defendant has improperly understated the \u201cfinance charge,\u201d it has also improperly understated the \u201cannual percentage rate,\u201d which is computed from the \u201cfinance charge.\u201d <em>See </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s account having been opened before the Act became effective, defendant argues that because it has complied with \u00a7 226.7(f) of Regulation Z by sending the letter of June 28, 1969, it need not now comply with \u00a7 226.4(a) (5). We cannot agree. Section 226.7(f) merely provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-10\">\u201cIn the ease of any open end credit account in existence and in which a balance remains unpaid on July 1, 1969 . . . the items described in paragraph (a) of this section [the terms that a creditor must disclose to a customer <em>opening an account </em>after the Act becomes effective] shall be disclosed in a notice mailed or delivered to the customer not later than July 31, 1969. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">Defendant argues that this language creates a \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d excusing all pre-existing \u201copen end credit accounts\u201d from compliance with the ongoing disclosure requirements of \u00a7 226.-4(a)(5), but nowhere in the Act or in Regulation Z do we find any such exception. Defendant argues nonetheless that such an exception should be implied from two factors. First, defendant relies on the fact that pre-existing- \u201copen end credit accounts\u201d are not mentioned elsewhere in Regulation Z to support the inference that \u00a7 226.7(f) contains the <em>only </em>disclosure requirements applicable to such pre-existing accounts. Secondly, defendant urges that the \u201cobvious intent of this ['\u00a7 226.7(f)] disclosure to existing accounts was to relieve a business from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>the impractical requirement of obtaining signed credit life elections and disclosures from the holders of its numerous existing accounts. . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">Defendant\u2019s efforts to create an \u201cexisting-accounts exception\u201d from the disclosure requirements of Regulation Z must fail. As to its first theory, we deem it sufficient to iterate that \u201cexceptions\u201d not mentioned in the Act should not lightly be read into it, Buford v. American Finance Co., N.D.Ga.1971, 333 F.Supp. 1243, 1247, and we can perceive no good reason for our creating the exception defendant here urges. <em>See also </em>Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., <em>supra. </em>Nor is defendant\u2019s second theory persuasive, for we understand that the promulgation of \u00a7 226.-7(f) reveals an altogether different intent. Section 226.7 sets out the specific disclosures required for all \u201copen end credit accounts.\u201d Section 226.7(a), for example, lists eight items that must be disclosed \u2014 at the time an account is opened \u2014 -to every customer who opens such an account after the effective date of the Act. Rather than creating a special category of \u201copen end credit accounts,\u201d we think it clear that \u00a7 226.-7 (f) merely guarantees that pre-existing \u201copen end credit accounts\u201d will receive the identical level of protection that such post-Act accounts are afforded. Under \u00a7 226.7(a) \u201cnew\u201d accounts are given certain disclosures at the time of opening; \u201cold\u201d accounts are placed on a par by the requirement that the same disclosures be made after the Act\u2019s effective date, <em>i. e., </em>under the circumstances enumerated in \u00a7 226.7(f). Furthermore, we reject the argument that creditors may excuse their actions not in compliance with the regulatory scheme by arguing that to comply will place a \u201ccommercially unfeasible burden\u201d on them. <em>E. G., </em>Douglas v. Beneficial Finance Co., D.Alas.1971, 334 F.Supp. 1166, 1175, rev\u2019d on other grounds, 9 Cir. 1972, 469 F.2d 453. In that regard, we note that at the time defendant sent out its \u00a7 226.7(f) disclosure letters, it might have been able to ease its \u201cburden\u201d by including a \u00a7 226.4(a)(5) insurance authorization form in the same envelopes.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Defendant\u2019s view of this ease misconceives the central thrust of the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z. The stated purpose of the Act\u2019s disclosure provisions is \u201cto assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the customer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601. <em>See also </em>Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., <em>supra, </em>411 U.S. at 363-369, 93 S.Ct. 1652, \u00a7 I. In order to enhance the consumer\u2019s ability to shop for credit intelligently, the Act created the terms \u201cfinance charge\u201d and \u201cannual percentage rate\u201d as standards that the consumer might look to in determining the actual cost to him of using credit. Buford v. American Finance Co., <em>supra. See also </em>Ratner v. Chemical Bank New York Trust Co., S.D.N.Y.1971, 329 F.Supp. 270; Bostwick v. Cohen, N.D.Ohio 1970, 319 F.Supp. 875. To implement this general purpose, two types of disclosures are required for \u201copen end credit accounts.\u201d First, a disclosure must be made when the account is opened advising the consumer <em>what will or may happen </em>to his account. <em>See </em>\u00a7 226.7(a). Defendant has complied with this requirement by sending plaintiff the notice contemplated by \u00a7 226.7(f). But secondly, the creditor is required to send \u201cperiodic statements\u201d to users of its \u201copen end credit accounts\u201d advising them <em>what has happened </em>to their accounts. <em>See </em>\u00a7 226.-7(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">The regulatory scheme is clearly intended to allow consumers to look to <em>one </em>place on the \u201cperiodic statement\u201d to see what the cost of credit is, and defendant admits that the statement it sent plaintiff would violate Regulation Z, 12 C.F. R. \u00a7 226.4(a)(5), if employed for accounts opened after July 1, 1969. That seemingly harsh result is necessary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>however, if consumers are to be able to (1) intelligently shop for credit, and (2) intelligently assess the costs of continuing to use that credit. Defendant has failed to include a required item within its listing of the \u201cfinance charge\u201d on the \u201cperiodic statements\u201d it sent plaintiff, and we hold that this non-disclosure is excused neither by the fact that this individual \u201copen end credit account\u201d was opened before the effective date of the Act nor by the fact that defendant has complied with \u00a7 226.7(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The biologism of the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d suggested by defendant would project progeny and lineal descendants <em>ad infinitum. </em>Instead of establishing this anomolous result, a realistic reading suggests that Regulation Z was intended to delineate the specifies of charges imposed after the Act\u2019s effective date and necessitates a continuum of their monthly permutations. It would have been a simple matter and the grist of their daily 'Congressional mill for the Congress to have employed explicit words of prospectivity if such a result had been intended. We are satisfied that violations of \u00a7 226.4(a) (5)\u2019s disclosure requirements have been established, and we turn now to a consideration of the proper measure of damages for those violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">III. COMPUTATION OF DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Once a violation has been found under the Act or its implementing regulations, damages are set by \u00a7 130 of the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-7\">\u201c(a) <em>Failure to disclose.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-8\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this section, any creditor who fails in connection with any consumer credit transaction to disclose to any person any information required under this part to be disclosed to that person is liable to that person in an amount equal to the sum of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-10\">(1) twice the amount of the finance charge in connection with the transaction, except that the liability under this paragraph shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-11\">(2) in the case of any successful action to enforce the foregoing liability, the costs of the action together with a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as determined by the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640. Thus, under the statute, the amount of damages to be awarded when disclosure violations are found is not discretionary: The court must award the successful litigant-consumer twice the \u201cfinance charge\u201d involved in the relevant transaction, with the minimum award being $100 and the maximum being $1,000. The principal issue that we must decide regarding the application of the statute is whether use of the word \u201ctransaction\u201d in \u00a7 1640(a) limits the creditor\u2019s liability to any one customer for disclosure violations to one imposition of damages in the $100 to $1,000 range. We hold that damages are not so limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-13\">The parties have not cited to us any legislative history that can guide our interpretation of the statute, and our reading of the appropriate Congressional reports reveals that the problem seems not to have been addressed in language more specific than the statute itself.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We must therefore turn elsewhere for guidance as to the meaning of \u201ctransaction\u201d as used in \u00a7 1640(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-14\">Defendant insists that the word \u201ctransaction\u201d carries with it an implied Congressional rejection of assigning the meaning \u201cviolation\u201d to the statute. The sole authority relied upon to support this argument is the \u201cAnnual Report to Congress for the Year 1971 by the Board of Governors of the Federal Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>serve System on Truth in Lending,\u201d which states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-5\">\u201cSection 130 of the Act [15 U.S.C. '\u00a7 1640] provides that a creditor is liable for a minimum of $100 for failure to make proper disclosure in connection with any consumer credit transaction. There is some uncertainty as to the meaning of \u2018transaction\u2019 when applying Section 130 to a possible error on a periodic statement used in connection with an open account. It might be contended that each separate purchase for which a credit card is used constitutes a \u2018transaction\u2019 for purposes of Section 13b, or that each periodic statement is a transaction. More likely the opening and use of the account is a single transaction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-6\"><em>Id. </em>at p. 18. Although official Federal Reserve Board interpretations of the Act are normally entitled to great weight, <em>see </em>Douglas v. Beneficial Finance Co., <em>supra, </em>334 F.Supp. at 1175-1176, we note that the above-cited report does not purport to be an official Board interpretation, was not promulgated pursuant to the Board\u2019s rule-making or legislative function, and is not binding on the Board itself; rather, the quoted portion of the report is merely a suggestion that the stated, interpretation is the \u201cmore likely\u201d meaning of the statute. The suggested interpretation is by no means binding on this Court, and we decline to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Within the \u201copen end credit account\u201d context, \u201ctransaction\u201d more logically refers to each \u201cperiodic statement.\u201d One of the primary characteristics of these accounts is that, \u201cthe customer has the privilege of paying the balance in full or in installments,\u201d <em>see </em>note 1 <em>supra, </em>and each month\u2019s billing statement may therefore be viewed as an invitation to the customer to decline to pay off the balance and instead to \u201ccarry his account on credit\u201d with a new and different \u201cfinance charge\u201d being imposed. Conversely, the limitation defendant urges us to place on the statute would be both illogical and inconsistent with the purposes of the Act. Defendant\u2019s argument reduces itself to the basic proposition that the opening and use of an \u201copen end credit account\u201d is a single \u201ctransaction\u201d and the only event covered by the statute. How that interpretation could be applied to an ongoing series of sales and monthly billings is not clear. If, for example, a customer purchased an item one year and paid a \u201cfinance charge\u201d of $50, the customer would, upon discovering a violation of the Act or Regulation\u2019s Z disclosure provisions, be able to recover twice the \u201cfinance charge\u201d or $100. If the next year the same customer were to purchase a second item and incur a \u201cfinance charge\u201d of $500, he would normally be entitled to recover $1,000 upon the discovery of a disclosure violation. Under defendant\u2019s view of the statute, however, the creditor could never be liable for a cumulative total in excess of $1,000, and the plain words of \u00a7 1640(a) thus could not be applied to the second violation. The facts of the instant ease also demonstrate the difficulty with defendant\u2019s position. This particular customer, Fannie Thomas, made four separate purchases from defendant \u2014 three after the Act took effect \u2014 and she received eleven different \u201cperiodic statements,\u201d each of which imposed a new and different \u201cfinance charge.\u201d Each statement solicited, albeit <em>sub silentio, </em>a new credit obligation to extend some portion of her outstanding balance for yet another month.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">Finally, it is undisputed that the mandatory disclosure provisions of the Act and Regulation Z apply with equal force to each and every \u201cperiodic statement,\u201d and we note that the word \u201ctransaction\u201d is used elsewhere in Regulation Z in what is obviously a plural context. <em>See </em>\u00a7 226.7(a). Under the totality of the circumstances herein enumerated, we hold that as to \u201copen end credit accounts,\u201d each \u201cperiodic statement\u201d that imposes a new \u201cfinance charge\u201d constitutes a separate transaction within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>IV. ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Plaintiff cross-appeals from the trial court\u2019s allegedly insufficient award of attorney\u2019s fees, which are specifically provided for in the Act-:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-5\">\u201c[I]n the case of any successful action to enforce the foregoing liability, the costs of the action together with a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as determined by the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a)(2). At the conclusion of the action below, the trial judge conducted a hearing in which he explored, <em>inter alia, </em>the amount of time plaintiff\u2019s attorney spent on this case, the amount of time other lawyers might have spent on her case had they represented her, the hourly rate plaintiff\u2019s attorney usually charged his clients, and the prevailing rate charged by lawyers of similar age and experience in the area. The court, without stating his reasons, then awarded plaintiff $500 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Section 1640(a)(2) leaves the determination of what fee is \u201creasonable\u201d to the court, and plaintiff admits that the test on appellate review is whether the trial judge abused his discretion. <em>E. g., </em>Weeks v. Southern Bell T. &amp; T. Co., 5 Cir. 1972, 467 F.2d 95. Applying that test to the instant facts, we find that the $500 award falls within the range of amounts that could be called reasonable. That figure could, for example, be calculated by multiplying \u201chours reasonably expended\u201d (as testified to at the hearing) by \u201creasonable rate per hour\u201d (again on the basis of testimony before the court). The award is admittedly at the lower end of the scale of fees that could have been determined on the basis of the conflicting testimony before the court, but without suggesting that the court is either bound or limited in any way by such testimony, <em>see </em>Weeks v. Southern Bell T. <em>&amp; </em>T. Co., <em>supra, </em>we find that no abuse of discretion occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">Plaintiff argues further, however, that even if the award already entered is not increased, separate fees should be allowed for her attorney\u2019s work on this appeal. We agree, for the Act allows fees in \u201cany successful action,\u201d and an action cannot be said to be \u201csuccessful\u201d when an appeal is taken <em>unless </em>the victory below is defended on appeal. Accordingly, we direct that the District Court (1) conduct a further hearing and determine the amount that will reasonably compensate plaintiff\u2019s attorney for his efforts expended on appeal, and (2) enter an order awarding that amount as attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1640(a)(2). We are confident that in determining this amount, the able trial judge will take into account the fact that plaintiff\u2019s attorney has won his client\u2019s case in a new and difficult area of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">The result we reach today is consistent with the statute\u2019s goal of creating a system of \u201cprivate attorney generals\u201d who will be able to aid the effective enforcement of the Act. Section 1640 is intended to allow aggrieved consumers to participate in policing the Act, Ratner v. Chemical Bank New York Trust Co., <em>supra, </em>and its language should be construed liberally in light of its broadly remedial purpose. <em>Id. </em>The domain of consumer credit with its allied commercial practices is no longer in the <em>laissez faire </em>era of <em>caveat emptor. </em>That doctrine is increasingly relegated to its proper place as a historical relic without modern application. The regulatory scheme forcefully expounds an emerging ethic of <em>\u201ccaveat </em>vendor,\u201d and we will not strain to avoid giving effect to the Federal Consumer Credit <em>Protection </em>Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">Affirmed and remanded for a hearing on attorney\u2019s fees on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-9\">.
