Appellant then sought federal habeas corpus relief to assert that his constitutional right to bail had been denied. There is a direct appeal now pending in the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-18\">The real issue is whether appellant has a claim which is cognizable by federal habeas corpus. A state prisoner has no absolute federal constitutional right to bail pending appeal. Bloss v. Michigan, 421 F.2d 903 (6th Cir. 1970); United States ex rel. Fink v. Heyd, 408 F.2d 7 (5th Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 895, 90 S.Ct. 192, 24 L.Ed.2d 172; United States ex rel. Klein v. Deegan, 290 F.Supp. 66 (S.D.N.Y.1968); United States ex rel. Siegal v. Follette, 290 F. Supp. 632 (S.D.N.Y.1968); Iles v. Ellis, 264 F.Supp. 185 (S.D.Ind.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-19\">Federal courts do not sit as appellate courts to review the use or abuse of discretion of state courts in granting or withholding bail pending final appeal. Bloss v. Michigan, supra, 421 F.2d at 906. And, generally, denial of bail is not an available basis for seeking post-conviction relief. Corbett v. Patterson, 272 F.Supp. 602 (D.C.Colo. 1967). See also Sheldon v. Nebraska, 401 F.2d 342 (8th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-20\">We notified appellant that the court was considering summary affirmance and that appellee had filed a motion to affirm. We now have before us appellant\u2019s memorandum in opposition to summary affirmance and his response to motion to affirm. Nonetheless, we have now carefully and thoroughly reviewed the files and records in this case, and are convinced that the district court\u2019s denial of relief was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-21\">Accordingly, the motion to affirm is granted and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
