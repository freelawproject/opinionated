Specifically, appellants sought to enjoin the Internal Revenue Service from withholding certain identified records related to the determination of appellants\u2019 tax deficiencies presently under question in the United States Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-16\">The District Court granted summary judgment on the grounds that (1) the data compiled in connection with an audit of an individual\u2019s income tax liability constitutes an \u201cinvestigatory file compiled for law enforcement purposes\u201d within the meaning of 5 U.S.C., \u00a7 552 (b) (7); (2) the exception clause found in \u00a7 552(b) (7) which provides for disclosure \u201cto the extent available by law to a party other than an agency\u201d does not include availability under the discovery provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; and (3) even if the exception clause found in \u00a7 552(b) (7) was construed to allow discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, those provisions would not apply in this ease because the parties are presently involved in litigation before the United States Tax Court and not the United States District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-17\">After carefully considering the briefs, oral argument and the District Court Opinion, we conclude that the District Court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of the appellee, the Internal Revenue Service, and we agree with the reasoning of the learned District Court Judge which is set forth in his Memorandum Opinion filed March 7, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-18\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
