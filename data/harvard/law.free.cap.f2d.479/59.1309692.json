The only remaining issue is the argument that the jury\u2019s verdict of $65,000 for the permanent partial impairment of the plaintiff\u2019s ankle was so excessive as to bring it within the power of this court to reverse the denial of the motion in the trial court to order a re-mittitur of a part of the verdict or grant a new trial. In our position of over-viewing the jury\u2019s verdict for injury which caused loss of wages, future loss of wages, past pain and suffering, future pain and suffering and loss of function of ten to fifteen percent of one leg in the case of a twenty-seven year old worker with a substantial earning capacity we conclude that this court does not have the power to disturb the verdict. See Neese, Administrator, v. Southern Railway Company, 350 U.S. 77, 76 S.Ct. 131, 100 L.Ed. 60, in which the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, 216 F.2d 772, when that court had directed a remit-itur in an appeal from a verdict claimed not to have been mathematically sustainable. See also Grunenthal v. Long Island Railroad Company, 393 U.S. 156, 89 S. Ct. 331, 21 L.Ed.2d 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
