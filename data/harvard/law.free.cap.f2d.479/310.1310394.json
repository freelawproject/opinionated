Velarde-Villarreal v. United States, 354 F.2d 9 (9th Cir. 1965). The appellant moved the trial court to order the government to produce Armstrong, but this motion was denied.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">\u201c[S]ince the government chooses to utilize such agents, with the attendant risk of entrapment, it is fair to require the government which uses this inherently dangerous procedure to take appropriate precautions to insure that no innocent man should be punished.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-10\">If [the informer] is available for hire, he should be available to come and testify . . . [and] [w]e think whether there was a failure to expend every reasonable effort to obtain the witness is a question of fact for the trial judge.\u201d 354 F.2d at 13.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">Therefore in accordance with the teachings of <em>Velarde, </em>we remand the cause</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-13\">\u201cto the trial court for the [limited] purpose of holding a further hearing at which the Government shall be given the opportunity of proving if such be the case that it was genuinely unable through reasonable efforts to produce [Armstrong] and also, if such be the case, that the Government did not take steps to see to it that [Armstrong] would be or become unavailable as a witness. The burden of proving these things should be on the government.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-14\">The court upon remand may hear such evidence as it deems necessary and proper, and then shall certify its findings to this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
