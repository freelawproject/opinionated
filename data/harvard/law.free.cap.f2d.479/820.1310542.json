They claimed to be citizens, but those claims were rejected, and each of them was ordered excluded by the Board of Immigration Appeals. While those proceedings were pending, each of them was paroled into the United States, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d) (5). For reasons which are not explained in the record, they have been in the United States on parole status ever since.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">Each alien submitted an application for a suspension of deportation and adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence under section 244(a) (1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1). The District Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service refused to accept the applications on the ground that these aliens are not eligible for the relief afforded by that section. The aliens then sought review in the district court under 5 U.S. C. \u00a7 701, et seq. The court granted their motion for summary judgment. It found that they had been \u201cphysically present\u201d in the United States in excess of seven years, as required by section 244(a)(1), and that they were therefore entitled to file an application for suspension of deportation. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">Section 244(a) of the Act provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-14\">\u201c . . . [T]he Attorney General may, in his discretion, suspend deportation and adjust the status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, in the ease of an alien who applies to the Attorney General for suspension of deportation and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-16\">(1) is deportable under any law of the United States . . . ; has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than seven years immediately preceding the date of such application. . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-18\">To bring themselves within this section, the aliens must satisfy two requirements : (1) They must have been \u201cphysically present in the United States\u201d for the required period and, (2) they must be \u201cdeportable.\u201d In this case the aliens do not meet either requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-19\">1. If the words \u201cphysically present\u201d are to be taken literally, it is obvious that the aliens meet this requirement. However, we are in the never-never land of the Immigration and Nationality Act, where plain words do not always mean what they say.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-20\">In Leng May Ma v. Barber, 1958, 357 U.S. 185, 78 S.Ct. 1072, 2 L.Ed.2d 1246, the Court had before it the question whether an alien who, like the aliens in this case, was considered excludable but had been paroled into the United States, was \u201cwithin\u201d the United States under section 243(h) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h), and so entitled to seek withholding of deportation under that section. Surely, under the literal meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>\u201cwithin\u201d the alien was \u201cwithin\u201d the United States. But the Court held that legally she was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The Court pointed to the long standing distinction \u201cbetween those aliens who have come to our shores seeking admission . . . and those who are within the United States after an entry, irrespective of its legality.\u201d (P. 187, 78 S.Ct. p. 1073.) It further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-6\">\u201cIn the latter instance the Court has recognized additional rights and privileges not extended to those in the former category who are merely \u2018on the threshold of initial entry\u2019. Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 1953, 345 U.S. 206, 212, 73 S.Ct. 625, 629, 97 L.Ed. 956. See Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding, 1953, 344 U.S. 590, 596, 73 S.Ct. 472, 477, 97 L.Ed. 576. The distinction was carefully preserved in Title II of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Chapter 4 subjects those seeking admission to \u2018exclusion proceedings\u2019 to determine whether they \u2018shall be allowed to enter or shall be excluded and deported.\u2019 66 Stat. 200, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a). On the other hand, Chapter 5 concerns itself with aliens who have already entered the United States and are subject to \u2018expulsion,\u2019 as distinguished from \u2018exclusion,\u2019 if they fall within certain \u2018general classes of deportable aliens.\u2019 66 Stat. 204, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251. Proceedings for expulsion under Chapter 5 are commonly referred to as \u2018deportation proceedings.\u2019 Parenthetically, the word \u2018deportation\u2019 appears also in Chapter 4 to refer to the return of excluded aliens from the country, but its use there reflects none of the technical gloss accompanying its use as a word of art in Chapter 5.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">The Court then cited (p. 188, 78 S.Ct. p. 1074) a list of cases holding that aliens held in custody pending determination of their admissibility have not made \u201can entry though the alien is physically within the United States.\u201d \u201cIt seems quite clear that an alien so confined would not be \u2018within the United States\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 243(h).\u201d (P. 188, 78 S.Ct. p. 1074.) The Court went on to hold that parole, as a substitute for custody, did not change the result; the parolee still was not \u201cwithin\u201d the United States. It relied in part on section 212(d) (5) of the Act, (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(5)), which states that parole \u201cshall not be regarded as an admission of the alien,\u201d and that, after return to custody, the alien\u2019s case \u201cshall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\"><em>Leng May Ma </em>requires the same result here. Section 244, like section 243, is a part of Chapter 5, not Chapter 4. The use of different language in section 244 does not change the result. It is true that in <em>Leng May Ma </em>the court said that detained aliens are \u201cphysically within\u201d the United States, and the aliens seek to distinguish the case on that ground. But the distinction will not wash.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">Before the adoption of the Act in 1952, the statute provided that an alien who had \u201cresided continuously in the United States for seven years or more\u201d was eligible to apply for suspension of deportation. (Act of July 1, 1948, 62 Stat. 1206.) It is clear that if residence were still the criterion, the aliens could not meet it. In Kaplan v. Tod, 1925, 267 U.S. 228, 45 S.Ct. 257, 69 L.Ed. 585 (cited with approval in <em>Leng May Ma, supra, </em>357 U.S. at p. 189, 78 S.Ct. at p. 1074), which involved a paroled alien, Mr. Justice Holmes said;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-11\">\u201cThe appellant could not lawfully have landed in the United States . . ., and until she legally landed \u2018could not have dwelt within the United States\u2019. . . . When her prison bounds were enlarged by committing her to the custody of the Hebrew Society, the nature of her stay within the territory was not changed. She was still in theory at the boundary line and had gained no foothold in the United States.\u201d (P. 230, 45 S.Ct. p. 257.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-13\">The seven years\u2019 residence language of the statute was criticized on the ground that an alien could enter the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>United States and establish residence and then go abroad for an extended period while technically maintaining residence here and thus remain eligible for suspension of deportation. It was in response to that criticism that the Congress in 1952 modified the statute by including the \u201cphysically present . . . for a continuous period\u201d requirement. See S. Rep.No.1515, 81st Cong.2d Sess., 595-604 (1950). Thus the purpose of Congress was to tighten the statute insofar as it applied to aliens who had \u201centered\u201d the United States, not to extend the application of the statute to those who had been excluded but paroled into the United \u2022States pending final determination of their excludability. The decision in <em>Leng May Ma </em>is, we think, just as applicable to the \u201cphysically present in the United States\u201d language of section 244 as it is to the \u201cwithin the United States\u201d language of section 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">2. Assuming, however, that we are in error in this respect, <em>Leng May Ma </em>would nevertheless require a reversal in this case. This is because the aliens are not \u201cdeportable\u201d within the meaning of section 244(a). This position at first blush seems as anomalous as our holding that these aliens are not technically physically present in the United States. The law, however, is that aliens paroled into the United States have not been admitted into the United States. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182 (d)(5). They are persons subject to \u201cexclusion\u201d which, as is pointed out in <em>Leng May Ma, supra, </em>357 U.S. p. 187, 78 S.Ct. 1072, is to be distinguished from \u201cexpulsion\u201d or \u201cdeportation.\u201d It is true that, as persons subject to exclusion, under Chapter 4 of Title II of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1221-1230, these aliens are subject to \u201cimmediate deportation.\u201d See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227. Nevertheless, they are not \u201cdeportable under any law of the United States\u201d within the meaning of section 244(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">In <em>Leng May Ma, supra, </em>as we have, seen, the Court held that one of the rights and privileges unavailable to excludees was application for withholding of deportation under section 243(h). The rationale is equally applicable to section 244(a). The Court held that the fact that Chapter 4 provides for the \u201cdeportation\u201d of excludees does not render such excludees \u201cdeportable\u201d as that term is used in Chapter 5. The Court found it significant that the provision for withholding of deportation, (\u00a7 243(h)), was found in Chapter 5. So is the provision of section 244(a) in question here. Under the compulsion of <em>Leng May Ma, supra, </em>we hold that the appealing aliens are not deportable within the meaning of section 244(a). That term, as <em>Leng May Ma </em>holds, is a word of art and does not cover excludable aliens who have been paroled into the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">We can find nothing in the law that would permit us to hold that section 244(a) becomes applicable if parole continues for an inordinate length of time. We are regretfully constrained to hold that suspension of deportation under section 244(a) is not a right or privilege extended to those paroled into the United States and who are therefore legally merely on the threshold of initial entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">The judgment is reversed with directions to enter summary judgment in favor of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b879-11\">ELY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AuF\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">I respectfully dissent. Whenever there is a reasonable doubt as to the proper interpretation of statutes granting discretionary power to the Attorney General in respect to the deportation of aliens, the doubt should be resolved in favor of the aliens. <em>See </em>Barber v. Gonzales, 347 U.S. 637, 74 S.Ct. 822, 98 L.Ed. 1009 (1954); Fong Haw Tan v. Phelan, 333 U.S. 6, 68 S.Ct. 374, 92 L.Ed. 433 (1948). <em>See also </em>Errico v. I&amp;NS, 349 F.2d 541 (9th Cir. 1965), 385 U.S. 214, 87 S.Ct. 473, 17 L.Ed.2d 318 (1966); Garcia-Gonzales v. I&amp;NS, 344 F.2d 804 (9th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">My Brother Duniway\u2019s opinion is, typically, written with the utmost care; nevertheless, I cannot subscribe to the technicality of its reasoning. In grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>ing relief to the aliens here involved, District Judge Zirpoli wrote, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANT\">\u201cThe statute under which petitioners seek relief from the Immigration and Naturalization Service\u2019in this case is Section 1254(a) of Title 8, United States Code Annotated. Within the meaning of that section the petitioners, in the instant -cases, have been <em>physically present </em>in the United States in excess of the prescribed number of years and are therefore entitled to seek the relief prayed for and are entitled to a hearing thereon from the Attorney General of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-4\">\u201cThe case of Leng May Ma v. Barber, 1958, 357 U.S. 185, 78 S.Ct. 1072, 2 L.Ed.2d 1246, applies to Section 1253 (h) of Title 8, United States Code, and is not, in this Court\u2019s view, controlling in its interpretation of Section 1254(a).\u201d (emphasis in original)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a6c-dedup-0\">Agreeing with Judge Zirpoli, I would affirm his \u201cOrder and Judgment\u201d remanding the cause for the Attorney General\u2019s consideration of the appellees\u2019 applications for suspension of deportation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
