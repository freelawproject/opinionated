By this order the Board granted the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>plication of Eastern Air Lines, Inc., for amendment of its certificate of public convenience and necessity for Route 10 so as to delete the point Bowling Green, Kentucky, from that route.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">The following facts, as adopted by the Board, appear in the initial decision of the examiner. Bowling Green is the county seat of Warren County, Kentucky, and the trade center for several counties in south-central Kentucky. In recent years Bowling Green and Warren County have experienced a trend of industrialization and relatively rapid growth. Thus Bowling Green\u2019s population has increased from about 18,000 in 1950 to about 38,000 in 1970, and the County\u2019s population increased from about 43,000 to about 55,000 during the same period.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Bowling Green is located approximately 60 miles north of Nashville, Tennessee, and approximately 100 miles south of Louisville, Kentucky, both of which cities are classified by the Federal Aviation Administration as medium air traffic hubs. From the Nashville airport, five trunklines and four local service air carriers provide single-plane service to over 65 cities throughout the United States. From the Louisville airport, four trunklines and three local service air carriers provide single-plane service to over 70 cities across the county. Louisville, Bowling Green, and Nashville are linked by Interstate Highway 65, a major north-south highway, as well as a major bus line providing frequent service between these points and beyond.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Since its certificate was amended in 1947 so as to add Bowling Green as a point on its Nashville-Louisville segments of Route 10, Eastern provided continued daily service to Bowling Green up to September 1969.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In fiscal year 1969, the number of origin and destination passengers for Eastern at Bowling Green had reached 11,852 per year or over 32 per day on its two daily schedules (southbound in the mid-morning and northbound in the late afternoon), and traffic had increased at a rate of about 2,000 passengers per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">On May 1, 1969, Eastern filed an application requesting suspension of its service at Bowling Green and approval of an agreement between Eastern and Air South, Inc., whereunder Air South would be employed by Eastern as an independent contractor to perform replacement service to Bowling Green. Air South was to provide three daily round-trips between Bowling Green and Louisville and two daily roundtrips between Bowling Green and Nashville, and bear its own expenses subject to Eastern\u2019s agreement to underwrite Air South in amounts of no more than $50,000 the first year, $10,000 the second year, and $5,000 the third year. In support of its application, Eastern cited its competition from numerous strong trunklines which are able to devote their full attention to dense and/or long-haul routes upon which Eastern is dependent for economic survival. Eastern noted that it would save $300,000 annually from suspension at Bowling Green and that Bowling Green would benefit from the more frequent service to Nashville and Louisville under the replacement service.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">In August 1969, the Board approved Eastern\u2019s application for temporary suspension at Bowling Green and the agreement for replacement service by Air South. The Board\u2019s approval was made subject to the condition that the suspension granted to Eastern would immediately terminate if Air South should cease to satisfactorily provide the specified replacement service.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-14\">Air South provided reliable service from September 2, 1969 through March 31, 1970, when it terminated its replacement service due to a lack of financial resources and support. Notwithstanding Air South\u2019s morning, afternoon, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>evening service from Bowling Green to Louisville and Nashville, the number of origin and destination passengers at Bowling Green dropped to an average of 21.9 per day during this seven month period \u2014 a decline of about one-third from the traffic Eastern had carried just prior to its replacement by Air South.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Faced with the legal obligation of providing air service to Bowling Green when Air South terminated its replacement service, Eastern on March 30, 1970, applied to the Board for continuation of its temporary suspension at Bowling Green and for approval of a one-year agreement between Eastern and Northern Airlines, Inc., which was then providing scheduled air service between Louisville, Bowling Green, and Nashville. Under the agreement Eastern would underwrite Northern in the amounts of $8,000 per month for the first three months of operation and no more than $4,000 per month thereafter for the latter\u2019s replacement service at Bowling Green.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Pending the Board\u2019s consideration of the above application, Northern\u2019s service was admittedly unreliable and unsatisfactory, and Northern in fact terminated service at Bowling Green on or about May 8, 1970. Bowling Green was thus without reliable and satisfactory air service from April 1, 1970, until May 25, 1970, and with no service at all during the last 17 days of this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">On May 25, 1970, Eastern entered into a third contractual agreement for replacement service to Bowling Green, this time with Wright Air Lines, Inc. Whereas Air South and Northern in essence had been employed as independent contractors, retaining all revenues and bearing all expenses subject to underwriting payments by Eastern, Wright was essentially employed to provide substitute air service on a cost-plus-10 percent basis, subject to an initial ceiling of $28,000 per month. Under the agreement, Wright was to provide Bowling Green with at least three daily round-trips to Louisville and at least two daily roundtrips to Nashville.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">On September 24, 1970, the Board approved Eastern\u2019s application for continued temporary suspension at Bowling Green, subject to Wright\u2019s performance of the specified replacement service, and the agreement between Eastern and Wright for such replacement service. In so approving Eastern\u2019s application, the Board acknowledged that replacement service at Bowling Green had not been satisfactory. The Board was nonetheless of the belief that Wright\u2019s replacement service, sponsored and sustained by Eastern, would be superior to prior replacement service and superior to the service which would be provided directly by Eastern were the suspension denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">On December 31, 1970, Eastern filed the present application for deletion of Bowling Green from its certificate for Route 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">In his initial decision rendered after a public hearing, Examiner Sornson apparently recognized that there is no reasonable prospect that reinstitution of direct service at Bowling Green by Eastern would be economically feasible. The Examiner nonetheless concluded that Bowling Green should not be deleted from Eastern\u2019s certificate, but rather that Eastern should continue to be responsible for the community\u2019s air service needs through support of air taxi replacement service. The Examiner found Eastern\u2019s request for total relief by way of deletion of Bowling Green to be unwarranted in that \u201cEastern (had) not shown that a substitute service arrangement at Bowling Green cannot be successful. . . . \u201d In support of this conclusion, Examiner Sornson cited what he found to be inadequate subsidies paid by Eastern to Air South and Wright and Eastern\u2019s failure to effectively promote and advertise the replacement \u25a0 service.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">Reviewing the decision of the Examiner, the Board rejected his finding that Eastern had failed to show that a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>stitute Service arrangement cannot be successful at Bowling Green and his conclusion that Eastern should remain responsible for the community\u2019s air service needs through support of air taxi replacement service. Instead, the Board concluded from the evidence that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\">\u201ccontinued air taxi operations have only a limited chance of eventual success and that there are no unusual or extenuating circumstances which would warrant support of the magnitude which would be required to continue such operations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">In support of its conclusion, the Board reviewed the decline in the number of passengei\u2019s experienced by both Air South and Wright and the resulting operating losses suffered by these replacement carriers, notwithstanding the substantial subsidies paid by Eastern. Thus Air South, with its fully satisfactory schedules and performance, was able to generate only 22 daily origin and destination passengers, resulting in a loss of over $127,000 during its seven months of operation. And during its first year of operation, Wright experienced traffic of under 20 daily origin and destination passengers, resulting in a loss of $242,000 or $35 per passenger. The Board also relied on the evidence that after approval' \u2014 without civic objection \u2014of reduced service by Wright in May 1971 to stem continuing losses, traffic dropped to about 12 passengers per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The Board further rejected the Examiner\u2019s finding that the decline in passenger traffic is attributable to Eastern\u2019s failure to promote and assist the substitute service and Eastern\u2019s inadequate subsidies. In addition to providing support services for both Air South and Wright, Eastern spent about $3,500 in the year ended May 1971 advertising and promoting Wright\u2019s substitute service. Eastern paid Air South $50,000 in cash subsidy for the latter\u2019s seven months of operation and paid Wright almost $300,-000 for the first year of its replacement service.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The Board therefore concluded that the public convenience and necessity require the amendment of Eastern\u2019s certificate for Route 10 so as to delete Eastern\u2019s authority to serve Bowling Green.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\"> Under our narrow scope of review as set forth in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1486(e), the Board\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. Beyond this scope of judicial review, we must defer to the Board\u2019s expertise and discretion in weighing the many factors and policy considerations which enter into Board decisions respecting public convenience and necessity. <em>See </em>City of Pontiac v. C. A. B., 361 F.2d 810, 814-815 (6th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">From the record before us we find that the Board\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. Relying upon the undisputed rates of traffic generation at Bowling Green between 1962 and 1969, the Board found that there is no reasonable prospect .that a reinstitution of direct service by Eastern could be profitable in the future. This finding \u2014 which also appears to be a conclusion of the Examiner \u2014 is supported by evidence that during its peak year of 1969 with 11,853 origin and destination passengers at Bowling Green, Eastern achieved load factors of only about 30 percent and suffered an operating loss of almost $300,000 (about $25 per Bowling Green passenger) on its Bowling Green-Nashville and Bowling Green-Louisville flights.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">We also find substantial evidence on the record to support the Board's findings that continued replacement air taxi operations supported by Eastern have an extemely limited chance of success and that traffic response to these operations does not warrant their continuation. As reviewed above, the declining traffic under Air South\u2019s and Wright\u2019s operations, and the substantial operating losses suffered by these replacement carriers despite Eastern\u2019s subsidies fully support these findings by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>We find no merit in Petitioner\u2019s argument that the Board\u2019s order must be set aside, because the Board failed to give sufficient weight to the several factors prescribed in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1302.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioner asserts that the Board failed to adequately consider the future commercial needs of Bowling Green as well as the effects of its decision upon the Postal Service and the national defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">With respect to Bowling Green\u2019s future commercial needs, its opinion discloses that the Board was fully aware of the factors favoring the maintenance of air service not only in Bowling Green but also in all smaller communities across the nation. On balance, however, the Board found that Bowling Green\u2019s future commercial needs and the community benefits from certified air service do not warrant continued requirements that Eastern \u2014 as a trunkline carrier \u2014 bear the responsibility and expense of the unsuccessful operations at the City. Finding no abuse of the Board\u2019s discretion, we are powerless to reweigh these factors which were before the Board. <em>See </em>City of Pontiac v. C. A. B., <em>supra, </em>361 F.2d at 814-815; Outagamie County v. C. A. B., 355 F.2d 900, 906 (7th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Moreover, we find in the record no evidence respecting the effects of the Board\u2019s decision on the present and future needs of the Postal Service and the national defense. Even if such evidence had been introduced, however, we do not believe that the Board is required in every case to make express findings on every factor set forth in Section 1302. <em>See </em>Outagamie County v. C. A. B., <em>supra, </em>355 F.2d at 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-13\">The order of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\">. Claiming an insufficient number of passengers at Bowling Green to support the two daily roundtrip flights it was then providing to Nashville and Louisville, in 1961 Eastern applied for suspension and deletion of Bowling Green <em>and </em>replacement of its Nashville-Bowling Green-Louisville service by Ozark Air Lines, Inc. The Board denied this application in a decision rendered in 1964.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\">. 49 U.S.C.
