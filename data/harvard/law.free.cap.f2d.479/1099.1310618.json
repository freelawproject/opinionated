It is conceded that the balance of more than five billion dollars in the highway trust fund is adequate to meet all current requirements and that Missouri is qualified in every respect for its apportionment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>On June 30, 1971, the State of Missouri filed an amended complaint against the Secretary and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The complaint alleged that the Secretary had apportioned 115.7 million dollars in highway funds to Missouri in fiscal 1972, but that he imposed contract controls on (impounded) 21.9 million dollars of that sum. Missouri also complained that funds had been impounded in fiscal 1971 for the same reasons.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">The district court, 347 F.Supp. 950, held that the contract controls were beyond the authority conferred on the Secretary by the Federal-Aid Highway Act. It enjoined further withholdings for Missouri for fiscal year 1973; issued a writ of mandamus ordering that the Secretary revoke any contract controls prohibiting Missouri from obligating its full apportionment for fiscal 1973; and entered a judgment declaring that it was not within the discretion of the Secretary to withhold or to defer obligation of highway funds previously apportioned to the State of Missouri for the reasons advanced by the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-11\">We hold that the action for mandamus was mooted by the Secretary\u2019s removal of the contract controls during the pendency of the action<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but that the court properly granted plaintiff\u2019s declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-12\">On appeal, the Secretary argues: (1) that there is no subject matter jurisdiction, (2) that there is no justiciable issue since the case involves only a political question, and (3) that the Secretary possesses discretion under the statute to withhold funds for the stated reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-13\">JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-14\">Missouri alleged and the district court so held that it had jurisdiction by virtue of the mandamus statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, and by Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-15\">The Secretary urges that mandamus is not a proper basis for jurisdiction since the Highway Act is non-mandatory in nature and that mandamus is only applicable where the duty owed is specific, unequivocal and plainly prescribed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Secretary further con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>tends that the Administrative Procedure Act is not an independent source of jurisdiction<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but is only applicable when other grounds of statutory jurisdiction exist. Regardless of these contentions we find an ample jurisdictional basis for adjudication under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">Although \u00a7 1331(a) was not specifically pleaded in the complaint, a review of the entire complaint demonstrates that a federal question exists. The plaintiffs sought a judicial construction of the Federal-Aid Highway Act and the amount in controversy obviously exceeded $10,000. In Sikora v. Brenner, 126 U.S.App.D.C. 357, 379 F.2d 134 (1967), the plaintiff alleged jurisdiction under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145. The district court dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. However, on appeal, the appellate court found that jurisdiction existed under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1161-12\">\u201cThe District Court\u2019s jurisdiction was established by the allegations of operative facts bringing the controversy within the scope of the statute conferring jurisdiction on the court. The court\u2019s jurisdiction was neither dependent upon nor removable by any reference to or recitation of a statute in the allegations.\u201d 379 F.2d at 136.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1161-13\">Moreover, since the complaint clearly establishes that federal question jurisdiction did exist, there is no need for this court to remand in order to amend the pleadings to specifically allege 1331(a) as a basis of jurisdiction. See Norton v. Larney, 266 U.S. 511, 516, 45 S.Ct. 145, 69 L.Ed. 413 (1925). We can assume that the complaint has been amended to conform to this fact and proceed to review the district court\u2019s judgment on the merits. See also National Farmers Union Property &amp; Casualty Co. v. Fisher, 284 F.2d 421, 423 (8 Cir. 1960); Parker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>v. Gordon, 178 F.2d 888, 890 n. 2 (1 Cir. 1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">JUSTICIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-5\">In view of our finding as to mootness under the mandamus action, we raise the question of whether the declaratory judgment is likewise moot for purposes of this appeal. We decide it is not. It is recognized that \u201c[w]here one of the several issues presented becomes moot, the remaining live issues supply the constitutional requirement of a case or controversy.\u201d Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 497, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 1951, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969). Moreover, a court may grant a declaratory judgment even though it declines to issue an injunction or writ of mandamus. <em>Id. </em>at 499, 89 S.Ct. at 1952. An action for declaratory relief satisfies the requirements of a \u201ccase or controversy\u201d when it would have significant consequences in determining the extent of any \u201cfurther relief\u201d deemed necessary if the illegal conduct should be expected to resume in the future. Gautreaux v. Romney, 448 F.2d 731, 736 (7 Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">It is generally held that the voluntary cessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not make a ease moot if there is a \u201creasonable expectation\u201d that the wrong will be repeated. United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633, 73 S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953). See also United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Export Ass\u2019n., Inc., 393 U.S. 199, 203, 89 S.Ct. 361, 21 L.Ed.2d 344 (1968). However, when the actions questioned are those of the government, the mere probability of recurrence must be coupled with a certainty that the impact will fall on the same objecting litigants. Committee to Free the Fort Dix 38 v. Collins, 429 F.2d 807, 812 (3 Cir. 1970); see generally Mootness on Appeal in the Supreme Court, 83 Harv.L. Rev. 1672 (1970). In the instant case, it is conceded by the Secretary that further contract controls will be imposed and that Missouri will most certainly be affected. We therefore find sufficient basis to justify appellate review of the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-8\">The Secretary asserts the lack of justiciability on the ground that the case presents political questions not appropriate for judicial resolution. Counsel suggests that what is involved is the \u201c[e]xeeutive\u2019s power to control the rate of expenditure of funds\u201d and that this is a political question. We disagree. The only issue before the district court and this court is the question of statutory construction, i. e., whether the Secretary of Transportation, pursuant to his delegated duties under the Federal-Aid Highway Act, can withhold from the State of Missouri, for the reasons he stated, the authority to obligate funds duly apportioned to the state under the Act. Surely such a determination is within the competence of the courts. Cf. Barlow v. Collins, 397 U.S. 159, 166, 90 S.Ct. 832, 25 L.Ed.2d 192 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-9\">As was recently observed, \u201c[i]n our overall pattern of government the judicial branch has the function of requiring .the executive (or administrative) branch to stay within the limits prescribed by the legislative branch.\u201d National Automatic Laundry and Cleaning Council v. Shultz, 143 U.S.App.D.C. 274, 443 F.2d 689, 695 (1971). Resolution of the issue before us does not involve analysis of the Executive\u2019s constitutional powers. Nothing in the present record demonstrates that the Secretary of Transportation will continue to exercise controls beyond that which judicial construction finds permissible within the statute. To the contrary, at oral argument counsel for the government stated, <em>\u201cI </em>suppose our brief comes as close as it can to conceding that were Congress to make this mandatory, that would be the end of the case. ... I would say almost certainly that without tending to give away what the White House might decide in any particular statute, that where it is mandated clearly, the Executive would have to spend that money or would spend the money.\u201d The issue before us is not whether the Secretary abused his discretion in imposing eon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>tract controls but whether the Secretary itas been delegated any discretion to so act in the first place. Cf. Constructores Civiles de Centroamerica, S.A. v. Hannah, 148 U.S.App.D.C. 159, 459 F.2d 1183, 1192 (1972). It is difficult to frame the Article III duty of the judicial branch of government under these circumstances in any more meaningful terms than did Mr. Justice Reed in Stark v. Wickard, 321 U.S. 288, 309-310, 64 S. Ct. 559, 88 L.Ed. 733 (1944):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-12\">\u201cWhen Congress passes an Act empowering administrative agencies to carry on governmental activities, the power of those agencies is circumscribed by the authority granted. This permits the courts to participate in law enforcement entrusted to administrative bodies only to the extent necessary to protect justiciable individual rights against administrative action fairly beyond the granted powers. The responsibility of determining the limits of statutory grants of authority in such instances is a judicial function entrusted to the courts by Congress by the statutes establishing courts and marking their jurisdiction. Cf. United States v. Morgan, 307 U.S. 183, 190-191, 59 S.Ct. 795, 83 L.Ed. 1211. This is very far from assuming that the courts are charged more than administrators or legislators with the protection of the rights of the people. Congress and the Executive supervise the acts of administrative agents. The powers of departments, boards and administrative agencies are subject to expansion, contraction or abolition at the will of the legislative and executive branches of the government. These branches have the resources and personnel to examine into the working of the various establishments to determine the necessary changes of function or management. But under Article III, Congress established courts to adjudicate cases and controversies as to claims of infringement of individual rights whether by unlawful action of private persons or by the exertion of unauthorized administrative power.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a6o-dedup-0\">Thus, we conclude that the present case presents a justiciable issue capable of judicial resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-14\">THE FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAY ACT</p>\n<p id=\"adq-dedup-0\">This then brings us to the merits of the controversy \u2014 the construction of the Federal-Aid Highway Act as it relates to defining the Secretary\u2019s delegated authority. A threshhold requirement is a rudimentary understanding of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-15\">Congress deemed it within the \u201cnational interest to accelerate the construction of the Federal-aid highway systems\u201d to serve local and interstate commerce and to enhance national and civil defense. 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(b) (1970). The objective of the Act was the creation of a National System of Interstate and Defense Highways. The system was to be completed \u201cas nearly as practicable\u201d over the period of twenty years on an expedited construction basis. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1163-17\">Based upon specific formulas set forth within the Act, the Secretary is required to apportion among the several states certain sums authorized to be appropriated for expenditure.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 104(b). After the apportionment, the states, through their respective highway departments, are to submit programs of proposed projects based upon the apportioned funds. The Secretary is instructed in Section 105(a) to \u201cact upon programs submitted to him as soon as prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1108\">*1108</page-number>ticable after the same have been submitted.\u201d Section 106(a) then provides that \u201cas soon as practicable after program approval,\u201d specific \u201csurveys, plans, specifications, and estimates for each proposed project\u201d will be submitted to the Secretary for his approval. In this regard, Section 106(a) specifically states that in approving the project plans \u201cthe Secretary shall be guided by the provisions of section 109 of this title.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is at this stage that the contract controls are imposed, for once a project is approved by the Secretary it \u201cshall be deemed a contractual obligation of the Federal Government for the payment of its proportional contribution thereto.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(a). On the basis of this approval, states are permitted to obligate the apportioned funds through the letting of construction contracts, etc. Section 118(b) provides that the sums \u201cavailable for expenditure\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> shall remain available for expenditure in that state for a period of two years after the close of the fiscal year for which the sums are authorized, and any funds not expended after that time shall lapse, except that unexpended funds apportioned for the Interstate System shall \u201cimmediately be reapportioned among the other States . . . . \u201d The final stage of the Act is the appropriation by Congress of money from the Highway Trust Fund to pay the state the proportional federal share of construction costs incurred in the partial or total completion of the highway projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">In 1966 President Johnson, in transmitting his proposals to Congress, announced that there would be a deferral of lower priority federal expenditures by approximately $3 billion in order to curb inflation and assure the stability of the economy (H.R. Doc. No. 492, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. (1966)). Thereafter, on November 23, 1966, the Director of the Bureau of the Budget advised the Department of Treasury that the federal highway program would have to bear its share of such deferrals. Accordingly, the program was limited to $3 billion in total project obligations during fiscal year 1967.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This was done notwithstanding provisions in the Highway Act authorizing over $4 billion to be apportioned to the states for highway construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-15\">In light of this, the Secretary of Transportation sought the opinion of the Attorney General of the United States as to the Secretary\u2019s authority to defer obligations under the Highway Act. The opinion of Ramsey Clark, Acting Attorney General of the United States, was issued on February 25, 1967. Attorney General Clark concluded that \u201cthe Secretary has the power to defer the availability to the States of those funds authorized and apportioned for highway construction which have not, by the approval of a project, become the subject of a contractual obligation on the part of the Federal Government in favor of a State.\u201d 42 Op.Att\u2019y Gen. No. 32 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-16\">The essentia] theses upon which the Secretary defends his authority to impose contract controls under the Federal-Aid Highway Act turns on three arguments: (1) that appropriation acts are permissive in nature and do not provide a specific mandate that the funds authorized to be apportioned must be expended;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (2) that there exists no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>vested right by the states in the appropriated funds until such time that the Secretary gives his approval; and (3) that the language of Section 101(c) is precatory and although expressing Congress\u2019 \u201cdesire\u201d and \u201cpolicy\u201d that highway funds not be impounded, the terms of the statute are not mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-4\">We find these arguments unavailing. The claim that a general appropriation act is deemed permissive in nature as far as it constitutes a mandate to expend funds has not escaped criticism.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nevertheless, assuming the proposition to be true, it still does not provide a bottom on which to premise either a direct or implied authorization within the Federal-Aid Highway Act to administer contract controls. For although a general appropriation act may be viewed as not providing a specific mandate to expend <em>cdl </em>of the funds appropriated, this does not <em>a fortiori </em>endow the Secretary with the authority to use unfettered discretion as to when and how the monies may be used. The Act circumscribes that discretion and only an analysis of the statute itself can dictate the latitude of the questioned discretion. Civil Aeronautics Board v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 367 U.S. 316, 322, 81 S.Ct. 1611; 6 L.Ed.2d 869 (1961); Federal Trade Commission v. National Lead Co., 352 U.S. 419, 428, 77 S.Ct. 502, 1 L.Ed.2d 438 (1957); Stark v. Wickard, 321 U.S. 288, 309, 64 S.Ct. 559, 88 L.Ed. 733, (1944); Pentheny, Ltd. v. Government of the Virgin Islands, 360 F.2d 786, 790 (3 Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-6\">The second contention raised by the Secretary is that the states have no vested interest in the funds at the time the Secretary exercises his contract control. This argument is premised on Section 106(a) of the Act which states that approval of the Secretary is a prerequisite to the contractual obligation of the United States. It is, therefore, urged that the statute is not mandatory and that the Secretary has the authority to withhold his approval up to two years time.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Assuming arguendo that the states have no vested right in the funds until such time as the Secretary approves the specific projects, we fail to see that this provides a basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>for finding that the Secretary has lawful discretion to <em>withhold his approval </em>of projects for reasons not contemplated within the Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>The remaining argument of the Secretary is that Section 101(e) of the Act demonstrates that Congress deems impoundment of funds permissive. Section 101(c) specifically provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-5\">\u201c(c) It is the sense of Congress that under existing law no part of any sums authorized to be appropriated for expenditure upon any Federal-aid system which has been apportioned pursuant to the provisions of this title shall be impounded or withheld from obligation . . ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1167-6\">The Secretary urges that \u201cthe sense of Congress\u201d language is precatory and simply expresses the wishes of Congress rather than a specific mandate of proscription. Assuming for the moment that this be correct, we find the argument still not controlling the issue before us. The fundamental issue is whether the Secretary possesses direct or implied authority to exercise contract controls for the reasons advanced here. Such authority, if it exists at all, must be gleaned from the language of the Act itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-7\">We turn then to an analysis of the statute. At the outset we note that in legislating the Federal-Aid Highway Act, Congress was acting under Article I, \u00a7 8 wherein it is given its express constitutional authority to establish \u201cpost Roads.\u201d After granting several additional powers to Congress, Article I, \u00a7 8 concludes by setting forth that Congress may \u201cmake all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Office thereof.\u201d It seems reasonable to say that until and unless Congress acted under Article I, neither the Secretary nor anyone else within the Executive branch of the government could build a federally aided highway system. The only branch of government which has the constitutional power to build roads is the only one which has the authority to dictate the terms under which the construction can be carried out. It should require no citation of authority to reaffirm the proposition that the Secretary\u2019s authority is limited to carrying out the law according to its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-13\">In construing the statute, we adhere to the basic canon of construction observed in Richards v. United States:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-14\">\u201cWe believe it fundamental that a section of a statute should not be read in isolation from the context of the whole Act, and that in fulfilling our responsibility in interpreting legislation, \u2018we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>but [should] look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.\u2019 \u201d 369 U.S. 1, 11, 82 S.Ct. 585, 591, 7 L.Ed.2d 492 (1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1168-3\">And as stated in 2 Sutherland, Statutory Construction \u00a7 2802, at 215 (3d ed. 1943), \u201c[t]he statute should be construed according to its subject matter and the purpose for which it was enacted.\u201d Over a century ago, Lord Campbell noted, \u201c[i]t is the duty of the Courts of Justice to try to get at the real intention of the Legislature by carefully attending to the <em>whole scope </em>of the statute to be construed.\u201d (Emphasis ours.) Liverpool Borough Bank v. Turner, 45 Eng. Repr. 715, 718 (1860), aff\u2019d, 70 Eng. Repr. 703. See generally Thompson v. Clifford, 132 U.S.App.D.C. 351, 408 F.2d 154, 158 (1968); United States v. St. Regis Paper Co., 355 F.2d 688, 692 (2 Cir. 1966); Joanna Western Mills Co. v. United States, 311 F.Supp. 1328, 1335 (Cust.Ct.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-12\">Under the Federal-Aid Highway Act Congress has provided for a coherent scheme of statutory duties relating to the Secretary of Transportation. While the Secretary is given the discretion to approve or disapprove a state highway program under the statute, nevertheless he must act within <em>specific </em>directions relating to efficiency, safety and overall compliance with the Act itself. Within Sections 105(a) and and 106(a), the Secretary is given the discretion to approve a state\u2019s programs and projects, respectively. However, in both instances the statute sets out detailed considerations designed to guide the Secretary\u2019s approval.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In this re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>gard, it is clear that Congress did contemplate that the Secretary exercise administrative expertise to see that the apportioned funds are not expended on projects which fail to meet <em>reasonable </em>standards of cost. Such administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>stewardship is implicit within Section 106(d) of the Act which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1170-4\">\u201c(d) In such cases as the Secretary determines advisable, plans, specifications, and estimates for proposed projects on any Federal-aid system shall be accompanied by a value engineering or other cost reduction analysis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">Moreover, the Secretary is authorized to oversee the letting of contracts (23 U.S. C. \u00a7 112) and to insure that prevailing wage rates are maintained (23 U.S.C. \u00a7 113). We find nothing within these provisions of the Act which explicitly or impliedly allows the Secretary to withhold approval of construction projects for reasons remote and unrelated to the Act. The statute specifically sets out when the Secretary is justified in withholding funds from the states. This authority generally relates to guarding against the depletion of the Highway Trust Fund. The Secretary is given the express power to withhold obligational authority for a given fiscal year if the Secretary of Treasury determines that \u201cthe amounts which will be available in such fund . . . will be insufficient to defray the expenditures which will be required as a result of the apportionment to the States of the amounts authorized . . . .\u201d Section 209(g) of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, 70 Stat. 400, 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 120 note. See also 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-7\">As has cogently been observed, \u201c[w]here Congress has consistently made express its delegation of a particular power, its silence is strong evidence that it did not intend to grant the power.\u201d Alcoa Steamship Co. v. Federal Maritime Commission, 121 U.S.App.D.C. 144, 348 F.2d 756, 758 (1965). Cf. Zuber v. Allen, 396 U.S. 168, 183, 90 S.Ct. 314, 24 L.Ed.2d 345 (1969); Addison v. Holly Hill Fruit Products, Inc., 322 U.S. 607, 617, 64 S.Ct. 1215, 88 L.Ed. 1488 (1944). To reason that there is implicit authority within the Act to defer approval for reasons totally collateral and remote to the Act itself requires a strained construction which we refuse to make. It is impossible to find from these specific grants of authority discretion in the Secretary to withhold approval on projects Congress has specifically directed because of a system of priorities the Executive chooses to impose on all expenditures. The Congressional intent is that the Secretary may exercise his discretion to insure that the roads are well constructed and safely built at the lowest possible cost, all in furtherance of the Act, but when the impoundment of funds impedes the orderly progress of the federal highway program, this hardly can be said to be favorable to such a program. In fact, it is in derogation of it. It is difficult to perceive that Congress intended such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-9\">SECTION 118(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-10\">The Secretary additionally urges that since Section 118(b) provides that the sums are to be available for expenditure for a period of two years before they lapse, it is perfectly legal for him to withhold obligational authority so long as the states receive their full obligational authority within the two-year period. This is not only contradictory of the government\u2019s position that the states have no vested interest in the monies authorized, but this misconstrues the intent of Section 118(b) as well. That section provides: \u201cSuch sums shall continue available for expenditure <em>in that state . . </em>. for a period of two years . . . .\u201d (Our emphasis.) This simply means that the money is to be available for an individual state to use, and if any state does not obligate all their money within the two-year period, then the money will lapse. The statute is not directed at permitting the federal government to withhold the money as it sees fit so long as the states are allowed to obligate the funds within two years. This construction finds support in the legislative history. In the Senate Report to the Federal Aid in the Construction of Rural Post Roads Act, which was the initial federal legislation supporting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>highway construction, the following appears :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1171-5\">\u201cSection 3 also provides that the unexpended portions of the appropriations at the close of any fiscal year shall be available for expenditure until the close of the succeeding fiscal year. This will prevent both undue haste in the expenditure of the appropriation <em>to prevent its being turned, back into the Federal Treasury and the defeating of the purpose of the act by failure to adequately and wisely expend it for the purpose of road improvement. </em>In order that <em>the States </em>having no highway departments may not be penalized pending the meeting of their State legislatures, <em>this section alloius them until the close of the third fiscal year succeeding the year for which appropriation was made [in order to arrange for </em>expenditure.]\u201d (Emphasis ours.) S.Rep. No. 250, 64th Cong., 1st Sess. (1916).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1171-6\">The bracketed language clearly indicates that any expenditures are to be arranged by the states within the two years. Furthermore, in the Conference Report to the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, it is noted that the funds <em>available </em>for <em>expenditure </em>will lapse if unex-pended at the end of the two-year period. In discussing the availability for' expenditure, the Committee observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANvY\">\u201c(f) Availability for expenditure. \u2014The language of the House bill (sec. 108(h)) and the conference agreement (sec. 108(f) ) are identical in this respect. The conferees took note of the fact that <em>some States have not yet obligated </em>all of the funds previously apportioned to them under the authorizations contained in the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1954, wherein the matching ratio is 60-40 instead of the more liberal 90-10 ratio provided in the conference agreement. It is intended by the conferees that the Secretary of Commerce will take such steps as may be necessary to insure that <em>each State shall utilize all 60-40 funds apportioned to it before the lapse period and that no State will be permitted to deliberately lapse </em>any of the 60-40 funds in order to substitute therefor the more favorable 90-10 funds and thereby increase the total Federal funds going into any State for the Interstate System.\u201d (Emphasis ours.) H.R.Rep. No. 2436, 84th Cong., 2d Sess. (1956); U.S. Code, Cong. &amp; Adm.News at p. 2896 (1956).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1171-9\">Thus, there is a clear indication that Congress intended that the obligation of funds within the lapse period be a continuing duty of the states. Once this premise is recognized, it is not persuasive for the Secretary to argue that the lapse period of 118(a) was intended for the benefit of the Secretary. The government position is similarly weakened by reference to Section 101(b) of the Act where it is declared to be in the national interest to accelerate the construction of the highway system. As noted earlier, this same theme appears throughout the Act wherein Congress directs the states and the Secretary to act \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-10\">SECTION 101(e)</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-11\"> When the provisions of the Federal-Aid Highway Act are considered as a whole, it is apparent that the Secretary does not have the authority to withhold- funds for anti-inflationary purposes. This construction is supported by Section 101(c). After the Attorney General\u2019s opinion<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> in 1967 ruled that impoundment of highway funds was permissible under the Highway Act, Congress passed Section 101(c) specifically saying that it \u201cwas the sense of Congress that under existing law\u201d the Secretary was not to impound funds under the Federal-Aid Highway Act. Upon subsequent amendment to the Act in 1970, the House Report significantly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1171-12\">\u201cIt has been clearly demonstrated that the Federal-aid highway program can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>operate successfully and efficiently only so long as its planning and programming can be based on an assured comparatively long-term level of financing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1172-4\"><em>\u201cThe withholding of highway trust funds as an anti-inflationary measure is a clear violation of the intent of the Congress as expressed in section 15 of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968. We again wish to emphasize the clear legislative intent that funds apportioned shall not be impounded or withheld from obligation . . . .\u201d </em>(Emphasis ours.) H.R.Rep. No. 91-1554, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970); U.S. Code, Cong. &amp; Adm.News at p. 5401 (1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1172-6\">However, assuming, as the Secretary contends, that the \u201csense of Congress\u201d language is precatory and merely reflects a policy statement, nevertheless, such language can be useful in resolving ambiguities in statutory construction. See Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 324 U.S. 515, 527, 65 S.Ct. 749, 89 L.Ed. 1150 (1945); 2 Sutherland, Statutory Construction \u00a7 4820 (3d ed. 1943). Moreover, Section 101(c) takes on an added significance since it is a Congressional interpretation of prior law \u2014 for the words used are \u201cit is the sense of Congress that under existing law.\u201d And as the most recent pronouncement of the Supreme Court observes: \u201cSubsequent legislation declaring the intent of an earlier statute is entitled to great weight in statutory construction.\u201d Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Commission, 395 U.S. 367, 380-381, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 1801, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969). Accord, Federal Housing Administration v. The Darlington, Inc., 358 U.S. 84, 90, 79 S.Ct. 141, 3 L.Ed.2d 132 (1958); Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Farr, 383 F.2d 166, 175 (2 Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390 U.S. 956, 88 S. Ct. 1038, 20 L.Ed.2d 1151 (1968). But see Waterman Steamship Corp. v. United States, 381 U.S. 252, 85 S.Ct. 1389, 14 L.Ed.2d 370 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-10\">Thus, we find Section 101(c) merely <em>corroborates </em>what, as was pointed out earlier, the statute as a whole already provides \u2014 that apportioned funds are not to be withheld from obligation for purposes totally unrelated to the highway program.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-11\"> Finally, the Secretary urges that it is significant that Congress has failed to pass subsequent legislation specifically prohibiting the Secretary from withholding obligational authority. We deem this another straw in the wind.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-12\">When attempting to determine the meaning and intent of a particular statute, it is generally held that the rejection by Congress of amendments or other legislation relating to the statute in question is \u201cnot conclusive as to the meaning of the bill in the unamended form. ... It is, however, a circumstance to be weighed along with others when choice is nicely balanced.\u201d Fox v. Standard Oil Co., 294 U.S. 87, 96, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>55 S.Ct. 333, 337, 79 L.Ed. 780 (1935). However, under the facts of the instant case, these rejections by Congress are of even lesser consequence, for the necessary balance is missing. In <em>Fox </em>the amendment was debated and rejected by a vote of the entire Senate. In the present case, there were four principal bills introduced which would have prohibited the Secretary from impounding any highway funds\u2014S. 4049, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. (1968); H.R. 1214, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (1969); S. 3877, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. (1972); and S. 3939, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. (1972). Of these four bills, the first three have never even been reported out of committee.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> There have been no committee hearings, reports, floor debates, or floor votes on these measures. They simply died in committee for no explained reason. The last bill, S. 3939, contained an alternative procedure which would have precluded the Secretary from withholding obligational authority. Only the Senate Report contained this procedure \u2014 it was not part of the House Report.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> When the Conference Report was submitted the alternative procedure was dropped altogether, with no concomitant explanation. H.R.Rep.No. 92-1619, 92d Cong., 2d Sess.(1972).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">Under such circumstances, there is no way of ascertaining why these various bills were not enacted; The Secretary argues that Congress did not want to proscribe the Secretary\u2019s alleged authority to withhold obligational authority. But it is equally plausible that Congress felt that the bills were unnecessary-\u2014 that it was their understanding that the Federal-Aid Highway Act as then existing already precluded any deferral of obligational authority. When the rejection of these bills is viewed in this light, this legislative history is of no assistance in construing the Act. As the Supreme Court noted in Order of Railway Conductors of America v. Swan, 329 U.S. 520, 529, 67 S.Ct. 405, 410, 91 L.Ed. 471 (1947): <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>See also Arnold Tours, Inc. v.

Stark, 87 U.S.App.D.C. 388, 185 F.2d 871, 883 (1950), aff\u2019d, 342 U.S. 451, 72 S.Ct. 433, 96 L.Ed. 497 (1952); see generally Hart, Comment on Courts and Lawmaking, in Paulsen, ed.

It does not appear whether the bills died because they were thought to be unnecessary or undesirable. No hearings were held; no committee reports were made. Under such circumstances, the failure of Congress to amend the statute is without meaning for purposes of statutory </em>interpretation.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>ANTI-DEFICIENCY ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">Although the applicability of the Anti-Deficiency Act, 34 Stat. 49, as amended, 64 Stat. 765, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 665(c), was not argued on this appeal, the conclusion we reach is not at variance with the provisions of that Act. Section 665(c) (2) allows the Bureau of the Budget (now OMB), when apportioning appropriation funds, to set up reserves (i.e., withhold the funds) in order \u201cto provide for contingencies, or to effect savings whenever savings are made possible by or through changes in requirements, greater efficiency of operations, or other developments subsequent to the date on which such appropriation was made available.\u201d However, the Act goes on to point out that the reserves may only be established when the funds <em>\u201cwill not be required to carry out the purposes of the appropriation concerned . . . .\u201d </em>(Emphasis ours.) The legislative history is emphatic in noting that this power to withhold funds cannot be used if it would jeopardize the policy of the statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1174-6\">\u201cIt is perfectly justifiable and proper for all possible economies to be effected and savings to be made, <em>but there is no warrant or justification for the thwarting of a major policy of Congress by the impounding of funds. </em>If this principle of thwarting the will of Congress by the impounding of funds should be accepted as correct, then Congress would be totally incapable of carrying out its constitutional mandate of providing for the defense of the Nation.\u201d (Emphasis ours.) H.R.Rep. No. 1797, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 311 (1950).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1174-10\">It is thus apparent that any withholding in order to \u201ceffect savings\u201d or due to \u201csubsequent events,\u201d etc., must be considered in context of not violating the purposes and objectives of the particular appropriation statute. Such purposes and objectives are necessarily violated when one charged with implementing the statute acts beyond his delegated authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-12\">We conclude that the statutory provisions of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, as amended, 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et seq. (1970), do not expressly or impliedly authorize the Secretary to withhold the authority to obligate apportioned funds where the only reasons are those advanced by the Secretary in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-13\">As earlier indicated the issuance of the writ of mandamus is now moot and is hereby ordered vacated. The judgment granting declaratory relief in favor of the plaintiff is affirmed. The defendants are hereby enjoined from withholding from the State of Missouri, now and in the future, the authority to obligate its apportioned funds under the Federal-Aid Highway Act for reasons allegedly related to the status of the economy and the need to control inflationary pressures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-14\">Judgment affirmed, as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1159-14\">. As amended, 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et seq. (1970). The act of deferring authority to obligate funds is generally referred to as \u201ccontract controls.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1159-26\">. Under Section 209 of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 120 note, there is established a Highway Trust Fund. Appropriated into that fund <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>are specified percentages of certain highway user taxes, such as taxes on diesel fuel, gasoline, trucks, tires, etc., which are received into the Treasury. These funds are then used to reimburse the states for expenditures under the Federal-Aid Highway Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1160-6\">. The original action was commenced on August 14, 1970, and related to .highway funds impounded for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1971. This was dismissed as moot since the court found that at the time of trial the contract controls had been removed and that Missouri had been allowed to obligate all funds which had originally been apportioned for that fiscal year and previous fiscal years. However, the court permitted Missouri to file an amended complaint to pursue its claims for the years after the fiscal year ending June 30, 1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1160-7\">. The district court restricted its issuance of mandamus to fiscal year 1973. The date of the district court\u2019s hearing was June 19, 1972, and the record shows that on June 15, 1972, Missouri was informed that it would be entitled to obligate all of the funds originally apportioned for the fiscal year 1973. Thus, on the date of judgment, August 7, 1972, there was no specific duty breached and nothing remained to be ordered for the Secretary to carry out.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1160-17\">. The possible difficulty with mandamus is the judicial gloss requiring that the duty sought must be a positive command so plainly defined as to be free from doubt. Prairie Band of Pottawatomie Tribe of Indians v. Udall, 355 F.2d 364 (10 Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 831, 87 S. Ct. 70, 17 L.Ed.2d 67. As the Supreme Court has stated, \u201cwhere the duty . . . depends upon a statute or statutes the construction or application of which is not free from doubt, it is regarded as involving the character of judgment or discretion which cannot be controlled by mandamus.\u201d Wilbur v. United States ex rel. Kadrie, 281 U.S. 206, 219, 50 S.Ct. 320, 324, 74 L.Ed. 809 (1930). Nevertheless, if the Secretary was not delegated any discretionary power to withhold obligational authority for anti-inflationary purposes, the Secretary would be acting outside the scope of his power and it would appear that mandamus was intended to provide a basis for such relief. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>Peoples v. United States Department of Agriculture, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 291, 427 F.2d 561, 565 (1970). \u201cWhile the statute [1361] is couched in terms of mandamus action, its liberalizing purpose . . . was intended to permit District Courts generally to issue appropriate corrective orders where Federal officials are not acting within the zone of their permissible discretion but are abusing their discretion or otherwise acting contrary to law . . . .\u201d See also Udall v. Wis consin, Colorado and Minnesota, 113 U.S. App.D.C. 183, 306 F.2d 790, 793 (1962), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 969, 83 S.Ct. 552, 9 L.Ed.2d 539 (1963).

However, it is apparent that any issue concerning a writ of mandamus is moot as far as this appeal is concerned. See note 5 supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1161-10\">.

Although we find it unnecessary to decide, a reasonable construction of Section 118(a) is contrary to the Secretary\u2019s argument that the states have no inchoate interest whatsoever in the funds so apportioned. Section 118(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-5\">\u201c \u00a7 118. Availability of sums apportioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUMA\">\u201c(a) On and after the date that the Secretary has certified to each State highway department the sums apportioned to each Federal-aid system or part thereof pursuant to an authorization under this title, or under prior Acts, such sums <em>shall be available for expenditure under the provisions of this title.\u201d </em>(Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1166-7\">The phrase \u201cshall be available for expenditure\u201d is indicative of a Congressional intent that the money so apportioned may be fully obligated by the states. This can perhaps best be demonstrated by analogizing to other acts which contain somewhat similar language. For instance, in the Medical Facilities Construction and Modernization Amendments of 1970 (Hill-Burton Act), Congress stated in Section 601:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-8\">\u201cTITLE VI \u2014 AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ajh-dedup-1\">\u201cSec. 601.

His veto message stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-15\">\u201cOne of the most unacceptable provisions of the bill is in Section 601. Here, the Congress insists that funds appropriated for any fiscal year through 1973 to carry out the programs involved must be spent. In addition to restricting flexibility in management of Federal expenditures, this provision would interfere with my ability to comply with the limitation on total 1971 spending that has already passed the House of Representatives and has been reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee.\u201d Public Papers of the President, Richard Nixon, 1970 at 513-514. Congress subsequently passed this bill over the President\u2019s veto.

For example, Senator Morse, the second ranking member of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare which reported out the bill, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-10\">\u201cThe language of section 406 simply requires that appropriations for any fiscal year for education programs which constitute a new obligational authority shall remain available for obligation until the end of the fiscal year for which they are appropriated. <em>This section would override any statutory authority the President might have to prevent by affirmative act the obligation of fiscal yew 1969 appropriations.\u201d </em>114 Cong.

Thus, other instances where language similar to Section 118 (a)\u2019s \u201cshall be available for expenditure\u201d lend support to the conclusion that once authorization for apportionment was given, Congress intended to mandate that a state\u2019s interest in the apportioned funds was at least sufficient to preclude the imposition of any contract controls.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">.

It is my view that the district court erred in holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>that the Executive Branch has no diseretion to control the rate of obligation of funds apportioned under the Federal-Aid Highway Act. The language of the statute and its historical interpretation clearly demonstrate a deliberate choice by Congress to grant to the Executive discretion in determining the extent to which apportioned funds will be made available for obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-4\">The expenditure of funds pursuant to the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 (23 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et seq.) is a step-by-step process. The program involves successive, and distinct, stages of authorizations, apportionments, programs, projects and appropriations. The basic <em>authorization </em>for appropriations for the Interstate Highway system is found in section 108(b) of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. The funds expected to be available with respect to each fiscal year included in these authorizations are then <em>apportioned </em>among the states on or before the first day of January preceding the fiscal year for which they are authorized to be appropriated. 23 U.S. C. \u00a7 104(a). Funds so apportioned remain available for obligation at any time prior to the close of the second fiscal year after the fiscal year for which they are authorized. 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 118(a), (b). After apportionment, however, the states must submit programs for proposed highway projects for approval by the Secretary of Transportation (appellant here) before they may obligate apportioned funds. 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 105.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Approval of a specific program by the Secretary results in a contractual obligation of the Federal Government. 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(a). Payments to the states are made pursuant to appropriation acts for reimbursement for work performed. The amount appropriated each year may not exceed the amounts provided for in the authorization act, nor may it exceed the funds available in the Highway Trust Fund, jn ^he instant case, the Secretary has withheld its approval of proposed proj-eets after authorization and apportionment but before any appropriation has been made by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">While an appropriation act, as contrasted to authorization acts, would seem to be mandatory in its effect, the courts have held that even appropriation acts are permissive in nature and do not in themselves impose an affirmative duty to expend the funds. McKay v. Central Electric Power Cooperative, 96 U.S. App.D.C. 158, 223 F.2d 623, 625 (1955). Historically, there has been considerable support for this construction. For instance, then Senator Truman said in 1943,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1175-7\">\u201cWhen the Congress appropriates funds it gives the executive branch an <em>authority </em>to incur obligations. Certainly none of us hold that we give a mandate to expend the funds appropriated. We expect the funds to be used only where needed, and not in excess of the amount appropriated, to carry out some phase of the law.\u201d 89 Cong.Ree. 10362 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1175-8\">The legislative branch itself pointed out in a Committee Report concerning the 1951 Appropriations Bill, an \u201cappropriation of a given amount for a particular activity constitutes only a ceiling upon the amount which should be expended for that activity.\u201d H.Rep. 1797, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 9. As early as 1943 Congress recognized that <em>authorizing </em>legislation does not compel the executive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>branch to obligate or expend highway funds. <em>See </em>House Conf.Rep. 677, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 4 (1943) in regard to \u00a7 9 of the Rural Post Roads Act of 1943. The fact is that the presidential practice of withholding authorized and appropriated funds runs at least as far back as 1942. Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and now Nixon have all practiced it to varying degrees. Miller, Presidential Power to Impound Appropriated Funds: An Exercise in Constitutional Decision Making, 43 North Carolina Law Rev. 502, 513 (1965). Although this practice is not without its critics,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it appears to be an established practice. <em>Id., </em>and as Judge Cardozo once stated, \u201cnot lightly [to be] vacated is. the verdict of quiescent years.\u201d Coler v. Corn Exchange Bk., 250 N.Y. 136, 164 N.E. 882, 884 (1928). <em>Cf. </em>Contractors Ass\u2019n of Eastern Pa. v. Secretary of Labor, 442 F.2d 159, 171 (CA3 1971). By implication the practice has received frequent statutory recognition. An example is the Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 665(c)(1) which provides that \u201cauthorizations to create obligations by contract in advance of appropriations shall be so apportioned as to achieve the most effective and <em>economical </em>use thereof.\u201d (Emphasis added). And 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2) of the same Act provides for reversion of unobligated appropriated funds to the fund from which they originally were derived. If Congress expected full expenditure of funds, it obviously would appear unnecessary to include such a provision. It is, therefore, my view that in the absence of specific statutory language to the contrary, Congress has given the Executive branch the power to withhold authorized but unobligated funds from expenditure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-12\">I now turn to the specific statutory language of the Federal-Aid Highway Act to determine whether Congress has provided a specific mandate to spend authorized but unobligated funds, 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-13\"><em>\u201cIt is the sense of Congress </em>that under existing law no part of any sums authorized to be appropriated for expenditure upon any Federal-Aid system . . . shall be impounded or withheld from obligation, for purposes and projects as provided in this title, by any officer or employee in the executive branch of the Federal Government, . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1176-16\">23 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(d) provides in clear mandatory terms:</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-17\"><em>\u201cNo funds </em>authorized to be appropriated from the Highway trust fund <em>shall </em>be expended by or on behalf of any Federal department, agency, or instrumentality other than the Federal Highway Administration unless . . . specifically authorized . . . from the Highway Trust Fund by Federal-aid highway legislation.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-19\">Sections (c) and (d) were added to the Federal-Aid Highway Act in 1968.

However, when 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 was amended to its present form in 1970, the phrase \u201cNo funds authorized to be appropriated\u201d was substituted for the \u201csense of Congress\u201d phrase in section (d) but not in section (c). Pub.L. 91-605, \u00a7 107. By reenacting \u00a7 101(c) without pertinent modification but amending'101(d) Congress implicitly accepted the non-mandatory construction placed on \u00a7 101(c) by the Secretary after receiving Attorney General Clark\u2019s opinion<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number><em>Cf. </em>National Labor Relations Board, v.

The phrase has been the subject of interpretation in two opinions of the United States Attorney General, both construing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 616a. The latest, 42 Op.Att\u2019y Gen. 20 (1965) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-8\">\u201cThis section, by expressing the \u2018sense of Congress\u2019 that government agencies \u2018shall\u2019 require the exports to be carried exclusively in United States vessels, is not mandatory and does not preclude the Maritime Administration from permitting 50 per cent of the cargoes to be earri\u00e9d in vessels of the recipient country . . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1178-11\">In 1934 the Attorney General found that the \u201csense of Congress\u201d language indicated that the statutory requirement of 15 U.S.C. 616a was to be carried out \u201conly if feasible to do so.\u201d 37 Op.Att\u2019y Gen. 546 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-12\">In view of the legislative history of this and other statutes and because the expression \u201csense of Congress\u201d conno-tates a <em>policy </em>rather than a <em>directory </em>statement, it is my view that the Secretary of Transportation has the power to defer the availability to the states of those \u2018funds authorized and apportioned for highway construction which have not become the subject of a contractual obligation on the part of the Federal Government in favor of a state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-13\">I must therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-14\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING AND SUGGESTION FOR REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<author id=\"b1178-15\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b1178-16\">The petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>is denied pursuant to Rule 35(b), Fed.R. App.P. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-17\">On motion for rehearing the Secretary of Transportation and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget urge, <em>inter alia, </em>that the case before us is moot. This issue was raised in their original briefs. At oral argument the following colloquy took place between the court and their counsel:</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-18\">\u201cQ. (by the court) I am a little troubled by your lengthy discussion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>as to the fact that all of this money that has been deferred has now been allocated such that Missouri can \u2014 has obligated all of the funds available. Are you suggesting that there is an issue here of mootness or justiciability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-5\">\u201cA. (Mr. Appier) No, Your Hon- or, we are not. We gave a great deal of thought to arguing mootness in this particular case, but we ultimately decided perhaps this is the time to get this case finally decided. .. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-6\">\u201cQ. (by the court) As I recall, part of the prayer here was in the form of a declaratory action. Is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-7\">\u201cA. (Mr. Appier) That\u2019s right. I presume that it cannot be done in the future. To that extent I would suppose there is still some controversy between the parties. It may be that those controls would not be imposed in the future, but presumably they have been in the past and economic conditions being what they were, I think we can fairly assume they will be \u2014 will be imposed in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-8\">The government also suggests that relief should be denied plaintiffs by reason of sovereign immunity. This allegation is raised for the first time on appeal in the government\u2019s petition for rehearing (via a footnote) and consequently has not been fully addressed by either of the parties. Notwithstanding, because of its serious implications, we have given careful consideration to the issue. We nevertheless reject this claim. In Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 689, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 93 L. Ed. 1628 (1949), it was held that suits against governmental officers are not barred by sovereign immunity where the officer being sued is alleged to have acted beyond his statutory powers. See also Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S, 609, 621, 83 S.Ct. 999, 10 L.Ed.2d 15 (1963). This, of course, is the thrust of plaintiff\u2019s complaint and the basis of this court\u2019s opinion wherein we hold that the Secretary and the Director have no implied or express authority to impound funds under the Federal-Aid Highway Act for purposes not directly related to the Act itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1179-13\">However, a caveat was raised in <em>Larson </em>by the controversial<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dictum which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-14\">\u201cOf course, a suit may fail, as one against the sovereign, even if it is claimed that the officer being sued has acted unconstitutionally or beyond his statutory powers, if the relief requested cannot be granted by merely ordering the cessation of the conduct complained of but will require affirmative action by the sovereign or the disposition of unquestionably sovereign property. North Carolina v. Temple, 134 U.S. 22, 10 S.Ct. 509, 33 L.Ed. 849 (1890).\u201d 337 U.S. at 691 n. 11, 69 S.Ct. at 1462.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1179-15\">Notwithstanding, we do not consider the court\u2019s decree in the instant case as being affirmative in nature. It requires only that the defendant officers cease unauthorized action. Cf. Rockbridge v. Lincoln, 449 F.2d 567, 573 (9 Cir. 1971). The resultant release of funds is only to the extent that Congress has already authorized them to be appropriated and expended. See Local 2677, The American Federation of Government Em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>ployees v. Phillips, 358 F.Supp. 60 (D.D. C.1973); City of New York v. Ruckelshaus, 358 F.Supp. 669 (D.D.C.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">As has been observed, \u201c[a]n agency may not finally decide the limits of its statutory power. That is a judicial function.\u201d Social Security Board v. Nierotko, 327 U.S. 358, 369, 66 S.Ct. 637, 643, 90 L.Ed. 718 (1946). See also Stark v. Wickard, 321 U.S. 288, 309-310, 64 S.Ct. 559, 88 L.Ed. 733 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-5\">The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">. In an attempt to curtail the Executive\u2019s practice of withholding apportioned funds under the Federal-Aid Highway Act, the Senate in 1972 approved a bill S. 3939, 92nd Cong., 2d Sess.

The Secretary would not then be able to withhold funds by simply not approving proposed projects. See H. Rep. 92-1081, 92nd Cong., 2d Sess. The corresponding House bill contained no such provision.

An examination of the legislative history of \u00a7\u00a7 (c) and (d) reveals a concern by Congress over the practice of the Executive of impounding or withholding apportioned funds. Apparently in response to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>1967 Attorney General opinion, 42 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 32 (1967), the House passed a bill which would have amended 23 U.S. G. \u00a7 104 to include a mandatory spending provision. H.Rep.No.1584, 90th Cong., 2nd Sess., p. 11-12. Conf.Rep.No.1799, 90th Cong., 2nd Sess., (1968), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at p. 3537. The Senate did not recommend a specific amendment but did state its opposition to reductions in funds made available for obligation under the Federal-aid highway program which relate directly to the \u201cplanning and design of highway projects, the acquisition of rights-of-way necessary for such projects, and the assistance to those who are dislocated or displaced by highway construction projects.\u201d S.Rep.No. 1340, 90th Cong., 2nd Sess., (1968), U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at p. 3501.

The Conference Report, <em>Id., </em>describes 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 as the \u201cgeneral declaration of policy\u201d (emphasis added) applicable to Title 23.

Ct. 1328, 8 L.Ed.2d 440 (1962) ; 42 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 32 (1967). Since no provision of the Act gives any state a vested right to the apportioned funds prior to approval by the Secretary, and there is no express mandate to the Secretary to approve proposed projects, it is reasonable to conclude that the Secretary has, in his discretion, the authority to withhold unobligated funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">. \u201cDEAR MR. SECRETARY : This is in reply to your letter of February 21, 1967, requesting my opinion as to the legality of a reduction in the amount of Federal aid highway funds which may be obligated during the Fiscal Year ending June 30, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-6\">5k :\u00a1! sk \u00a1!\u00a1</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-7\">An appropriation act thus places an upper and not a lower limit on expenditures. The duty of the President to see that the laws are faithfully executed, under Article II, section 3 of the Constitution, does not require that funds made available must be fully expended. This principle has received statutory recognition in the Anti-Deficiency Act, February 27, 1906, c. 510, sec. 3, 34 Stat. 49 (31 U.S.C. 665(c)), which authorized the executive branch to effectuate savings of appropriated funds, and in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 701, which provides that unexpended appropriated funds shall revert to the Treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-8\">Many factors must be weighed by the Executive in determining the extent to which funds should be expended. Consideration must be given not only to legislative authorizations and appropriations but also to such factors as the effect of the authorized expenditures on the national economy and their relation to other programs important to the national welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-9\">A situation analogous to the present one arose in the early 1940\u2019s when the economy of the United States shifted first to defense and later to war production. At that time President Franklin Delano Roosevelt directed that projects having a lower priority would have to be postponed or even cancelled in spite of the availability of appropriated funds. In response to complaints about the curtailment by the Bureau of the Budget of certain programs of the Agricultural Marketing Administration, President Roosevelt set forth the powers and responsibilities of the executive branch in this area :</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-10\">\u2018It should, of course, be clearly understood that what you refer to as \u201cthe practice of the Bureau [of the Budget] of impounding funds duly appropriated by the Congress\u201d is in fact action by the Chief Executive, and has two purposes. The first purpose is compliance with the Anti-Deficiency Act, which requires that appropriated funds be so apportioned over the fiscal year as to insure against deficiency spending. * * \u00ae Secondly, the apportionment procedure is used as a positive means of reducing expenditures and saving money wherever and whenever such savings appear possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>\u2018While our statutory system of fund apportionment is not a substitute for item or blanket veto power, and should not be used to set aside or nullify the expressed will of Congress, I cannot believe that you or Congress as a whole would take exception to either of these purposes which are common to sound business management everywhere. In other words, the mere fact that Congress, by the appropriation process, has made available specified sums for the various programs and functions of the Government is not a mandate that such funds must be fully expended. Such a premise would take from the Chief Executive every incentive for good management and the practice of commonsense economy. This is particularly true in times of rapid change in general economic conditions and with respect to programs and activities in which exact standards or levels of operation are not and cannot well be prescribed by statute.\u201d \u2019 42 Op.
