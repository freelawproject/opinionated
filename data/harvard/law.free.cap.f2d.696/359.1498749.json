BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b456-21\">This appeal arises out of a dispute over the ownership of 1,000 sacks of coffee beans. Appellant, Casa Guzman, S.A. (Guzman), the seller, asserts error by the trial court in its ruling on its cross-action that: (1) Balzac Brothers, Inc. (Balzac), the rightful owner of the coffee, could stop payment on its check to Guzman after \u201creceiving delivery\u201d of the coffee being purchased and its warehouse receipt; (2) Balzac could stop payment on its check when the court \u201cjudicially admits\u201d that Guzman is entitled to the funds; (3) Guzman should be denied damages for Balzac\u2019s alleged wrongful stop payment order; (4) Corrigan Dispatch Co. (Corrigan), the warehouseman, could breach its agreement to deliver coffee pursuant to the terms of its warehouse receipt; (5) Guzman should be denied damages for Corrigan\u2019s wrongful refusal to deliver coffee as it had agreed in its warehouse receipt; (6) Guzman should be denied damages for Corrigan\u2019s wrongful interpleader; and (7) granted Corrigan attorney\u2019s fees. Because we find no error in the actions of the trial court, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-23\">This case, involving a contract to purchase 1,000 sacks of coffee beans, has been brewing for several years, having been analyzed by two different panels of the Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Circuit in two different appeals by Guzman.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The relevant facts of this \u201cchock\u2019d full o\u2019nuts\u201d dispute are set forth in the court\u2019s first opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">Corrigan Dispatch Company, an import agent and warehouseman, had custody of 1000 sacks of green coffee. Several parties claimed ownership of the coffee. Therefore, Corrigan filed an interpleader action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1335. It alleged that there were four claimants to the coffee, sought to place the disputed property in judicial custody, and asked the court to determine the owner. The four claimants were named in the complaint, and each was properly served.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">Guzman, one of the interpleaded parties, originally owned the coffee. On February 8, 1977, it agreed to sell the coffee to Cargill for $327,052.41. Cargill, in turn, contracted to sell the coffee to Mitsui. However, various problems arose with respect to delivery of the coffee to the warehouse and the import documentation. On March 11, 1977, after all of the coffee had been delivered to Corrigan, the warehouseman, Guzman notified Cargill that it considered Cargill in breach of the contract of sale due to Cargill\u2019s failure to tender payment. Guzman requested and received a storage receipt for the coffee from Corrigan. It notified Corrigan that the coffee was held for Guzman\u2019s account and not Car-gill\u2019s. Guzman then made a telephone offer to sell the coffee to Balzac Brothers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">On March 16, Guzman and Balzac Brothers consummated a purported sale by telephone, and Balzac Brothers signed a purchase order promising cash to Guzman against the warehouse receipt for the coffee. Corrigan issued a storage' receipt to Guzman for the account of Balzac Brothers. Thereafter, Corrigan received a letter from Guzman that the coffee had been sold to Balzac Brothers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\">In the interim, Cargill notified Corrigan by telegram to dispatch the coffee per Mitsui\u2019s instructions, and informed Corrigan that it would be held liable if it dispatched the coffee per Guzman\u2019s instructions. On March 17, Guzman gave the Corrigan warehouse receipt for the coffee to Balzac Brothers, and Guzman received Balzac Brothers\u2019 check for $418,-330.00. Balzac Brothers directed Corrigan to ship the coffee to Canada, and, when Corrigan refused, Balzac Brothers issued a stop payment on its check to Guzman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">Corrigan\u2019s action interpleaded Cargill, Mitsui, Guzman and Balzac Brothers. The trial court found that Cargill did not have right to possession of the coffee because the concurrent conditions for performance of the contract had not occurred, and found that Balzac Brothers had right to possession of the coffee on its delivery of the storage receipt from Guzman. It issued a mandatory preliminary injunction pursuant to which Corrigan delivered the coffee to Balzac Brothers and Balzac Brothers paid the full purchase price into the court\u2019s registry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\">The Bank<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> intervened in the action and asked to withdraw funds from the trial court as holder in due course of the check deposited to the account of Guzman. On June 30, the trial court issued an Amendment to the Interlocutory Order, agreed to by all the parties, including Guzman, whereby the Bank and Guzman were paid $248,330.00 out of the monies deposited by Balzac Brothers. The court held the remaining $170,000.00 as security for the payment of such costs and damages as may be incurred by any party pending final judgment of the court. Guzman filed its motion to dissolve or modify the preliminary injunction and asked the trial court to order additional security pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>65(c). The trial court denied Guzman\u2019s motion, and Guzman appealed to this court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">569 F.2d 301-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\n<em>A. Balzac\u2019s Check</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Guzman argues as its first basis for appeal that the trial court committed reversible error in dismissing its cross-action for recovery of damages against Balzac because of Balzac\u2019s stopping payment on its check to Guzman in payment for the coffee. Guzman\u2019s argument is premised on the idea that it had fully performed its obligations under the contract-. That is, it argues that by its delivery of the Corrigan warehouse receipt and Balzac\u2019s purported acceptance of delivery of the coffee at the warehouse, it had done all that it was required to do under its contract with Balzac.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On this basis, it argues that it is entitled to recover the \u201cunpaid\u201d purchase price plus interest<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on the coffee as well as incidental damages. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-15\">To begin our analysis of Balzac\u2019s stop payment order on its check to Guzman, we must look first to the substance of the contract between the parties. Balzac clearly entered into a contract for the purchase of coffee: There is testimony in the record to indicate that Balzac was at all times dealing with the coffee. Moreover, the payment term of the contract (see note 4 <em>supra) </em>evidences concern on the part of Balzac that the coffee be ready for importation into the United States. Recall that Mitsui delayed paying Guzman for the coffee for this very reason. Finally, the fact that payment was to be made against nonnegotiable warehouse receipts indicates that the contract was one to receive, hold and dispose of the coffee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, we hold that Balzac\u2019s duty to pay for the coffee was conditioned on its ability to remove the coffee from Corrigan\u2019s warehouse.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>On that basis, Guzman\u2019s delivery of the warehouse receipts covering goods to which there were competing claims and which were subject to an interpleader action constituted nonperformance of a condition by Guzman. As such, Balzac\u2019s duty to perform did not become due. Performance of a duty subject to a condition- cannot become due unless the condition occurs or its non-occurrence is excused. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 225(1) (1981). There being no excuse here, Balzac was not under a duty to pay Guzman for the coffee on being informed of the competing claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Even assuming that Balzac\u2019s duty to performance became due, Balzac would still have available here a \u201cdefense\u201d to an action against it for breach. \u201cIf a fact or event is a condition precedent to a promisor\u2019s duty to render the performance promised, its absence or non-occurrence is a \u2018defense\u2019 in an action brought against him for breach of his promise. This is so whether the \u2018condition\u2019 is described as express, implied or constructive.\u201d <em>Corbin, supra </em>\u00a7 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Because we find that Balzac was not required to render its own performance in light of Guzman\u2019s failure to supply coffee capable of being disposed of by Balzac, we hold that Balzac was justified in stopping payment of its check upon being informed by Corrigan that the coffee would not be delivered because of the competing claims and interpleader action. On that basis, we hold that the Trial Court did not commit reversible error in dismissing the cross-action of Guzman and denying it recovery against Balzac on grounds of Balzac\u2019s stopping payment of its check to Guzman.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">We should also point out here that had Balzac not stopped payment on its check to Guzman, Guzman would find itself in much the same position it is in now. By order of the court of March 30, 1977, Guzman was required to deposit into the Registry of the District Court any monies paid by Balzac to Guzman for the coffee in question. Thus, Guzman would not have retained the funds represented by Balzac\u2019s check even in the absence of Balzac\u2019s stop payment order and, as the result, Guzman could have no damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">B. <em>Corrigan\u2019s Refusal to Deliver</em></p>\n<p id=\"AF0\">Guzman argues as its second basis for appeal that it was entitled to recover damages against Corrigan for not delivering its coffee to Balzac. Guzman is correct when it asserts that under Article 7.403 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code Corrigan had an obligation to deliver Guzman\u2019s goods to \u201ca person entitled under the document (warehouse receipt) . .. \u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Yet Guzman\u2019s position is only partially correct. Under that same section, a warehouseman is excused from his obligation to deliver if he has a personal defense against the claimant, \u00a7 7.403(6), or \u201cany other lawful excuse\u201d, \u00a7 7.403(7). Thus the question here is not whether Corrigan had an obligation to deliver the coffee. It clearly did. The question here is whether Corrigan was lawfully excused from that obligation by the competing claims for Guzman\u2019s property. We hold that Corrigan did establish such a lawful excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-14\">Corrigan excuses its failure to deliver Guzman\u2019s coffee to Balzac on the basis of its filing of an interpleader action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Inter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>pleader is a device which allows a party in possession of money or property belonging to another to join two or more parties asserting mutually exclusive claims to the property or fund in a single suit, thereby freeing the stakeholder from multiple liability or multiple lawsuits. An interpleader action may be instituted by a plaintiff when two or more persons have claims such that the plaintiff may be exposed to double or multiple liability. At this initial stage, the merits of these potential claims are irrelevant; the threat of multiple vexation by future litigation provides sufficient basis for interpleader under F.R.Civ.P. 22. <em>See </em>3 A. Lucas and J. Moore, Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 2202(1) (1974). In this action, Corrigan was faced with the competing claims of Cargill and Balzac. E.H. Corrigan testified that Balzac threatened suit if delivery was not made. He also testified that representatives of Mitsui had claimed that the coffee belonged to it. On that basis, we hold that Corrigan\u2019s filing of an interpleader action was proper and that this filing constituted a lawful excuse for its obligation to deliver Guzman\u2019s goods. Guzman is therefore not entitled to recover damages against Corrigan for its failure to deliver coffee to Balzac.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">C. <em>Attorney\u2019s Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">As its final basis for appeal, Guzman argues that it was error to allow Corrigan to recover attorney\u2019s fees in its interpleader action. Guzman bases this argument on its assertion that Corrigan breached its contractual obligation to ship Guzman\u2019s coffee to Balzac. In such cases, recovery of attorney\u2019s fees might be denied. <em>Miller v. Nacol, </em>224 S.W.2d 734 (Tex.Civ.App.1949) (award of attorney\u2019s fees set aside because party instituting interpleader action was not a neutral stakeholder). We have held above, however, that Corrigan was excused from its obligation to deliver the coffee by the competing claims of Cargill and Balzac which resulted in its filing an interpleader action.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">It is well settled that a district court has the authority to award costs, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, in interpleader actions. <em>James P. Talcott, Inc. v. Allahabad Bank, Ltd., </em>444 F.2d 451, 468 (5th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 940, 92 S.Ct. 280, 30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>L.Ed.2d 253 (1971); <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, supra, </em>\u00a7 22.16[2]. This being the case, we hold that the Trial Court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to Corrigan in this matter was correct.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-8\">. This matter is discussed in <em>Corrigan Dispatch Co. v. Casa Guzman, S.A., </em>569 F.2d 300 (5th Cir.1978), a case involving Guzman\u2019s appeal from the denial of its motion to dissolve a mandatory preliminary injunction. In the second, <em>Corrigan Dispatch Co. v. Casa Guzman, S.A., </em>627 F.2d 238 (5th Cir.1980), the court affirmed a summary judgment for Cargill, Inc. (Cargill).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b457-13\">. Banco de Londres y Mexico.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b458-8\">. The court affirmed the trial court\u2019s action. 569 F.2d 300.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b458-9\">. The Balzac-Guzman contract provided for payment in the following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">Cash against documents upon presentation to buyers forwarding agent (Carillio Company) Laredo, Texas. Documents to include all items necessary to introduce coffee into Interstate or Intrastate commerce in the USA and including proof of clearance by U.S. Customs and approval by U.S. Federal Food Drug and Cosmetics Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b458-11\">. In its brief, Guzman asserts that it is entitled to recover from Balzac the sum of $170,000 plus interest at a rate of 18% per annum on the $418,330 contract price of the coffee, as well as an unspecified amount of incidental damages for wrongful stop payment. Guzman arrives at this award by claiming funds already paid by Balzac into the registry of the court but awarded to Cargill because of Guzman\u2019s breach of its contract to sell Cargill the coffee.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">As the preceding excerpt from the Fifth Circuit opinion in <em>Corrigan, </em>569 F.2d at 301-02, states, the trial court issued a mandatory preliminary injunction by which Balzac paid the full purchase price into the court\u2019s registry. Thereafter, the trial court issued an Amendment to the Interlocutory Order whereby the intervening bank and Guzman were paid $248,-330 out of the monies deposited by Balzac. The court held the remaining $170,000 as security.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-16\">In the meantime, Cargill filed a separate claim against Guzman in federal district court. On August 18, 1977, it filed a motion for summary judgment asking the district court to give full faith and credit to the final judgment of a New York court awarding Cargill $151,867.09 plus 6% interest. The district court ordered the clerk to pay the remaining $170,000 retained in the registry. This judgment was affirmed by the Fifth Circuit on September 22, 1980. <em>Corrigan, </em>627 F.2d 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-17\">The result of all this is that Guzman apparently is now seeking to have Balzac pay it the $170,000 which Balzac already deposited but which was awarded to Cargill. There is quite obviously no merit to this claim and, as a result, we will confine our discussion to Guzman\u2019s claim for incidental damages for wrongful stop payment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b458-18\">.
