(1976 Supp. V 1981), for enforcement of orders issued against Keystone Pretzel Bakery, Inc. on May 24, 1979 and June 2, 1981.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board found that the company violated sections 8(a)(1), 8(a) (3) and 8(a)(5) of the Act by engaging in activities aimed at discouraging union membership, and by refusing to bargain with a union having a membership card majority in the bargaining unit. As a part of its remedy the Board imposed a bargaining order. We enforce in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-16\">Keystone is engaged in the production of pretzels at its Lancaster, Pennsylvania plant. The company, which employs about 40 people, was purchased in December 1976 by President Glen Hyneman and Secretary-Treasurer Horace Groff. Several months after that purchase, Bakery and Confectionary Workers International Union of America, Local 6, began organizing Keystone\u2019s production and maintenance employees. By June 1, 1977 the Union had obtained authorization cards from seventeen employees in what it regarded as an appropriate bargaining unit of twenty-nine employees, and petitioned the Board for a representation election. No election was held, however, for on June 16, 1977 the Union filed an unfair labor practice charge with respect to Keystone's activities after its officers learned of the organizing effort. On August 31, 1977, the General Counsel filed a complaint and issued a notice of hearing. After a hearing an administrative law judge, on June 23,1978, found that Keystone had interfered, restrained and coerced employees in the choice of a bargaining representative, but that the Union had lacked authorization cards from a majority of an appropriate bargaining unit. Thus the administrative law judge did not recommend imposition of a bargaining order. The General Coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>sel, the charging party, and Keystone all filed exceptions, and the Board, rejecting Keystone\u2019s exceptions, on May 24, 1979 made the first order for which enforcement is sought. That order finds appropriate a bargaining unit consisting of all full and part-time production and maintenance employees, excluding a truckdriver, office clerical employees, and supervisors. It finds that various forms of interference, restraint and coercion took place, and that those unfair labor practices were so substantial and pervasive that they disrupted the election process, thus precluding a fair election and warranting a bargaining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The Board petitioned this court for enforcement. In response, on September 9, 1980, Keystone moved pursuant to section 10(e) of the Act to remand to the Board in order to adduce additional evidence to the effect that changes in the membership of the bargaining unit since the union obtained its authorization cards would cast doubt upon the propriety of a bargaining order \u201cat this late date.\u201d On October 8, 1980 a two judge panel of this court granted that motion. The Board moved for reconsideration of that order by the court in banc, and on November 14, 1980 this court denied the Board\u2019s motion, four judges dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">On remand the Board notified the parties that they could file statements of position on the issues raised by the remand. Accepting as true the employer\u2019s affidavit describing personnel changes in the bargaining unit, the Board concluded that no evidentiary hearing was required, and declined to withdraw its earlier bargaining order. Once again the Board petitioned for enforcement. Keystone resists enforcement, contending that: (1) there is insufficient evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings of unfair labor practices; (2) the Board erred in defining the appropriate bargaining unit; (3) the Board erred in determining that a majority of the bargaining unit had authorized the Union to bargain on its behalf; and (4) the Board\u2019s statement of reasons is insufficient to justify a bargaining order. We consider those contentions seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Under section 8(a)(1) of the Act it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with, restrain or coerce in the exercise of the right of employees, guaranteed by section 7, to organize, and to bargain collectively through chosen representatives. The administrative law judge who heard the testimony found that Keystone had violated section 8(a)(1) by authorizing employee Douglas Shertzer to conduct surveillance of union activity and report, by coercively interrogating employees Ken Rohrer and Charles Swift, and by coercing employee Ken Hall to refrain from union activity. He also found that Keystone, with knowledge of the union activity, solicited and promised to resolve employee grievances, and grant benefits; conducted an employee meeting on a holiday, for attendance at which employees were paid, and conducted an employee poll at that meeting; and through President Hyneman expressed satisfaction at a negative vote. The administrative law judge also found that Keystone violated sections 8(a)(1) and (3) when it denied a pay raise to union adherent Hall, while giving a raise to a union foe, Schertzer. The Board adopted these findings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have reviewed the testimony, and conclude that the findings respecting these activities are amply supported. Moreover, they fully support the Board\u2019s conclusion that Keystone engaged in a pattern of unfair labor practice reasonably tending to coerce or intimidate employees in the exercise of section 7 rights. <em>See, e.g., NLRB v. Garry Manufacturing Co., </em>630 F.2d 934, 937 (3d Cir.1980); <em>NLRB v. Eagle Material Handling, Inc., </em>558 F.2d 160, 165 (3d Cir.1977); <em>Hedstrom Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number><em>NLRB, </em>558 F.2d 1137, 1144 &amp; n. 18 (3d Cir.1977); <em>NLRB v. Armour Industries, Inc., </em>535 F.2d 239, 242 (3d Cir.1976); <em>NLRB v. Triangle Publications, Inc., </em>500 F.2d 597, 598 (3d Cir.1974) (The test of coercion and intimidation is whether the misconduct is such that, under the existing circumstances, it may reasonably tend to coerce or intimidate employees in the exercise of rights protected by the National Labor Relations Act.)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Under section 9(b) of the Act the Board has broad discretion in determining what is an appropriate bargaining unit. <em>E.g., Allied Chemical Workers v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., </em>404 U.S. 157, 171, 92 S.Ct. 383, 393, 30 L.Ed.2d 341 (1971); <em>NLRB v. St. Francis College, </em>562 F.2d 246, 248 (3d Cir.1977). Before the Board the parties were in agreement as to the inclusion of twenty-eight employees contended for by the General Counsel. Keystone objected to the exclusion of seven others. These included three bakers whom the administrative law judge found to be supervisors and thus excludable as a matter of law. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11) (1976). These findings as to supervisor status, approved by the Board, are supported by substantial evidence. The administrative law judge excluded from the bargaining unit a truckdriver, Russ Yoder, whose work was mostly outside the plant, on the ground that he lacked a community of interest with plant employees. In doing so he noted that the Union expressed a preference for Yoder\u2019s exclusion, and that under Board precedent unrepresented truckdrivers may be either included in or excluded from a production and maintenance unit depending on the wishes of the petitioning union.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Board approved this determination. We find no abuse of discretion. Finally the administrative law judge found that Joanne Herbst, a part-time employee, first included in the General Counsel\u2019s list, but later objected to as a casual employee, should be included. The Board approved her inclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The unit approved by the Board, therefore, consisting of all full and part-time production and maintenance employees, excluding the truck driver, office clerical employees, and statutory supervisors, apparently included a stipulated list of twenty-eight people plus Joanne Herbst, a total of twenty-nine. Since the Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence, the exclusion of three supervisors was required by law, and the exclusion of Yoder, the truck driver, was a matter within the Board\u2019s discretion, we must approve the makeup of the bargaining unit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">The General Counsel placed in evidence seventeen authorization cards (GC Exhibits 3-19). Since these comprise a majority of the twenty-nine members in the approved bargaining unit, Keystone urges that the Board erred in relying on them as evidence that the union could bargain for those members. The authorization cards are unequivocal. Each is on a printed form as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-10\">LOCAL NO. 6</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\">B. &amp; C. W.I.U. of A. \u2014 AFL-CIO 5416 Rising Sun Ave. Phila. Pa. 19120-329-8933</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-12\">I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-13\">Print Name (Date employed)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-14\">the undersigned, employee of the_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-15\">(Name of Company)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-16\">Home Address_Phone_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-17\">City-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-18\">hereby authorize the Bakery and Confectionery Workers Local No. 6 to represent me and, in my behalf, for the purpose of collective bargaining to negotiate and con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>elude all agreements in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">Department-Shift-Job Title_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">Signature of Employee-Date_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Each of the seventeen cards is filled in with the employee\u2019s name and address, phone number, and job description, and each is signed by a Keystone employee. No objection is made about their authenticity.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Keystone offered no testimony impeaching the authorization cards. It makes two contentions with respect to the sufficiency of the General Counsel\u2019s showing: that the General Counsel\u2019s showing of authorization was legally insufficient, in that he failed to adduce testimony that each employee read the card before signing it, or that it was read to the signer; and that in any event, in the General Counsel\u2019s own case, there is testimony impeaching the cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">In appraising Keystone\u2019s contentions, the starting point must be the Board\u2019s decision in <em>Cumberland Shoe Corp., </em>144 NLRB 1268 (1963), which holds that when a card states on its face that it authorizes collective bargaining it will be counted for that purpose unless it is established that the employee who signed it was told it would not be used for that purpose, but solely for another purpose. Under the <em>Cumberland Shoe </em>rule the General Counsel need do no more than produce duly authenticated cards authorizing collective bargaining. The Supreme Court has expressly approved the Board\u2019s customary analysis of the consequences of signing such cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">The customary approach of the Board in dealing with allegations of misrepresentation by the Union and misunderstanding by the employees of the purpose for which the cards were being solicited has been set out in <em>Cumberland Shoe Corp., </em>144 N.L.R.B. 1268 (1963) and reaffirmed in <em>Levi Strauss &amp; Co., </em>172 N.L.R.B. No. 57, 68 L.R.R.M. 1338 (1968). Under the <em>Cumberland Shoe </em>doctrine, if the card itself is unambiguous <em>(i.e., </em>states on its face that the signer authorizes the Union to represent the employee for collective bargaining purposes and not to seek an election), it will be counted unless it is proved that the employee was told that the card was to be used <em>solely </em>for the purpose of obtaining an election.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\"><em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 584, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1924, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1968). This holding confirms that the General Counsel establishes a prima facie case of authority to bargain collectively by producing unequivocal authorization cards from a majority of members in the bargaining unit. The holding is consistent with the settled rule that an employer may rely upon such cards to recognize a union and enter into a collective bargaining relationship. <em>NLRB v. Atlas Lumber Co., </em>611 F.2d 26 (3d Cir.1979); <em>Eisenberg v. Hartz Mountain Corp., </em>519 F.2d 138, 143 (3d Cir.1975); <em>Suburban Transit Corp. v. NLRB, </em>499 F.2d 78, 82-83, 85-86 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1089, 95 S.Ct. 681, 42 L.Ed.2d 682 (1974); <em>NLRB v. Air Master Corp., </em>339 F.2d 553, 556-57 (3d Cir.1964). Certainly an employer examining an unequivocal card authorization for collective bargaining is under no obligation to inquire beyond the four corners of the instrument before deciding to recognize a union holding authorization cards from a bargaining unit majority. When an employer, instead, refuses to recognize a card majority there is no reason why a higher burden of coming forward with proof of employee intention should be placed upon the General Counsel. There is no presumption that union adherents are any more likely not to read what they have signed than are members of the public at large. If they have signed an unequivocal authorization for collective bargaining they should, like anyone else, be presumed to have intended what the card says, absent proof of an unambiguous representation by the solicitor that the card will not be used for the stated purpose even if the employer should agree to bargain. Thus we reject Keystone\u2019s contention that the General Counsel failed to establish a prima facie case of majority representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Keystone\u2019s alternative contention, that the General Counsel\u2019s evidence impeached the cards, is predicated on the testimony of union organizer Murray, with respect to three of them. With respect to a card signed by employee Kline, Murray testified on direct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\">I asked her if she coud [sic] care to sign a card to bring an election in, for the purpose of negotiating a contract, to better the wages, working conditions, etc., the benefits and things of this nature. And she signed the card in front of me and her husband.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">With respect to employee Geyer, Murray testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">I told Mrs. Geyer that the purpose of the card was to bring a federal election in the plant, conducted by the National Labor Relations Board, for the purpose of negotiating a contract for wages, better benefits, working conditions and etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">With respect to the Mays card the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">JUDGE SCHNEIDER: Mr. Murray, I understand that before Ms. Mays signed the card, you told her the purpose was to get a contract negotiated in the plant for better working conditions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\">THE WITNESS: The purpose was to bring an election in the plant for contract negotiations, of better wages, working conditions and benefits, yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-10\">JUDGE SCHNEIDER: To bring an election in the plant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-11\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">On cross-examination Murray testified that he told every employee whose card was solicited that it would be used to get a board-supervised election at the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">Murray\u2019s testimony about the purpose of the cards was certainly truthful, since authorization cards always have a dual purpose. If the employer refuses to recognize a card majority the cards may be used to obtain a representation election. But neither Murray nor any other witness testified that any signer was told that the <em>sole </em>purpose of the cards was to bring about a representation election. The Board found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-o\">Murray\u2019s statements that the cards would be used to get an election did not negate, and were not inconsistent with, the clear and unambiguous statement on the cards that the signers authorized the Union to represent them for the purposes of collective bargaining. We find nothing in the circumstances surrounding the solicitation of the cards which would indicate that Murray deliberately and clearly directed these employees to disregard the language on the cards, or otherwise assured them that their cards would be used for no purpose other than to get an election.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">242 NLRB at 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-16\">Having so found, the Board relied on the cards as evidence that the Union represented a majority of employees in the bargaining unit. That holding is entirely consistent with governing precedent. In <em>General Steel Products, Inc., </em>which was consolidated with <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>the Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-17\">In <em>General Steel, </em>the trial examiner considered the allegations of misrepresentation at length and, applying the Board\u2019s customary analysis, rejected the claims with findings that were adopted by the Board and are reprinted in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>395 U.S. at 584-85, 89 S.Ct. at 1924-25. The Court ordered enforcement of a bargaining order in <em>General Steel. </em>In its first post<em>Gissel </em>case considering the effect of unequivocal authorization cards this court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">In <em>Gissel </em>the Supreme Court upheld the <em>Cumberland Shoe </em>doctrine of the N.L. R.B. and held that evidence of intention in signing an unambiguous single-purpose union authorization card is not pertinent in the absence of evidence that the signing employee was <em>clearly told that the sole purpose of the card was to bring about an election </em>to determine the status of the Union. (Footnote omitted) (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-6\"><em>NLRB v. Boyer Brothers, Inc., </em>448 F.2d 555, 561 (3d Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 878, 93 S.Ct. 132, 34 L.Ed.2d 132 (1972) (footnote omitted, emphasis supplied). That opinion explained, further, that \u201cthe teaching of <em>Gissel </em>is that the <em>purpose </em>of an employee in signing a card is conclusively presumed to be authorization of the Union to represent him if the card signed so states unambiguously and if no one has explicitly represented to him that the card has a different purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562. More recently, in <em>Hedstrom Company v. NLRB, </em>558 F.2d 1137 (3d Cir.1971) <em>(Hedstrom I), </em>we held that cards of employees who were told that an election was a purpose of their cards were valid for determining majority representation. Only when a union adherent soliciting a card stated affirmatively \u201cthat the sole purpose of his signing an authorization was to get an election\u201d could the card be disregarded. <em>Id. </em>at 1150 n. 34. The caselaw in other circuits is to the same effect.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Under the governing caselaw, therefore, the testimony of organizer Murray on which Keystone relies to impeach the General Counsel\u2019s prima facie case of majority representation is legally insufficient. The Board\u2019s holding that a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit authorized the union to represent them is supported by the seventeen cards in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Turning to the question whether the Board\u2019s reasoning adequately supports a bargaining order based on a card majority, we note that this case falls within what this court customarily characterizes as a <em>Gissel </em>II case: a factual situation in which an employer has engaged in unfair labor practices, and those practices, while not so outrageous as to prevent the holding of a free election, nevertheless have a tendency to erode union support.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A bargaining order in the <em>Gissel </em>II category requires, as we have found, that the union has a valid card majority. Thus for this case only two inquiries remain: whether the Board initially gave adequate reasons for its conclusion that a bargaining order was required, and whether it gave adequate reasons for concluding on remand that a bargaining order was still required despite the passage of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">In its initial decision the Board justified a bargaining order as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-11\">We further find that the unfair labor practices committed by Respondent warrant the issuance of a bargaining order in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>this case. The record shows that Respondent embarked on its course of unlawful conduct shortly after the Union\u2019s organizational campaign began in April, when it engaged in surveillance and encouraged and authorized employee Douglas Shertzer to engage in surveillance. Respondent\u2019s course of unlawful conduct continued through May, when Respondent unlawfully granted Shertzer\u2019s wage increase, withheld Hall\u2019s wage increase, continued its surveillance of union activities, and interrogated employees as to their union activities. Respondent\u2019s unlawful activity culminated in the May 31 employee meeting, during which Respondent solicited and promised to satisfy employees\u2019 grievances, promised and subsequently granted retroactively raises to almost all employees, and conducted an unlawful poll. We find that this campaign of serious and extensive unfair labor practices had the tendency to undermine the Union\u2019s majority strength and impede the election process. In this regard, we agree with the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s findings that in 1 week the Union\u2019s support in the plant had been obliterated and that the result of the May 31 poll more reliably reflected the success of Respondent\u2019s unfair labor practices than the employees\u2019 uncoerced desires. We further find that the possibility of erasing the effects of Respondent\u2019s unfair labor practices and of ensuring a fair election by the use of traditional remedies is slight. Therefore, for all the above reasons, we conclude that the employees\u2019 sentiment, once expressed through authorization cards, would, on balance, be better protected by our issuance of a bargaining order than by traditional remedies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">242 NLRB at 494. This statement of reasons for the original entry of a bargaining order fully satisfies the requirements of intelligent judicial review and the legal standards for <em>Gissel II </em>bargaining orders articulated by this court. <em>NLRB v. Permanent Label Corp., </em>657 F.2d 512 (3d Cir.1981) <em>(in banc), cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 940, 102 S.Ct. 1432, 71 L.Ed.2d 651 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">In its supplemental decision following this court\u2019s r\u00e9mand order the Board considered whether evidence of employee turnover warrants modification of the original order and concluded that it did not. The Board reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">Respondent\u2019s unfair labor practices, as summarized in the Board\u2019s original Decision, included conduct which, in the Board\u2019s experience, tends to have a continuing effect on employee freedom of choice long after the conduct has ended. Thus, upon learning through an unlawful solicitation of grievances that its failure to give pay raises was a major source of employee discontent, Respondent promptly raised the pay of virtually every unit employee. Such an unprecedented pay raise in the midst of a union campaign has been found to be particularly coercive because it eliminates \u201cthe very reason for a union\u2019s existence.\u201d That effect was further heightened in this case because the pay raise followed \u2014 and rewarded\u2014 the employees\u2019 \u201cvote\u201d in an unlawful poll which revealed that Respondent\u2019s unlawful campaign had been so successful that not one employee indicated support for the Union. Thus, the lesson to be learned by Respondent\u2019s employees was that the rejection of a union was the means by which to assure the receipt of improved wages and benefits. A corollary to this lesson, which has been recognized by the Board and courts, is that the employees\u2019 departure from this preferred antiunion stance may result in the withholding of benefits in the future.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Such a lesson, once learned, is not forgotten quickly but continues to exert a restraining influence on employee free choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">Nothing in the evidence presented by Respondent indicates that the employee turnover since the election has vitiated the effect of these unfair labor practices. Thus, nearly half of the current employees were employed while Respondent was engaged in its campaign of surveillance, interrogation, solicitation, and the implied promise to remedy grievances, and the actual grant of benefits as a reward for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>their rejection of the Union. Further, all 14 of the current unit employees who were in Respondent\u2019s employ at the time of the unfair labor practices received the pay raise which we have found to be unlawful. Thus, a substantial portion of the current employee complement was not only in a position to be aware of Respondent\u2019s unlawful actions, but, in fact, was subjected to such unlawful conduct. Finally, Respondent\u2019s conduct remains unremedied and at no time has Respondent given assurances to its employees that such conduct will not recur.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">We further find that the passage of time from the date of Respondent\u2019s unlawful conduct has not rendered a bargaining order inappropriate. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Respondent is correct in alleging that a majority of its employees no longer supports the Union, any current expression of employee sentiment is necessarily tainted by the lingering effect of Respondent\u2019s unfair labor practices. In any event, the Board and courts have long held that a union\u2019s loss of majority status following the commission of unfair labor practices by an employer sufficient to warrant the issuance of a bargaining order does not require a change in the Board\u2019s remedial order, for \u201ca requirement that union membership be kept intact during delays incident to hearings would result in permitting employers to profit from their own wrongful refusal to bargain.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The delay in the Board\u2019s issuance of its Decision and in seeking enforcement of its Order in this case, while regrettable, does not alter our conclusion in this regard. Such delay has in no way diminished the coercive effect of Respondent\u2019s serious and extensive unfair labor practices.

Judge Weis\u2019 dissent raises a substantial point as to the validity of the authorization cards used in this proceeding. If this were a case of first impression, I might well have agreed with him. His position, as I understand it, is that a card <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>should not be counted for purposes of a bargaining order when there is no evidence that an employee has read the union card before signing it, and there is evidence that a union agent in obtaining the signature on the card represented only that the card would be used for an election. There is much to commend such a position, since the NLRA itself admonishes us to take steps to protect the right of each employee to vote for or against union affiliation. However, after carefully reviewing the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), I am persuaded that that decision compels the conclusion that a card under these circumstances must be considered valid for determining union representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">In <em>Gissel, </em>the Court held-that \u201cemployees should be bound by the clear language of what they sign unless that language is deliberately and clearly canceled by a union adherent with words calculated to direct the signer to disregard and forget the language above his signature.\u201d 395 U.S. at 606, 89 S.Ct. at 1936. Inasmuch as the Court in <em>Gissel </em>sustained the use of authorization cards where some of the employees had been told, as they were in the present case, \u201cthat the card would be used to get an election\u201d (395 U.S. at 584 n. 5, 89 S.Ct. at 1925 n. 5), it must have concluded that such a statement alone did not rise to the level of misrepresentation necessary to cause the employees to ignore the card\u2019s printed text. Nothing in the facts of the proceeding before us today would indicate that the union representative\u2019s conduct here converted his statement to \u201cwords calculated to direct the signer to disregard and forget the language above his signature.\u201d Accordingly, I join the majority in upholding the validity of these cards.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b362-5\">BECKER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AEX\">joins in this concurrence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b362-6\">WEIS, Circuit Judge, dissenting, with whom JAMES HUNTER, III and GARTH, Circuit Judges, join.</judges>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The stated policy of the National Labor Relations Act is to protect \u201cthe exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151. That freedom is best assured by secret elections, which the Board concedes is the preferable method for selecting a collective bargaining representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">In the few instances where a fair election cannot be held, an alternative, albeit less reliable, means of ascertaining the employees\u2019 choice of a bargaining representative is through union authorization cards. We have cautioned, however, that \u201c[fjreedom of association and free selection of a bargaining agent ... may be substantially diminished by dependence on authorization cards.\u201d <em>NLRB v. K &amp; K Gourmet Meats, </em>640 F.2d 460, 469 n. 4 (3d Cir.1981). The case at hand illustrates these dangers. The Board, in issuing the bargaining order, improperly relied on several authorization cards for its conclusion that the union had established majority support. The Board compounded this error by its failure to adequately examine the effect of employee turnover in the bargaining unit, as directed by this court in an earlier remand. For these two reasons, I dissent from the enforcement of the bargaining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">As the excerpts from the hearing quoted in the majority opinion demonstrate, a number of employees who signed authorization cards were told that the purpose of the card was to get an election in order to negotiate a contract. Majority Op. at 262. Of these employees, the AU found that there was no showing that Mays, Kline, and Geyer read the cards before signing them. He noted that the union organizer\u2019s representation as to the purpose of the cards differed from the language printed on them, and that no other evidence was produced indicating that the signatures were meant to designate the union as bargaining representative. Accordingly, the ALJ held that \u201c[t]he burden being on the General Counsel to establish that the Union represented a majority, an absence of proof that, in such circumstances, the employee read the card, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>precludes a finding that the card constitutes a designation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">In reversing the ALJ, the Board found that the organizer\u2019s statements were not inconsistent with the unambiguous language on the cards. It further found that \u201cnothing in the circumstances surrounding the solicitation of the cards\u201d indicated that the organizer \u201cdeliberately and clearly directed these employees to disregard the language on the cards, or otherwise assured them that their cards would be used for no purpose other than to get an election.\u201d The Board did not comment on the burden of General Counsel to establish a union majority as a prerequisite for a bargaining order and commented only that , he had \u201cestablished, through Murray\u2019s testimony and the unambiguous language on the face of the authorization cards, the <em>prima facie </em>validity of the cards signed by Mays, Kline and Geyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The Board\u2019s conclusion that there was no inconsistency between the cards and the representations made by the union organizer is puzzling, to say the least. Its determination that General Counsel established a <em>prima facie </em>case of the cards\u2019 validity is, at best, incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">In <em>NLRB v. Gissel, </em>395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), the Supreme Court warned that misrepresentation in the solicitation of authorization cards was an abuse to which the Board must be alert. The Court approved the Board\u2019s <em>Cumberland </em>rule that a card is valid \u201cunless it is proved that the employee was told that the card was to be used <em>solely </em>for the purpose of obtaining an election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584, 89 S.Ct. at 1924 (emphasis in original). The Court also quoted with approval the Board\u2019s later explanation of the <em>Cumberland </em>doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">\u201cThe Board looks to substance rather than form. It is not the use or nonuse of certain key or \u2018magic\u2019 words that is controlling, but whether or not the totality of the circumstances surrounding the card solicitation is such, as to add up to an assurance to the card signer that his card will be used for no purpose other than to help get an election.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">395 U.S. at 608 n. 27, 89 S.Ct. at 1937 n. 27, <em>quoting Levi Strauss &amp; Co., </em>172 N.L.R.B. 732, 733 n. 7 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">The Court cautioned against a \u201ctoo easy mechanical application of the <em>Cumberland </em>rule,\u201d 395 U.S. at 608, 89 S.Ct. at 1937, and stated that \u201cthe trial examiner\u2019s findings in <em>General Steel ... </em>represent the limits of the <em>Cumberland </em>rule\u2019s application. We emphasize that the Board should be careful to guard against an approach any more rigid than that in <em>General Steel.\u201d Id. </em>at 608-609, 89 S.Ct. at 1937.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">In <em>General Steel </em>the trial examiner found authorization cards valid even though statements at odds with the unambiguous language of the card were made by a union representative. Among the findings made by the trial examiner were these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-14\">\u201cAll of these cards were <em>read by or to each signer </em>thereof.... [Consideration of all the testimony pertaining to the circumstances under which the signatures were obtained convinces me that ... all these employees not only intended, but were <em>fully aware </em>that they were thereby designating the union as their representative.\u201d \\</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-15\"><em>General Steel Products, Inc., </em>157 N.L.R.B. 636, 645 (1966) (emphasis added). Thus, even though there was a variation between what appeared on the printed card and what the employees were told, the trial examiner had an evidentiary basis for finding that they were aware of these differences and chose nevertheless to sign the authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-16\">No such evidence is present in this case. The ALJ who heard and saw the witnesses found specifically that there was \u201cno showing that the card signers read the card.... [T]he evidence in those instances shows only that the employee signed a card on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>representation that its purpose was to secure an election.\u201d Those conclusions are compelled by any fair reading of the record. The statement that signing the card would serve to bring an election into the plant cannot be read as anything other than inconsistent with the wording on the cards which designated the union as the bargaining representative and said nothing about an election. Surely, it is obvious that designating a particular union to act as one\u2019s representative is far different from expressing a desire for an election to deter-' mine whether a particular union is to be selected. <em>See Burlington Industries, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>680 F.2d 974, 976 (4th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">In its decision here, the Board recognized that \u201c[o]ne factor ... in the \u2018totality of circumstances\u2019 is whether the employees read the cards.\u201d Even though the Board agreed that there was no evidence that the employees read the three cards, it nevertheless concluded that they were valid designations. In reaching this conclusion, the Board, in its rush to impose a bargaining order, has stretched its policy of crediting authorization cards beyond the limits which the Supreme Court drew in <em>Gissel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Unlike other forms of agreements recognized by the law, a variance between oral representations of a solicitor and the text of a union authorization card does not necessarily invalidate the card\u2019s printed terms. As noted earlier, <em>Gissel </em>found an authorization card valid even though the solicitor stated it would be used to get an election. The Court\u2019s rationale was that \u201cemployees should be bound by the clear language of what they sign unless that language is deliberately and clearly canceled by the union adherent with words calculated to direct the signer to disregard and forget the language above the signature.\u201d 395 U.S. at 606, 89 S.Ct. at 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">This oft quoted statement of the Court points up two pertinent factors passed over by the Board. First, oral representations can vitiate the language of a card. Accordingly, the mere act of signing is not conclusive, and on a proper evidentiary record, viewed under the totality of the circumstances, a card may be declared invalid. Second, if a card may be nullified because an oral representation induced the employee to disregard the printed language, then it follows that the signer must, in the first instance, have knowledge of the text. An instruction to disregard the wording on a card can have significance only if the employee has read it.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">If a person, of his own accord and uninfluenced by misrepresentation, chooses not to read a card before signing it, then the misrepresentation would be irrelevant. If, however, a person decides not to read a card on the basis of what he is told, then the text does not express the signer\u2019s intent. <em>See Gissel, </em>395 U.S. at 607, 89 S.Ct. at 1936 (employees are sufficiently sophisticated to be bound by what they sign <em>unless </em>expressly told act of signing represents something else). Rather, the signature represents agreement with the representations of the solicitor. Such an analysis explores the subjective motivations of the signer no more than the inquiry whether the magic words \u201csolely\u201d or \u201conly\u201d affected the signer\u2019s decision, and thus does not offend <em>Gissel\u2019s </em>admonition against probing an employee\u2019s intent. <em>See id. </em>at 608, 89 S.Ct. at 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">The <em>General Steel </em>rationale leads to the conclusion that in choosing to sign a card notwithstanding misrepresentations by the solicitor, the employee indicates his willingness to abide by the text. Where, as here, no evidence demonstrates that the signer knew what was printed above his name, then there is no basis for assuming that he was agreeable to the card\u2019s terms. In the absence of any other explanation, one must conclude, as did the AU, that the signatures were obtained <em>solely </em>on the misrepresentation that the card would be used to get an election. Based on undisputed evidence, the record therefore satisfied the <em>Cumberland </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">Although General Counsel has the burden of establishing the fact of a union majority, the Board did not squarely confront this problem. It skirted the issue by stating that General Counsel had made a <em>\u201cprima facie </em>[showing of] validity\u201d through the tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>timony of the union solicitor and the language of the cards. I will not dispute here the majority\u2019s statement that in the usual case, General Counsel, in order to meet the burden, \u201cneed do no more than produce duly authenticated cards [unequivocally] authorizing collective bargaining.\u201d Majority Op. at 261. The employer is then free to attack the validity of the authorization. However, General Counsel did not follow that procedure here.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">As part of his case, General Counsel produced the union organizer who testified not only that the three employees signed the cards but that he made statements to them which the ALJ found inconsistent with the text. General Counsel, therefore, went beyond proof of authenticity. His witness established a variance between what was printed and what was represented, and had therefore placed the validity of the cards into contention at this stage of the proceeding. Having presented the ambiguity as part of his case, General Counsel could not rely on the mere showing of authenticity to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case. Nor could the Board ignore the totality of the evidence in evaluating whether General Counsel had met his burden of establishing a union majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Under the <em>General Steel </em>rationale, General Counsel could have proved his case by further testimony that the three employees had read the cards. If so, there would be evidence that, despite the inconsistency in the organizer\u2019s statements, the employees chose to be bound by the language of the card. Absent such testimony, however, all that the record shows is that the employees signed the cards in the belief that their action could result in an election. That clearly is not proof of consent to union representation. <em>See NLRB v. South Bay Daily Breeze, </em>415 F.2d 360, 366-67 (9th Cir.1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 915, 90 S.Ct. 919, 25 L.Ed.2d 96 (1970); <em>L.C. Cassidy &amp; Son, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>415 F.2d 1358, 1363-64 (7th Cir.1969). Nor is it the substantial evidence that the Board must have to sustain its decision in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The Board\u2019s conclusion that the evidence demonstrates a union majority is difficult to reconcile with its insistence upon \u201claboratory conditions\u201d to insure freedom of choice when holding secret elections. The card process, with such admitted shortcomings as overt peer pressure, and frequent misrepresentations or misunderstandings, should require even more demanding standards than those governing elections. The Board prohibits electioneering near the polls so that employees may vote without being subjected to last minute importuning. <em>See Season-All Industries, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>654 F.2d 932, 936-37 (3d Cir.1981). Yet it does not hesitate to count as a \u201cvote\u201d a card secured by statements that distort the meaning of what the employee is signing.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The Board\u2019s standards are the reverse of what they should be. Proof of a majority manifested by cards should whenever possible be established by evidence at least as convincing as that demonstrated by a secret election. There were no obstacles to such proof here. It is the facts that should preclude the result reached by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">The Board\u2019s failure to adequately address the effect of changes in the bargaining unit also calls into question the propriety of enforcing the bargaining order. Soon after the appeal was filed in this court in 1980, the employer moved to remand the case to the Board to adduce additional evidence. Attached to the motion was an affidavit demonstrating that significant changes in the bargaining unit had occurred in the three-year period following the May 1977 unlawful practices. The unit had grown from 29 to 33 persons, only 14 of whom were employed in May 1977. Of the 14, only 7 had signed union authorization cards. If the bargaining order had been enforced in 1980, only 7 of the 33 members of the bargaining unit would have been signatories to authorization cards. Of those seven, one is a signatory to a card I would find invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">The motion for remand was granted, and the Board again considered the matter. It decided to forego a hearing and accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>the affidavit as correct. Nevertheless, the Board declined to alter its bargaining order, remarking that \u201cnearly half\u201d of the current employees were with the company during the occurrence of the unfair labor practices, including the 1977 pay raise which the Board found to be unlawful. The Board added, \u201cRespondent\u2019s conduct remains unremedied and at no time has Respondent given assurances that such conduct will not recur.\u201d The Board also determined that \u201cneither the passage of time nor employee turnover in the bargaining unit has dissipated the impact of Respondent\u2019s unfair labor practices, and therefore the possibility of erasing the effect of Respondent\u2019s unfair labor practices and of ensuring a fair election through the use of traditional remedies remain slight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Since the Board refused to have a hearing which would form a basis for such findings, the only evidence in the record on which to justify them is the employer\u2019s affidavit. But no ground for its conclusions exists in that document. The Board\u2019s statements are simply conclusions without any supporting basis. There is not one scrap of evidence to support the assertion that a fair election could not have been held in 1980, or that an appropriate cease and desist order would not have been effective in preventing any interference with laboratory conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Under analogous circumstances, Judge Frank commented in a dissenting opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnV\">Reversed [on the previous appeal, the Interstate Commerce Commission] comes back to us with a report manifesting no real regard for our criticism. The Commission\u2019s position now is that we must be satisfied if only it recites a formal abracadabra to which it has added a few words as a sop to us.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> That position I think should not satisfy this court \u2014 not at all because I consider judges inherently better than Commissioners, for I certainly do not, but because Commissioners, like judges, owe an obligation to do their job, as prescribed by statute, in a manner, which, within practical limits, publicizes the rational bases of their performance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-7\"><em>Old Colony Bondholders v.

New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad Co., </em>331 U.S. 858, 67 S.Ct. 1754, 91 L.Ed. 1865 (1947) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">The Board\u2019s action on remand was not an adequate compliance with the order issued by this court, <em>see NLRB v. American Cable Systems, Inc., </em>427 F.2d 446, 448-49 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 957, 91 S.Ct. 356, 27 L.Ed.2d 266 (1970), and its bargaining order is a denial of the rights granted to the employees by the National Labor Relations Act. The Board\u2019s desire to punish the employer has once again resulted in greater harm to the employees, the intended beneficiaries of the Act. <em>See Electrical Products Division of Midland-Ross Co. v.
