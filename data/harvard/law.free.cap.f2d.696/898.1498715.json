In 1980, the County Clerk suspended her for three days and reassigned her to the position of Account Clerk, a demotion. Estes employed an attorney and challenged this action before the Tuscaloosa County Civil Service Board, as she was entitled to do under Alabama law. The Board reversed the decision of the Clerk, and ordered Estes reinstated as Deputy Clerk with full benefits restored. Thereafter, Estes brought this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988, claiming, among other things, that she was entitled to recover fees for the services of her attorney in the administrative proceedings before Tuscaloosa County Civil Service Board. The district court entered summary judgment against Estes, concluding that she failed to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>out a claim under section 1983, and she took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">The sole question we must decide is whether section 1988 gives a cause of action in federal court to one, such as Estes, who has \u201cprevailed,\u201d and has been made whole, in state administrative proceedings but who cannot establish a claim for relief, for violation of constitutional rights, under section 1983. We hold that it does not, for the reasons stated by the district court in its dispositive memorandum opinion, Record, vol. 1 at 86, set out in the appendix and therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">\n<em>Memorandum of Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">Plaintiff brought this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988, alleging a violation of due process rights in connection with plaintiff\u2019s employment, and seeking attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in this action and in a state administrative proceeding. This cause is now before the court on defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and plaintiff\u2019s cross-motion for partial summary judgment. Based on the undisputed material facts recited below, the court concludes that defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">In April, 1980, plaintiff was removed from her position as Deputy Clerk in the Tuscaloosa County Clerk\u2019s Office by her supervisor Robert Johnston, County Clerk of Tuscaloosa County, who informed plaintiff that she would be suspended for three days and reassigned to the position of Account Clerk. Under Alabama Act. No. 357 (Regular Session, 1949), civil service employees of Tuscaloosa County may be removed or demoted only for cause, and, if a demotion is appealed to the County Board, the demotion becomes final only after a hearing. Plaintiff challenged Johnston\u2019s actions, and a hearing was held before the Tuscaloosa County Civil Service Board, at which both plaintiff and Mr. Johnston were represented by counsel. The Board issued a written decision on July 9, 1981, finding that Mr. Johnston\u2019s charges were unsupported by substantial evidence and that the actions taken against plaintiff were unwarranted and in excess of Mr. Johnston\u2019s authority as a County Department Head. The Board ordered plaintiff reinstated as Deputy County Clerk with full benefits restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">In the present action, plaintiff complains of the county commission\u2019s failure to expunge information concerning this incident from plaintiff\u2019s personnel file, its failure to grant a salary increase that had been given to deputy clerks in certain other county departments, and its failure to pay attorney\u2019s fees for plaintiff\u2019s representation during the administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">It is well established that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process protection of property interests extends to a public employee\u2019s legitimate expectations of continued employment. <em>Arnett v. Kennedy, </em>416 U.S. 134 [94 S.Ct. 1633, 40 L.Ed.2d 15] (1974). However, not all employment related grievances by public employees rise to the level of constitutional claims. In order to invoke due process guarantees, there must be a constitutionally protected property or liberty interest at stake. In the present case, plaintiff has received the process due to safeguard her employment interests, and her remaining complaints do not implicate a property or liberty entitlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-12\">Plaintiff\u2019s request that her personnel file be expunged of derogatory material cannot form the basis of a \u00a7 1983 action under the circumstances of this case. It is clear that no action lies under \u00a7 1983 for mere damage to reputation. <em>Bradford v. Bronner, </em>665 F.2d 680 (5th Cir.1982). A liberty interest is infringed only when the government\u2019s untrue charges might seriously damage a person\u2019s standing and associations in the community or when such charges impair some other protected interest such as employment or first amendment rights. <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1975). While the charges against plaintiff involved her employment interests, any infringement on plaintiff\u2019s property or liberty interests was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>remedied by the administrative hearing before the county board, as a result of which plaintiff was reinstated to her position as Deputy County Clerk and exonerated of all charges against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">Moreover, plaintiff\u2019s claim to a pay raise does not indicate an entitlement sufficient to constitute a property interest. By a resolution adopted February 27, 1980 and made effective March 6,1980, the county commission upgraded the salaries of the deputy clerks in the license commissioner\u2019s office, the tax collector\u2019s office, and the probate office to equal the salary of the deputy clerk in the tax assessor\u2019s office. The resolution stated expressly that the adjustment did not affect the salary of the deputy clerk in plaintiff\u2019s office. Any assertion that the denial of a raise was a failure to implement the board\u2019s order to reinstate plaintiff with full benefits must fail, for this order would restore the salary established for plaintiff\u2019s position, not grant additional benefits. There is no indication of any statute, rule, or understanding upon which plaintiff could rely for a legitimate claim of entitlement to a pay raise or the equalization of salaries for deputy clerks in all offices. Without such an entitlement, there is no constitutionally protected property interest to serve as the basis of a due process claim. See <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564 [92 S.Ct. 2701, 38 L.Ed.2d 548] (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">Finally, plaintiff asserts that, since she prevailed in a state administrative proceeding to protect her property interest in employment, \u00a7 1988 authorizes an award of attorney\u2019s fees for representation in that proceeding. The court finds plaintiff\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees to be without merit. Section 1988 authorizes attorney\u2019s fees as part of a remedy for violations of civil rights statutes; it does not create an independent right of action. See <em>Derheim v. Hennepin County, </em>524 F.Supp. 1321 (D.Minn.1981). Nor does \u00a7 1988 operate to make an award of attorney\u2019s fees an essential ingredient in providing \u201cdue process.\u201d In the present case, the plaintiff, having been accorded due process by the administrative proceeding, and having no independent claim under \u00a7 1983, is not entitled to an award of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">Plaintiff having failed to state a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988, defendant is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. An order consistent with this Memorandum shall be entered separately.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
