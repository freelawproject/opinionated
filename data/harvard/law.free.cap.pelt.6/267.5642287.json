You stated you employed Mr. Moses from July, 1930 to July 1931?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyF\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\">Q.

'A, Because he would take it forgrsnted that the hooks were alright; he was to render me a certified statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">We gather from the entire record and from the testimony in this case that plaintiff did all that he wes required to do, all that he had agreed to do, end subsequently under prepared his agreement with the defendants,/*Haxsxia the return for the United States Government for income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-15\">The Judge of the lower court hesrd and saw the witnesses, noted their demeanor on the stand, therefore had a bette'r opportunity to judge of the truthfulness than we have. He rendered judgment in fe.vor of plaintiff and we are satisfied this is correct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>For the. re- 30ns assigned, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the judgment of the Court aquo be and the same is hereby affirmed, costa of both Courts to be paid by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-2\">-Judgment affirmed-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
