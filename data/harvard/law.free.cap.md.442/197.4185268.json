Marcalus (\u201cMarcalus\u201d), Respondent, a member of the Bar of Maryland, texted Lindsay Dudley (\u201cDudley\u201d) \u2014 a self-represented party in litigation in which Marcalus represented the opposing party \u2014 to, among other things, request a photograph of Dudley in a bathing suit; discuss whether Dudley would be willing to use \u201ctoys\u201d with a \u201csugar daddy\u201d; and state that he \u201cusually wake[s] up with\u201d an erection. Alter Dudley engaged counsel, her attorney filed a complaint against Marcalus with the Attorney Grievance Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">On November 15, 2013, on the Commission\u2019s behalf, Bar Counsel filed in this Court a \u201cPetition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d against Marcalus, charging him with violating Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) 1.7 (Conflict of Interest: General Rule), 4.2 (Communication with Person Represented by Counsel), 4.3 (Dealing with Unrepresented Person), 8.4(b) (Criminal Act), and 8.4(d) (Conduct that is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">On November 20, 2013, this Court designated the Honorable Paul F. Harris, Jr. (\u201cthe hearing judge\u201d) of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County to hear this attorney discipline proceeding. On April 24 and 25, 2014, the hearing judge conducted an evidentiary hearing. On July 22, 2014, the hearing judge filed in this Court an opinion including findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>of fact and conclusions of law, concluding that Marcalus had violated MLRPC 8.4(d), but had not violated MLRPC 1.7(a)(2), 4.2(a), 4.3, or 8.4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">On February 5, 2015, we heard oral argument, and, immediately afterward, disbarred Marcalus. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Marcalus, </em>441 Md. 619, 109 A.3d 131 (2015) (per curiam). We now explain the reasons for Marcalus\u2019s disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The hearing judge found the following facts, which we summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">In December 1993, this Court admitted Marcalus to the Bar of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">In 2012, Kendall Minchin (\u201cMinchin\u201d) retained Marcalus to represent him in a custody modification action in which the other party was Dudley, the mother of Minchin\u2019s child. Initially, Dudley represented herself; thus, Dudley and Marcalus exchanged telephone numbers and e-mail addresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">Marcalus scheduled a deposition of Dudley for November 14, 2012. On November 13, 2012, Marcalus texted Dudley to confirm that her deposition would occur the next day. Dudley texted Marcalus to respond in the affirmative. Afterward, Marcalus texted Dudley to ask whether she knew anyone who did modeling or promotional work. Soon thereafter, Marcalus texted Dudley to apologize and state that his text about modeling or promotional work was meant for a client, not Dudley.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">On November 14, 2012, Marcalus deposed Dudley. Afterward, Marcalus asked whether Dudley would consider moving to the school district in which Minchin lived. Dudley responded that she could not afford to live in the school district in which Minchin lived, and joked that she would need a \u201csugar daddy\u201d to do so. Later that day, Marcalus texted Dudley to state that he would \u201clet [her] know if [he] c[ould] think of a s d [sic] for\u201d her.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>On November 28, 2012,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dudley texted Marcalus to ask: \u201c[W]hat type of promotional work was your client lo[o]king for[?]\u201d Marcalus and Dudley texted each other to arrange for Dudley to come to Marcalus\u2019s office to discuss the modeling or promotional work. On that day, Dudley came to Marcalus\u2019s office, where Marcalus told Dudley that she would need to bring bathing suits, high heels, and a lingerie-like short dress to the modeling or promotional work. Dudley left Marcalus\u2019s office, and Marcalus texted Dudley to ask: \u201c[I]s it possible to e[-]mail a pic or two[?]\u201d Dudley texted Marcalus to ask: \u201cYes[. W]hat kind of photos? Anything!?]\u201d Marcalus texted Dudley to respond: \u201c[W]ell maybe one in a suit you mentioned!. A]nd we forgot to talk about the other thing.\u201d Marcalus and Dudley texted each other to arrange a meeting the next day to discuss a \u201csugar daddy\u201d for Dudley. Marcalus texted Dudley to offer to give her cash \u201cto buy some things!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">On November 29, 2012, Marcalus texted Dudley to arrange a meeting that day, to remind Dudley to bring the \u201coutfit\u201d so that Marcalus could see it, and to revisit the possibility that Dudley e-mail photographs of herself to Marcalus. On that day, Marcalus and Dudley met at a restaurant, got into Marcalus\u2019s car, and went to a beach, where Dudley showed Marcalus outfits that she had brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">On November 80, 2012, Marcalus and Dudley texted each other to discuss what Dudley would be willing to do with the \u201csugar daddy\u201d and whether Dudley would be willing to use \u201ctoys\u201d with the \u201csugar daddy.\u201d Marcalus and Dudley seemingly joked about Marcalus\u2019s waking up with an erection.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On that day, during a telephone conversation, Marcalus told Dudley that the \u201csugar daddy\u201d would pay her to watch her masturbate.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Marcalus showed remorse for his conduct. At the evidentiary hearing, both Marcalus and Dudley testified that their statements to each other were a \u201cjoke.\u201d Marcalus engaged in a deceptive practice during this attorney discipline proceeding, as, in his letter to the Commission responding to the complaint against him, Marcalus failed to state that his statements to Dudley were a \u201cjoke.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In an attorney discipline proceeding, this Court reviews for clear error a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, and reviews without deference a hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16-759(b)(2)(B) (\u201cThe Court [of Appeals] shall give due regard to the opportunity of the hearing judge to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McDowell, </em>439 Md. 26, 35, 93 A.3d 711, 716 (2014) (\u201c[T]his Court reviews for clear error a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact[.]\u201d (Citations omitted)); Md. R. 16-759(b)(l) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals shall review de novo the [hearing] judge\u2019s conclusions of law.\u201d). This Court determines whether clear and convincing evidence establishes that a lawyer violated the MLRPC. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16-757(b) (\u201cThe [Commission] has the burden of proving the averments of the petition [for disciplinary or remedial action] by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A2mB\">(A) Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">The Commission did not except to any of the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact. Marcalus excepted to: (1) the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Marcalus \u201craised the prospect of Dudley masturbating for [the] \u2018sugar daddy\u2019 in exchange for\u201d money; (2) the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Marcalus engaged in a deceptive practice during this attorney discipline proceeding; and (3) the hearing judge\u2019s refraining from finding that Marcalus lacked a selfish motive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>We need not, and do not, rule on Marcalus\u2019s first exception, which is based on Marcalus\u2019s allegation that Dudley volunteered that she would be willing to masturbate in front of the \u201csugar daddy\u201d in exchange for money; <em>i.e., </em>that Dudley raised the matter first. Even if Marcalus\u2019s allegation is true, the hearing judge found (and Marcalus does not dispute) that Marcalus told Dudley that the \u201csugar daddy\u201d would pay Dudley to watch her masturbate. This is the culmination of Marcalus\u2019s misconduct as to the \u201csugar daddy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">We overrule Marcalus\u2019s second exception, which is based on Marcalus\u2019s allegation that the text messages that were admitted as evidence at the hearing made it \u201cevident\u201d that his statements to Dudley were a \u201cjoke.\u201d Even if Marcalus\u2019s allegation is true, the hearing judge found (and Marcalus expressly concedes) that, in his letter to the Commission responding to the complaint against him, Marcalus failed to assert that his statements to Dudley were a \u201cjoke.\u201d In his letter to the Commission, Marcalus indicated that he \u201cdid have a single friend [who] may [have] be[en] interested in meeting\u201d Dudley, and that \u201cwhatever the two of them did was between the two of them.\u201d In other words, in his letter, Marcalus represented that he was acting as a liaison between Dudley and a friend who could become Dudley\u2019s \u201csugar daddy.\u201d Ostensibly, Marcalus represented the same to the Commission to implicitly deny that he himself had ever contemplated becoming Dudley\u2019s \u201csugar daddy.\u201d In any event, for whatever reason, in his letter to the Commission, Marcalus conveyed that there was an actual potential \u201csugar daddy.\u201d Marcalus\u2019s representation in his letter to the Commission is inconsistent with Marcalus\u2019s testimony at the hearing that his statements to Dudley were a <em>\u201cjoke\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., there had never been an actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>potential \u201csugar daddy,\u201d Marcalus himself or otherwise. Thus, the hearing judge did not clearly err in finding that Marcalus had been deceptive by not alleging in his letter to the Commission responding to the complaint against him that his statements to Dudley were a \u201cjoke.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">We overrule Marcalus\u2019s third exception, which is based on Marcalus pointing out that: (1) the Commission did not offer any evidence that Marcalus had a selfish motive; and (2) both Marcalus and Dudley testified that their statements to each other were a \u201cjoke.\u201d \u201cA respondent who asserts ... a matter of mitigation ... has the burden of proving the ... matter by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Md. R. 16-757(b). In other words, a lack of evidence of a selfish motive does not compel a fact-finder to declare a lack of a selfish motive. That Marcalus and Dudley testified that their statements to each other were a \u201cjoke\u201d does not shed any light on Marcalus\u2019s motive for making his statements, much less whether his motive was selfish. Thus, the hearing judge did not clearly err in refraining from finding that Marcalus lacked a selfish motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">(B) Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Marcalus excepted to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he violated MLRPC 8.4(d) (Conduct that is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice). For the below reasons, we overrule Marcalus\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The Commission excepted to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Marcalus did not violate MLRPC 1.7(a)(2) (Conflict of Interest: General Rule); however, the Commission recommended that we disbar Marcalus even if we concluded that Marcalus violated only MLRPC 8.4(d). As discussed below, we agreed with the Commission that disbarment was the appropriate sanction for Marcalus\u2019s misconduct based only on Marcalus\u2019s violation of MLRPC 8.4(d); thus, we need not, and do not, determine whether Marcalus violated any other MLRPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>MLRPC 8.4(d) (Conduct that is Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice[.]\u201d MLRPC 8.4(d). \u201cGenerally, a lawyer violates MLRPC 8.4(d) where the lawyer\u2019s conduct negatively impacts the public\u2019s perception of the legal profession.\u201d <em>McDowell, </em>439 Md. at 39, 93 A.3d at 719 (citation, ellipses, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">In determining whether a lawyer violated MLRPC 8.4(d) by engaging in conduct that negatively impacted the public\u2019s perception of the legal profession, \u201cthis Court applie[s] the \u2018objective\u2019 standard of whether\u201d the lawyer\u2019s conduct would negatively impact the perception of the legal profession of \u201ca reasonable member of the public ..., not the subjective standard of whether the lawyer\u2019s conduct actually impacted the public and/or a particular person <em>(e.g., </em>a complainant) who is involved with the attorney discipline proceeding.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Carl Stephen Basinger, </em>441 Md. 703, 716, 109 A.3d 1165 (2015) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Saridakis, </em>402 Md. 413, 430 n. 10, 430, 936 A.2d 886, 896 n. 10, 896 (2007)) (some brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Marcalus violated MLRPC 8.4(d). At all relevant times, Dudley was a self-represented party in litigation in which Marcalus represented the opposing party. Whether mistakenly or not, Marcalus texted Dudley to ask whether she knew anyone who did modeling or promotional work. Later, Marcalus texted Dudley to state that he would \u201clet [her] know if [he] c[ould] think of a s[ugar] d[addy] for\u201d her. After Dudley expressed interest in the modeling or promotional work, Marcalus met with Dudley and told her that she would need to bring bathing suits, high heels, and a lingerie-like short dress to the modeling or promotional work. Later, Marcalus texted Dudley to request a photograph of Dudley in a bathing suit. Marcalus and Dudley texted each other to arrange a meeting to discuss a \u201csugar daddy\u201d for Dudley, and Marcalus texted Dudley to offer to give Dudley cash \u201cto buy some things[.]\u201d Still later, Marcalus and Dudley went to a beach, where Dudley showed Marcalus outfits that she had brought. Afterward, Marcalus and Dudley texted each other to discuss what Dudley would be willing to do with the \u201csugar daddy\u201d and whether Dudley would be willing to use \u201ctoys\u201d with the \u201csugar daddy.\u201d Marcalus texted Dudley to state that he \u201cusually wake[s] up with\u201d an erection. And, during a telephone conversation, Marcalus told Dudley that the \u201csugar daddy\u201d would pay her to watch her masturbate.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">We are beyond satisfied that, even if Marcalus and Dudley engaged in consensual conduct and believed that their statements to each other were a \u201cjoke,\u201d given that Dudley was a self-represented party in litigation in which Marcalus represented the opposing party, Marcalus\u2019s \u201csexting\u201d and suggestive conduct would negatively impact the perception of the legal profession of \u201ca reasonable member of the public[J\u201d <em>Basinger, </em>109 Md. at 716, 109 A.3d 1165 (quoting <em>Saridakis, </em>402 Md. at 430, 936 A.2d at 896) (some brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). No reasonable member of the public would expect a lawyer to engage in \u201csexting\u201d and suggestive conduct with a self-represented party in litigation in which the lawyer represented the opposing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>We are unpersuaded by Marcalus\u2019s reliance on <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Link, </em>380 Md. 405, 429, 844 A.2d 1197, 1211-12 (2004), in which this Court stated that a lawyer violates MLRPC 8.4(d) through purely private <em>conduct </em>\u2014 ie,, conduct that is entirely unrelated to the practice of law \u2014 if and only if the lawyer\u2019s conduct \u201cis criminal or so egregious as to make the harm, or potential harm, flowing from it patent[.]\u201d <em>See also Basinger, </em>441 Md. at 718, 109 A.3d 1165 (\u201c[I]n <em>Link, </em>by \u2018private,\u2019 this Court meant \u2018unrelated to the practice of law.\u2019 \u201d). Dudley was a self-represented party in litigation in which Marcalus represented the opposing party. Thus, Marcalus\u2019s conduct was not entirely unrelated to the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">(C) Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The Commission recommended that we disbar Marcalus, who recommended that we dismiss this attorney discipline proceeding, or, alternatively, that we reprimand or suspend him.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In <em>McDowell, </em>439 Md. at 45-46, 93 A.3d at 722-23, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">This Court sanctions a lawyer not to punish the lawyer, but instead to protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession. This Court protects the public by: (1) deterring other lawyers from engaging in similar misconduct; and (2) suspending or disbarring a lawyer who is unfit to continue to practice law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">In determining an appropriate sanction for a lawyer\u2019s misconduct, this Court considers: (a) the duty violated; (b) the lawyer\u2019s mental state; (c) the potential or actual injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s misconduct; and (d) the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">Aggravating factors include: (a) prior attorney discipline; (b) a dishonest or selfish motive; (c) a pattern of misconduct; (d) multiple violations of the MLRPC; (e) bad faith obstruction of the attorney discipline proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with the Maryland Rules or orders of this Court; (f) submission of false evidence, false state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>ments, or other deceptive practices during the attorney discipline proceeding; (g) refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the misconduct; (h) vulnerability of the victim; (i) substantial experience in the practice of law; (j) indifference to making restitution; and (k) illegal conduct, including that involving the use of controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-4\">Mitigating factors include: (a) the absence of prior attorney discipline; (b) absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; (c) personal or emotional problems; (d) timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of the misconduct; (e) full and free disclosure to the Commission or a cooperative attitude toward the attorney discipline proceeding; (f) inexperience in the practice of law; (g) character or reputation; (h) physical disability; (i) a mental disability or chemical dependency including alcoholism or drug abuse where: (1) there is medical evidence that the lawyer is affected by a chemical dependency or mental disability; (2) the chemical dependency or mental disability caused the misconduct; (3) the lawyer\u2019s recovery from the chemical dependency or mental disability is demonstrated by a meaningful and sustained period of successful rehabilitation; and (4) the recovery arrested the misconduct and recurrence of the misconduct is unlikely; (j) delay in the attorney discipline proceeding; (k) the imposition of other penalties or sanctions; (l) remorse; and (m) remoteness of prior violations of the MLRPC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">(Brackets, citations, footnote, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">In addition to the above, likelihood of repetition of misconduct is an aggravating factor, and unlikelihood of repetition of misconduct is a mitigating factor. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

First, Marcalus has substantial experience in the practice of law, as he has been a member of the Bar of Maryland for more than twenty years. Second, Marcalus engaged in a deceptive practice during this attorney discipline proceeding, as, in his letter to the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>sion responding to the complaint against him, he claimed to be acting as a liaison between Dudley and an actual potential \u201csugar daddy\u201d and did not claim that his statements to Dudley were a \u201cjoke,\u201d as he later testified at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Even more importantly, third, fourth, and fifth, Marcalus has received prior attorney discipline; has demonstrated a pattern of misconduct; and has demonstrated that he is likely to repeat his misconduct. In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. </em>Marcalus, 401 Md. 496, 938 A.2d 382 (2007), this Court granted a joint petition and indefinitely suspended Marcalus from the practice of law in Maryland with the right to apply for reinstatement no sooner than thirty days afterward where, significantly, Marcalus engaged in the exact same type of misconduct that is at issue here: violating MLRPC 8.4(d) by engaging in \u201csexting.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Marcalus failed to cease violating MLRPC 8.4(d) by engaging in misconduct; less than three years later, in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Marcalus, </em>414 Md. 501, 526, 523, 521, 508, 996 A.2d 350, 364, 362, 361, 354 (2010), this Court suspended Marcalus from the practice of law in Maryland for sixty days for violating MLRPC 8.4(d) and 8.4(b) (Criminal Act) by giving a woman a painkiller in exchange for fellatio.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">We agreed with the Commission that disbarment is the appropriate sanction for Marcalus\u2019s misconduct. This is the third time that Marcalus has violated MLRPC 8.4(d) by engaging in misconduct in general, and this is the second time that Marcalus has violated MLRPC 8.4(d) by \u201csexting\u201d in particular. Either Marcalus fails to grasp that his misconduct is inconsistent with his professional obligations, or he does so grasp and chooses to disregard his professional obligations. In any event, Marcalus has demonstrated that he is extremely likely to repeat his misconduct, no matter how many times this Court suspends him from the practice of law in Maryland. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>protect the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession, our only remaining option is to disbar Marcalus so that, the next time he engages in misconduct, the same will not again negatively affect the public\u2019s perception of the legal profession. <em>Cf. Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kerpelman, </em>292 Md. 228, 244-45, 438 A.2d 501, 509-510 (1981) (\u201c[T]his is the second time [that Kerpelman] has been found guilty of professional misconduct. If we could conclude that this was a pattern of conduet[,] we would not hesitate to disbar.... Having agreed on suspension rather than disbarment as the proper sanction, we add that any similar misconduct proved against this attorney will reflect most adversely upon his fitness to practice law in this State.\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The only mitigating factor (remorse) falls woefully short of warranting a lesser sanction. Marcalus\u2019s remorse is too little, too late. Marcalus should have realized that his misconduct was wrongful before, not after, he engaged in it for the third time. Plainly put, in this instance, \u201cthree strikes and you\u2019re out.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-9\">. \u201cSexting\u201d is \u201cthe sending of sexually explicit messages ... by cell phone.\u201d Sexting, Merriam-Webster, http://www.merriam-webster.com/ dictionary/sexting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b231-10\">.

The Commission attached to its response to the motion to dismiss a notice from this Court's Clerk, which stated that any exceptions were to be filed by August 7, 2014. On that date, the Commission filed its exceptions and recommendation. We accept the Commission's filing. Thus, we deny the motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b237-7\">. Of course, a \u00a1awyer violates MLRPC 8.4(d) where the lawyer\u2019s conduct actually negatively impacts the public\u2019s perception of the legal profession. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Greenleaf, </em>438 Md. 151, 162 n. 12, 91 A.3d 1066, 1073 n. 12 (2014) (\"[T]he public has [] learned that, while the Chief Deputy Clerk of the Court of Special Appeals, Greenleaf engaged in egregious misconduct!.]\u201d); <em>McDowell, </em>439 Md. at 40, 93 A.3d at 720 (\u201cOnce it became public knowledge, the robo-signing ... prompted adverse media coverage!.]\u201d (Citing Attorney <em>Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Geesing, </em>436 Md. 56, 65, 80 A.3d 718, 723 (2013))). Plainly put, an actual negative impact on the public's perception of the legal profession is sufficient, but not necessary, to a conclusion that a lawyer violated MLRPC 8.4(d) by negatively impacting the public's perception of the legal profession. Thus, we are unpersuaded by Marcalus\u2019s reliance on the circumstance that there is no evidence that his conduct actually negatively impacted the public\u2019s perception of the legal profession.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b242-6\">.
