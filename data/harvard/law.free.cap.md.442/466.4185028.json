The insureds argue that the express terms of the insurance contract mandate that the insurance company pay them $300,000. The insurance company argues instead that its insureds are owed only $100,000. To settle this dispute, we are called upon to interpret the subject policy. In so doing, we conclude that the policy is not ambiguous. We agree with the insurance company that the terms of the policy mandate that the insureds are owed $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">I. Statement of Facts: The Accident</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">The facts are not in dispute. On 14 August 2009, Robert and Linda Connors (collectively, the \u201cConnors,\u201d the \u201cPlaintiffs,\u201d or the \u201cPetitioners\u201d), husband and wife, took an ill-fated stroll in their Waldorf neighborhood. A motor vehicle operated by Adam Pond (\u201cPond\u201d), while backing out of a residential driveway at 3269 Captain Dament Drive, struck the Connors. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Plaintiffs alleged, in their subsequent Complaint, that, as she was struck, Linda Connors hit the vehicle with her hand and screamed, causing it to come to a stop. Pond saw allegedly Linda screaming on the ground and nonetheless resumed moving the vehicle again, backing over Robert Connors, as he attempted to flee the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Both of the Connors sustained injuries. Robert sustained serious injuries to his head, including a traumatic brain injury, as well as injuries to his neck, body, and limbs. He was taken to Holy Cross Hospital for treatment of his injuries and transferred later to the Crofton Rehabilitation Center, where he died on 31 January 2011.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Linda sustained injuries to her neck, back, leg, and arm, and also claimed emotional injuries incurred as a result of watching her husband being run-over.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">At the time of the accident, the Connors together owned a vehicle insured by Government Employees Insurance Co. (\u201cGEICO\u201d) under a Maryland Family Automobile insurance Policy numbered 0377-86-55-06 (the \u201cGEICO policy\u201d or the \u201cpolicy\u201d). GEICO concedes that both Robert and Linda Connors are \u201cinsureds\u201d under the policy. The terms of the policy included underinsured motorist (\u201cUIM\u201d) coverage of $300,000 per person/$300,000 per accident. Pond maintained automobile liability insurance with Allstate Insurance Co. (\u201cAllstate\u201d), limited to $100,000 per person/$300,000 per accident. The record does not divulge the exact monetary amount of damages sustained by Robert and Linda Connors, although GEI-CO concedes that the total amount exceeds all available and collectable insurance. The Connors settled with Allstate for the limits of Pond\u2019s liability insurance after GEICO waived its rights of subrogation against Pond. Pursuant to this settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>ment, Allstate paid $100,000 to Robert (before he died) and $100,000 to Linda.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Each of the Connors then submitted claims for underinsured motorist coverage to GEICO under the terms of their policy. The Connors sought $300,000 total from GEICO. GEICO agreed that the Connors were owed a total of $100,000 under the terms of the policy, but disputed the additional $200,000 claimed by them. Pursuant to an agreement reached between the parties, GEICO paid the Connors the $100,000 it agreed was owed them, with the understanding that the Connors could proceed with a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment as to the $200,000 in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">II. Statement of the Case: The Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">On 16 December 2010,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Robert and Linda Connors filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment against GEICO, together with a motion for summary judgment. GEICO filed initially a motion to dismiss, which was denied summarily. GEICO filed then an answer, a cross-motion for summary judgment, and opposition to the Connors\u2019 motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The Circuit Court heard on 5 May 2011 arguments from all parties and ruled from the bench as to the pending motions and the Complaint. The trial judge agreed with GEICO\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>interpretation of the policy, and determined that the Plaintiffs should recover only $100,000 from GEICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">In an Order entered on 3 June 2011, the trial judge granted GEICO\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment and denied the Connors\u2019 motion for summary judgment. In a Declaratory Judgment entered on 6 June 2011, the trial judge determined that (1) the Plaintiffs were insured under the GEICO policy and were entitled to collect UIM benefits under the policy; (2) the GEICO policy was not ambiguous and GEICO was obligated under the policy to pay the Connors $100,000 together in satisfaction of their claims; and (3) GEICO\u2019s remaining UIM obligation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">is calculated by taking its $300,000 \u201cper accident\u201d limit under the GEICO Policy and subtracting all amounts received by Robert and Linda Connors that exhausted the tortfeasor\u2019s liability limits, which in this instance was $200,000. GEICO\u2019s remaining UIM obligation to Robert and Linda Connors is to fill the \u201cgap\u201d between what Robert and Linda Connors could have recovered from the tortfeasor had the tortfeasor maintained identical liability coverage to the coverage Robert Connors purchased under the GEI-CO Policy. That \u201cgap\u201d is $100,000 which, as noted, has been paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">On 9 June 2011, the Petitioners filed a Notice of Appeal. The Court of Special Appeals, in a reported opinion, affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Connors v.

At the time of the</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The general purpose of Maryland\u2019s UIM statutory scheme is to \u201cprovide minimum protection for individuals injured by uninsured motorists and should be liberally construed to ensure that innocent victims of motor vehicle collisions are compensated for their injuries.\u201d <em>Brethren Mut.

Specifically, Maryland\u2019s UIM scheme is designed to \u201cprovide an injured insured with resources equal to those which would have been available had the tortfeasor carried liability coverage equal to the amount of uninsured motorist coverage which the injured insured purchased from his own insurance company.\u201d <em>Waters, </em>328 Md. at 714, 616 A.2d at 890.

The Parties\u2019 Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The parties have provided us with various formulas by which to calculate the benefits due to the Connors under the terms of their policy. By our count, the parties\u2019 disagreement centers on two alleged ambiguities in the contract. First, the parties dispute the proper interplay between subsections (1) and (2). Second, the parties appear to dispute (but not as vigorously) the point at which subsection (4) comes into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The Connors suggest the following interpretation and calculation: The Connors begin their analysis with subsection (1), which mandates a $300,000 limit for \u201ceach person\u201d resulting from \u201cone accident.\u201d The Connors suggest that the \u201csubject to\u201d language in subsection (2) makes the $300,000 limit governing \u201ceach accident\u201d subservient to the $300,000 limit for \u201ceach person\u201d from subsection (1). If subsection (2) is subject to subsection (1), then \u201c[e]ach individual claimant\u2019s recovery is limited to the per-person limits, with the maximum payout for the occurrence limited to the per-occurrenee limit.\u201d The Connors summarize their position: \u201c[The policy] states when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>more than one person is injured it will pay up to the per person limit, less payments to that person, with a cap of $300,000 for all payments from GEICO for one accident.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Connors argue that the benefits owed should be calculated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-4\">Estate of Robert Connors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">$300,000 [GEICO\u2019s per person UIM coverage]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">-$100,000 [Payment from Allstate]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">= $200,000 [GEICO\u2019s remaining coverage]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">Linda Connors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">$300,000 [GEICO\u2019s per person UIM coverage]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">-$100,000 [Payment from Allstate]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-11\">= $200,000 [GEICO\u2019s remaining coverage]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-12\">$200,000 owed to the Estate of Robert Connors + $200,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5fG\">owed to Linda Connors = $400,000 total owed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfuZ\">$400,000 is adjusted to $300,000 pursuant to the $300,000 per accident cap from subsection (2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-13\">Finally,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-14\">$300,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-15\">-$100,000 [Amount GEICO already agreed to pay]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-16\">= $200,000 still owed by GEICO</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-17\">GEICO suggests a much different method of calculation is appropriate. GEICO asserts that \u201csubsection (1) simply is not the relevant provision to analyze when more than one person or insured is injured in one accident,\u201d and so begins instead its analysis with subsection (2). As the \u201cper occurrence\u201d limit of subsection (2) is $300,000 in this case, GEICO argues that \u201c[fjrorn this $300,000 limit, the GEICO policy dictates that the amount is reduced by all amounts paid by the tortfeasor, which in this instance is $200,000____\u201d Accordingly, GEICO argues that the benefits owed should be calculated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>The amount of both Connors\u2019 individual injuries (which GEICO concedes exceeds the policy limits) is adjusted to $300,000 pursuant to the $300,000 per accident cap.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-4\">$300,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">-$200,000 [Payments from Allstate to both Connors]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">= $100,000 [Amount GEICO already agreed to pay]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The trial court and the Court of Special Appeals agreed with GEICO\u2019s method of calculating the UIM benefits due to the Connors pursuant to the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">\n<em>D. Our Interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">As a general rule, we interpret the language of an insurance policy with the same principles and rules of construction that we use to interpret other contracts. <em>See De-Haan, </em>393 Md. at 193, 900 A.2d at 225-26; <em>Megonnell v. United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>368 Md. 633, 655, 796 A.2d 758, 772 (2002); <em>Cole v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., </em>359 Md. 298, 305, 753 A.2d 533, 537 (2000). Like any other contract, an insurance contract is \u201cmeasured by its terms unless a statute, a regulation, or public policy is violated thereby.\u201d <em>Pacific Indem. Co. v. Interstate Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>302 Md. 383, 388, 488 A.2d 486, 488 (1985).

Nat\u2019l Lawyers Ins. Reciprocal, </em>379 Md. 643, 660, 843 A.2d 78, 89 (2004). When contractual language is plain and unambiguous, we enforce the terms of the contract as a matter of law. <em>Calomiris v. Woods, </em>353 Md. 425, 445, 727 A.2d 358, 368 (1998); <em>Pacific Indem. Co., </em>302 Md. at 389, 488 A.2d at 489. When interpreting contracts,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acg\">the contract must be construed in its entirety and, if reasonably possible, effect must be given to each clause so that a court will not find an interpretation which casts out or disregards a meaningful part of the language of the writing unless no other course can be sensibly and reasonably followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-10\"><em>Cochran v. Norkunas, </em>398 Md. 1, 17, 919 A.2d 700, 710 (2007). If the language of the contract is ambiguous, we may turn to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>extrinsic evidence to determine the intent of the parties. <em>Clendenin Bros., Inc. v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co., </em>390 Md. 449, 459, 889 A.2d 387, 393 (2006); <em>Pacific Indem. Co., </em>302 Md. at 389, 488 A.2d at 489. A policy term is considered \u201cambiguous if, to a reasonably prudent person, the term is susceptible to more than one meaning.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>359 Md. at 305-06, 753 A.2d at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Some of our sister states maintain that insurance policies should, as a matter of course, be construed against the insurer. <em>Megonnell, </em>368 Md. at 655, 796 A.2d at 771. Maryland does not follow this rule.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Instead, in the event that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>an insurance policy contains ambiguous language, we construe that language \u201cliberally in favor of the insured and against the insurer as <em>drafter of the instrument.\u201d Megonnell, </em>368 Md. at 655, 796 A.2d at 772 (emphasis in original) (internal quotations omitted); <em>see Clendenin Bros., </em>390 Md. at 459-60, 889 A.2d at 394; <em>Collier v.

Only if either no extrinsic or parol evidence is introduced or if an ambiguity still remains after the examination of extrinsic evidence will Maryland courts construe a policy against an insurer.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">In this case, the policy is not ambiguous and therefore we may enforce the terms of the policy as a matter of law. For ease of reference, we reproduce here subsections (1) and (2) as our point of departure for our explication of why there is no ambiguity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">1. The limit of liability for Uninsured Motorists coverage stated in the Declarations as applicable to \u201ceach person\u201d is the limit of our liability for all damages, including those for care or loss of service, due to <em>bodily injury </em>sustained by one person as the result of one accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">2. The limit of liability for Uninsured Motorists coverage stated in the Declarations as applicable to \u201ceach accident\u201d is, <em>subject to the above 'provision respecting each person, </em>the total limit of our liability for all such damages including damages for care and loss of services, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>due to <em>bodily injury </em>sustained by two or more persons as the result of one accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">(emphasis added in subsection (2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Subsection (2) addresses the \u201climit of liability\u201d in situations where \u201cbodily injury\u201d was \u201csustained by two or more persons as the result of one accident.\u201d Subsection (2) refers, however, to subsection (1) by its own terms and ensures therefore that something about subsection (1) impacts the meaning of subsection (2). The Connors contend that the two commas \u201cconvert the statement into the qualifying clause.\u201d The Connors argue further that the \u201cplain language of the policy makes clear that the \u2018per occurrence\u2019 provision is subject to the \u2018per person\u2019 provision. The \u2018per occurrence\u2019 provision is <em>subject to </em>what is in between the commas, which makes the \u2018per person\u2019 provision the main clause dictating the calculation of coverage of UIM benefits.\u201d GEICO, on the other hand, accuses the Connors of \u201creading out\u201d the comma between \u201cis\u201d and \u201csubject,\u201d which, in GEICO\u2019s view, \u201cconverts the \u2018subject to the above provisions respecting each person\u2019 into a qualifying clause that makes it \u2018subservient to\u2019 the per occurrence limit, not the other way around.\u201d Practically speaking, GEICO argues that the \u201csubject to\u201d language \u201csimply restricts an individual insured, involved in an accident where the \u2018per occurrence\u2019 limit is invoked, from individually recovering <em>more than </em>the \u2018per person\u2019 limits.\u201d (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Despite spending numerous pages debating the fine points of grammar and the proper labels to give to various clauses,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the parties agree practically on the interplay between the two provisions. The \u201csubject to\u201d clause present in subsection (2) incorporates subsection (l)\u2019s per person limits and says simply that when two or more persons sustain bodily injury as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>result of one accident, the \u201cper person\u201d limits of the policy-discussed in subsection (1) apply still. The following hypothetical highlights similarities in the parties\u2019 arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8qD\">Suppose the Connors had a policy with GEICO in effect at the time of the accident with fictional policy limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per occurrence. Bracketing for the moment any potential contribution from the tortfeasor, both parties agree that the Connors could recover collectively no more than the $300,000 per accident limit. Both parties agree further that the per accident limit of subsection (2) is \u201csubject to\u201d subsection (1) in the sense that the \u201cper person\u201d limits apply still in the \u201cper accident\u201d context where more than one person is injured. Specifically, in our hypothetical, although the per accident limit is $300,000, each of the Connors would be subject to the $100,000 per person limit and could therefore recover collectively only $200,000. On this much, the parties agree. The terms of the hypothetical policy unambiguously command that result. In order to calculate the amount payable under subsection (2), then, the parties must calculate first the amount payable to each individual person had they been the only insured involved hypothetically in the accident, pursuant to subsection (1). Those individual amounts calculated under subsection (1) are then subjected to the \u201ccap\u201d of subsection (2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The policy held by the Connors had policy limits of $300,000 per person and $300,000 per occurrence. Again, bracketing any potential contributions from the tortfeasor, if the value of the Connors\u2019 claims exceeded $300,000 each as it did here, the method for calculating the proceeds due to the Connors from GEICO proceeds the same as in the hypothetical. It just so happens that the end result is the same because the limits are the same \u2014 bracketing any contributions from Allstate, the Connors may recover together no more than the $300,000 per accident limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In our view, the actual dispute between the parties is, at its heart, over the point in time at which the contributions from Pond\u2019s insurance carrier are taken into account. At two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>separate points the policy mandates that GEICO\u2019s liability is reduced by whatever payments Pond\u2019s carrier made to the Connors. Subsection (4) provides \u201c[t]he amount payable under this coverage will be reduced by all amounts: (a) [p]aid by or for all persons or organizations liable for the injury....\u201d Also, the definition of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d notes that the limit of GEICO\u2019s liability is \u201cthe amount of Uninsured Motorists coverage as stated in the Declarations less the amount paid to the insured that exhausts any applicable liability insurance policies, bonds, and securities on behalf of any person who may be held liable for the bodily injury or death of the insured.\u201d (emphasis removed).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Subsection (4) provides that the \u201camount payable under this coverage\u201d will be reduced by payments received from persons or organizations liable for the injury, such as Allstate on behalf of Pond. We interpret the phrase \u201cthis coverage\u201d to refer to the uninsured motorist coverage generally. Therefore, once the parties get through the calculations and caps of subsection (1) and (2) and arrive at a penultimate number, they are required at that point by subsection (4) to \u201ccredit\u201d payments made by other entities such as Allstate. This is the final amount owed by GEICO. This understanding of subsection (4) is confirmed by the policy\u2019s definition of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle,\u201d which mandates that any other amount paid to the insured of any person who may be held liable for the bodily injury or death of the insured be deducted from the amount calculated pursuant to the declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">We conclude that the policy is not ambiguous and the terms of the policy mandate that the total damages due to the Connors as a couple are capped at $300,000 pursuant to the per accident limit of the policy. Allstate has paid already each of the Connors $100,000, which amounts are deducted from the amount that GEICO would be required otherwise to pay the Connors pursuant to subsection (4). Accordingly, GEICO is responsible for the remaining $100,000, which has been paid already to the Connors.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONERS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-6\">.

The Connors did not ask us, for example, to re-examine Maryland common law and recognize that terms contained in an insurance contract are not the product of equal bargaining, but instead must be construed strictly against the insurer. GEICO recognized rightly in their brief that the Connors failed to raise this larger, more existential question before the Court of Special Appeals or in their Petition for Writ of Certiorari. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8 \u2014 131(b) (\u201cUnless provided by the order granting the writ of certiorari, in reviewing a decision rendered by the Court of Special Appeals ..., the Court of Appeals ordinarily will consider only an issue that has been raised in the petition for certiorari or any cross-petition and that has been preserved for review by the Court of Appeals....\u201d); <em>Worsham v.

State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>436 Md. 501, 83 A.3d 779 (2014), where we granted certiorari to consider the following question, among others: \u201c[sjhould this Court reexamine Maryland common law on construing insurance contracts and, recognizing that such contracts are not the product of equal bargaining, hold that terms contained in an insurance policy must be strictly construed against the insurer?\u201d <em>Id. </em>In their initial brief, the Connors provided us with a list of states (attached originally to the Petitioner\u2019s Brief in <em>People\u2019s </em>Insurance) following purportedly the rule that insurance policies are contracts of adhesion and are to be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>strued strictly against the insurer. GEICO, in its brief, argues that, if the Connors had wanted us to re-examine Maryland common law regarding whether insurance policies should be construed strictly against the insurer, the Connors should have raised the issue before the Court of Special Appeals or in their petition for certiorari, as did the petitioners in <em>People\u2019s Insurance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The Connors, in their reply brief, concede that they only argued the issue in their briefs after we granted certiorari in <em>People\u2019s Insurance. </em>They note, however, that Rule 8-131(a) permits appellate courts to consider unpreserved issues \"if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expenses and delay of another appeal.\u201d The Connors argue further that the fact that we granted certiorari in <em>People's Insurance </em>\u201dindicat[es] [we] intend[] to consider whether the archaic rule established one hundred and seventy-seven (177) years ago should be maintained.\u201d Finally, the Connors argue that no party is prejudiced by raising this issue on appeal as GEICO was afforded the opportunity to brief fully its response to this argument in its reply to the <em>amicus curiae </em>brief filed by the Maryland Association for Justice, Inc. (the \"MAJ\u201d). The MAJ argued first that Maryland should adopt the view that a consumer insurance policy should be construed liberally in favor of the insured and construed strictly against the insurer, and second that judicial action is required to modify the \"insurer-friendly approach\u201d to construing insurance policies currently embodied in Maryland common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">GEICO responded that the MAJ\u2019s <em>amicus curiae </em>\"should not be permitted to otherwise revive an issue that has not otherwise been preserved for review.\u201d GEICO advanced further a host of arguments for why we should reject the arguments advanced by the MAJ and the Connors encouraging us to re-examine Maryland common law. GEI-CO argued that (1) <em>stare decisis </em>dictates that we construe insurance contracts in the same manner as other contracts; (2) Maryland already construes strictly ambiguous policy terms against insurers as the drafters; and (3) the MAJ overstates the \"majority\u201d rule from other jurisdictions. GEICO then provided us with amici briefs from <em>People\u2019s Insurance </em>as well as charts describing the interpretation methodologies of various other states.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">By per curiam order dated 24 February 2015, we dismissed (but not without quarrel) the writ of certiorari in <em>People's Insurance </em>as granted improvidently. <em>People\u2019s Insurance Counsel Div. v.

Generally, we dismiss a case after briefing and argument on the ground that the petition for writ of certiorari was granted improvidently in cases where the grant was (or was proven to be) a mistake, \"either because it becomes apparent later that there is truly no issue of public importance in the case or because there is such an issue, but it was not preserved below or the record in the case provides an inadequate basis for rendering useful guidance on that issue.\u201d <em>Sturdivant </em>v. <em>Maryland Dept. of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>436 Md.-584, 589, 84 A.3d. 83, 86 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">We chose not to re-examine Maryland common law in <em>People\u2019s Insurance </em>when we dismissed the writ of certiorari as granted improvi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>dently. We choose not to re-examine Maryland common law in this case because the Connors did not raise the issue before the Court of Special Appeals nor in their petition for writ of certiorari. Finally, and most importantly, consideration of this question is not \"necessary\u201d here as the parties\u2019 insurance contract is not ambiguous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b516-7\">. The parties treat the Court to a grammar lesson in constructing the policy. Peppered throughout the briefs are arguments about whether the \"subject to\u201d clause is qualifying or modifying, restrictive or nonrestrictive, subservient to something else or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The parties direct our attention to two statutory interpretation cases in which we discussed the nature of qualifying clauses and the impact of commas. In <em>Kane v. Board of Appeals, </em>390 Md. 145, 162, 887 A.2d 1060, 1070 (2005), we analyzed the effect of the qualifying clause and commas in the following provision of the Prince George\u2019s County Code: \"any order or notice issued pursuant to this Subtitle shall be served upon the owner, operator, occupant, agent or other person responsible for the condition or violation....\u201d We recognized that qualifying claus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>es are ordinarily \"confined to the immediately preceding words or phrase \u2014 particularly in the absence of a comma before the qualifying clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). We noted further that, when the qualifying clause is set apart by a comma, \"it is clear that it modifies every element within the list.\u201d <em>Kane, </em>390 Md. at 164, 887 A.2d at 1071. <em>Kane </em>does not aid us in our interpretation task here because there is no list of terms in subsection (2) nor any question regarding which term among many the \"subject to\u201d clause might modify or qualify. <em>Maryland Dep\u2019t of the Environment v. Underwood, </em>368 Md. 160, 175-76, 792 A.2d 1130, 1139 (2002), is unhelpful for similar reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">By our reading, the plain text of the policy flies in the face actually of the rules of grammar. We take as our guide two popular volumes concerning modern grammar: Bryan A. Garner's <em>A Dictionary of Modem Legal Usage </em>(2d. ed. 1995) and Lynne Truss' <em>Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation </em>(2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Garner compares restrictive and nonrestrictive clauses. Restrictive clauses \u201ctake no commas (for commas would present the added information as an aside).\u201d Garner, <em>supra </em>at 765. Garner identifies several mistakes in the usage of restrictive clauses, one of which is making wrongly a restrictive clause nonrestrictive. Garner, <em>supra </em>at 766. This \"fairly common\u201d error occurs when the relative clauses are set off illogically by commas when it is necessary actually to the meaning of the sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Truss has this to say about \u201ccommas that come in pairs,\u201d such as the commas bookending the \u201csubject to\u201d clause in this case: \"[t]he first rule of bracketing commas is that you use them to mark both ends of a 'weak interruption\u2019 to a sentence \u2014 or a piece of \u2018additional information.\u2019 The commas mark the places where the reader can \u2014 as it were\u2014 place an elegant two-pronged fork and cleanly lift out a section of the sentence, leaving no obvious damage to the whole.\u201d Truss, <em>supra, </em>at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">The presence of the commas bookending the phrase \"subject to the above provision respecting each person\u201d renders technically the phrase nonrestrictive. But the meaning of subsection (2) changes radically if one ignores the \u201csubject to\u201d clause, as one must do with a nonrestrictive clause. In order to avoid a nonsensical and wholly meaningless interpretation of the clause, we overlook the GEICO gecko\u2019s violation of grammatical rules and treat the clause (as it clearly was intended to be treated) as if it were restrictive. <em>See Cochran v. Norkunas, </em>398 Md. 1, 17, 919 A.2d 700, 710 (2007) (\u201c \u2018[I]f reasonably possible, effect must be given to each clause so that a court will not find an interpretation which casts out or disregards a meaningful part of the language of the writing unless no other course can sensibly and reasonably be followed.' \u201d (quoting <em>Sagner v.
