Hailes moved to suppress a pretrial identification on the grounds that the identification was, among other things: (1) hearsay; and (2) testimonial and inadmissible under the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The circuit court conducted a hearing on the motion to suppress and issued an opinion in which the circuit court found the following facts, which we summarize. On November 22, 2010, Melvin Pate (\u201cPate\u201d) was shot once in the right side of his face. The bullet entered Pate\u2019s neck and severed C5, the neck\u2019s fifth cervical bone. Pate lost the ability to speak and became quadriplegic <em>(i.e., </em>Pate lost the use of all of his extremities). Pate was taken to Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center. On November 24, 2010, Pate was transferred to the Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland Medical Center (\u201cShock Trauma\u201d). Immediately after Pate arrived at Shock Trauma, doctors told Pate that he had twenty-four hours to live, and Pate\u2019s eyes welled up with tears.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">On November 26, 2010, two detectives of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department showed Pate a photographic array that included a photograph of Hailes. By blinking (\u201cblink hard\u201d if he recognized the person who shot him) in response to the detectives\u2019 questions, Pate identified Hailes as the shooter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that time, Pate was restrained to a hospital bed; was on medical life-support equipment, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>a ventilator; had several tubes in his body; and, by all indications, believed that his death was imminent. Pate did not die soon afterward, however. In 2011, Pate was released from Shock Trauma. In November 2012, Pate died as a consequence of complications caused by the gunshot wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The circuit court granted the motion to suppress, determining that Pate\u2019s identification of Hailes fell under the \u201cdying declaration\u201d exception to the rule against hearsay, but was testimonial and inadmissible under the Confrontation Clause. The State appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals reversed and remanded for trial, holding that: (I) the State could appeal from the circuit court\u2019s grant of the motion to suppress Pate\u2019s identification of Hailes; (II) Pate made a dying declaration; and (III) the Confrontation Clause does not apply to dying declarations. <em>See State v. Hailes, </em>217 Md.App. 212, 271, 225, 236, 251-52, 92 A.3d 544, 578, 552, 558, 567 (2014). Hailes filed a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>which this Court granted. <em>See Hailes v. State, </em>440 Md. 114, 99 A.3d 778 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc.

Specifically, Hailes argues that, because CJP \u00a7 12 \u2014 302(c)(4)(i) uses the word \u201cseized,\u201d CJP \u00a7 12-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>302(c)(4)(i) authorizes the State to appeal only from a trial court\u2019s exclusion of tangible evidence; thus, here, CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4)\u00ae does not authorize the State to appeal from the circuit court\u2019s exclusion of Pate\u2019s identification of Hailes because it is not tangible evidence capable of being seized. Alternatively, Hailes asserts that, because CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4)\u00ae uses the past-tense phrase \u201cto have been seized in violation of the Constitution of the United States, the Maryland Constitution, or the Maryland Declaration of Rights,\u201d CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4)(i) authorizes the State to appeal only from a trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence based on an existing alleged constitutional<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> violation \u2014 as opposed to an exclusion of evidence based on a determination that the evidence\u2019s admission itself would be a constitutional violation; thus, here, CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4)(i) does not authorize the State to appeal from the circuit court\u2019s exclusion of Pate\u2019s identification of Hailes because the detectives did not violate any constitutional provision in obtaining the identification. The State responds that it can appeal from the circuit court\u2019s grant of the motion to suppress because the General Assembly did not intend for the State to be able to appeal from a trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence only where the evidence is tangible and/or where the exclusion is based on an existing alleged constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u201cIn interpreting a statute, a court first considers the statute\u2019s language, which the court applies where the statute\u2019s language is unambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose.\u201d <em>McCree v. State, </em>441 Md. 4, 9, 105 A.3d 456, 459 (2014) (brackets, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted). Where the statute\u2019s language is ambiguous or not clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, the court \u201csearch[es] for [the General Assembly\u2019s] intent in other indicia, including the history of the [statute] or other relevant sources intrinsic and extrinsic to the legislative pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>cess[,]\u201d in light of: (1) \u201cthe structure of the statute\u201d; (2) \u201chow [the statute] relates to other laws\u201d; (3) the statute\u2019s \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d; and (4) \u201cthe relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.\u201d <em>Gardner v. State, </em>420 Md. 1, 9, 20 A.3d 801, 806 (2011) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In <em>Derry v. State, </em>358 Md. 325, 345, 748 A.2d 478, 488 (2000), this Court held that the State cannot appeal from a trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence based only on an alleged violation of a statute \u2014 as opposed to an alleged violation of a constitution. This Court stated that, as used in what is now CJP \u00a7 12-302(e)(4)(i), the phrase \u201calleged to have been seized in violation of the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of Maryland, or the Maryland Declaration of Rights\u201d modifies both \u201cevidence offered by the State\u201d and \u201cproperty.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 338-39, 748 A.2d at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Here, first, we conclude that CJP \u00a7 12-302(e)(4)(i)\u2019s language is ambiguous in that the word \u201cseized\u201d renders unclear whether CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4)(i) authorizes the State to appeal only from a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to suppress tangible evidence, as opposed to pretrial identifications and other intangible evidence. CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4)(i)\u2019s legislative history, however, conclusively establishes that the General Assembly did not intend for CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4)(i) to authorize the State to appeal only from a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to suppress tangible evidence. In 1982, the General Assembly passed Senate Bill 39, which added to CJP \u00a7 12-302 a provision whose relevant language is identical to the relevant language of what is now CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4)(i). <em>See </em>1982 Md. Laws 3107 (Ch. 493, S.B. 39). Senate Bill 39\u2019s file includes a document entitled \u201cS.B. 39 \u2014 Criminal Cases \u2014 State\u2019s Right to Appeal,\u201d which states in pertinent part: \u201c[Senate B]ill [39] is aimed at those cases in which the Judge excludes a defendant\u2019s confession, physical evidence (such as drugs), or any evidence which is at the heart of the State\u2019s case.\u201d (Emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Senate Bill 39 is identical to Senate Bill 196 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>(Md.1981), whose file contains the following note on the hearing before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee: \u201cThe type of evidence which is involved includes physical evidence obtained by search and seizure, confessions or admissions, and identifications of the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added). Thus, CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4)(i)\u2019s legislative history makes clear that the General Assembly intended for CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4)(i) to apply to both tangible evidence and intangible evidence alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Next, we conclude that CJP \u00a7 12-802(e)(4)(i)\u2019s language is ambiguous in that the past-tense phrase \u201cto have been seized in violation of\u2019 a constitution renders unclear whether CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4)(i) authorizes the State to appeal only from a trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence based on an existing alleged constitutional violation \u2014 as opposed to an exclusion of evidence based on a determination that the evidence\u2019s admission itself would be a constitutional violation. CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4)(i)\u2019s legislative history, however, conclusively establishes that the General Assembly did not intend for CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4)(i) to authorize the State to appeal only from a trial court\u2019s exclusion of evidence based on an existing alleged constitutional violation. As discussed above, CJP \u00a7 12-802(c)(4)(i)\u2019s legislative history indicates that the General Assembly intended for CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4)(i) to broadly apply to various kinds of evidence, from tangible evidence (such as drugs) to intangible evidence (such as pretrial identifications). It follows that the General Assembly intended for CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4)(i) to broadly apply to exclusions based on various constitutional grounds, from existing alleged constitutional violations \u2014 as with seizures that were allegedly unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment \u2014 to determinations that that the evidence\u2019s admission itself would be a constitutional violation \u2014 as with pretrial identifications that, if admitted, would allegedly violate the Confrontation Clause. For CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4)(i)\u2019s purposes, it is a distinction without a difference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>whether the constitutional violation is the obtaining of the evidence before trial or the admission of the evidence at trial; it would be absurd for CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4)(i) to apply to one situation, but not to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Thus, we are unpersuaded by Hailes\u2019s reliance on <em>Rush v. State, </em>403 Md. 68, 98, 939 A.2d 689, 706 (2008) (\u201c[W]e have narrowly construed any grant of appellate authority.\u201d). Although, generally, a court narrowly construes a statute that allows a party to appeal, the Court cannot construe such a statute so narrowly as to produce absurd results. <em>See Gardner, </em>420 Md. at 9, 20 A.3d at 806 (A \u201cstatute must be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is absurd, illogical[,] or incompatible with common sense.\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">For the above reasons, under CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4)(i), the State may appeal from a trial court\u2019s exclusion of intangible evidence based on a determination that the evidence\u2019s admission would be a constitutional violation. Thus, here, the State may appeal from the circuit court\u2019s grant of the motion to suppress Pate\u2019s identification of Hailes based on a determination that admission of the same would violate the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Hailes contends that the circuit court was incorrect in determining that Pate\u2019s identification of him was a dying declaration. Specifically, Hailes argues that the circuit court clearly erred in finding that Pate believed that his death was imminent when he identified Hailes, as Pate did so four days after being shot, two days after being told that he had twenty-four hours to live, and two years before dying. Hailes asserts that, by the time that Pate identified him, Pate\u2019s condition had stabilized. The State responds that the circuit court was correct in determining that Pate\u2019s identification of Hailes was a dying declaration because the circuit court did not clearly err in finding that Pate believed that his death was imminent when he identified Hailes, given the severity of Pate\u2019s injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>and his apparent appreciation of a doctor\u2019s prognosis that he had only a short time to live.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, an appellate court reviews for clear error the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, and reviews without deference the trial court\u2019s application of the law to its findings of fact. <em>See Raynor v. State, </em>440 Md. 71, 81, 99 A.3d 753, 758 (2014). The appellate court views the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, \u201cthe evidence!,] and [the] inferences that may be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party who prevails on the\u201d issue that the defendant raises in the motion to suppress. <em>Id. </em>at 81, 99 A.3d at 758 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on whether evidence falls under an exception to the rule against hearsay, an appellate court reviews for clear error the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, and reviews without deference the trial court\u2019s application of the law to its findings of fact. <em>See Gordon v. State, </em>431 Md. 527, 538, 66 A.3d 647, 653 (2013).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Maryland Rule 5-802, also known as the rule against hearsay, states: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by [the Maryland R]ules or permitted by applicable constitutional provisions or statutes, hearsay is not admissible.\u201d \u201cIn a prosecution for an offense based upon an unlawful homicide,\u201d Maryland Rule 5-804(b)(2) excepts from the rule against hearsay an unavailable declarant\u2019s dying declaration, which is \u201ca statement made by [the] declarant, while believing that the declarant\u2019s death was imminent, concerning the cause or circumstances of what the declarant believed to be his or her impending death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">For example, in <em>Connor v. State, </em>225 Md. 543, 554, 551, 171 A.2d 699, 705, 703 (1961), this Court held that a statement was a dying declaration where the declarant \u201centreat[ed] that someone take care of [her] baby [and] called for a priest before making the\u201d statement. Similarly, in <em>Meno v. State, </em>117 Md. 435, 437, 83 A. 759, 760 (1912), this Court held that a statement was a dying declaration where a doctor told the declarant of her \u201cimpending death,\u201d and the declarant nodded in response to the question \u201cDo you realize that you are going to die?\u201d Likewise, in <em>Worthington v. State, </em>92 Md. 222, 242, 241, 48 A. 355, 358 (1901), this Court held that a statement was a dying declaration where the declarant \u201cconstantly declared she expected to die\u201d and \u201cbeg[ed her physician] to save her[,] as she was dying.\u201d Under extremely similar circumstances, in <em>Hawkins v. State, </em>98 Md. 355, 358-59, 57 A. 27, 28 (1904), this Court held that a statement was a dying declaration where the declarant \u201cconstantly said [that] she \u2018knew [that] she was dying,\u2019 and the [declarant\u2019s] mother testified that \u2018she could see death in [the declarant\u2019s] eyes.\u2019 \u201d This Court concluded that these two facts outweighed the circumstance that, earlier, the declarant stated, \u201c[i]f you don\u2019t send for the doctor, I will die[,]\u201d which \u201cimplie[d] a hope of recovery, however faint\u201d; a statement is not a dying declaration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>where the declarant has \u201c[a]ny expressed or clearly visible hope of recovery!.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358, 57 A. at 28. By contrast, in <em>Hays v. State, </em>40 Md. 633, 652, 646 (1874), this Court agreed with the State\u2019s contention that a statement was not a dying declaration where \u201cthere [wa]s no evidence that [the declarant] expected to die[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Here, viewing the circuit court\u2019s findings of fact, the evidence, and the inferences that may be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude that the circuit court was correct in determining that Pate\u2019s identification of Hailes was a dying declaration, and that the circuit court did not clearly err in finding that Pate believed that his death was imminent when he identified Hailes. It is undisputed that, as the circuit court found, Pate was shot in the right side of his face; that the bullet entered Pate\u2019s neck and severed the fifth cervical bone; and that Pate lost the ability to speak and became quadriplegic. Two days after the shooting, Pate was transferred to Shock Trauma. Pate\u2019s mother testified that, on that day, a doctor told her and Pate \u201cthat he wouldn\u2019t make it\u201d and that \u201c[i]t would be very rare if [Pate] made it past [twenty-four] hours because [the doctor] never had a case that survived from this.\u201d According to Pate\u2019s mother, immediately after the doctor announced this prognosis, \u201c[t]ears came out of [Pate\u2019s] eyes.\u201d Pate\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony supports the circuit court\u2019s finding that, immediately after Pate arrived at Shock Trauma, doctors told Pate that he had twenty-four hours to live, and Pate\u2019s eyes welled up with tears.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Pate\u2019s contemporaneous crying tends to prove that he both heard and believed the doctor\u2019s prognosis that his death was imminent. Pate\u2019s crying also undermines Hailes\u2019s allegation that Pate did not communicate that he believed that his death was imminent. In any event, such direct evidence is unnecessary; circumstantial evidence can establish a declarant\u2019s belief in imminent death. <em>See Connor, 225 </em>Md. at 551, 171 A.2d at 703-04 (\u201cIt is not necessary to prove expressions implying apprehension of death, if it is clear that the [declar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>ant] does not expect to survive the injury. This expectation may be indicated by the circumstances of [the declarant\u2019s] condition[.]\u201d (Citation and internal quotation mark omitted)). It is not conjecture to draw reasonable inferences from circumstantial evidence; thus, we are unpersuaded by Hailes\u2019s reliance on <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>290 U.S. 96, 100, 54 S.Ct. 22, 78 L.Ed. 196 (1933) (\u201c[T]he state of mind must be exhibited in the evidence, and not left to conjecture.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">It is accurate that Pate identified Hailes two days after the doctor\u2019s prognosis that Pate\u2019s death was imminent; however, the record establishes that Pate was faring just as badly as he had been two days before. As the circuit court found, when Pate identified Hailes, Pate still could not speak or move any of his extremities; could communicate only by blinking; was restrained to a hospital bed; was on medical life-support equipment, including a ventilator; and had several tubes in his body. A nurse from Shock Trauma testified that, when Pate identified Hailes, Pate was on a feeding tube for nutrition and medication, could not breathe on his own because of a collapsed lung, and had a \u201chalo\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cscrewed in.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">We are unconvinced by Hailes\u2019s reliance on the circumstance that Pate died two years after he identified Hailes. Hailes relies on <em>Mattox v. United States (\u201cMattox I\u201d), </em>146 U.S. 140, 151, 13 S.Ct. 50, 36 L.Ed. 917 (1892), in which the Supreme Court of the United States stated: \u201cThe length of time elapsing between the making of the [statement] and the death is ... to be considered[.]\u201d (Citations omitted). For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>three reasons, the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Mattox I, </em>146 U.S. at 151, 13 S.Ct. 50 does not compel us to conclude that the length of time between a statement and the declarant\u2019s death is a determinative factor. First, the Supreme Court\u2019s statement appears to be <em>dicta, </em>as, in <em>Mattox I, id. </em>at 152, 13 S.Ct. 50 a declarant died \u201ca few hours\u201d after making a statement. Thus, the Supreme Court\u2019s observation was not intended to convey that a lengthy period of time between a statement and a declarant\u2019s death may prevent the statement from being a dying declaration. Second, the Supreme Court\u2019s statement is clarified by what the Supreme Court acknowledged immediately afterward: \u201c[I]t is the impression of almost immediate dissolution, and not the rapid succession of death, ... that renders the\u201d statement a dying declaration. <em>Mattox I, id. </em>at 151, 13 S.Ct. 50 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Third, the Supreme Court\u2019s statement is clarified even further by what the Supreme Court noted later in the same paragraph: \u201cThe point is to ascertain the state of the mind at the time the [statement was] made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152,13 S.Ct. 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Significantly, nothing in Maryland Rule 5 \u2014 804(b)(2) or this Court\u2019s precedent indicates that the length of time between a statement and the declarant\u2019s death is to be considered in determining whether the statement is a dying declaration. Certainly, Maryland Rule 5-804(b)(2)\u2019s plain language lacks such a requirement; Maryland Rule 5 \u2014 804(b)(2) requires only that a declarant \u201cbelievfed] that the declarant\u2019s death was imminent[.]\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although this Court has held that statements were dying declarations in cases in which declarants died less than a week after making the statements, <em>see Connor, 225 </em>Md. at 548, 171 A.2d at 702 (less than one day); <em>Meno, </em>117 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>437, 83 A. at 760 (six days); <em>Hawkins, </em>98 Md. at 356, 57 A. at 27 (one day); <em>Worthington, </em>92 Md. at 241, 48 A. at 358 (two days), this Court never implied, much less stated, that the length of time between a statement and the declarant\u2019s death is to be considered in determining whether the statement is a dying declaration. To the contrary, in <em>Worthington, </em>this Court indicated that the length of time between a statement and the declarant\u2019s death is not to be considered in determining whether the statement is a dying declaration. <em>See id. </em>at 242, 48 A. at 358 (\u201cA firm belief that death is impending ... is sufficient to render the statement [a dying declaration], though the [declarant] ... may chance to linger on for some days, or even two or three weeks.\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">This Court\u2019s statement in <em>Worthington, id. </em>at 242, 48 A. at 358, accords with the circumstance that this Court has consistently focused on \u2014 whether the declarant\u2019s belief in imminent death was genuine, not whether it was, in hindsight, accurate. <em>See id. </em>at 242, 241, 48 A. at 358 (This Court held that a statement was a dying declaration where the declarant \u201cconstantly declared that she expected to die\u201d and \u201cbeg[ed her physician] to save her[,] as she was dying.\u201d); <em>Connor, </em>225 Md. at 554, 551, 171 A.2d at 705, 703 (This Court held that a statement was a dying declaration where the declarant \u201centreated] that someone take care of [her] baby [and] called for a priest before making the\u201d statement.); <em>Meno, </em>117 Md. at 437, 83 A. at 760 (This Court held that a statement was a dying declaration where a doctor told the declarant of her \u201cimpending death,\u201d and the declarant nodded in response to the question \u201cDo you realize that you are going to die?\u201d); <em>Hawkins, </em>98 Md. at 358-59, 57 A. at 28 (This Court held that a statement was a dying declaration where the declarant \u201cconstantly said [that] she \u2018knew [that] she was dying,\u2019 and the [declarant\u2019s] mother testified that \u2018she could see death in [the declarant\u2019s] eyes.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Hays, </em>40 Md. at 652, 646 (This Court agreed with the State\u2019s contention that a statement was not a dying declaration where \u201cthere [wa]s no evidence that [the declarant] expected to die[.]\u201d). In other words, this Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>consistently focused on whether the declarant had \u201c[a]ny expressed or clearly visible hope of recovery[,]\u201d <em>Hawkins, </em>98 Md. at 358, 57 A. at 28, not whether the declarant did, in fact, recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">This Court\u2019s focus on the declarant\u2019s mental state is bolstered \u2014 and, indeed, compelled \u2014 by the reason why dying declarations are excepted from the rule against hearsay. As the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Mattox I, </em>a dying declaration is considered reliable because a declarant who believes that his or her death is imminent ostensibly lacks any motive to lie. <em>See </em>146 U.S. at 152, 13 S.Ct. 50 (\u201c[T]he certain expectation of almost immediate death will remove all temptation to falsehood and enforce as strict adherence to the truth as the obligation of an oath could impose.\u201d); <em>accord Connor, </em>225 Md. at 554, 171 A.2d at 705 (Imminent death \u201ccreates an obligation as solemn as that of a positive oath to tell the truth[.]\u201d). Whether a declarant believed that his or her death was imminent when the declarant made a statement depends on what happened before, not after, the declarant made the statement. Obviously, no one can predict the future with absolute certainty; thus, a declarant can genuinely believe, but cannot know for certain, that his or her death is imminent when the declarant makes a statement. The genuineness of the declarant\u2019s belief in imminent death is not diminished by the circumstance that that belief is, in hindsight, inaccurate. Indeed, it would lead to illogical results to consider the length of time between a statement and the declarant\u2019s death in determining whether the statement is a dying declaration. For example, a statement by a declarant in critical condition would be a dying declaration where the declarant died soon afterward; yet, the exact same statement by the exact same declarant in the exact same critical condition would not be a dying declaration where, for whatever reason, the declarant survived for years.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Here, we hold that the length of time between a statement and the declarant\u2019s death is entitled to little, if any, weight in determining whether a declarant believed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>declarant\u2019s death was imminent when the declarant made the statement. <em>See Worthington, </em>92 Md. at 242, 241, 48 A. at 358; <em>Connor, </em>225 Md. at 554, 551, 171 A.2d at 705, 703; <em>Meno, </em>117 Md. at 437, 83 A. at 760; <em>Hawkins, 98 </em>Md. at 358-59, 57 A. at 28; <em>Hays, </em>40 Md. at 652, 646; <em>Mattox I, </em>146 U.S. at 151, 152, 13 S.Ct. 50 (\u201c[I]t is the impression of almost immediate dissolution, and not the rapid succession of death, ... that renders the\u201d statement a dying declaration; \u201c[t]he point is to ascertain the state of the mind at the time the declarations were made.\u201d (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). Thus, here, the circumstance that Pate died two years after he identified Hailes is entitled to little, if any, weight, and certainly cannot render clearly erroneous the circuit court\u2019s finding \u2014 supported by the evidence, as discussed above \u2014 that Pate believed that his death was imminent when he identified Hailes.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">For the above reasons, the circuit court was correct in determining that Pate\u2019s identification of Hailes was a dying declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Hailes contends that the circuit court was correct in concluding that admission of Pate\u2019s identification of him would violate the Confrontation Clause because the Confrontation Clause applies to testimonial dying declarations. The State responds that the circuit court was incorrect in concluding that admission of Pate\u2019s identification of Hailes would violate the Confrontation Clause, and argues that the Confrontation Clause does not apply to dying declarations, even testimonial ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">An appellate court reviews without deference a trial court\u2019s ruling on whether admission of evidence would violate a constitution. <em>See generally McCree, </em>441 Md. at 9,105 A.3d at 459 (\u201cWe review the ultimate question of constitutionality de novo.\u201d (Brackets, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>The Confrontation Clause states: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him[.]\u201d U.S. Const. amend.

In <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 54, 124 S.Ct. 1354 the Supreme Court stated that the Confrontation Clause \u201cis most naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admitting only those exceptions established at the time of the founding\u201d; for that proposition, that Court relied on <em>Mattox II, </em>156 U.S. at 243, 15 S.Ct. 337 which is the earliest case in which the Supreme Court indicated that the Confrontation Clause does not apply to dying declarations. The reason why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>is clear: Dying declarations were an exception to the common law right of confrontation when the Sixth Amendment was ratified. <em>See Kirby, </em>174 U.S. at 61, 19 S.Ct. 574 (\u201c[T]he admission of dying declarations is an exception [to the Confrontation Clause] which arises from the necessity of the cause. This exception was well established before the adoption of the [Constitution, and was not intended to be abrogated.\u201d). This accords with <em>Crawford </em>and its progeny, in which the Supreme Court has held that the Confrontation Clause applies to testimonial statements of types as to which \u2014 in contrast to dying declarations \u2014 there was no exception to the common law right of confrontation when the Sixth Amendment was ratified. <em>See, e.g., Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 40, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (statements against penal interest); <em>Giles, </em>554 U.S. at 377, 359, 357, 128 S.Ct. 2678 (\u201cforfeiture by wrongdoing\u201d under California law); <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 834, 821, 819, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006) (excited utterances); <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. 305, 324, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009) (purported business records and public records). Indeed, as the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Crawford, </em>dying declarations are an anomaly with regard to the Confrontation Clause. <em>See </em>541 U.S. at 56, 56 n. 6, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (\u201c[T]here is scant evidence that exceptions [to the rule against hearsay] were invoked to admit testimonial statements against the accused in a criminal case\u201d; \u201c[t]he one deviation we have found involves dying declarations.... If this exception [to the Confrontation Clause] must be accepted on historical grounds, it is <em>sui generis.\u201d </em>(Footnote and some emphasis omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Hailes raises red herrings in contending that dying declarations are not inherently reliable and that, under <em>Crawford 'id. </em>at 61-62, 124 S.Ct. 1354 testimonial dying declarations are reliable if and only if they are subject to cross-examination. As an initial matter, Hailes\u2019s first contention is incorrect; as noted above in Part II, a dying declaration is considered reliable because a declarant who believes that the declarant\u2019s death is imminent ostensibly lacks any motive to lie. <em>See Mattox I, </em>146 U.S. at 152, 13 S.Ct. 50; <em>accord Connor, </em>225 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Md. at 554, 171 A.2d at 705. In any event, the Confrontation Clause does not apply to dying declarations, not because dying declarations are inherently reliable, but instead because excluding dying declarations for lack of cross-examination would result in a failure of justice. This is established by the very case on which Hailes relies: <em>Carver v. United States, </em>164 U.S. 694, 697, 17 S.Ct. 228, 41 L.Ed. 602 (1897), in which the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">A dying declaration by no means imports absolute verity. The history of criminal trials is replete with instances where witnesses, even in the agonies of death, have, through malice, misapprehension, or weakness of mind, made declarations that were inconsistent with the actual facts; and it would be a great hardship to the defendant, who is deprived of the benefit of a cross-examination, to hold that he could not explain them. Dying declarations are a marked exception to the general rule that hearsay [statements are] not admissible, and are received from the necessities of the case, and to prevent an entire failure of justice, as it frequently happens that no other witnesses to the homicide are present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">(Emphasis added); <em>see also Mattox II, </em>156 U.S. at 244, 15 S.Ct. 337 (Dying declarations \u201care admitted, not in conformity with any general rule regarding the admission of [evidence], but as an exception to such rules, simply from the necessities of the case, and to prevent a manifest failure of justice.\u201d). Thus, in both <em>Carver, </em>164 U.S. at 697, 17 S.Ct. 228 and <em>Mattox II, </em>156 U.S. at 244, 15 S.Ct. 337 \u2014 just like in <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 56 n. 6, 124 S.Ct. 1354 \u2014 the Supreme Court indicated that dying declarations are an \u201cexception\u201d to the Confrontation Clause, and thus need not be subject to cross-examination. By way of comparison, in <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court noted that the Confrontation Clause does not apply to statements that fall under the \u201cforfeiture by wrongdoing\u201d exception to the rule against hearsay,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> not because such statements are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>inherently reliable, but instead because excluding such statements for lack of cross-examination would result in a failure of justice. <em>See </em>541 U.S. at 62, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (\u201c[T]he rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing (which we accept) extinguishes confrontation claims on essentially equitable grounds; it does not purport to be an alternative means of determining reliability.\u201d (Emphasis added) (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">For the above reasons, the Confrontation Clause does not apply to dying declarations. Here, as discussed above in Part II, Pate\u2019s identification of Hailes is a dying declaration; thus, the Confrontation Clause does not apply to Pate\u2019s identification of Hailes,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and we need not, and do not, address whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Pate\u2019s identification of Hailes was testimonial or non-testimonial, as the distinction is irrelevant in the context of dying declarations.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

That said, where (as here) one party prevails on one issue that the defendant raises in the motion to suppress, but does not prevail on the motion to suppress, the appellate court views the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, the evidence, and the inferences that may be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party that prevailed on the issue insofar as the appellate court considers the issue. Here, the State prevailed on the issue of whether Pate\u2019s identification of Hailes was a dying declaration, but did not prevail on the motion to suppress. Thus, in our analysis, we view the circuit court's findings of fact, the evidence, and the inferences that may be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the State insofar as we consider whether Pate\u2019s identification of Hailes was a dying declaration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b531-8\">. We reject Hailes\u2019s contention that an appellate court reviews without deference a trial court\u2019s finding that a declarant believed that the declarant's death was imminent when the declarant made a statement.

Both when the Sixth Amendment was ratified and under current Maryland law, an unavailable declarant\u2019s statement is a dying declaration if and only if the declarant made the statement \u201cwhile believing that the declarant\u2019s death was imminent,\u201d and the statement \u201cconcerned] the cause or circumstances of what the declarant believed to be his or her impending death.\u201d Md.

What matters is that, when the declarant made the statement, the declarant believed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>declarant was on the brink of death, even if the declarant did not go over that brink soon afterward \u2014 as long as the declarant is unavailable at the time of the trial or hearing. <em>See Mattox I, </em>146 U.S. at 151, 13 S.Ct. 50 (\"[I]t is the impression of almost immediate dissolution, and not the rapid succession of death, ... that renders the\u201d statement a dying declaration.

In determining that Pate\u2019s identification of Hailes was testimonial and inadmissible under the Confrontation Clause, the circuit court incorrectly assumed that the Confrontation Clause can apply to a dying declaration. Apparently, the circuit court based its assumption on <em>Michigan v. Bryant, </em>562 U.S. 344, 131 S.Ct. 1143, 179 L.Ed.2d 93 (2011), and <em>Head v. State, </em>171 Md.App. 642, 912 A.2d 1 (2006). Neither case supports the proposition that the Confrontation Clause can apply to a dying declaration. <em>Bryant </em>involved an excited utterance, not a dying declaration. <em>See </em>562 U.S. at 351, 131 S.Ct. at 1151 n. 1. <em>InHead, </em>171 Md.App. at 660, 661 n. 10, 912 A.2d at 12, 12 n. 10, the Court of Special Appeals held that a certain dying declaration was nontestimonial; thus, that Court found it \"unnecessary ... to decide\u201d whether the Confrontation Clause applies to dying declarations. Curiously, here, the circuit court correctly acknowledged that \"dying declarations have historically been an exception to the\u201d Confrontation Clause, yet the circuit court declined to apply that legal principle because of this case's unique facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
