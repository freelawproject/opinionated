The Court of Special Appeals affirmed. We granted Harrison-Solomon\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to consider his single question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">Where Petitioner was committed to the Department of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene pursuant to a finding that he was not criminally responsible, was subsequently conditionally released, and did not violate any of the conditions of his release, did the circuit court have jurisdiction, after the expiration of the order of conditional release (OCR), to grant a motion to \u201cextend\u201d the OCR filed five days prior to its expiration?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">For reasons we shall explain, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">On 15 June 1999, Harrison-Solomon pleaded guilty in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to two counts of second degree assault. The Court found him not criminally responsible, pursuant to Maryland Code (1982, 1996 Repl. Vol.), Health General Article, \u00a7 12-108, and committed him to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (the \u201cDepartment\u201d or the \u201cState\u201d) for inpatient treatment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Harrison-Solomon was released conditionally by the Circuit Court\u2019s order of 23 March 2000. The Order of Conditional Release required, among other things, that Harrison-Solomon: (1) reside with his mother; (2) receive and follow the treatment advice of a specified psychiatrist; (3) attend a semester of high school and thereafter remain involved with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>meaningful daytime activities approved by his therapist; (4) refrain from using illegal drugs or alcohol and submit to urine testing; and (5) notify and receive approval of his therapist before taking certain actions, such as changing his place of residence, employment, or marital status. The duration, on its face, of this Order of Conditional Release was three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">On 21 December 2001, Harrison-Solomon was indicted for attempted murder, robbery with a deadly weapon, and use of a handgun in commission of a felony or of a crime of violence. As a result, the Circuit Court rescinded the 2000 Order of Conditional Release and recommitted Harrison-Solomon to impatient treatment. A jury found him guilty on 12 December 2002, but again not criminally responsible, of robbery and use of a handgun in commission of a felony or of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Upon the recommendation of an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) of the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings, the Circuit Court again released conditionally Harrison-Solomon on 3 July 2006.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The facial duration of this order was through 3 July 2011. Among the changes in conditions from those in the 2000 Order of Conditional Release were requirements that Harrison-Solomon participate in a residential program and that he may visit his parents only if authorized by those treating his mental illness. When Harrison-Solomon\u2019s family became no longer able to support financially execution of some of the terms of his conditional release, the Circuit Court excused those requirements, such as electronic monitoring and some portions of the outpatient care regimen.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">In November of 2009, the State petitioned the Circuit Court to revoke Harrison-Solomon\u2019s conditional release. According to the State, he violated the terms of the 2006 Order of Conditional Release by not following the directions of his housing provider, missing a medication injection, and visiting his mother without receiving the proper prior approval. Har<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>rison-Solomon was re-committed to impatient medical treatment on 17 November 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">An ALJ found, on 13 May 2010, that, although Harrison-Solomon violated the 2006 Conditional Release Order, he would not be a danger to himself or others if released subject to conditions substantially similar to those in the 2006 order. Therefore, the ALJ recommended that he be released conditionally for the remaining duration of the 2006 Order. On June 15, the Circuit Court released Harrison-Solomon in accordance with the ALJ\u2019s recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">On 28 June 2011, five days before Harrison-Solomon\u2019s conditional release was to expire, according to the extant Order, the Department filed with the Circuit Court an Application for Extension of Conditional Release seeking to extend the terms of the Order for an additional four years, pursuant to Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol.), Criminal Procedure Art., \u00a7 3-122 (\u201cCP\u201d). Supporting the requested extension was an attached evaluation from a physician. Although the evaluation noted Harrison-Solomon\u2019s perfect attendance at treatment sessions, compliance with his medication regime to that time, and \u201cpleasant\u201d demeanor, it stated also that he \u201cannounced his intention to abandon psychiatric treatment so that his mind can be free to think.\u201d The evaluation continued that Harrison-Solomon \u201cha[d] not developed any insight into [the] role of medication [in] maintaining psychiatric stability.\u201d A copy of the Application was mailed to Harrison-Solomon\u2019s attorney on 23 June 2011. On 31 August 2011, approximately two months after the facial last day of the Order of Conditional Release (3 July 2011), the Circuit Court granted, without a hearing (none was requested by either party), the Department\u2019s Application, extending the conditions of release for an additional four years. Harrison-Solomon did not file an opposition to the Application.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Harrison-Solomon, through counsel, filed on 13 September 2011 a Motion to Alter or Amend under Maryland Rule 2-534. He asserted that the Circuit Court\u2019s jurisdiction over him ended on 3 July 2011, at the expiration of the 2006 Order of Conditional Release, and therefore the order entered on Au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>gust 31 extending his conditional release was invalid. The Department answered that it filed the Application for Extension of Conditional Release before the 2006 Order expired, so the Court retained jurisdiction to rule on the Application.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">After holding a hearing on November 10, the Circuit Court held that CP \u00a7 3-122<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did not impose upon the court a mandatory or fixed deadline by which it had to decide a timely-filed application to extend a conditional release. Rather, the court retained jurisdiction in Harrison-Solomon\u2019s case. The fact that the court did not rule on the Application until after the end date of the facial duration of the 2006 Order of Conditional Release was \u201cof no consequence.\u201d The court denied Harrison-Solomon\u2019s Motion to Alter or Amend.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Harrison-Solomon appealed to the Court of Special Appeals the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of his Motion to Alter or Amend. According to him, by granting the Department\u2019s Application, the Circuit Court did not \u201cextend\u201d the duration of the Order of Conditional Release as contemplated by CP \u00a7 3-122, but rather \u201crevived\u201d the conditional release after it had expired. This was not authorized by the statute, as Petitioner\u2019s argument continued, and was beyond the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The State retorted that CP \u00a7 3-122 did not impose any deadlines by which the Department was required to file an application to extend an order of conditional release or by which the Court was required to rule on such an application.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The Court of Special Appeals reviewed the denial of Harrison-Solomon\u2019s Motion to Alter or Amend for abuse of discretion, noting \u201c \u2018that trial judges do not have discretion to apply inappropriate legal standards, even when making decisions that are regarded as discretionary in nature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harrison-Solomon v. State, </em>216 Md.App. 138, 146, 85 A.3d 310, 316 (2014) (quoting <em>Wilson-X v. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>403 Md. 667, 675, 944 A.2d 509 (2008)). After considering the legislative intent of CP \u00a7 3-122 and particularly a decision of the Illinois intermediate appellate court in a similar case, the intermediate appellate court panel held that a circuit court retains jurisdiction over such a case \u201cas long as an application for a change in conditional release is filed before the expiration of the conditional release term ... even if the order is issued after the [Order of Conditional Release] otherwise would have expired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Harrison-Solomon sought a writ of certiorari from this Court. We granted his petition. <em>Harrison-Solomon v. State, </em>438 Md. 739, 93 A.3d 288 (2014).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we consider <em>de novo. Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Anderson, </em>395 Md. 172, 181, 909 A.2d 694, 699 (2006). Denial of a revisory motion under Md. Rule 2-534 is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Miller v. Mathias, </em>428 Md. 419, 438, 52 A.3d 53, 64 (2012) (citing <em>RRC Northeast, LLC v. BAA Maryland, Inc., </em>413 Md. 638, 673, 994 A.2d 430, 451 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\n<em>A. Intent of the Legislature</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">When interpreting statutes, we seek to ascertain and implement the will of the Legislature. <em>Williams v. Peninsula Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>440 Md. 573, 580, 103 A.3d 658, 663 (2014); <em>Johnson v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore City, </em>387 Md. 1, 11, 874 A.2d 439, 445 (2005); <em>Witte v. Azarian, </em>369 Md. 518, 525, 801 A.2d 160, 165 (2002). Our first step toward that goal is to examine the text. \u201cIf the language of the statute is unambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, our inquiry as to legislative intent ends ordinarily and we apply the statute as written, without resort to other rules of construction.\u201d <em>Lockshin v. Semsker, </em>412 Md. 257, 275, 987 A.2d 18, 28-29 (2010).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If ambiguities are found, other indicia of legislative intent are consulted, including the relevant statute\u2019s legislative history, the context of the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>within the broader legislative scheme, and the relative rationality of competing constructions. <em>Witte, </em>369 Md. at 525-26, 801 A.2d at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\n<em>1. Text of CP \u00a7 3-122</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The text of CP \u00a7 3-122 supports the conclusion that the Circuit Court retained jurisdiction to decide the Department\u2019s application to continue the conditions of Harrison-Solomon\u2019s release.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> CP \u00a7 3-122 provides (and provided at all times during Harrison-Solomon\u2019s latest conditional release):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 (1) An application to the court for a change in conditional release of a committed person may be made by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">(i) the Health Department or the State\u2019s Attorney at anytime; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">(ii) the committed person not earlier than 6 months after the court ordered the conditional release, unless the court for good cause permits an earlier application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">(2) The applicant for a change in conditional release shall notify the court and other parties, in writing, of the application and the reasons for the requested change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>(b) <em>Burden of proof. </em>\u2014 The burden of proof of any issue raised by the application for change in conditional release rests with the applicant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">(c) <em>Court action. </em>\u2014 After the court considers the application for change in conditional release and the evidence, in accordance with \u00a7 3-114 [<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] of this title, the court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">(1) change the conditions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">(2) impose appropriate additional conditions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">(3) revoke the conditional release;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">(4) continue the present conditions of release; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-10\">(5) extend the conditional release by an additional term of 5 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-11\">(d) <em>Reapplication. </em>\u2014 (1) Not earlier than 1 year after the court action on the application for change filed by the committed person, and not more than once a year thereafter, a committed person may reapply for a change in conditional release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-12\">(2) Notwithstanding the time restrictions in paragraph (1) of this subsection, a committed person may apply for a change in conditional release at any time if the application is accompanied by an affidavit of a physician or licensed psychologist that states an improvement in the mental condition of the committed person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">Whether CP \u00a7 3-122 authorizes the extension of the conditions of a release after the expiration of the immediately previous order depends on the legislative intent underlying the choice to use in the statute the terms \u2014 \u201cany time\u201d in (a)(1)\u00ae, \u201cshall\u201d in (c), and \u201cextend\u201d in (e)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">Harrison-Solomon, pondering the use of \u201cextend\u201d in CP \u00a7 3 \u2014 122(c)(5), argues that its plain meaning is that the General Assembly intended for extensions of a patient\u2019s condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>tional release to be valid only if the current conditional release order was in effect at the time the extension is granted. According to him, the conditions may not be \u201cextended\u201d where, as here, the order of conditional release expired before the Circuit Court acted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, \u201cextend\u201d has been defined as \u201cto continue; to prolong.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New Universal Unabridged </em>645 (1983).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For something to be continuous, a stop- and-start scenario would be inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">It is not uncommon, however, for courts to extend or prolong a deadline or time period retrospectively (often referred to still by reference to the Latin phrase <em>\u201cnunc pro tunc\u201d </em>\u2014 \u201cthen as now\u201d). Opportunities for retrospective extensions are recognized in Maryland and Federal courts. <em>See </em>Md. Rule l-204(a) (allowing courts to extend a deadline before its expiration and, if the failure to act to seek timely an extension was the result of excusable neglect, after its expiration); <em>Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs. v. Neal, </em>160 Md.App. 496, 509, 864 A.2d 287, 294 (2004) (\u201cRule 7-204 expressly grants the court discretion to extend the time for filing a response to the petition; and the language of Rule 7-204 does not preclude the court from exercising that discretion to extend the filing deadline retroactively, after it has passed\u201d); <em>Birt v. Surface Transp. Bd., </em>90 F.3d 580, 589 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>(D.C.Cir.1996) (holding that the Interstate Commerce Commission had authority to extend retrospectively a Certificate of Interim Trail Use eight days after the Certificate had expired); <em>In re Minh Vu Hoang, </em>484 B.R. 87 (D.Md.2012) (retrospectively granting a motion for extension of time to file motions). These circumstances do not support Harrison-Solomon\u2019s interpretation of \u201cextend\u201d in CP \u00a7 3-122(c)(5), even if the dictionary definition tends to support his reading and might suggest ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The other key statutory terms tend to support the State\u2019s reading. Criminal Procedure \u00a7 3 \u2014 122(a)(l)(i) states that \u201c[a]n application to the court for a change in conditional release of a committed person may be made by the Health Department or the State\u2019s Attorney at <em>any </em>time____\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Further, CP \u00a7 3-122(c) states that \u201c[a]fter the court considers the application for change in conditional release and the evidence, in accordance with \u00a7 3-114 of this title, the court <em>shall </em>\u201d either change the set of conditions, revoke the release, continue the present conditions, or extend the conditional release. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The term \u201cany time\u201d is not ambiguous. We have considered frequently the meaning of \u201cshall\u201d as used in statutes. \u201cAs this Court and the intermediate appellate court have reiterated on numerous occasions, the word \u2018shall\u2019 indicates the intent that a provision is mandatory.\u201d <em>Perez v. State, </em>420 Md. 57, 63, 21 A.3d 1048, 1052 (2011) (citing <em>State v. Green, </em>367 Md. 61, 82, 785 A.2d 1275, 1287 (2001)). Combining the terms, it appears that the Legislature intended here that the State or the Department may propose a change in the conditional release whenever it feels justified to do so (as long as it files the request during the \u201clife\u201d of an extant order), and the court is required to rule on the application (as long as it does so within a reasonable time, as we shall discuss <em>infra </em>Part II.B). The statute provides no specific time parameters for filing the application or ruling by the court. Because a court is required to take one of the specified actions once the application has been filed, it retains jurisdiction to rule on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>request. We conclude that the text of the statute, as a whole, tends to support the State\u2019s position that the Circuit Court retained jurisdiction to rule on the Department\u2019s application after the facial expiration date of the 2006 Order of Conditional Release.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Although the Court of Special Appeals found that the plain meaning of the text was unambiguous, the reading offered by Harrison-Solomon is not entirely irreconcilable with the text. Thus, it does not follow necessarily that the meaning of CP \u00a7 3-122 is unambiguous. As noted, the text of the statute allows on its face for an application to change the conditions to be filed at <em>any time. </em>No time limits are set specifically for the filing of the application by the State or Department or the ruling by the court. The intermediate appellate court noted, however, that \u201c[i]n a situation where an application is not filed within the term of conditional release, however, once the [Order of Conditional Release] expires, the court no longer would have jurisdiction to extend it.\u201d <em>Harrison-Solomon, </em>216 Md.App. at 151 n. 10, 85 A.3d at 319 n. 10. Thus, an aroma of ambiguity lingers in the air.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Against that whiff of ambiguity, we shall look, in an abundance of caution, to other signposts to discern the direction of legislative intent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>\n<em>2. CP \u00a7 3-122 Viewed in the Context of the Relevant Title of the Maryland Code</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">Other provisions of Title 3 of the Criminal Procedure Article point in the direction of the interpretation of the text of CP \u00a7 3-122 urged by the Department. The General Assembly demonstrated elsewhere in Title 3 that it understood how to impose unambiguously temporal deadlines for various actions in other contexts. <em>See, e.g., </em>CP \u00a7 3-115(a) (\u201cWithin 50 days after commitment to the Health Department under \u00a7 3-112 of this title, a hearing officer of the Health Department shall hold a hearing----\u201d); CP \u00a7 8-115(c) (\u201c[A]t least 7 days before the release hearing is scheduled, the Health Department shall complete an examination and evaluation of the committed person.\u201d); CP \u00a7 3-116(a) (\u201cWithin 10 days after the hearing ends, the Office shall prepare a report of recommendations to the court....\u201d); CP \u00a7 3-116(d) (\u201cThe committed person, the State\u2019s Attorney, or the Health Department may file exceptions to the report of the Office within 10 days after receiving the report.\u201d); CP \u00a7 3-117 (\u201cWithin 30 days after the court receives the report of recommendations from the office: (1) the court on its own initiative may hold a hearing; or (2) if timely exceptions are filed, or if the court requires more information, the court shall hold a hearing....\u201d); CP \u00a7 3-118 (\u201cWithin 15 days after a judicial hearing ends or is waived, the court shall determine whether the evidence indicates that the committed person proved by a preponderance of the evidence eligibility for release, with our without conditions ... and enter an appropriate order....\u201d); CP \u00a7 3 \u2014 121(i) (\u201cAfter the court considers the report of the Office, the evidence, and any exceptions filed, within 10 days after the court receives the report, the court shall\u201d revoke, modify, continue, or extend the conditional release.).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>When CP \u00a7 3-122 is considered against the clear deadlines in other provisions of Title 3 of the Criminal Procedure Article, whether directory or mandatory, it seems obvious that the Legislature did not intend to impose a strict or finite deadline (jurisdiction stripping or otherwise) on courts deciding timely-filed applications to extend the conditions of a patient\u2019s conditional release. There is no obvious reason why the Legislature, if it intended to limit the jurisdiction of courts, would do so by forced inference (from a dictionary definition of \u201cextend\u201d as used in CP \u00a7 3-122, as argued by Petitioner), instead of using unambiguous language as it used elsewhere in the same title.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The context of CP \u00a7 3-122 within Title 3 of the Criminal Procedure Article suggests that the Legislature did not intend to strip the courts of jurisdiction to consider and act upon a timely filed application to extend a patient\u2019s conditional release after the expiration of the previous conditional release order, although we shall interject a judicial gloss to be discussed <em>infra </em>Part II.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\n<em>3. Legislative History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The legislative history of CP \u00a7 3-122 points in a similar direction. The genesis of the current scheme of commitment and conditional release of defendants in criminal cases who are found not criminally responsible was the \u201cTask Force to Review the Defense of Insanity\u201d created by Governor Harry Hughes in 1982. <em>See Anderson v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hyg., </em>310 Md. 217, 220, 528 A.2d 904, 906 (1987).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As a result of the report of the Task Force, Senate Bill 645 of 1984 was enacted by the General Assembly, altering significantly Maryland\u2019s insanity defense in criminal cases. <em>See id.; </em>1984 Maryland Laws Ch. 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The Task Force was created and submitted its recommendations in the wake of the verdict that John Hinckley was not guilty, by reason of insanity, of any crimes for his attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan.

According to the Task Force, it had become increasingly difficult to commit involuntarily individuals, even where treatment was in their best interest and would prevent future dangerous behavior. <em>Id. </em>at 9. The Task Force found also that many chronically mentally ill people found guilty of misdemeanors had become \u201c \u2018street people\u2019 in numbers that represent[edl a real contemporary problem.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These concerns motivated a legislative response.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Prior to Senate Bill 645, a plea of insanity and the introduction of <em>prima facie </em>evidence of insanity by a defendant necessitated that the State, in order to obtain a conviction, prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was sane when he or she committed the crime. <em>Anderson, </em>310 Md. at 220, 528 A.2d at 906. If the State failed to prove the defendant\u2019s sanity, the statute in existence before 1984 required the trial court to commit immediately the defendant for evaluation. <em>Anderson, </em>310 Md. at 221, 528 A.2d at 906. To continue commitment beyond the evaluation phase, the State was required to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant met the requirements for indefinite civil commitment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Meanwhile, a committed defendant could travel any of several avenues to secure release from commitment. He or she could pursue a direct judicial release proceeding provided for in the relevant statute, at which he or she had the burden of proving, by preponderance of evidence, fitness for release. <em>Id. </em>A habeas corpus petition provided also for judicial scrutiny of the confinement. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the defendant could seek an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>administrative release hearing at which the State had to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that continued confinement was appropriate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Senate Bill 645 reconfigured the allocation of the burdens of proof and made continued confinement and supervision of defendants found previously not criminally responsible somewhat easier to achieve by the State. During a criminal trial, the burden was shifted to the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she was not criminally responsible. <em>Id. </em>The initial commitment examination and hearing were discarded and, in their place, the defendant became automatically committed indefinitely. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the defendant, rather than the State, was charged with demonstrating eligibility for discharge, conditional release, or the necessity of changes in the conditions of release. <em>Id. </em>An aim of Senate Bill 645 was to make more difficult raising successfully an insanity defense and easier for the State to maintain restrictions on those found not criminally responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The tenth \u201cmajor\u201d recommendation of the Governor\u2019s Task Force concerned exclusively the status of conditional release. Report of Governor\u2019s Task Force at 31. The Task Force recommended that the General Assembly enact legislation to \u201c[pjrovide more efficient procedures for revocation of conditional release and permit the court to extend a conditional release for an additional term of 5 years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Task Force proposed language similar to the current CP \u00a7 3-122 for changes resulting from a violation of the conditional release and for applications to change conditional release in the absence of a violation. 1984 Maryland Laws Ch. 501 (HG \u00a7\u00a7 12-120 and 12-121).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> When the change of conditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>release was the result of a violation of the existing conditions of release, however, the Task Force recommended that the court, \u201cwithin 10 days after the court receives the report [from a hearing officer from the Department], the court shall\u201d make its ruling. Report of Governor\u2019s Task Force at 31. No such requirement was thought necessary for applications to change or extend conditional release in the absence of a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">The General Assembly accepted the Task Force\u2019s recommendations and did not include in the final version of Senate Bill 645 a deadline for changes in conditional release when there was no violation of the pre-existing conditions of release. 1984 Maryland Laws Ch. 501. The provisions for modifying a patient\u2019s conditional release in either instance appeared sequentially in the final Bill, so the Legislature would have been aware of the option of imposing a deadline. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The comments of the Task Force (which were included by the Legislature in the Session Laws of the Bill) demonstrate also that our interpretation of \u201cshall\u201d in this statute was intended. About the section of Senate Bill 645 that would be codified as HG \u00a7 12-121 (and eventually re-codified as CP \u00a7 3-122), the Session Laws reported favorably the Task Force\u2019s comment that \u201c[i]n subsection (c) of this section, the phrase \u2018court shall\u2019 is substituted for \u2018court may\u2019 to clarify that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the court is required to take one of the 5 specified actions if an application is appropriately made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The Task Force and the Legislature were guided by a desire to strengthen protection of the public from the inappropriate release and discharge of defendants in criminal cases who are found not criminally responsible.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Legislature made it more difficult for defendants to avoid punishment by claiming mental non-culpability and increased the State\u2019s ability to confine not criminally responsible defendants and require conditions for their release. There is no evidence that the Legislature intended to limit the jurisdiction of courts deciding an application for an extension of conditional release. On the contrary, the Legislature chose to refrain from imposing a finite deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\n<em>Jp. Policy Considerations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">When \u201cconfronted with ambiguity regarding legislative intent, it is our duty to announce a rule that we are convinced is best supported by sound jurisprudential policy germane to the pursuit of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Haas v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>396 Md. 469, 493, 914 A.2d 735, 749 (2007). In rare instances, considering the practical consequences of competing interpretations may outweigh other principles of statutory construction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">As Harrison-Solomon and the <em>amici curiae </em>point out, a Court reinstating conditions after a long period of time, during which they may have been unenforced or unenforceable, could raise some fairness and due process concerns. <em>See infra </em>Part II.B. In many situations the conditions of release, although deemed necessary by the court and authorized by the General Assembly, limit severely the patient\u2019s autonomy. For exam-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>pie, Harrison-Solomon was required by the 2006 Order of Conditional Release, among other things, to live in an outpatient facility, comply with all treatment and medication ordered by his doctors, and receive permission before visiting his parents. He was required even to consult with his therapists, and presumably comply with their decisions, if he sought to marry or to father children. It would be jarring understandably for someone who had been living without these conditions for a lengthy period of time, while awaiting a court\u2019s decision whether to reinstate them, to have them reimposed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Indeed, it is possible that some of the conditions ordered previously, such as participation in a specific outpatient or residential program, may become unavailable during the interlude if the patient became unenrolled, thereby perhaps defaulting to institutional confinement for inpatient treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The State contends that these concerns may be addressed through means other than limiting the jurisdiction of courts. A patient awaiting a court\u2019s ruling could seek a writ of mandamus or seek proactively a discharge or termination of the conditions. If the circumstances of a delay and reinstatement were to amount arguably to a viable claim of a violation of the patient\u2019s right to due process, he or she would be able to challenge the order on those grounds, without the need to impose a uniform and time-definite jurisdictional limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Although patients would have some avenues of recourse, the State\u2019s open-ended interpretation of CP \u00a7 3-122 might impose an additional burden and uncertainty on some. People suffering from a mental disorder, even if they were not a danger to themselves or others, might be less able than an unimpaired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>person to mount a legal challenge. Harrison-Solomon and the <em>amici curiae </em>highlight negative effects on patients released conditionally if the State\u2019s major premise is adopted without limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">That notwithstanding, the State presents persuasive considerations as well in support of its reading of CP \u00a7 3-122. For a court to order the extension of a patient\u2019s conditional release, the State or the Department must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the conditions of release are appropriate or the patient must fail to establish that he or she would not be a danger if discharged or released without conditions. <em>See </em>CP \u00a7 3 \u2014 122(b); CP \u00a7 3-114.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> For the application to be granted, the court would have to find that it was more likely than not that the patient was a danger to himself, herself or others.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> If a court would have ruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>otherwise to extend the order of conditional release (but for having lost jurisdiction), the public safety would be jeopardized and the patient would be released from the therapeutic environment required for his or her possible recovery and protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The State\u2019s concerns are mitigated by Maryland\u2019s civil commitment regime. If a patient only avoided being a danger to himself/herself or the public while following the conditions of release, failing to follow them could be grounds for commitment. Even though the State would have to prove dangerousness by clear and convincing evidence, rather than demonstrate that it was merely more likely so than not, <em>Addington v. Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418, 432, 99 S.Ct. 1804, 1812, 60 L.Ed.2d 323 (1979) (holding that civil commitment required clear and convincing proof), indisputably dangerous patients would not be released without conditions, according to Harrison-Solomon\u2019s interpretation. It is clear from the legislative history of Senate Bill 645 of 1984, however, that the Legislature wanted to remove from the State the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence the need for continued supervision of defendants found not criminally responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">We have long held that we \u201ccannot disregard the mandate of the Legislature and insert an exception, where none has been made by the Legislature, for the sake of relieving against hardship or injustice!,]\u201d except in extreme circumstances.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Schmeizl v. Schmeizl, </em>186 Md. 371, 375, 46 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>A.2d 619, 621 (1946); <em>c.f. State v. Fleming, </em>173 Md. 192, 196, 195 A. 392, 393 (1937); <em>Alexander v. Worthington, </em>5 Md. 471, 485 (1854). The policy concerns raised by Harrison-Solomon and the <em>amici curiae </em>do not tip ultimately the scale in his favor, so as to overcome the evidence of the Legislature\u2019s intent for courts to retain jurisdiction to rule on timely-filed applications to extend an order of conditional release.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\n<em>5. Decisions by Courts of Other Jurisdictions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The appellate courts of other states have held that their trial courts retain jurisdiction to extend conditional release or inpatient confinement for patients found not criminally responsible (or the respective jurisdiction\u2019s equivalent) after the term of their conditional release or inpatient confinement has expired, provided the application was filed before the expiration.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In <em>People v. Maglio, </em>398 Ill.App.3d 327, 338 Ill.Dec. 6, 923 N.E.2d 866 (2010), the Illinois intermediate appellate court considered a case on all fours with the question presented here. Maglio was found not guilty, following a bench trial, of two counts of first degree murder by reason of insanity and was eventually released conditionally for a period of five years.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 328, 338 Ill.Dec. 6, 923 N.E.2d 866. Two weeks before his conditional release expired, Illinois filed a petition to extend conditions for an additional period of five years and requested an evidentiary hearing. <em>Id. </em>The matter came before the court after expiration of the facial duration of the immediate prior order. The trial court denied the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>petition and subsequent requests for reconsideration, stating that it lacked jurisdiction over the patient after the expiration of the term of conditional release. <em>Id. </em>The Illinois appellate court reversed the trial court and remanded the case for further consideration.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The reasoning in <em>Maglio </em>is similar to the State\u2019s argument and the reasoning of the Maryland Court of Special Appeals in the present case. According to the Illinois appellate court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxP\">[T]he trial court could retain jurisdiction over defendant until the State\u2019s petition and supplemental motion were adjudicated. Pursuant to section 5-2-4(a-l)(D), after a petition for an extension is filed, the court \u201cshall\u201d hold a hearing regarding defendant\u2019s mental health. Here, the trial court was required to hold an evidentiary hearing regarding defendant\u2019s mental health, which it did not do. It appears from the record the trial court was mistaken that first, the State\u2019s petition had to allege a basis for extending defendant\u2019s conditional release, and second, that the court lost jurisdiction over defendant after his term of conditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>release expired even though the State\u2019s petition and supplemental motion had been filed prior to the term expiring.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzS\"><em>Id. </em>at 331-31, 338 Ill.Dec. 6, 923 N.E.2d 866. As in the Maryland statute, the use of \u201cshall\u201d in the Illinois statute indicates the legislature\u2019s intent to grant continuing jurisdiction until the trial court rules on the motion. CP \u00a7 3-122 contains additional language allowing the State or Department to apply for an extension at \u201cany time,\u201d a strong indication that Maryland courts retain jurisdiction to rule on applications after the expiration of the order of conditional release.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The Illinois court noted also another Illinois intermediate appellate court decision of potentially collateral consequence to the present case. In <em>People v. Marshall, </em>273 Ill.App.3d 969, 210 Ill.Dec. 318, 652 N.E.2d 1294 (1995), the term of conditional release for a patient found not guilty by reason of insanity expired without action by the State. <em>Id. </em>210 Ill.Dec. 318, 652 N.E.2d at 1296. Later, a report recommending an extension of the conditions of release was sent to the court, but the State and the patient agreed (initially) that the trial court did not retain jurisdiction to extend the conditional release. <em>Id. </em>The State requested ultimately that the hearing be placed back on the docket, however, arguing that the court retained jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>The trial court held that it retained jurisdiction to extend the patient\u2019s conditional release and committed the patient, who was no longer taking medication, to inpatient treatment. <em>Id. </em>210 Ill.Dec. 318, 652 N.E.2d at 1297. The intermediate appellate court reversed, reasoning that the specified term of the order of conditional release provided for discharge at the termination date, absent a motion filed by Illinois before the termination date.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>210 Ill.Dec. 318, 652 N.E.2d at 1299-1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>A New York court, in <em>Matter of Ramon M., </em>294 A.D.2d 59, 740 N.Y.S.2d 335 (N.Y.App.Div.2002), held that an order of conditional release could be extended even if it expired before the State filed a motion to extend. The case involved appeals from two patients found not responsible for crimes by reason of mental disease. <em>Id. </em>at 60-61, 740 N.Y.S.2d 335. The relevant New York authorities requested an extension for each patient\u2019s conditional release after their respective conditional release orders had expired. <em>Id. </em>at 61-62, 740 N.Y.S.2d 335. The trial court denied both applications for extensions, holding in one case that extensions \u201c \u2018must be made within the time period in which such order remains in effect, and not after it has expired[,]\u2019\u201d and in the other simply that the State\u2019s application was untimely for missing the deadline in the other. <em>Id. </em>The Commissioner of the New York State Office of Mental Health appealed both cases. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">The New York intermediate appellate court reversed the trial court and remanded the cases for further consideration. <em>Id. </em>at 68, 740 N.Y.S.2d 335. Central to the appellate court\u2019s reasoning was that the New York legislature \u201cdid not include any language limiting the ability of a court to extend an order of conditions after expiration.\u201d Noting the absence of clear legislative intent to limit the court\u2019s jurisdiction, the appellate court held that the purpose of the statute, to protect the public, required that the trial court retain jurisdiction to consider and act on the application.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 62, 65, 740 N.Y.S.2d 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>In <em>State v. Roland, </em>973 S.W.2d 665 (Tex.1998) (per curiam), the Supreme Court of Texas dealt with an analogous situation to the case at hand. Roland was found not guilty by reason of insanity of attempted murder and committed to inpatient treatment for one year beginning on 16 June 1994. <em>Id. </em>at 666. His commitment was extended on 13 June 1995 for an additional year. <em>Id. </em>On 31 July 1996, forty-seven days after the previous order expired on its face, the trial court extended the commitment for a second time. <em>Id. </em>The intermediate appellate court held that the trial court\u2019s failure to hold the hearing before the commitment order expired compelled Roland\u2019s release. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court of Texas reversed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Texas\u2019s statutory regime, at the time of <em>Roland, </em>provided two options at the expiration of a commitment.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The trial court either could discharge the patient or hold a hearing to determine if commitment should be continued, modified, or terminated. <em>Id. </em>If the trial court chose to hold a hearing, \u201cit must be held \u2018prior to the expiration of the commitment order.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Tex.Crim. Proc.Code art. 46.03, \u00a7 4(d)(5)). The Texas Supreme Court noted, however, that the statute did not specify any consequence for a court\u2019s failure to act timely.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Ultimately, the Texas Supreme Court held that although the deadline was framed in mandatory language, failing to hold a timely hearing did not strip the court of jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">As noted previously in this opinion, CP \u00a7 3-122 does not impose a finite deadline by which a circuit court must act on a timely-filed application for extension. <em>Roland </em>is informative because, even in a jurisdiction with a clear, mandatory dead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>line, a trial court\u2019s delay in deciding a motion to extend mandatory treatment until some presumably reasonable time after the expiration of the previous treatment term did not strip the court of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Harrison-Solomon has not identified for us (nor have we found) any jurisdiction in which a court becomes unable to extend commitment to inpatient treatment or conditional release because the court did not rule on a timely-filed motion to extend the mandatory treatment before the previous order mandating treatment expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\n<em>6. Analogy to Probation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Harrison-Solomon analogizes conditional release from inpatient mental health treatment to probation in a criminal case context, arguing that we should treat the end date of conditional release the same as the end date of a probation order for purposes of determining ongoing court supervision. Presumably, as the argument goes, the Legislature would not intend similar situations to have different outcomes. Although conditional release and probation are similar superficially, Petitioner\u2019s attempt at constructing this analogy crumbles because of the disparate foundational purposes of probation and conditional release.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Petitioner relies on <em>Carter v. State, </em>193 Md.App. 193, 996 A.2d 948 (2010), as his main support for this argument. Carter was granted probation before judgment in connection with a charge of second degree assault. <em>Carter, </em>193 Md.App. at 197, 996 A.2d at 950. As a condition of probation, Carter was required to pay restitution to the victim spread over his two year period of probation. <em>Carter, </em>193 Md.App. at 197-98, 996 A.2d at 951. Although Carter paid the restitution as ordered, the trial court (nearly a month after his probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>expired) extended his probation, subject to additional restitution for the victim\u2019s ongoing therapy expenses. <em>Carter, 193 </em>Md.App. at 202, 996 A.2d at 953. Carter appealed. <em>Carter, </em>193 Md.App. at 203, 996 A.2d at 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The Court of Special Appeals vacated the order of the trial court. <em>Carter, </em>193 Md.App. at 214, 996 A.2d at 960. According to our appellate brethren, \u201cin the absence of a probation violation, a court does not have jurisdiction to extend the term of probation after the original term of probation has expired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The panel reasoned that the extension of probation was an illegal sentence that was not authorized by the relevant probation statute. <em>Id. </em>From this, Harrison-Solomon synthetizes an equivalent rule for orders of conditional release: in the absence of a violation of the conditions of release, a court does not have continuing jurisdiction to extend the term of the conditions after the facial term of conditional release expires. The attempted syllogism fails to recognize the essential differences between probation and conditional release of those found not criminally responsible.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Probation is a punishment. <em>See Donaldson v. State, </em>305 Md. 522, 530, 505 A.2d 527, 532 (1986). Although we have called probation \u201ca matter of grace\u201d and effectively clemency, <em>Scott v. State, </em>238 Md. 265, 275, 208 A.2d 575, 580 (1965), its fundamental nature is different from the treatment of people found not criminally responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Commitment of those found not criminally responsible and the restrictions of conditional release are not designed to punish, but rather to protect the public from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>patient and the patient from himself or herself. If the patient is unlikely to represent a risk to others or himself/herself, CP \u00a7 3-114 mandates that the patient be discharged if a court renders affirmatively such a holding. Although the State supervision could be indefinite potentially, it could also be relatively brief. Unlike someone subject to probation, there is no longer a determined time for which the patient will be subject to judicial oversight, absent an outright discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\n<em>B. Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Whatever the intention of the Legislature with regard to CP \u00a7 3-122, it must comply with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and its counterpart provision in Maryland, Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Under what the United States Supreme Court termed \u201cthe canon of constitutional avoidance,\u201d we will construe a statute to avoid conflict with the Constitution whenever it is reasonably possible to do so, even to the extent of applying a judicial gloss to interpretation that skirts a constitutional confrontation. <em>Koshko v. Haining, </em>398 Md. 404, 425-26, 921 A.2d 171, 183 (2007) (citing <em>In re James D., </em>295 Md. 314, 327, 455 A.2d 966, 972 (1983)). We do not presume that the Legislature intended to enact unconstitutional legislation and, if it did so intend, we would limit a statute to only those situations in which it would pass constitutional muster. <em>See Burruss v. Bd. of Cnty. Commissioners of Frederick Cnty., </em>427 Md. 231, 263-64, 46 A.3d 1182, 1201 (2012) (citing <em>Koshko, </em>398 Md. at 426, 921 A.2d at 184) (stating that a challenge to the facial validity of a statute must establish that there is no set of circumstances under which the act would be constitutional).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>AH Maryland \u201cproceedings are to be tested by fundamental fairness \u2014 the touchstone of due process.\u201d <em>State v. Bryan, </em>284 Md. 152, 159 n. 6, 395 A.2d 475, 479 n. 6 (1978) (citing <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 790, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973)). Similarly, the State has generally an obligation to apply for extensions in a reasonably diligent and prompt manner. <em>See State v. Berry, </em>287 Md. 491, 499, 413 A.2d 557, 562 (1980) (stating that probation revocation proceedings must be brought within reasonable time to satisfy due process).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Therefore, a circuit court must rule on a timely-filed application within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The State filed its application while Petitioner was subject clearly to the 2006 Order of Conditional Release and the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. Harrison-Solomon, through counsel, was aware of the pending application. The Circuit Court ruled on the application sixty-four days after the State filed its application, after making attempts to reach the parties and expedite its ruling. There is no indication in the record that either the State, the Department, or the Circuit Court failed to act with diligence or delayed the process to a point amounting to undue prejudice to or denying Harrison-Solomon due process.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Hence, the trial court acted within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">We hold that the Circuit Court retained jurisdiction for a reasonable time to decide the timely-filed application to extend the 2006 Order of Conditional Release, pursuant to CP \u00a7 3-122. All roads seeking interpretation of the statute lead to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the conclusion that the General Assembly did not intend to place a finite deadline by which courts must rale on timely-filed applications to extend conditional release pursuant to CP \u00a7 3-122. Further, a decision on a timely-filed extension request rendered after the expiration of an order of conditional release does not <em>ipso facto </em>violate due process, when decided within a reasonable time and where no undue prejudice is shown to have been worked on the patient during the time it took to decide the application. In the instant case, there is no indication of undue prejudice or that the Circuit Court delayed for an unreasonable time before ruling on the State\u2019s application for an extension on Harrison-Solomon\u2019s conditional release. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-9\">. Maryland Code (1982, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Health General Article \u00a7 12-108 (\"HG\u201d) was repealed and replaced by 2001 Maryland Laws Ch. 10 (S.B. 1) as part of a recodification initiative. No substantive changes were made. The statute is codified currently as Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol.), Criminal Procedure Art., \u00a7 3-109 (\"CP\u201d). The statute provides: \"A defendant is not criminally responsible for criminal conduct if, at the time of that conduct, the defendant, because of a mental disorder or mental retardation, lacks substantial capacity to: (1) appreciate the criminality of that conduct; or (2) conform that conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d CP \u00a7 3-109(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-8\">.

The Maryland Disability Law Center, On Our Own of Maryland, Mental Health Association of Maryland, and The Public Justice Center joined to submit a brief as <em>amici curiae </em>in support of Harrison-Solomon\u2019s interpretation of CP \u00a7 3-122.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b297-8\">. In certain of our cases, we stated that an investigation of the apparent purpose of the statute should accompany the textual analysis, even if the language is unambiguous. <em>See Williams </em>v. <em>Peninsula Reg\u2019l Med.

In other cases, we stated that our analysis ends if we find the language unambiguous. <em>Haile </em>v. <em>State, </em>431 Md. 448, 467, 66 A.3d 600, 611 (2013); <em>Stoddard v. State, </em>395 Md. 653, 662, 911 A.2d 1245, 1250 (2006). Keeping in mind the ultimate end of divining the will of the Legislature, however, it is clear that looking to other evidence of legislative intent is appropriate, even if merely to ratify that our conclusion of the unambiguous meaning of the statute is correct. <em>Bd. of Educ. of Baltimore Cnty. v. Zimmer-Rubert, </em>409 Md. 200, 214, 973 A.2d 233, 241 (2009) (\"we may resort to legislative history to ensure that our plain language interpretation is correct\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b298-10\">. As the State signals, even if CP \u00a7 3-122 could be read to impose a deadline upon the Circuit Court to act on the Application to extend the Order of Conditional Release before it expires, the Court would not lack necessarily jurisdiction to rule on the timely-filed Application. Statutory deadlines may be either mandatory or directory. <em>Woodfield v. W. River Improvement Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>395 Md. 377, 388, 910 A.2d 452, 459 (2006).

Further, we have been reluctant to find a loss of jurisdiction for a court\u2019s failure to meet even a mandatory deadline, if such a consequence is not required by the statute. <em>See Motor Vehicle Admin. </em>v. <em>Shrader, </em>324 Md. 454, 467, 597 A.2d 939, 945 (1991); <em>In re Keith W., </em>310 Md. 99, 103-04, 527 A.2d 35, 37 (1987); <em>State v.

CP \u00a7 3-114(b) allows \u201cfor discharge from commitment only if that person would not be a danger, as a result of a mental disorder or mental retardation, to self or to the person or property of others if discharged.\u201d CP \u00a7 3-114(c) allows for conditional release if the patient would not be dangerous because of conditions imposed by the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b300-5\">. The nature of this dispute does not require us to determine the vitality of the conditions placed previously on Harrison-Solomon\u2019s release between the expiration of the 2006 Order of Conditional Release on 3 July 2011 and its extension on 31 August 2011. It is not alleged that any conditions were violated during that period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b300-6\">. It is the sounder practice, when looking to the meaning of words used in a statute, for a court to \"resort to a dictionary, legal or otherwise, [which] should logically include consultation of those editions (in addition to current editions) of dictionaries that were extant at the time of the pertinent legislative enactments.\u201d <em>Harvey v. Marshall, </em>389 Md. 243, 260 n. 11, 884 A.2d 1171, 1181 n. 11 (2005). The language of CP \u00a7 3-122 had its genesis in 1984, <em>see </em>1984 Maryland Laws Ch. 501 (S.B. 645). Other dictionaries did not include the \"to continue\u201d definition of \"extend,\u201d <em>see </em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 439 (1989); <em>Extend, </em>https://www.google.com/7gws.nxN ssl#q=extend. Other alternative definitions attributed to \"extend\u201d in <em>Webster\u2019s New Universal Unabridged </em>did not contain any sense of continuance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b302-6\">. The State argues that the expiration of an order of conditional release (presumably without an application to extend filed before expiration) results only in termination of the conditions, but does not discharge the patient from the jurisdiction of the court under the statute. Title 3 of the Criminal Procedure Article contains no provision for releasing a patient without conditions (as distinct from discharging the patient). Discharge is governed, however, by CP \u00a7 3-114, which requires that the committed person prove that he or she would not be a danger if discharged. Because a person who is released conditionally has not demonstrated that he or she would not be a danger if discharged, it is conceivable, as the State argues, that the expiration of the conditions of release is not equivalent to a full and unqualified discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">We need not to decide in the present case whether persons released conditionally need to seek discharge to end the jurisdiction of the court to place conditions on them. Neither of the parties briefed nor argued significantly this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\">. The Court of Special Appeals considered also the purpose of the statute, its legislative history, policy considerations, and the interpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>tion of analogous statutes by the appellate courts of other states, finding ratification for its plain meaning reading of the text of CP \u00a7 3-122. <em>Harrison-Solomon v.

We presume, for the purpose of this analysis (without deciding), that a timely-filed application for extending an order of conditional release would not continue automatically the conditions during the period between facial expiration of the extant order and when the court ruled on the application. The present case does not require us to confront this question, and we decline to consider it in dicta. If such a circumstance in a future case were to come properly before us, other policy and due process concerns might arise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b310-6\">. CP \u00a7 3 \u2014 122(b) provides that \"[tjhe burden of proof of any issue raised by the application for change in conditional release rests with the applicant.\u201d Yet CP \u00a7 3- 122(c) indicates that the Court <em>must make </em>the determination of whether to change the conditions, impose additional conditions, revoke the conditional release, continue the present conditions, or extend the conditional release, in accordance with CP \u00a7 3-114. In turn, CP \u00a7 3-114(d) states that a committed person has the burden to establish that he or she either be discharged or released conditionally.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\">. Title 3 of the Criminal Procedure Article contains no provision for releasing a patient without conditions (as distinct from discharging the patient). This may be arguably possible, however, if the court retains jurisdiction until a patient obtains discharge under CP \u00a7 3-114. If such were the case, at the expiration of the order of conditional release the patient would be free from conditions, but not discharged, as the State argued in the alternative at oral argument as a sort of fall-back position. <em>But see infra </em>note 24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b310-8\">. Although multiple reasonable interpretations of the intersection of CP \u00a7 3-122 and CP \u00a7 3-114 are possible, the relevant standard requires proof by a preponderance of evidence. Whichever party bears the initial burden, the court determines whether it is more likely than not that the patient would be a danger if released with conditions or without conditions, as the case may be. <em>See Coleman v. Anne Arundel Cnty. Police Dep\u2019t, </em>369 Md. 108, 125, 797 A.2d 770, 781 (2002). The court is making the same finding of dangerousness if, for example, the State failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that a patient would be a danger without conditions as it would be if the patient failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>to show that he or she would not be a danger to be released without conditions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b311-8\">. The United States Supreme Court summarized the standard thusly, analogizing the interpretation of a contract to that of a constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8U\">But if, in any case, the plain meaning of a provision, not contradicted by any other provision in the same instrument, is to be disregarded, because we believe the framers of that instrument could not intend what they say, it must be one in which the absurdity and injustice of applying the provision to the case, would be so monstrous, that all mankind would, without hesitation, unite in rejecting the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATW\"><em>Sturges v.

Finding a defendant not criminally responsible under Maryland Law is not an acquittal, but rather operates as a release from punishment. <em>Treece v. State, </em>313 Md. 665, 676, 547 A.2d 1054, 1059 (1988). For purposes of commitment for mental disorder and subsequent conditional release, however, acquitting a defendant by reason of insanity under the law of Illinois is the functional equivalent of finding a defendant guilty, but not criminally responsible, under Maryland\u2019s scheme.

Even disregarding the fundamental differences between probation and conditional release from inpatient treatment of those found not criminally responsible, there is no reason the General Assembly could not treat them differently for less obvious reasons.
