The doctrine has been \u201c \u2018developed to identify appropriate occasions for judicial action.\u2019 \u201d <em>State Center, LLC v. Lexington Charles Ltd. Partnership, </em>438 Md. 451, 498, 92 A.3d 400, 427 (2014), quoting 13 Charles Alan Wright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3529, at 611 (3d ed.2008). Issues of justiciability may encompass unripe and moot controversies, abstract or hypothetical disputes, collusive lawsuits and claims by disinterested plaintiffs. John A. Lynch, Jr. &amp; Richard W. Bourne, Modern Maryland Civil Procedure 2-8 (2d ed.2004, 2014 supp.). \u201cWhen a court believes a litigant\u2019s claim is somehow unfit for judicial determination, it dismisses the claim under the rubric of \u2018justiciability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2-3. The rationale for the doctrine is that \u201caddressing non-justiciable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>issues would place courts in the position of rendering purely advisory opinions, a long forbidden practice in this State.\u201d <em>State Center, LLC, </em>438 Md. at 591, 92 A.3d at 483-84 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Ripeness is the issue in the present declaratory judgment action, which pits G &amp; C Gulf, Inc. (\u201cG &amp; C Gulf\u2019), Respondent, a towing company located in Montgomery County, Maryland, the victor at the trial level, against the State, with respect to towing statutes enacted by the General Assembly in 2012, currently codified as Sections 21-10A-01 through 21-10A-06 and 27-101(c)(25) of the Transportation Article of the Maryland Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The contested provisions provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Unless otherwise set by local law, a person who undertakes the towing or removal of a vehicle from a parking lot:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">(3) Shall notify the owner, any secured party, and the insurer of record by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first-class mail within 7 days, exclusive of days that the towing business is closed, after towing or removing the vehicle, and shall provide the same information required in a notice to a police department under item (2) of this subsection;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">(7) May not employ or otherwise compensate individuals, commonly referred to as \u201cspotters\u201d, whose primary task is to report the presence of unauthorized parked vehicles for the purposes of towing or removal, and impounding;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Md.Code Ann., Transp. \u00a7 21-10A-04(a)(3), (a)(7).

Anderson, </em>297 Md. 42, 45, 464 A.2d 1076, 1078 (1983) (\u201c[T]he existence of a justiciable controversy is an absolute prerequisite to the maintenance of a declaratory judgment action.\u201d). \u201cGenerally, an action for declaratory relief lacks ripeness if it involves a request that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>court declare the rights of parties upon a state of facts which has not yet arisen, or upon a matter which is future, contingent and uncertain.\u201d <em>State Center, LLC, </em>438 Md. at 591, 92 A.3d at 484. In <em>Hamilton v. McAuliffe, </em>277 Md. 336, 339-40, 353 A.2d 634, 637 (1976), we summarized the necessity of a justiciable controversy to a declaratory judgment action; we opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">That the existence of a justiciable controversy is a prerequisite to the maintenance of a declaratory judgment in Maryland is well settled. <em>Prince George\u2019s Co. v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>269 Md. 9, 304 A.2d 228 (1973). A controversy is justiciable \u201c \u2018when there are interested parties asserting adverse claims upon a state of facts which must have accrued wherein a legal decision is sought or demanded.\u2019 \u201d <em>Patuxent Co. v. Commissioners, </em>212 Md. 543, 548, 129 A.2d 847 (1957). It is thus clear that the declaratory judgment process is not available to decide purely theoretical questions or questions that may never arise, <em>Prince George\u2019s Co. v. Chillum-Adelphi, </em>275 Md. 374, 340 A.2d 265 (1975); <em>Liss v. Goodman, </em>224 Md. 173, 167 A.2d 123 (1961), or questions which have become moot, <em>Eberts v. Congress\u2019l Country Club, </em>197 Md. 461, 79 A.2d 518 (1951), or merely abstract questions, <em>Davis v. State, </em>183 Md. 385, 37 A.2d 880 (1944). That the declaratory judgment process should not be used where a declaration would not serve a useful purpose or terminate a controversy is equally well settled. <em>Liss v. Goodman, supra; Bachman v. Lembach, </em>192 Md. 35, 63 A.2d 641 (1949); <em>Staley v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>189 Md. 447, 56 A.2d 144 (1947).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The present action arose when G <em>&amp; </em>C Gulf filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County and requested a declaratory judgment, a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction and a permanent injunction against the State of Maryland, the Governor of Maryland, the Acting Secretary of the Maryland Department of Transportation<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>and the Attorney General of Maryland, challenging the constitutionality of Sections 21-10A-04(a)(3) and 21-10A-04(a)(7); the State\u2019s Attorney for Montgomery County and Montgomery County were later added as defendants. The complaint was amended again to reflect that, in 2013, the Legislature amended Section 21-10A-04(a)(3) to extend from three days to seven days the requirements for towing companies to inform \u201cthe owner, any secured party, and the insurer of record\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">In its complaint, G &amp; C Gulf alleged that its \u201crights, duties, status and legal relations are affected by\u201d the statute, and further, that it is \u201cin jeopardy of being charged with criminal offenses under provisions of [the contested statute]\u201d. G &amp; C Gulfs factual allegations were sparse, reflecting mainly G &amp; C Gulfs business practices and the roles of the various Governmental entities identified as defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">10. Plaintiff is engaged in the business within Maryland of the towing or removal of vehicles from parking lots which includes privately owned facilities consisting of 3 or more spaces for motor vehicle parking that are accessible to the general public and intended by the owners of the facilities to be used primarily by the owner\u2019s customers, client[e]le, residents, lessees or guests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">12. The [contested statute] governs the conduct of Plaintiffs business within Maryland of the towing or removal of vehicles from parking lots which include privately owned facilities consisting of 3 or more spaces for motor vehicle parking that are accessible to the general public and intended by the owners of the facilities to be used primarily by the owner\u2019s customers, client[e]le, residents, lessees or guests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">15. Plaintiffs rights, duties, status and legal relations are affected by the [contested statute].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>15. A. Defendants State, Governor, Attorney General, State\u2019s Attorney and County (through its Department of Police) have authority to enforce Maryland laws in Montgomery County, Maryland, and have authority to enforce the [contested statute] in Montgomery County, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">16. Plaintiff is in jeopardy of being charged with criminal offenses under provisions of the [contested statute] with which Plaintiff cannot comply and/or are arbitrary, oppressive and unreasonable, violate Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration Of Rights, violate the [D]ue [P]rocess [C]lause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, are void for vagueness, and are unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Additional allegations G &amp; C Gulf included reflected a history of the enactment of the statute, and a comparison of the statute to a prior, non-penal, Montgomery County towing statute. G <em>&amp; </em>C Gulf did not allege that it had been prosecuted or threatened with prosecution under the statute nor that it actually had engaged in activities prohibited by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">G &amp; C Gulf, specifically, alleged that Section 21-10A-04(a)(3), which now provides seven days for a towing company to notify the owner of a vehicle that his or her car was towed, \u201cis arbitrary, oppressive and unreasonable, violates Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights,[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] violates the [D]ue [P]rocess [C]lause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution,[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] is void for vagueness, and is unconstitutional\u201d, because it creates requirements with which towing companies cannot comply and that the violation of those requirements is criminalized. G <em>&amp; </em>C Gulf averred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>27. In the course of its business, Plaintiff tows vehicles insured by insurers not authorized to write a vehicle liability policy in Maryland. The [contested statute] does not require the Administration to provide towers with a database containing \u201cthe proper address for providing notice to an insurer under subsection (a)(3) of this section for each insurer\u201d not authorized to write a vehicle liability policy in the State. Absent the Administration\u2019s providing such information, Plaintiff will not be able to comply with the requirement to notify the insured under Section 21-10A-04(A)(3) ____ As of the date of filing this action, it is Plaintiffs understanding that the Administration will not make such information available to any tower free of charge. Because the notice provisions of Section 21-10A-04(A)(3) impose requirements with which a tower cannot comply, the State\u2019s exercise of its police power to impose such notice requirements is an arbitrary, oppressive and unreasonable exercise of its police power, violate Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration Of Rights, violate the [D]ue [P]roeess [C]lause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, are void for vagueness, and are unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">28. In the course of its business, Plaintiff tows vehicles that are not registered in Maryland (herein \u201cOut Of State Vehicles\u201d). The [contested statute] does not exempt towed vehicles which are Out Of State Vehicles from the notice provisions in Section 21-10A-04(a)(3); yet, the [the contested statute] does not require the Administration to maintain and make available to any tower free of charge a database for the tower to obtain the name and address of the owner, any secured party, and the insurer of record of Out Of State Vehicles in order to be able to comply with the notice provisions of Section 21-10A-04(a)(3). Because the notice provisions of Section 21-10A-04(A)(3) impose \u2014 requirements the violation of which are crimes \u2014 with which a tower as \u201ca person who undertakes the towing or removal of a vehicle from a parking lot\u201d cannot comply, the State\u2019s exercise of its police power to impose such notice require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>ments is an arbitrary, oppressive and unreasonable exercise of its police power, violate Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration Of Rights, violate the [Djue [Pjrocess [C]lause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, are void for vagueness, and are unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">G &amp; C Gulf also challenged Section 21-10A-04(a)(7), which prohibits towing companies from \u201cemployLing] or otherwise compensat[ing] individuals, commonly referred to as \u2018spotters\u2019, whose primary task is to report the presence of unauthorized parked vehicles for the purposes of towing or removal, and impounding\u201d, by alleging that it is arbitrary, oppressive and unreasonable, void for vagueness, violates Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and violates the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution. G &amp; C Gulf alleged that it is not a violation of the statute or Maryland law for individuals to have the primary task of reporting unauthorized vehicles, but it is a violation for towing companies to \u201cemploy\u201d individuals with the primary task of reporting authorized vehicles, so that Section 21-10A-04(a)(7) is unconstitutional:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">34. It is an arbitrary, oppressive and unreasonable exercise of the State\u2019s police power, a violation of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration Of Rights, a violation of the [D]ue [PJrocess [CJlause of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, are void for vagueness, and are unconstitutional, for the State to enact a law prohibiting \u2014 and making a crime \u2014 a \u201cperson who undertakes the towing or removal of a vehicle from a parking lot\u201d to \u201cemploy or otherwise compensate an individual whose primary task is to report the presence of unauthorized parked vehicles for the purpose of towing or removal, and impounding\u201d <em>when: </em>(i) it is not a violation of the [contested statute] or of any other Maryland law for \u201cindividuals\u201d to have the \u201cprimary task\u201d to \u201creport the presence of unauthorized parked vehicles for the purpose of towing or removal, and impounding\u201d and (ii) it is not a violation of the [contested statute] or of any other Maryland law for any \u201cperson\u201d to \u201cemploy or otherwise compensate individuals\u201d whose \u201cprimary task is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>to report the presence of unauthorized parked vehicles for the purpose of towing or removal, and impounding\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">G &amp; C Gulf contended that the phrase \u201cprimary task\u201d is void for vagueness, \u201cbecause from that language Plaintiff does not know what conduct on its part will subject it\u201d to a fine or imprisonment. G &amp; C Gulf alleged, additionally, that Section 21-10A-04(a)(7) goes against the additional requirement of Section 21 \u2014 10A.\u201404(a)(5)(iii) for the towing company to provide \u201c[pjhotographic evidence of the violation or event that precipitated the towing of the vehicle\u201d, because the towing companies cannot compensate individuals to gather and report the required photographic evidence without, in turn, violating Section 21-10A-04(a)(7). G &amp; C Gulf requested that the court enter a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction and a permanent injunction enjoining the State from enforcing Sections 21-10A-04(a)(3) and (a)(7) of the Transportation Article and to enter a declaratory judgment determining that the Sections are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">After the matter was joined, discovery ensued. G &amp; C Gulf, in a response to an interrogatory propounded by the State asking for it to \u201c[ijdentify, for each of the past five calendar years ... the number of vehicle[s] you have removed that are not registered in Maryland\u201d, answered that it had removed 1,848 vehicles not registered in Maryland in 2013, 2,417 in 2012, and 2,413 in 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Trial commenced on February 19, 2014, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. Montgomery County was represented by an Assistant County Attorney, and the remaining defendants were represented by an Assistant Attorney General. The Assistant Attorney General orally moved for summary judgment arguing that the case did not present a justiciable controversy, because there was no actual or threatened prosecution of G &amp; C Gulf under the statute. A colloquy ensued among the judge, the Assistant Attorney General and the Assistant County Attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>THE COURT: So, on behalf of the State of Maryland, are you offering a stipulation that [G &amp; C Gulf] will not be prosecuted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-4\">[ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL]: I can\u2019t do that. Frankly, Your Honor, that is not really the issue. When and if that ever happens, that is when it becomes a justiciable controversy. But I think if they have been towing to the tune of 1,848 vehicles and they have actually been towing \u2014 in 2012, they towed 2,417 and 2012 was actually when the law was in effect and nothing has happened to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">So, I think it is fair to say that if that holds, they are never going to be threatened with prosecution let alone even prosecuted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-6\">THE COURT: Ms. [Assistant Attorney for Montgomery County], do you want to say me too, or, take no position or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">[ASSISTANT ATTORNEY FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY]: Your Honor, thank you. Montgomery County has been named as a Defendant because our Police Department is the one that is enforcing the statute. But we don\u2019t really have a position either way. If the statute were declared unconstitutional, then, obviously, we wouldn\u2019t enforce it, but we are enforcing it now because it is the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-8\">THE COURT: When you say we are enforcing it now, if we morphed into opening statements, is that \u2014 would it be the position of the county that, in fact, you are ready to charge and prosecute or at least take to the Commissioner\u2019s Office the Plaintiff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-9\">[ASSISTANT ATTORNEY FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">The president as well as the general manager of G &amp; C Gulf testified. Neither of them, however, identified any prosecution, threat of prosecution, or any violation of the statute by the company. In closing argument, counsel for G <em>&amp; </em>C Gulf stated: \u201cI am not aware and I would be aware whether or not [the president of G &amp; C Gulf] or his company or anybody in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>the company had yet received a citation. I am not aware of that having happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">In response to the oral summary judgment motion, G <em>&amp; </em>C Gulf filed a post-hearing memoranda related to ripeness, in which it emphasized the statement made by the Assistant County Attorney for Montgomery County. G &amp; C Gulf posited that it was a judicial admission<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> by an entity which, through its police department, would enforce the statute. The State, in its reply, argued that the Assistant County Attorney\u2019s statement in open court was of \u201cdubious worth\u201d and did not constitute a specific threat against G <em>&amp; </em>C Gulf, because, <em>inter alia, </em>it was \u201cnot specifically directed at G &amp; C Gulf\u2019 and amounted to \u201cnothing more than a recitation of the County police force\u2019s intention to fulfill its general duty to enforce the law.\u201d The State contended, additionally, that \u201cthere was no evidence (or even allegation in any pleading) that the State\u2019s Attorney for Montgomery County has threatened G &amp; C Gulf or anyone else with criminal prosecution for violating this statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">On April 7, 2014, the Circuit Court Judge filed a written opinion in which he denied the oral motion. The trial judge relied on the Assistant County Attorney\u2019s statement in open court to find that G &amp; C Gulf had presented a justiciable controversy because \u201ccounsel for the Montgomery County Government (including its police department) stated the intention of that county government to enforce the new towing law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The trial judge next turned to the merits of the case and granted G &amp; C Gulfs requests for declaratory and injunctive relief as to Sections 21-10A-04(a)(3), (4)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (7). With <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>respect to Section 21-10A-04(a)(3), the trial court agreed with G &amp; C Gulf that it was \u201carbitrary, oppressive and unreasonable\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">The statute is <em>arbitrary, </em>not having provided a reasonable amount of time for the traditionally-required transmission of mail and a reasonable amount of time for processing out-of-state requests. It is <em>oppressive </em>since each violation could result in a misdemeanor conviction, fine and incarceration. It is <em>unreasonable </em>as applied, particularly in a jurisdiction (Montgomery County) located near other states\u2019 and the District of Columbia boundaries such that the towing company reportedly must handle many out-of-state vehicles whose registration and owners\u2019 information are not available except via mail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The trial court addressed Section 21-10A-04(a)(7) and determined that the phrase \u201cprimary task\u201d was void for vagueness. The trial court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">This Court agrees with Plaintiff that the scope of the term \u201cprimary task\u201d is sufficiently ambiguous that a reasonable person is required to guess at its precise meaning in context.

Ober, </em>199 Md. 203, 208, 86 A.2d 399, 402 (1952); <em>Hitchcock v. Kloman, </em>196 Md. 351, 356, 76 A.2d 582, 584 (1950); <em>Hammond v. Lancaster, </em>194 Md. 462, 473-74, 71 A.2d 474, 479 (1950). <em>Hammond v. Lancaster, Hitchcock v. Kloman </em>and <em>WAAM, Inc. v. Ober </em>are illustrative.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">In <em>Hammond v. Lancaster, </em>194 Md. at 469, 71 A.2d at 476-77, a group of plaintiffs, including college professors, teachers, a salesman, physicians and a sculptor, challenged the constitutionality of the Subversive Activities Act of 1949, which required, <em>inter alia, </em>State employees to make a loyalty oath or face criminal penalties under the statute. We determined the suit was not justiciable as, \u201c[n]one of the complainants ha[d] been threatened with prosecution, nor d[id] they allege any facts to indicate that they ha[d] violated, or [were] about to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>violate, any of the criminal provisions of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477-78, 71 A.2d at 481. A single plaintiff, as a state employee, fell under the provisions of the Act, \u201c[b]ut she [did] not allege that she [was] threatened with discharge, that she ha[d] been ordered to take an oath, or that she ha[d] refused or w[ould] refuse to take it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478, 71 A.2d at 481. We opined that \u201cthe general rule is that equity will not interfere to prevent the enforcement of a criminal statute even though unconstitutional. The mere existence of a criminal statute is not such a threat as to present a justiciable controversy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473-74, 71 A.2d at 479 (citations omitted). We observed that the constitutionality of a statute will not be evaluated by a court \u201c \u2018until faced with cases involving particular provisions as specifically applied to persons who claim to be injured.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473, 71 A.2d at 478, quoting <em>Watson v. Buck, </em>313 U.S. 387, 402, 61 S.Ct. 962, 967, 85 L.Ed. 1416 (1941). We stated also that \u201c \u2018[a] hypothetical threat is not enough.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473, 71 A.2d at 479, quoting <em>United Public Workers of America (C.I.O.) v. Mitchell, </em>330 U.S. 75, 90, 67 S.Ct. 556, 564, 91 L.Ed. 754 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Similarly, in <em>Hitchcock v. Kloman, </em>196 Md. at 354, 356, 76 A.2d at 583, 584, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of a suit challenging the constitutionality of a statute criminalizing the practice of medicine or surgery by individuals not registered as physicians or surgeons. Hitchcock, a naturopathy practitioner,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> filed a claim against the Maryland Board of Medical Examiners, the Police Commissioner of Baltimore City and the State\u2019s Attorney of Baltimore City alleging that the statute was unconstitutional and asking for a declaratory judgment that naturopathy \u201cis a separate and distinct branch of the healing arts and sciences and not included in the practice of medicine\u201d, as well as injunctive relief preventing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>the State from instituting criminal proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 353, 76 A.2d at 583. Hitchcock\u2019s complaint averred that the Attorney General of Maryland issued opinions explaining that naturopathy was not recognized by the State of Maryland and that those practicing naturopathy are violating the statute and thus subject to criminal prosecution. The State Board of Medical Examiners, based upon the opinions of the Attorney General, contended that naturopathy was a practice of medicine and surgery and, therefore, that the State was preparing to prosecute Hitchcock for the unlawful practice of medicine under the statute. We relied on <em>Hammond </em>and determined that there was no justiciable controversy, because Hitchcock did not \u201callege that he ha[d] been ordered to discontinue the practice of naturopathy\u201d, and there was \u201cno threat of interference by the Board of Medical Examiners, by the Police Commissioner and State\u2019s Attorney of Baltimore City\u201d which appeared \u201cbeyond that implied by the existence of the law and the opinions delivered by the Attorney General of Maryland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356, 76 A.2d at 584. We reiterated that the mere existence of a criminal statute did not present a threat sufficient to establish a justiciable controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><em>WAAM, Inc. v. Ober, </em>199 Md. at 208, 86 A.2d at 402, although addressing the issue of a litigant\u2019s standing, is also instructive. In <em>WAAM, Inc., </em>we affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of a declaratory judgment action when the plaintiff had not been prosecuted nor threatened with prosecution under an ordinance criminalizing advertising on Sundays. WAAM, Inc., a television broadcasting corporation, alleged that an ordinance that prohibited advertising on Sundays was unconstitutional and that the Police Commissioner of Baltimore City was unlawfully interfering with its business by threatening to arrest one of its customers, who refused to honor its contract. We noted that the plaintiff itself was \u201cnot threatened with arrest, and the person threatened [was] not a party to the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206, 86 A.2d at 401. We reiterated that \u201c[t]he general rale is that equity will not interfere to prevent the enforcement of a criminal statute, even though unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205, 86 A.2d at 401. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>noted that there is an exception to that rale, \u201cwhere the threatened prosecution affects property rights and will result in irreparable injury\u201d but determined that there was no showing of either. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">We determine, based upon our jurisprudence, that the instant declaratory judgment action is not ripe, because G &amp; C Gulf has not alleged nor proven that it has been prosecuted under the statute nor, in actuality, threatened with prosecution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> With respect to the threat of prosecution, in <em>Hammond, </em>we stated \u201c[t]he mere existence of a criminal statute is not such a threat as to present a justiciable controversy.\u201d 194 Md. at 474, 71 A.2d at 479. \u201c <em>\u2018A </em>hypothetical threat is not enough.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473, 71 A.2d at 479, quoting <em>United Public Workers, </em>330 U.S. at 90, 67 S.Ct. at 564, 91 L.Ed. 754. In fact, in G &amp; C Gulfs response to interrogatories, it demonstrated that it had continued with its normal course of business of towing out-of-state vehicles without any threat of enforcement. Nor does G &amp; C Gulf allege that any threatened prosecution affects their property rights and will result in irreparable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The purported threat in this case, according to G &amp; C Gulf and the circuit court ruling, rather, was evoked when the Assistant County Attorney proffered that \u201cwe are enforcing [the statute] now because it is the law\u201d, and answered in the affirmative the judge\u2019s question as to whether the Assistant County Attorney was \u201cready to charge and prosecute or at least take to the Commissioner\u2019s Office the Plaintiff\u2019. The judge found that the Assistant County Attorney\u2019s affirmative response constituted a judicial admission. \u201c \u2018A judicial admission is an express waiver made in court or before trial by the party or his attorney conceding for the purposes of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>the truth of some alleged fact. The party with the burden of proof is, therefore, relieved of that burden and the fact is deemed proved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bellamy v. State, </em>408 Md. 308, 327 n. 19, 941 A.2d 1107, 1118 n. 19 (2008), quoting 2 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence \u00a7 6:16 (15th ed.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">The affirmative answer of the Assistant County Attorney to the question proffered by the judge, though, cannot constitute a credible threat of enforcement, because, for the purported threat to constitute a threat of prosecution for purposes of ripeness, it must be specific to the litigant. <em>See Hammond, </em>194 Md. at 473-74, 71 A.2d at 478. Specific has been defined as, \u201c[o]f, relating to, or designating a particular or defined thing; explicit.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1616 (10th ed.2014). In this case the Assistant County Attorney did not specifically utter a threat of enforcement towards the litigant, G &amp; C Gulf. She merely affirmed that the County would enforce the statute because it is the law. Furthermore, G &amp; C Gulf did not aver that it had violated the statute or that it intended to violate the statute. The purported threat, therefore, does not constitute a credible threat of enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Accordingly, the present controversy is not justiciable.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">CERTIFIED QUESTION ANSWERED AS SET FORTH HEREIN.
