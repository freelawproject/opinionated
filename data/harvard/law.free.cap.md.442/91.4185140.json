Barton, Respondent, was admitted to the Bar of this Court on December 17, 2002. On February 25, 2013, May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>1, 2013 and October 23, 2013, the Attorney Grievance Commission, (\u201cPetitioner\u201d or \u201cBar Counsel\u201d), acting pursuant to Maryland Rule lO-YSRa),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed three separate Petitions for Disciplinary or Remedial Action against Respondent related to her role as the supervising attorney of the Cardinal Law Firm, located in Camp Springs, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In its initial petition, filed on February 25, 2013, in which Winifred Winston, Brent Ellis, Howard and Avon Chapman (\u201cthe Chapmans\u201d), and Joseph and Ernestine Johnson (\u201cthe Johnsons\u201d) were complainants, collectively identified as the \u201cComplaint of Bar Counsel,\u201d as well as Rosemary Tyner and Teresa Barnes, Petitioner alleged that Respondent violated the following Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cRule\u201d): 1.1 (Competence),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1.3 (Diligence),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 1.4(a) and (b) (Communication),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 1.5(a) (Fees),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 1.15(a) and (b) (Safe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>keeping Property),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 1.16(d) (Declining or Terminating Representation),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 5.1(a), (b) and (c) (Responsibilities of Partners, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Managers, and Supervisory Lawyers),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 5.3(a), (b) and (c) (Responsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer Assistants),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 5.4(a) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>(b) (Professional Independence of a Lawyer),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 5.5(a) (Unauthorized Practice of Law; Multijurisdictional Practice of Law),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and 8.4(c) and (d) (Misconduct).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In a second petition, filed on May 1, 2013, the complainants were Arnell Simmons, Gwendelyn Rhett and Winifred Winston, clients of the Cardinal Law Firm, and Respondent was charged with violations of Rules 1.1 (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), 1.4(a) and (b) (Communication), 5.3(a), (b) and (c) (Responsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer Assistants), 5.5(a) (Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>authorized Practice of Law; Multijurisdictional Practice of Law), and 8.4(d) (Misconduct). The Commission also charged Respondent with a violation of Rule 1.16(d) (Declining or Terminating Representation) with respect to Ms. Winston\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">In a third petition, filed on October 23, 2013, the complainants were Alma Miljkovic and Christine Gray-Knight, clients of the Cardinal Law Firm, and Respondent was charged with violations of Rules 1.1 (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), 1.4(a) and (b) (Communication), 1.15(a) (Safekeeping Property), 1.16(d) (Declining or Terminating Representation), 5.3(a), (b) and (c) (Responsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer Assistants), 5.5(a) (Unauthorized Practice of Law; Multijurisdictional Practice of Law), and 8.4(a) and (d) (Misconduct).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Commission also charged Respondent with a violation of Rule 1.5(a) (Fees) with respect to Ms. Miljkovic\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">By Order, we referred the initial petition to Judge Marielsa A. Bernard of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for a hearing, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-757.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>was personally served with the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action and the Writ of Summons, to which she filed a timely response.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">By Order, we referred the second petition to Judge David A. Boynton of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for a hearing, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-757. Respondent was again personally served with the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, our Order, and the Writ of Summons, to which Respondent filed a timely response. We issued an Order consolidating the first two petitions and transferred the second petition from Judge Boynton to Judge Bernard.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">By Order, we referred the third petition to Judge Bernard for a hearing, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-757. Respondent was served through counsel with the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, our Order and the Writ of Summons. Respondent filed a Motion to Extend Time and Consolidate Disciplinary Petitions. We issued an Order consolidating the third petition with the two other previously consolidated petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Respondent was served through counsel with Interrogatories, a Request for Production of Documents and a Request for Admission of Facts and Genuineness of Documents, to which no response was forthcoming. Bar Counsel then filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>an Emergency Motion for Sanctions pursuant to Maryland Rules 2-432 and 2-433, to which no answer was filed. On the Friday prior to the January 27, 2014 hearing date on the Consolidated Petition, Respondent responded to the discovery requests, albeit over two weeks out of time. On the hearing date, prior to taking evidence, after arguments of counsel, Judge Bernard granted Bar Counsel\u2019s motion and determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\">Based on the tardiness in Respondent\u2019s response to discovery (Respondent incompletely responded to Petitioner\u2019s discovery request in the afternoon on the last business day before trial, Friday, January 24, 2014), this Court deemed each Request for Admission \u201cadmitted\u201d but deferred ordering any relief so that such relief could be addressed if and when an issue arose at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">During the evidentiary hearings, Bar Counsel presented testimony from Gwendelyn Rhett, Teresa Barnes, Arnell Simmons and Winifred Winston, all of whom had been complainants included in the first and second petitions, as well as relied on the deemed admissions. Bar Counsel introduced various documents, which were admitted into evidence, including a Post-Trial Memorandum from the United States Trustee for Region 4 (\u201cTrustee Memo\u201d), as well as a Memorandum of Decision from the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland (\u201cBankruptcy Court Memo\u201d) to which was appended an Order directing Respondent to refund fees in the Winston case. Bar Counsel also introduced emails and letters between Respondent and Ms. Rhett, as well as the complaints to Bar Counsel from Ms. Rhett, Ms. Barnes, Ms. Simmons and Ms. Winston, and Barton\u2019s response to Bar Counsel about each complaint, which were admitted into evidence. Finally, a letter from Barton to Richard Tolbert, the former office manager of the Cardinal Law Firm, as well as an email exchange between the two, were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Barton testified on her own behalf; she was precluded from calling Leon Sutton, an individual who had served as a paralegal at her Washington D.C. office, as a witness, because of her failure to respond to the Request for Admissions. Respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>dent did introduce various documents, which were admitted into evidence, including correspondence between Respondent and M &amp; T Bank, a case list from the Cardinal Law Firm, two emails between Barton and Mr. Tolbert, an email from Barton to a document courier service, the federal Form 1099 for each of her employees from 2011, an application for statement of charges and a civil complaint filed by Barton against Mr. Tolbert, which were filed in the District Court of Maryland for Prince George\u2019s County and the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, respectively, as well as a case information document showing pending criminal charges against Mr. Tolbert.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Judge Bernard issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in which she ultimately determined that Respondent violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.5(a), 1.15(a) and (b), 1.16(d), 5.3(a), (b) and (c), 5.4(a) and (b), 5.5(a), 8.4(a), (c) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Judge Bernard\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law state:<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">In light of the admitted Requests for Admissions, the additional evidence submitted by the parties at trial, the trial testimony and the arguments of counsel, this Court finds the following facts to have been established by clear and convincing evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>1. Respondent graduated from Nova Southeastern University in August 1998 and was admitted to the Bar of the Court of Appeals of Maryland on December 17, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\">2. In 2010 and 2011, Respondent owned and operated a law firm located at 5897 Allentown Rd., Camp Springs, Maryland, doing business under the name \u201cCardinal Law Firm\u201d. Respondent owned and operated this firm. Respondent also maintained a law office in Washington D.C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">3. Respondent was the supervising attorney of the Cardinal Law Firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">4. Cardinal Law Firm regularly advertised in the local \u201cPennysaver\u201d advertising circular, holding itself out as handling bankruptcy cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">5. The Camp Springs office of the Cardinal Law Firm primarily represented clients regarding the filing of bankruptcy petitions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">6. Richard Tolbert (hereinafter referred to as \u201cMr. Tolbert\u201d) owned the building at 5897 Allentown Road, Camp Springs, Maryland, at which the Cardinal Law Firm was located.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-9\">7. Respondent employed Mr. Tolbert as the office manager for the Camp Springs office of the Cardinal Law Firm. Mr. Tolbert worked full-time at the Camp Springs office while Respondent primarily worked in her office in the District of Columbia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-10\">8. Mr. Tolbert, who is not licensed to practice law, regularly met with prospective clients of the Cardinal Law Firm, accepted their cases, and set the fee that would be charged by the Cardinal Law Firm. Mr. Tolbert led several clients, such as Winifred Winston, to believe he was an attorney and regularly met with these prospective clients before they met with Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-11\">9. Respondent permitted Mr. Tolbert to meet with prospective clients, to accept cases and set fees, and was aware that Mr. Tolbert was doing so on behalf of the Cardinal Law Firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>10. At trial, Respondent testified that Mr. Tolbert\u2019s duties were limited to taking client names and contact information and immediately forwarding this information to her. She indicated that he had no authority to charge client fees or to negotiate checks. This Court does not find Respondent\u2019s testimony to be credible, however, and it is contradicted by all of the other evidence submitted at trial. In a letter to Richard Tolbert (and apparently also sent to the U.S. Trustee\u2019s office), Respondent stated \u201cWe entered into an arrangement around September/October of last year 2010, where you would work for me as an accountant, office manager, book[k]eeper, and sometimes intake person, you collected money for the firm.\u201d Respondent also stated: \u201cI gave you the Maryland rules to read and told you what the legal fees for bankruptcy cases in Maryland were supposed to be, additionally you worked with other attorneys before, so you knew.\u201d Respondent further stated in the letter that she discovered that: \u201cMr. Tolbert spoke to new clients and had them sign retainers without giving me an accurate list of names and numbers who these clients are.\u201d Respondent also told William Ramsey, an Investigator with the Attorney Grievance Commission, that she collected and deposited fees at first, but later Mr. Tolbert took over that role, although Respondent asserted that this statement only pertained to fees she had previously quoted to clients she had already met. Several emails introduced at trial also indicated that Mr. Tolbert and the firm were accepting client cases and charging fees independent of Respondent\u2019s guidance. Respondent\u2019s trial testimony that she had, on several occasions, educated Mr. Tolbert and Ms. Crawford on appropriate and reasonable fees in bankruptcy cases only further details Respondent\u2019s level of participation and awareness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">11. Additionally, Arnell Simmons, Winifred Winston, and Gwendelyn Rhett, all of whom this Court found to be credible, each testified that Mr. Tolbert specifically informed them that Respondent would be the attorney handling their case. Each witness also testified that Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Tolbert provided them with contact information for Respondent during their initial meeting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\">12. Mr. Tolbert frequently advised clients regarding what type of bankruptcy petition would be appropriate to be filed in their case, routinely accepted retainers and fees from clients, and deposited the funds he received from the firm\u2019s clients in an account maintained under the name \u201cA. Barton Law Firm\u201d. This account was not an escrow account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">13. Respondent permitted Mr. Tolbert to deposit funds in her \u201cA. Barton Law Firm\u201d operating account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">14. Respondent was aware that Mr. Tolbert deposited client retainers in the \u201cA. Barton Law Firm\u201d operating account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">15. Respondent gave Mr. Tolbert a limited number of checks to disburse funds from the \u201cA. Barton Law Firm\u201d operating account to pay office expenses. Notably Respondent testified during trial that she continued to provide \u201cblank\u201d checks to Mr. Tolbert for several months after she had learned that Mr. Tolbert had stolen money from the firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">16. Respondent regularly received bank statements for the \u201cA. Barton Law Firm\u201d operating account during 2010 and 2011 but testified that she did not review them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">With respect to the specific allegations of Ms. Winston, the hearing judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">17. Respondent filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on behalf of her client, Winifred Winston (hereinafter referred to as \u201cMs. Winston\u201d) on or about March 10, 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-11\">18. Ms. Winston paid the Cardinal Law Firm a flat fee of $4,000.00, which Respondent disclosed on a Disclosure of Compensation filed in the Bankruptcy Court. Ms. Winston later paid the Cardinal Law Firm an additional fee payment of $526.00, but Respondent did not disclose Ms. Winston\u2019s $526.00 payment to the Bankruptcy Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-12\">19. Ms. Winston first met Respondent on April 21, 2011, at a 341 hearing on her bankruptcy case. Respondent arrived late for the hearing. According to Ms. Winston\u2019s testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Respondent was unprepared for this hearing and unfamiliar with Ms. Winston\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-4\">20. After the hearing on April 21, 2011, Ms. Winston discussed her case with Respondent and told her that she wanted to sell her condominium and to have the second mortgage removed. Respondent told Ms. Winston to contact Mr. Tolbert to discuss the issues regarding sale of the condominium and removal of the second mortgage. Upon contacting Mr. Tolbert, Ms. Winston was told that an additional fee would be required, which Ms. Winston paid by a check payable to the A. Barton Law Firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">21. Respondent failed to appear in court at a confirmation hearing in Ms. Winston\u2019s case on May 24, 2011. Ms. Winston testified that she had to make several calls to the Cardinal Law Firm in an effort to find Respondent to see if she would appear. Ms. Winston was told by office personnel that Respondent was on her way to court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">22. Ultimately, Respondent did not appear, but sent another attorney, Donya T. Zimmerman, in her place. Ms. Zimmerman had not met with Ms. Winston and was not familiar with her case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">23. During the representation, Ms. Winston made numerous attempts to reach Respondent to discuss her case, but Respondent failed to return her calls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">24. Ms. Winston discharged Respondent as her counsel on October 12, 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">25. In February 2012, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland ordered Respondent to refund $3,776.00 to Ms. Winston within 60 days. The Bankruptcy Court ordered the refund because it found that Respondent improperly failed to appear at the May 24, 2011 hearing, had been unresponsive to Ms. Winston\u2019s inquiries, failed to file an amended plan, and gave her inaccurate advice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">26. Respondent confirmed during her testimony at trial that she has not refunded any fees to Ms. Winston.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">With respect to the complaints of Brent Ellis, the Chapmans and the Johnsons, the hearing judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>27. Respondent filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on behalf of Brent Ellis (hereinafter referred to as \u201cMr. Ellis\u201d) on or about August 5, 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\">28. Respondent filed a Disclosure of Compensation in Mr. Ellis\u2019 case, reporting that Mr. Ellis paid a flat fee of $4,500.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">29. Respondent filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on behalf of her clients, Howard and Avon Chapman (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Chapmans\u201d) on or about August 11, 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">30. Respondent received a fee of $4,000.00 from the Chap-mans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">31. The Chapmans paid the fee by a check to the A. Barton Law Firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">32. Mr. Tolbert set the fee and directed the Chapmans to make their check payable to the Cardinal Law Firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">33. The United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland ordered Ms. Barton to refund $2,000.00 to the Chapmans, finding that her filing of the Chapter 13 petition was a \u201cuseless act that could not accomplish anything\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">34. Respondent has not refunded any portion of the Chap-mans\u2019 fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">35. Respondent filed a bankruptcy petition on behalf of Joseph and Ernestine Johnson (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Johnsons\u201d) on August 11, 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\">36. Respondent\u2019s firm received a fee of $4,500.00 from the Johnsons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-13\">37. The Johnsons initially met with Mr. Tolbert, who advised them that they should file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-14\">38. Mr. Tolbert informed the Johnsons that the Cardinal Law Firm would charge them a $4,500.00 fee for representing them in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding and led the Johnsons to believe that he was an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-15\">39. Respondent first met with the Johnsons on November 30, 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>40. At the time the Cardinal Law Firm represented the Johnsons, Respondent was the only attorney employed by the Cardinal Law Firm licensed to practice law in Maryland or before the United States District Court for the District of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-4\">41. On March 21, 2012, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland ordered Respondent to refund $3,000.00 to the Johnsons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">42. Respondent has not refunded any portion of the John-sons\u2019 fee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">With respect to the complaint of Ms. Tyner, the hearing judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">43. Rosemary Tyner (hereinafter referred to as \u201cMs. Tyner\u201d) retained the Cardinal Law Firm to represent her regarding a bankruptcy matter in October 2010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">44. Ms. Tyner initially met with Mr. Tolbert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">45. Mr. Tolbert advised Ms. Tyner to stop paying her mortgage payments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">46. Mr. Tolbert advised Ms. Tyner to use the money saved from not making her mortgage payment to pay her fee to the Cardinal Law Firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">47. Ms. Tyner paid the Cardinal Law Firm $4,500.00 as her fee to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-12\">48. Ms. Tyner met Respondent at her pre-confirmation hearing on February 19, 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-13\">49. At the pre-confirmation hearing on February 19, 2011, Respondent showed Ms. Tyner a copy of a payment plan to be submitted on her behalf. Ms. Tyner had not been shown the payment plan prior to the pre-confirmation hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-14\">50. Ms. Tyner attempted to communicate with Respondent about the status of her case but Respondent failed to keep her informed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-15\">51. Ms. Tyner\u2019s bankruptcy petition was dismissed after Respondent failed to appear in court for a hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-16\">52. In October 2011, Mr. Tolbert contacted Ms. Tyner to say that she was late in making a payment on her automo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>bile loan and that she should bring in $500.00 to Mr. Tolbert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\">53. Pursuant to Mr. Tolbert\u2019s request, Ms. Tyner delivered to Mr. Tolbert $300.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">54. Ms. Tyner later learned that her automobile loan payment was not late.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">55. Respondent has not accounted for the $300.00 paid by Ms. Tyner and has not returned those funds to her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">With respect to the complaint of Ms. Barnes, the hearing judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">56. The Cardinal Law Firm filed a bankruptcy petition on behalf of Teresa P. Barnes (hereinafter referred to as \u201cMs. Barnes\u201d) on April 19, 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">57. Ms. Barnes paid the Cardinal Law Firm a fee of $4,474.00 by a check payable to the A. Barton Law Firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">58. Ms. Barnes initially met with Mr. Tolbert, who advised her on what kind of bankruptcy petition to file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-11\">59. Mr. Tolbert informed Ms. Barnes of the amount of the fee she would be charged by the Cardinal Law Firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-12\">60. On February 8, 2012, Ms. Barnes received a summons regarding a suit filed against her by Discover Bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-13\">61. Ms. Barnes attempted to contact Mr. Tolbert, who did not respond to her calls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-14\">62. Ms. Barnes contacted Respondent by telephone in February 2012.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-15\">63. Respondent informed Ms. Barnes that she had no knowledge of Ms. Barnes\u2019s case, and that she was no longer affiliated with the Cardinal Law Firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-16\">64. Respondent did no work on Ms. Barnes\u2019s bankruptcy case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-17\">65. Respondent has not refunded any portion of the fee paid by Ms. Barnes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-18\">With respect to the complaint of Ms. Simmons, Judge Bernard found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>66. Arnell W. Simmons (hereinafter referred to as \u201cMs. Simmons\u201d) retained the Cardinal Law Firm in December 2010, to represent her regarding a bankruptcy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-4\">67. Ms. Simmons paid to the Cardinal Law Firm $4,774.00 by checks payable to the A. Barton Law Firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">68. Ms. Simmons initially met with Mr. Tolbert to discuss her case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">69. Mr. Tolbert accepted her case, informed her of the fee, and advised her that she should file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">70. Ms. Simmons later met with an associate of Respondent, who is an attorney. That attorney advised Ms. Simmons to file a Chapter 18 petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">71.

Ms. Gray-Knight has not received a refund of any portion of her retainer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Judge Bernard then proceeded to her Conclusions of Law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">In the proceedings before the Court, the Petitioner has the burden of proving the allegations by clear and convincing evidence. The Respondent has the burden of proving a matter of affirmative defense or mitigation by a preponderance of the evidence. In each matter, Petitioner charged Respondent with a violation of Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.15, 1.16, 5.3, 5.5, and 8.4 of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (hereinafter \u201cMLRPC\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-10\">The Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent violated Rule 1.1 by failing to respond to clients\u2019 repeated requests for information, failing to attend hearings on behalf of clients, failing to file bankruptcy petitions, and failing to properly further the objectives of her clients. In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Ficker, </em>349 Md. 13, 42, 706 A.2d 1045, 1059 (1998), the Court of Appeals stated: \u201c[T]he lawyer does have a duty to his or her client to remain diligent\u201d. The evidence in this case clearly demonstrated that the Respondent abdicated her responsibility to supervise Mr. Tolbert and the other Maryland office employees, and provided inadequate representation to her clients despite taking a fee in each case. \u201cCompliance with [Rule 1.1] requires more than knowing what to do. It requires applying the knowledge to the client\u2019s problem.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. McCulloch, </em>404 Md. 388, 397-98, 946 A.2d 1009, 1015 (2008). The Court of Appeals has said \u201c[e]vidence of a failure to apply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>requisite thoroughness and/or preparation in representing a client is sufficient alone to support a violation of Rule 1.1.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 54, 891 A.2d 1085, 1097 (2006). Such acts also demonstrate a lack of \u201cdiligence and promptness\u201d in violation of Rule 1.3. <em>McCulloch, </em>404 Md. at 398, 946 A.2d at 1015. (\u201cThe evidence shows that respondent failed to act with \u2018diligence and promptness\u2019 as required by Rule 1.3, for the same reasons discussed under Rules 1.1 and 1.2.\u201d). As in McCulloch and <em>Guida, </em>Respondent took a fee in each case but failed to do any cognizable work of value to the client. Therefore, Respondent, in each complaint, violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, and 8.4(a) and (d) of the MLRPC. <em>See Attorney Grievance Commission v. Nelson, </em>425 Md. 344, 363, 40 A.3d 1039, 1050 (2012). The Respondent through her persistent conduct clearly violated Rule 8.4(d), which states that it is professional misconduct to \u201cengage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d Rule 8.4(a) was also violated when Respondent breached the other Rules of Professional Conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">Respondent is also charged in each complaint with a violation of Rule 1.4(a) and (b) of the MLRPC. Each and every witness testified to having difficulties contacting Respondent, and in some cases, being unable to contact Respondent entirely. In Ms. Simmons\u2019 case, Respondent failed to adequately communicate with both Ms. Simmons and her creditors. Respondent did not keep her clients informed regarding the status of their case or respond to their attempts to communicate with her. Moreover, to the extent that Respondent had difficulties with her personal health of which she testified, or with Mr. Tolbert and the Cardinal Law Firm, Respondent failed to inform her clients of these problems and any others that limited her ability to represent them. Thus, in each matter, Respondent violated Rule 1.4(a) and (b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">Respondent violated Rules 5.3(a), (b) and (c) by failing to properly supervise Mr. Tolbert and the rest of the Cardinal Law Firm. It is undisputed that Mr. Tolbert met with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>clients, quoted fees, provided legal advice to clients, and held himself out as an attorney. Mr. Tolbert was able to do so because Respondent was not in the office to supervise him and had not made any efforts to ensure that his conduct was compatible with Respondent\u2019s professional obligations. Mr. Tolbert also mishandled law firm and client funds, and deposited unearned funds into a business account, not an escrow account. Respondent was not only aware of this conduct; Respondent permitted this conduct and instructed both Mr. Tolbert and Ms. Crawford[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>] so that the law office could effectively function without Respondent\u2019s presence. More troubling perhaps is Respondent\u2019s admission that she provided blank checks to Mr. Tolbert after she learned that he had stolen client money from the firm. In fact, Respondent gave Mr. Tolbert total control of the firm bank accounts. Respondent testified that she did not review the bank statements, even after she had caught him stealing. Such conduct can only be seen as enabling and ratification of the misconduct. Despite Respondent\u2019s testimony that she knew Mr. Tolbert \u201cdid not listen\u201d she continued to condone his conduct. The Court did not find the Respondent to be at all credible in her denial of Mr. Tolbert\u2019s actions. She repeatedly testified that she knew that Mr. Tolbert \u201cdid not listen,\u201d but did not take any affirmative action to deter or stop his behavior. In fact she testified that she continued to pay Mr. Tolbert up until July, 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\">Respondent knowingly permitted Mr. Tolbert to handle client intake, which included quoting fees (based upon an evaluation of the prospective client\u2019s case) and providing legal advice, and therefore, assisted Mr. Tolbert in engaging in the unauthorized practice of law in violation of Rules 5.5(a) and 8.4(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">Respondent violated Rule 1.16(d) in the Winston, Miljkovic, Gray-Knight, Tyner, Barnes and Bar Counsel complaints for failing to return unearned fees paid to Respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>dent by each client. The fees charged to those clients, while the respective fee may not have been unreasonable on its face, became unreasonable because Respondent did no work of value, or at all, in their case, in violation of Rule 1.5(a). <em>See Guida, </em>391 Md. at 54, 891 A.2d at 1096-97.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\">Respondent\u2019s failure to disclose the receipt of an additional $526.00 payment from Winston to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court is a violation of Rule 8.4(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">Respondent\u2019s failure to maintain unearned fees of Cardinal Law Firm clients in an attorney trust account, and instead maintaining those fees in the A. Barton Law Firm checking account along with firm funds used to pay expenses and employees, without written informed consent of the clients violated Rule 1.15(a) and (b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">Lastly, Petitioner alleged in its Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action that Respondent shared fees from cases with Mr. Tolbert in violation of Rule 5.4, which Respondent vehemently denied at trial. Notwithstanding that denial, this Court again finds Respondent\u2019s testimony not credible. The evidence submitted at trial, coupled with Respondent\u2019s testimony, demonstrated that Respondent paid Mr. Tolbert $1,000.00 every two (2) weeks. On cross-examination, Respondent stated that Mr. Tolbert did not receive any additional salary on top of the $1,000.00 and that in 2011 Respondent was only paid for six months, until the end of June, 2011. Yet according to Mr. Tolbert\u2019s 1099 for 2011, submitted into evidence during Respondent\u2019s case, Respondent paid Mr. Tolbert $48,000.00 in 2011. Even if Respondent paid Mr. Tolbert for the entire 2011 year, Respondent would have only earned $26,000.00. Since Respondent testified that Mr. Tolbert was not paid any additional money, the only logical conclusion is that Respondent shared fees with Mr. Tolbert.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Judge Bernard also concluded as to the mitigating factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkT\">Having determined that Respondent violated the various previously referenced Rules, the Court turns now to the mitigation evidence presented by Respondent. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>determines by a preponderance of the evidence, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-757(b) that the following factor mitigates the misconduct charged in this case. Respondent testified that she took over 50 cases pro bono, filing them in Maryland. She indicated that she had to take on a second job, in addition to the document reviews that she was doing, in order to pay the filing fees and other associated costs. She testified that she spoke with creditors, mortgage companies, etc. in order to try to protect the interests of the clients that she was handling on a pro bono basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\">The Court did not find that Respondent\u2019s illness in any way would mitigate the previously referenced violations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\u201cThis Court has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings in Maryland.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. O\u2019Leary, </em>433 Md. 2, 28, 69 A.3d 1121, 1136 (2013), quoting <em>Attorney Grievance v. Chapman, </em>430 Md. 238, 273, 60 A.3d 25, 46 (2013). We conduct an independent review of the record and we accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact unless shown to be clearly erroneous. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Lara, </em>418 Md. 355, 14 A.3d 650 (2011). \u201cUnder our independent review of the record, we must determine whether the findings of the hearing judge are based on clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 73, 753 A.2d 17, 26 (2000). With respect to exceptions, upon our review of the record, \u201cthe hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact generally will be accepted unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d Maryland Rule 16 \u2014 759(b)(2); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Whitehead, </em>405 Md. 240, 253, 950 A.2d 798, 806 (2008). \u201cA hearing judge\u2019s factual finding is not clearly erroneous if there is any competent material evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. McDonald, </em>437 Md. 1, 16, 85 A.3d 117, 125 (2014) (internal quotation omitted). As to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, such as whether provisions of the MLRPC were violated, our consideration is essentially <em>de novo. </em>Maryland Rule 16-759(b)(l). Finally, as to the hearing judge\u2019s mitigation findings, Maryland Rule 16-757(b) provides that \u201cA respondent who asserts ... a matter of mitigation ... has the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>burden of proving the ... matter by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Bar Counsel did not file any exceptions to Judge Bernard\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law and recommends disbarment. Respondent has filed multiple exceptions in which she challenges various findings of fact, numerous conclusions of law and Judge Bernard\u2019s mitigation findings; at argument Barton\u2019s counsel suggested a reprimand, or at worst, a suspension for 90 to 120 days as a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Respondent initially challenges the use of the deemed admissions to establish the violations of the Rules alleged. She argues that the deemed admissions should not have been relied upon by the hearing judge as bases for the findings of fact and conclusions of law and that Bar Counsel was not prejudiced by her failure to answer within 30 days, because she eventually did answer the request for admissions, albeit on the eve of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">We recognize that the hearing judge, generally, \u201cis entrusted with the role of administering the discovery rules and, as such, is vested with broad discretion in imposing sanctions when a party fails to comply with the rules.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. O\u2019Leary, </em>433 Md. at 28-29, 69 A.3d at 1137, quoting <em>Attorney Grievance v. Kreamer, </em>404 Md. 282, 342, 946 A.2d 500, 535 (2008). With respect to the sanctions for failing to respond to the requests for admissions, Maryland Rule 2-424(b)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> provides that any matter for which an admission is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>requested is deemed admitted if a party fails to respond to the request within 30 days. Maryland Rule 2-424(d)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> provides that deemed admissions are conclusively established, unless the court permits their withdrawal or amendment, which the court may do if it will assist in the presentation of the merits of the action and if the party who obtained the admissions fails to satisfy the court that it will be prejudiced by the withdrawal or amendment of the admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Judge Bernard was within her discretion in deeming each Request for Admission admitted and not permitting their withdrawal on the eve of the hearing, as she rejected as inadequate the proffer by Barton\u2019s counsel that, prior to the hearing, Barton was unavailable to him and that he was in another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Respondent also appears to take broad exception to the hearing judge\u2019s credibility findings. In developing her factual findings, Judge Bernard discredited much of Respondent\u2019s testimony regarding the authority that she gave Mr. Tolbert in managing the Cardinal Law Firm in Camp Springs, as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>as his access to the firm\u2019s bank accounts and Barton\u2019s recollection of specific interactions she had with clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">We, generally, \u201cdefer to the credibility findings of the hearing judge.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Agbaje, </em>438 Md. 695, 722, 93 A.3d 262, 277 (2014). \u201cThe hearing judge is in the best position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and to decide which one to believe and, as we have said, to pick and choose which evidence to rely upon.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Monfried, </em>368 Md. 373, 390, 794 A.2d 92, 101 (2002); <em>see also Attorney Grievance v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 17, 741 A.2d 1143, 1152 (1999) (stating that the hearing judge is \u201cin the best position to assess first hand a witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d). As we have stated, a hearing judge is \u201cfree to disregard the testimony of respondent if the judge believed the evidence was not credible.\u201d <em>Monfried, </em>368 Md. at 390, 794 A.2d at 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Respondent excepts to Judge Bernard\u2019s finding that \u201cRespondent permitted Mr. Tolbert to meet with prospective clients, to accept cases and set fees, and was aware that Mr. Tolbert was doing so on behalf of the Cardinal Law Firm\u201d, based on her own testimony during the hearing that she did not leave Mr. Tolbert in charge of the firm and he did not have the authority to accept clients, give legal advice, charge client fees or negotiate checks because he was not a lawyer; he was only to take the names and contact information of potential clients. Respondent also testified that she had no supervisory authority over Mr. Tolbert after March, 2011, because she had closed the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The hearing judge specifically stated that Respondent\u2019s testimony in regard to her supervision of and authority over Mr. Tolbert was incredible. In a letter from Barton to Mr. Tolbert, which was admitted into evidence as Exhibit R, Barton writes, \u201cwe entered into an arrangement around September/October of last year 2010, where you would work for me as an accountant, office manager, book[k]eeper, and sometimes intake person, you collected the money for the firm\u201d, and that, \u201cI gave you the Maryland rules to read and told you what the legal fees for bankruptcy cases in Maryland were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>supposed to be\u201d. Respondent also testified that she had told Mr. Tolbert about fee structures in bankruptcy cases, after Mr. Tolbert suggested that the firm charge higher fees. In terms of the amount of time during which Mr. Tolbert was employed, Judge Bernard had before her Exhibit 11 \u2014 federal Form 1099, which was accepted into evidence at the hearing and, paired with Barton\u2019s testimony, shows that Mr. Tolbert was paid by the Cardinal Law Firm up until July of 2011. Thus, we overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Barton also excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s findings that, \u201cRespondent permitted Mr. Tolbert to deposit funds in her \u2018A. Barton Law Firm\u2019 operating account\u201d, and, \u201cRespondent was aware that Mr. Tolbert deposited client retainers in the \u2018A. Barton Law Firm\u2019 operating account\u201d, based upon her own testimony that client funds were not supposed to be deposited in the A. Barton Law Firm operating account and that Mr. Tolbert was not authorized to deposit any client funds into that account. Barton, however, during the hearing, testified with reference to the operating account, that \u201c[Mr. Tolbert] could only deposit.\u201d Further, Barton testified at a November 30, 2011 hearing before the Bankruptcy Trustee, that, \u201cclients were told to pay A. Barton Law Firm because that was the name on the IOLTA and business bank accounts\u201d; she further testified that Mr. Tolbert \u201cwas in total control of the [IOLTA and business] bank accounts\u201d, according to the Trustee Memo, admitted into evidence as Exhibit B. We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Respondent also excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjX\">Respondent gave Mr. Tolbert a limited number of checks to disburse funds from the \u201cA. Barton Law Firm\u201d operating account to pay office expenses. Notably Respondent testified during trial that she continued to provide \u201cblank\u201d checks to Mr. Tolbert for several months after she had learned that Mr. Tolbert had stolen money from the firm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABa\">Barton initially testified during the hearing that she gave Mr. Tolbert no authority to write checks, but later testified that he was given checks from the A. Barton Law Firm business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>account to pay firm expenses. She further testified that she provided Mr. Tolbert with pre-signed blank checks for the A. Barton Law Firm business account, even after she caught him stealing money from the firm in February 2011. We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Barton also excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">In February 2012, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland ordered Respondent to refund $8,776.00 to Ms. Winston within 60 days. The Bankruptcy Court ordered the refund because it found that Respondent improperly failed to appear at the May 24, 2011 hearing, had been unresponsive to Ms. Winston\u2019s inquiries, failed to file an amended plan, and gave her inaccurate advice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Respondent excepts based on her testimony that she \u201csubstantially completed\u201d the work in Ms. Winston\u2019s case; that she would have completed Ms. Winston\u2019s bankruptcy were it not for her illness and that Ms. Winston\u2019s bankruptcy was eventually approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland (\u201cBankruptcy Court\u201d). The Bankruptcy Court Order undergirding Judge Bernard\u2019s finding, however, had been admitted into evidence as Exhibit C and recited, verbatim, what Judge Bernard stated. Ms. Winston\u2019s testimony before the Bankruptcy Court, and also during the disciplinary hearing, reflects that Barton was unprepared during the bankruptcy hearing, as well as that Barton failed to appear at another hearing. Ostensibly, Barton seemingly credits the eventual approval of Ms. Winston\u2019s bankruptcy petition as obviating the finding, despite the fact that it was Ms. Winston who represented herself ultimately and successfully in the Bankruptcy Court. We, as a result, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Respondent also excepts to Judge Bernard\u2019s finding that, \u201cRespondent failed to file required papers on behalf of Ms. Simmons, resulting in the Bankruptcy Court issuing a deficiency notice.\u201d Barton argues that although Simmons did receive a \u201croutine\u201d deficiency notice, \u201cit was corrected\u201d and the case proceeded to confirmation. Respondent again, thus, argues no harm, no foul; in reality, however, her client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>snatched victory from the jaws of defeat because Ms. Simmons acted to correct the problem. We, therefore, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Barton excepts to Judge Bernard\u2019s finding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">Ms. Rhett sent a message by electronic mail to Respondent on April 13, 2011, asking her questions about the status of her bankruptcy case.... Respondent replied to her email message on May 2, 2011, responding to her questions. ... In her May 2, 2011 reply to Ms. Rhett, Respondent did not indicate that she was no longer connected with the Cardinal Law Firm or Mr. Tolbert.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Respondent testified during the hearing that she was unaware that Ms. Rhett was a client and that she never authorized Mr. Tolbert to take any legal fees from Ms. Rhett.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The emails upon which Judge Bernard relied, however, were admitted into evidence at the hearing, as Exhibit I. Exhibit I reflects that, in her email of April 13, 2011, Ms. Rhett wrote that she had retained Barton\u2019s law firm and asked Barton numerous questions pertaining to her representation, including when her bankruptcy paperwork would be filed and what she should expect from Barton as her attorney. In Barton\u2019s reply, also contained in Exhibit I, three weeks later, Barton confirmed that her firm was representing Ms. Rhett, stated that she would file Ms. Rhett\u2019s bankruptcy paperwork as soon as possible, and assured Ms. Rhett that she would answer any questions by phone, email or in person. At no point in her May 2, 2011 reply did Barton state that the Cardinal Law Firm was shuttered, despite Barton\u2019s testimony that she closed the firm after March 1, 2011; rather, Respondent confirmed her representation of Ms. Rhett, offered that the firm\u2019s paralegals would be working with Ms. Rhett, and described what Ms. Rhett should expect during the bankruptcy process. We, therefore, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Respondent also makes several specific exceptions to Judge Bernard\u2019s findings concerning the allegations of individual complainants, specifically the allegations of Ms. Winston, Ms. Simmons, Ms. Rhett and Ms. Barnes.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s findings that, \u201cMs. Winston paid the Cardinal Law Firm a flat fee of $4,000.00, which Respondent disclosed on a Disclosure of Compensation filed in the Bankruptcy Court.\u201d Barton argues that she did not accept payment of Ms. Winston\u2019s $4,000.00 fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The issue is not, however, whether Barton had accepted payment, but whether the Cardinal Law Firm had. In making the findings, Judge Bernard relied on the deemed admissions as well as the Trustee Memo, which reflected that Barton affirmed, under the penalty of perjury, in a Disclosure of Compensation form required by the Bankruptcy Court, that Ms. Winston had paid Barton $4,000.00. We, therefore, conclude that Judge Bernard\u2019s findings were supported by clear and convincing evidence and overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Respondent next excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s findings that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">After the hearing on April 21, 2011, Ms. Winston discussed her case with Respondent and told her that she wanted to sell her condominium and to have the second mortgage removed. Respondent told Ms. Winston to contact Mr. Tolbert to discuss the issues regarding sale of the condominium and removal of the second mortgage. Upon contacting Mr. Tolbert, Ms. Winston was told that an additional fee would be required, which Ms. Winston paid by a check payable to the A. Barton Law Firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">Ms. Winston later paid the Cardinal Law Firm an additional fee payment of $526.00, but Respondent did not disclose Ms. Winston\u2019s $526.00 payment to the Bankruptcy Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlS\">Respondent excepts, stating that she did not mention \u201can additional five hundred dollar[ ]\u201d fee to Ms. Winston after the April 21, 2011 bankruptcy hearing. The challenged findings, however, do not rest on whether Barton mentioned an amount to Ms. Winston, but whether the $526.00 was paid and not disclosed. Judge Bernard relied upon the deemed admissions that mirrored her finding, as well as Ms. Winston\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>that Barton knew that Ms. Winston wanted to remove the second mortgage and directed her to Mr. Tolbert, who charged her the additional $526.00. We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Respondent excepts to Judge Bernard\u2019s finding that, \u201cMs. Barnes paid the Cardinal Law Firm a fee of $4,474.00 by a check payable to the A. Barton Law Firm.\u201d Respondent excepts that Ms. Barnes made payments to the Barton Law Firm and not the Cardinal Law Firm. Judge Bernard relied on the deemed admissions in making her finding, and, accordingly, we overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Barton also seems to argue that she did not accept Ms. Simmons\u2019s payments of $700.00 and $2,300.00, Mr. Tolbert did. Judge Bernard relied on the deemed admissions in making her findings, as well as Ms. Simmons\u2019s testimony that she initially made payments to the Cardinal Law Firm by checks payable to the A. Barton Law Firm in the amounts of $700.00 and $2,300.00, and that she later was instructed by Mr. Tolbert that she needed to pay an additional $1,774.00 to convert her Chapter 7 bankruptcy to a Chapter 13, which she paid. Ms. Simmons\u2019s bank statements, additionally, were accepted into evidence as Exhibit L, which showed withdrawals totaling $4,774.00, confirming Ms. Simmons\u2019s testimony. Judge Bernard\u2019s findings, thus, were supported by clear and convincing evidence, and we overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Barton also excepts to Judge Bernard\u2019s finding that, \u201cMs. Simmons attempted to contact Respondent about the status of her case, but was unable to reach her.\u201d Barton argues that despite a delay, she eventually responded to Ms. Simmons and that Ms. Simmons was ultimately satisfied with their communication, relying on a letter, accepted into evidence at the hearing as Exhibit N, in which Ms. Simmons informed the Attorney Grievance Commission that despite a prior \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d she was now \u201csatisfied\u201d with her communication with Barton. Judge Bernard relied upon the deemed admissions in making her findings. Ms. Simmons also testified at the hearing that she attempted to contact Barton and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Barton did not respond. Judge Bernard\u2019s finding was based on clear and convincing evidence and we, accordingly, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Respondent also excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that, \u201cOn May 11, 2011 the Cardinal Law Firm responded in writing to Ms. Rhett, agreeing to refund the full amount paid.\u201d Respondent argues that she did not respond to Ms. Rhett and that she never reimbursed Ms. Rhett. Judge Bernard again relied on the deemed admissions. Ms. Rhett, additionally, testified at the hearing that Respondent stated, during a telephone conversation, that she would authorize Mr. Tolbert to refund the legal fees, and that Ms. Rhett could retrieve a check from the firm\u2019s office. Rhett further testified that Mr. Tolbert personally delivered her refund along with a gift basket, as well as also provided Ms. Rhett with a receipt, admitted as Exhibit H at the hearing, printed on Cardinal Law Firm letterhead in which Barton\u2019s name was featured. Again, there was clear and convincing evidence to support Judge Bernard\u2019s finding, and we, therefore, overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Respondent finally excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s failure to find facts which she offered in her post-hearing Proposed Findings of Fact, to include that Mr. Tolbert was never a signer on Respondent\u2019s bank accounts; Respondent had to continue working with Mr. Tolbert after February 2011, despite being aware that he had stolen from the firm, because he owned the office building in which the firm rented space and she had approximately 20 active clients remaining; Mr. Tolbert reacted angrily when learning Barton was closing the law firm; Mr. Tolbert accepted over 50 clients after March 2011 and stole their money plus their filing fees; Mr. Tolbert embezzled from the firm by somehow using checks that Barton had provided him; Tolbert was criminally charged with impersonating a lawyer and theft; Barton has not been criminally charged with regard to Mr. Tolbert\u2019s thefts; Barton, as the only attorney in the office who was barred in Maryland, had to attend court hearings and could not be in the office at all times; Barton only practiced law in jurisdictions in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>she was authorized; Respondent\u2019s communication with her clients was \u201cadequate[ ]\u201d; and all the clients\u2019s bankruptcy petitions were eventually approved by the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">A hearing judge, however, is not required to accept any proposed findings submitted by Bar Counsel or a Respondent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">A judge hearing an attorney grievance matter does not need to meld together his or her own opinion, taking bits and pieces of each party\u2019s proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law, but may adopt one party\u2019s filing in its entirety, as long as it accurately reflects the judge\u2019s independent factual findings, proven by clear and convincing evidence at the hearing, and the legal conclusions flowing therefrom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQM\"><em>Attorney Grievance v. Joseph, </em>422 Md. 670, 696, 31 A.3d 137, 153 (2011). Judge Bernard made her own findings, which were established by clear and convincing evidence, based upon the deemed admissions and her evaluation of what she heard and saw during two days of evidentiary hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Having overruled all Respondent\u2019s exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and having determined that the findings are supported by clear and convincing evidence, we now turn to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The hearing judge determined that Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.5(a), 1.15(a) and (b), 1.16(d), 5.3(a), (b) and (c), 5.4(a) and (b), 5.5(a), and 8.4(a), (c) and (d) were violated. Bar Counsel has filed no exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Although Barton excepted to the determinations that she violated Rules 1.1 and 1.3, at oral argument, her counsel conceded the violation of those Rules and we agree that those violations are supported by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Respondent generally excepts to a lack of evidentiary foundation for the violations of Rules 1.5(a), 1.15(a) and (b), and 5.4(a) and (b), and takes the same exception, as well as other specific exceptions to the determinations that she violated Rules 1.4(a) and (b), 1.16(d), 5.3(a), (b) and (c), 5.5(a), and 8.4(a), (c) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated Rules 1.4(a) and (b). Judge Bernard concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP0\">Respondent is also charged in each complaint with a violation of Rule 1.4(a) and (b) of the MLRPC. Each and every witness testified to having difficulties contacting Respondent, and in some cases, being unable to contact Respondent entirely. In Ms. Simmons\u2019 case, Respondent failed to adequately communicate with both Ms. Simmons and her creditors. Respondent did not keep her clients informed regarding the status of their case or respond to their attempts to communicate with her. Moreover, to the extent that Respondent had difficulties with her personal health of which she testified, or with Mr. Tolbert and the Cardinal Law Firm, Respondent failed to inform her clients of these problems and any others that limited her ability to represent them. Thus, in each matter, Respondent violated Rule 1.4(a) and (b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Respondent argues there is no evidence of any Rule 1.4 violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Rules 1.4(a) and (b) provide that, a lawyer shall \u201ckeep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter\u201d, and that a \u201clawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.\u201d Rule 1.4(a) requires an attorney to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of his or her case. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Gelb, </em>440 Md. 312, 321, 102 A.3d 344, 349-50 (2014) (attorney violated 1.4(a) by failing to return a client\u2019s telephone calls or respond to another client\u2019s requests for information). Rule 1.4(b) requires that an attorney explain matters to the extent necessary to allow the client to make informed decisions. <em>Gelb, </em>440 Md. at 321, 102 A.3d at 349-50 (attorney\u2019s failure to communicate violated 1.4(b) when his clients\u2019s cases were dismissed due to lack of prosecution without the clients\u2019s knowledge or consent); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Narasimhan, </em>438 Md. 638, 92 A.3d 512 (2014) (attorney violated 1.4(b) by failing to provide her client with accurate information that was necessary for her client to make informed decisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Here, the hearing judge found that Barton failed to return the phone calls of Ms. Winston and failed to keep both Ms. Tyner and Ms. Simmons informed about the status of their respective cases in violation of Rule 1.4(a). Barton\u2019s lack of communication with Ms. Simmons and the inaccurate advice she gave to Ms. Winston also violated Rule 1.4(b). Ms. Simmons testified at the disciplinary hearing that she was unable to contact Barton after the Bankruptcy Court issued a deficiency notice in her case, due to Barton\u2019s failure to file the required papers, and Ms. Simmons eventually had to act on her own to correct the problem. The hearing judge also found that Respondent gave Ms. Winston inaccurate advice concerning the sale of her condominium, advice concerning a course of action which the Bankruptcy Court opined was totally unnecessary. We overrule Respondent\u2019s exception and conclude that Barton violated Rules 1.4(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Respondent excepts to Judge Bernard\u2019s conclusion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">The fees charged [in the Winston, Miljkovic, Gray-Knight, Tyner, Barnes and Bar Counsel complaints], while the respective fee may not have been unreasonable on its face, became unreasonable because Respondent did no work of value, or at all, in their case, in violation of Rule 1.5(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq9\">Respondent asserts that there was no evidence in that she violated Rule 1.5(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Under Rule 1.5(a), an attorney may not charge an unreasonable fee. An advance fee given in anticipation of legal service that is reasonable at the time of the receipt can become unreasonable if the attorney does not perform the services expected. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 891 A.2d 1085 (2006) (a flat fee to facilitate an adoption became unreasonable, in violation of 1.5(a), when the attorney failed to do any work); <em>see also Attorney Grievance v. Shakir, </em>427 Md. 197, 46 A.3d 1162 (2012) (attorney violated 1.5(a) when he accepted flat fees to file an asylum application and represent a client regarding DUI charges and then failed to perform either task). Here, the hearing judge found that Ms. Winston paid Respondent a flat fee which became unreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>able when Barton then failed to appear at a bankruptcy hearing, failed to respond to Ms. Winston\u2019s inquiries, failed to file an amended bankruptcy petition and subsequently gave Ms. Winston inaccurate advice. The hearing judge found that the Chapmans and the Johnsons each paid Respondent a flat fee which the Bankruptcy Court ordered Barton to refund because of Respondent\u2019s inadequate work product. The hearing judge, additionally, found that Respondent accepted fees from Ms. Barnes, Ms. Miljkovic and Ms. Gray-Knight, yet Barton \u201cdid no work\u201d and provided \u201cno legal services\u201d of any kind. We overrule Respondent\u2019s exception and conclude that Barton violated Rule 1.5(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Respondent also excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated Rules 1.15(a) and (b). Judge Bernard concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">Respondent\u2019s failure to maintain unearned fees of Cardinal Law Firm clients in an attorney trust account, and instead maintaining those fees in the A. Barton Law Firm checking account along with firm funds used to pay expenses and employees, without written informed consent of the clients violated Rule 1.15(a) and (b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Respondent asserts that there was no evidence that she violated Rules 1.15(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Rule 1.15(a) requires that an attorney deposit advance fees into an attorney trust account, and additionally, requires that an attorney keep records of the fees. We have noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">Funds given in anticipation of future legal services qualify as trust money and, accordingly, are to be deposited in trust accounts separate from the attorney\u2019s property, to be removed promptly by the attorney as earned. To deposit such trust money into the attorney\u2019s personal or operating accounts before the fees are earned constitutes a violation of MRPC 1.15(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-9\"><em>Attorney Grievance v.

The attorney or law firm may deposit into an attorney trust account any funds expected to be advanced on behalf of a client and expected to be reimbursed to the attorney by the client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Here, Judge Bernard found that Barton was aware and permitted Mr. Tolbert to deposit the funds and retainers received from the firm\u2019s clients into the A. Barton Law Firm operating account, which included earned fees and funds from which firm expenses were drawn, in violation of Rule 1.15(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">Accordingly, we overrule Respondent\u2019s exception and conclude that Barton commingled funds in violation of Rules 1.15(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">Respondent next excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated Rule 1.16(d). Judge Bernard concluded that, \u201cRespondent violated Rule 1.16(d) in the Winston, Miljkovic, Gray-Knight, Tyner, Barnes and Bar Counsel complaints for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>failing to return unearned fees paid to Respondent by each client.\u201d Barton argues that there was no evidentiary foundation for the Rule 1.16(d) violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Rule 1.16(d) states that a lawyer shall refund to the client \u201cany advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred.\u201d <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Pinno, </em>437 Md. 70, 85 A.3d 159 (2014) (attorney violated 1.16(d) by abandoning a client\u2019s ease before it was completed and by failing to return the unearned fees); <em>Attorney Grievance v. McLaughlin, </em>372 Md. 467, 813 A.2d 1145 (2002) (attorney violated 1.16(d) by not refunding unearned fees to his clients after performing no legal work). Judge Bernard found that: Respondent failed to refund the fees paid to her by Ms. Winston and Ms. Gray-Knight after both clients discharged Barton as their counsel; Respondent, additionally, did not refund the fees paid to her by Ms. Winston, the Chapmans or the Johnsons, despite being ordered to do so by the Bankruptcy Court; Respondent, furthermore, did not refund the fees paid to her by Ms. Barnes, Ms. Miljkovic or Ms. Gray-Knight after Barton claimed to have no knowledge of those clients\u2019s cases. We overrule Barton\u2019s exception and conclude that she violated Rule 1.16(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Respondent also excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated Rules 5.3(a), (b) and (c). Judge Bernard concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">Respondent violated Rules 5.3(a), (b) and (c) by failing to properly supervise Mr. Tolbert and the rest of the Cardinal Law Firm. It is undisputed that Mr. Tolbert met with clients, quoted fees, provided legal advice to clients, and held himself out as an attorney. Mr. Tolbert was able to do so because Respondent was not in the office to supervise him and had not made any efforts to ensure that his conduct was compatible with Respondent\u2019s professional obligations. Mr. Tolbert also mishandled law firm and client funds, and deposited unearned funds into a business account, not an escrow account. Respondent was not only aware of this conduct; Respondent permitted this conduct and instructed both Mr. Tolbert and Ms. Crawford so that the law office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>could effectively function without Respondent\u2019s presence. More troubling perhaps is Respondent\u2019s admission that she provided blank checks to Mr. Tolbert after she learned that he had stolen client money from the firm. In fact, Respondent gave Mr. Tolbert total control of the firm bank accounts. Respondent testified that she did not review the bank statements, even after she had caught him stealing. Such conduct can only be seen as enabling and ratification of the misconduct. Despite Respondent\u2019s testimony that she knew Mr. Tolbert \u201cdid not listen\u201d she continued to condone his conduct. The Court did not find the Respondent to be at all credible in her denial of Mr. Tolbert\u2019s actions. She repeatedly testified that she knew that Mr. Tolbert \u201cdid not listen,\u201d but did not take any affirmative action to deter or stop his behavior.

Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. 341, 872 A.2d 693 (2005), an attorney delegated the task of balancing his trust account to a nonlawyer employee and then did not follow up to ensure that the delegated task was actually and competently performed; the employee did not balance the trust account as requested. Zuckerman\u2019s failure to supervise delayed, for a month, his discovery that another nonlawyer employee had embezzled funds from his trust account. Zuckerman\u2019s conduct violated Rules 5.3(a) and (b). \u201c \u2018[H]ad the respondent exercised a reasonable degree of supervision over [his employee], he might have detected [the employee\u2019s] error before any ethical proscriptions had been violated\u2019 under Rule 5.3.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 374, 872 A.2d at 713, quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Rule 5.3(c) is violated when an attorney delegates a task to an employee, the unsuccessful or improper completion of which would result in a violation of the Rules. In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Ward </em>394 Md. 1, 904 A.2d 477 (2006), an attorney violated Rule 5.3(c) when he ordered his assistant to notarize a document without the signer present.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\"><em>Attorney Grievance v. Kimmel, </em>405 Md. 647, 955 A.2d 269 (2008), although specifically addressing a violation of Rule 5.1 by two attorneys for failing to supervise an inexperienced associate, is helpful in understanding the duty to supervise. In <em>Kimmel, </em>Kimmel and Silverman were the managing partners of a Pennsylvania law firm which operated a high volume practice; neither attorney was a member of the Bar of this State. The firm hired Robin Katz, a Maryland-barred attorney, to establish a local office wherein Katz was responsible for litigation in Maryland. Kimmel and Silverman stressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>that Katz meet \u201ca weekly benchmark for complaints to be filed\u201d and regularly \u201cemphasized the importance of this objective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 656, 955 A.2d at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Over the course of a year, Katz became increasingly overwhelmed and struggled to meet her performance benchmarks; she requested assistance on multiple occasions, but none was forthcoming. In one instance, she was reminded by the firm\u2019s office manager about the need to file fifteen complaints per week; on another occasion, Katz\u2019s supervising attorney emailed, \u201cno excuses, don\u2019t call, no need to talk, just get on it and only call me with good positive news of settlements\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 657, 955 A.2d at 275. Katz eventually resigned after becoming \u201ctotally overwhelmed\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 663, 955 A.2d at 279. Silverman, shortly thereinafter, visited Katz\u2019s office for the first time, observed \u201cstacks of documents in [the] office that were not filed\u201d and noted that Katz, who had yet to depart, looked \u201clike a beaten dog.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We emphasized that, \u201cnumerous indicators alerted [Kimmel and Silverman] to the need for a heightened level of supervision, but [they] failed to design and implement policies and procedures that reasonably would ensure compliance with the Maryland Rules\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 680, 955 A.2d at 289, and opined that, \u201c[w]hether an employee\u2019s ethical breaches are due to the employee\u2019s sub-standard performance or the deliberate circumvention of standard procedures, proper supervision must include mechanisms to determine whether the delegated tasks are being performed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 682, 955 A.2d at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In the present case, Judge Bernard found that Barton was the owner and only Maryland-barred attorney in the Cardinal Law Firm at the relevant time, and that she employed Mr. Tolbert, who was not licensed to practice law, as her office manager. She also not only permitted, but encouraged, Mr. Tolbert to engage in the unlicensed practice of law by allowing him to give legal advice to clients of the Cardinal Law Firm. Barton, additionally, permitted Mr. Tolbert to deposit client funds in the firm\u2019s operating account and provided him with blank checks. After Barton became aware in February of 2011 that Mr. Tolbert was stealing from the account, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>continued to employ him up until July of 2011. Accordingly, we overrule Respondent\u2019s exception and conclude that Barton violated Rules 5.3(a), (b) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Respondent also excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated Rules 5.4(a) and (b). Judge Bernard concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">Lastly, Petitioner alleged in its Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action that Respondent shared fees from cases with Mr. Tolbert in violation of Rule 5.4, which Respondent vehemently denied at trial. Notwithstanding that denial, this Court again finds Respondent\u2019s testimony not credible. The evidence submitted at trial, coupled with Respondent\u2019s testimony, demonstrated that Respondent paid Mr. Tolbert $1,000.00 every two (2) weeks. On cross-examination, Respondent stated that Mr. Tolbert did not receive any additional salary on top of the $1,000.00 and that in 2011 Respondent was only paid for six months, until the end of June, 2011. Yet according to Mr. Tolbert\u2019s 1099 for 2011, submitted into evidence during Respondent\u2019s case, Respondent paid Mr. Tolbert $48,000.00 in 2011. Even if Respondent paid Mr. Tolbert for the entire 2011 year, Respondent would have only earned $26,000.00. Since Respondent testified that Mr. Tolbert was not paid any additional money, the only logical conclusion is that Respondent shared fees with Mr. Tolbert.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Respondent alleges that there is no evidence of her violation of Rules 5.4(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Rules 5.4(a) and (b) provide that a \u201clawyer ... shall not share legal fees with a nonlawyer\u201d and that a \u201clawyer shall not form a partnership with a nonlawyer if any of the activities of the partnership consist of the practice of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">There is insufficient evidence presented in the record to support the hearing judge\u2019s determination that Barton shared legal fees with Mr. Tolbert. We, thus, sustain Respondent\u2019s exception to the conclusion that she violated Rule 5.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Judge Bernard also found that Barton was aware that Mr. Tolbert gave legal advice to clients; Respondent also directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Ms. Winston to Mr. Tolbert when Ms. Winston raised a legal question regarding her condominium. Clearly, Barton treated Mr. Tolbert as a principal in the law firm and thereby violated Rule 5.4(b). We, thus, overrule her exception to Rule 5.4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated Rule 5.5(a). Judge Bernard concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">Respondent knowingly permitted Mr. Tolbert to handle client intake, which included quoting fees (based upon an evaluation of the prospective client\u2019s case) and providing legal advice, and therefore, assisted Mr. Tolbert in engaging in the unauthorized practice of law in violation of Rules 5.5(a) and 8.4(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Respondent argues that there is no proof of her violation of Rule 5.5(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Rule 5.5(a) states that, \u201c[a] lawyer shall not practice law in a jurisdiction in violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction, or assist another in doing so.\u201d Rule 5.5(a) is violated when an attorney permits an employee to operate as a lawyer although not barred as one. <em>Attorney Grievance v.

The hearing judge found, additionally, that Barton was aware that Mr. Tolbert gave legal advice to clients of the Cardinal Law Firm, including the Johnsons, Ms. Barnes, Ms. Simmons, Ms. Rhett and Ms. Gray-Knight, with regard to what type of bankruptcy petitions to file and advised Ms. Tyner, Ms. Simmons and Ms. Miljkovic to stop paying their respective mortgages. We overrule Respondent\u2019s exception and, therefore, conclude that Barton violated Rule 5.5(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Respondent, additionally, excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that she violated Rules 8.4(a), (c) and (d). Rule 8.4(c) states that it is professional misconduct for an attorney to engage in conduct that involves dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. With regard to Rule 8.4(c), Judge Bernard concluded that, \u201cRespondent\u2019s failure to disclose the receipt of an additional $526.00 payment from Winston to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>U.S. Bankruptcy Court is a violation of Rule 8.4(c).\u201d Barton argues that there was no evidence adduced to support a violation of Rule 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">An attorney who knowingly makes a false statement to a tribunal necessarily engages in misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c). <em>Attorney Grievance v.

Robaton, </em>411 Md. 415, 983 A.2d 467 (2009), an attorney made an intentional misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c) by failing to disclose to the Bankruptcy Court a debtor\u2019s payment to a non-attorney professional who had typed the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy petition when the attorney knew that such a payment had been made and also failed to disclose the compensation he received from the debtor to the Bankruptcy Court. In <em>Robaton, </em>we agreed with the hearing judge\u2019s observation that the attorney\u2019s omissions \u201cdeprived the court and creditors of the ability to find out how much of the debtor\u2019s assets has been paid to the attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429, 983 A.2d at 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The gravamen of the Rule 8.4(c) violation in the instant case is whether Barton intentionally failed to disclose the $526.00 paid by Ms. Winston on Ms. Winston\u2019s bankruptcy petition, thereby shielding it from distribution to creditors. Barton asserts that she knew nothing about the transaction and so did not intentionally omit the amount from the bankruptcy estate. Barton, however, had directed Ms. Winston to speak to Mr. Tolbert to handle additional legal issues, and Ms. Winston had paid the additional $526.00 by check to the A. Barton Law Firm, an account to which Barton not only had access, but for which she had received statements as the responsible party. Barton\u2019s failure to disclose the $526.00 payment could only benefit her because, otherwise, the money would revert back to the bankruptcy estate. We, therefore, overrule her exception and conclude that Barton violated Rule 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">An attorney violates subsection (d) of Rule 8.4 when he or she \u201cengagefs] in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d.

The hearing judge also found that the Bankruptcy Court issued Ms. Simmons a deficiency notice after Barton failed to file the required papers, and that Ms. Simmons was unable to reach Respondent thereafter. Bar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>ton\u2019s clients retained her to shepherd them through the bankruptcy process, which she failed to do. Judge Bernard also found that Barton failed to both perform any legal services of value in exchange for legal fees she charged and failed to return the unearned fees of Ms. Winston, the Chapmans, the Johnsons, Ms. Barnes, Ms. Miljkovic and Ms. Gray-Knight. We, therefore, overrule her exception and conclude that Barton violated Rule 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Subsection (a) of Rule 8.4 provides that it is professional misconduct for an attorney to \u201cviolate or attempt to violate the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct\u201d.

Page, </em>430 Md. 602, 62 A.3d 163 (2013) (applying this factor when an attorney failed to refund any portion of the advanced fee paid by the client).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">We also consider mitigating factors in determining the appropriate sanction, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Absence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><em>O\u2019Leary, </em>438 Md. at 31, 69 A.3d at 1138, quoting <em>Attorney Grievance v. Brown, </em>426 Md. 298, 826, 44 A.3d 344, 361 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The hearing judge determined, by a preponderance of the evidence, that one mitigating factor was present in this case\u2014 that Barton undertook \u201cinterim rehabilitation.\u201d Judge Bernard credited Barton\u2019s testimony that she undertook over 50 cases pro bono in Maryland, all involving purported victims of Mr. Tolbert; that Barton had to take on a second job in order to personally pay the filing fees associated with these cases, and that Barton \u201cspoke with creditors, mortgage companies, etc. in order to try to protect the interests of the clients that she was handling on a pro bono basis.\u201d We, additionally, note that Barton has no prior disciplinary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Barton, however, excepts to Judge Bernard\u2019s finding that, \u201cThe Court did not find that the Respondent\u2019s illness in any way would mitigate the previously referenced violations.\u201d Barton contends that, during the time she operated the Cardinal Law Firm, she suffered from a host of health issues, including endometriosis and uterine fibroid tumors, for which she eventually underwent surgery. Respondent, however, testified that she was still able to handle her cases despite the pain associated with her health issue. We have said that, \u201c|w]hile an illness or a traumatic event may serve as a mitigating factor in determining sanctions, they may do so only when there is some nexus to the misconduct.\u201d <em>O\u2019Leary, </em>433 Md. at 32, 69 A.3d at 1138-39. Barton argues, on one hand, that her health situation mitigates her shortcomings, yet on the other, she argues that she was able to competently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>provide representation to her clients. Barton cannot have it both ways. We overrule her exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">With the aggravating and mitigating factors in mind, we turn to determining the appropriate sanction. Bar Counsel recommends disbarment, while, at oral argument, Barton\u2019s counsel suggested a reprimand, or at worst, a suspension for 90 to 120 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The instant case presents a bevy of Rule violations that showcases a pattern of client neglect and a failure to properly supervise nonlawyer employees and includes an instance of misrepresentation before a court. While no other case is on all fours with the present case in terms of sanction, several cases are helpful in its fashioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In cases where an attorney exhibits a lack of competence and diligence when attending to client affairs, even when more than one client is involved, we have imposed an indefinite suspension. For example, in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Mooney, </em>359 Md. at 97-98, 753 A.2d at 39, we indefinitely suspended Mooney, who had violated Rules 1.1,1.3,1.4, 5.1, 5.3 and 8.4(d) because of his failure to diligently pursue cases, as well as to appear at trial, and failure to supervise both another attorney and a nonlawyer assistant. He also failed to timely refund a fee and made multiple misrepresentations to the mother of a juvenile client. We noted Mooney\u2019s lack of disciplinary history, and stated \u201cthat while we have generally suspended lawyers who for the first time have been found to have violated rules relating to competency; we have disbarred subsequent offenders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98, 753 A.2d at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Client neglect, even when coupled with a finding of misrepresentation in violation of Rule 8.4(c), resulted in the imposition of an indefinite suspension in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Harrington, </em>367 Md. 36, 785 A.2d 1260 (2001). We determined that Harrington made numerous ethical violations when he failed to pursue a client matter, failed to keep the client reasonably informed regarding the status of his case and terminated the client relationship without taking steps to protect the client\u2019s interest. Harrington also failed to pursue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>another client\u2019s claim, and when questioned by the client, he falsely led his client to believe that a lawsuit had been filed on her behalf and that he was \u201cwaiting for a court date\u201d when no suit had actually been filed. <em>Id. </em>at 48, 785 A.2d at 1267. <em>See also Attorney Grievance v. Cohen, </em>361 Md. 161, 760 A.2d 706 (2000) (attorney violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 8.1(a) and 8.4(c) and (d) in three client matters because he demonstrated incompetence and a lack of diligence, failed to file a client\u2019s tax returns with the bankruptcy court despite indicating to the court that it had been done, misrepresented to a client and Bar Counsel that he had refunded the client\u2019s fee, and was uncooperative with Bar Counsel); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. David, </em>331 Md. 317, 628 A.2d 178 (1993) (indefinitely suspending an attorney who, with respect to four clients, failed to return an unearned fee for a period of nine months, failed to timely remit funds he received on behalf of a client, failed to communicate with his clients, failed to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information and made a misrepresentation to Bar Counsel concerning whether a client was already represented when she approached the attorney about her case).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">In the instant case, Barton failed to file papers to correct Ms. Simmons\u2019s deficiency notice; she failed to appear a bankruptcy hearing which resulted in the dismissal of Ms. Tyner\u2019s case; failed to appear at a hearing with respect to Ms. Winston; accepted payment from Ms. Barnes, Ms. Miljkovic and Ms. Gray-Knight to file bankruptcy petitions, yet never did any work on their cases; and, she failed to refund the unearned fees of Ms. Winston, the Chapmans, the Johnsons, Ms. Tyner, Ms. Barnes, Ms. Miljkovic and Ms. Gray-Knight. The Respondent, moreover, engaged in a misrepresentation to the Bankruptcy Court by failing to disclose the additional compensation she received from Ms. Winston. Barton\u2019s failure to supervise Mr. Tolbert would also result in her being indefinitely suspended as we did with <em>Kimmel, </em>405 Md. at 689, 955 A.2d at 294, and <em>Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. at 386, 872 A.2d at 716, discussed <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>We, therefore, determine that an indefinite suspension in the present case is the appropriate sanction, especially in the absence of any finding of misappropriation. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 773 A.2d 463 (2001). Although Barton\u2019s counsel recommended a reprimand or a 90-120 day suspension, he cited no case law in support, and we have found none.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">As a result, the Respondent, Sheron A. Barton, is hereby indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in the State of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST SHERON A.
