In order to maintain their litigation, they must demonstrate appropriate standing to do so. Respondents assert that property owner standing principles apply to a judicial challenge to comprehensive zoning legislation and that they satisfied those principles. We disagree. Plaintiffs wishing to challenge in Maryland courts the legislative action adopting a comprehensive zoning are required to demonstrate taxpayer standing. Respondents do not allege facts sufficient to meet the correct standing requirement. Thus, the dismissal by the Circuit Court of the two suits in the present case was correct. The contrary position taken by the Court of Special Appeals in this case must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>I. Statement of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Bill 12-11, a comprehensive zoning ordinance adopted in 2011 by the County Council for Anne Arundel County (\u201cthe County\u201d), embraced Councilmanic Districts I and IV, comprising approximately 59,045 individual parcels or lots totaling 4,265 acres in area. The two Districts include most of the property in the vicinity of the Baltimore/Washington International/Thurgood Marshall Airport and all of the property along the Baltimore-Washington Parkway corridor in Anne Arundel County. Of those 59,045 individual parcels or lots, Bill 12-11 changed the previous zoning classifications of 264 parcels or lots and maintained essentially the pre-existing zoning of the rest. Bill 12-11 was the culmination by local government of a 5-year comprehensive and thorough consideration of the zoning in the Districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Bill 12-11 was challenged by various Anne Arundel County property owners and community associations (\u201cthe Citizens\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who objected to some, but not all, of the rezonings. Two suits were filed in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, which were consolidated ultimately. Titled <em>In the Matter of Steve Bell, et al., </em>C-11-161930, the Citizens filed on 14 June 2011 an Amended Petition for Judicial Review or, in the Alternative, for a Writ of Administrative Mandamus (\u201cAmended Petition for Judicial Review\u201d). Styled as <em>Steve Bell, et al. v. Anne Arundel County, Maryland, </em>C-11-163163, the Citizens filed on 5 August 2011 a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment, in which they challenged the rezoning of multiple parcels of land, alleging that the County engaged in illegal spot and contract zoning with regard to those rezonings and failed to provide the public with the required notice of the proposed zoning changes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Several Anne Arundel County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>property owners and ground leaseholders whose properties had been rezoned to classifications desired by them (collectively, with the County, referred to as \u201cPetitioners\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> intervened to protect their interests. Petitioners moved to dismiss the Citizens\u2019 suit, arguing, <em>inter </em>alia,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the Citizens lacked standing. Following a hearing, the Circuit Court granted Petitioners\u2019 .motion to dismiss, concluding that the Citizens lacked standing because they failed to meet the burden of proving special aggrievement. Suggesting that being an adjoining, confronting, or nearby property owner is \u201c[o]ne means of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of aggrievement in Maryland,\u201d the trial court emphasized that it could not find any reported Maryland cases in which \u201ca party in a declaratory judgment action has been found to have <em>prima facie </em>aggrievement or standing to challenge comprehensive rezoning legislation based on ownership of property nearby or in proximity to property that was rezoned.\u201d Therefore, the Circuit Court concluded that the Citizens did not have <em>prima facie </em>standing to challenge Bill 12-11 through a declaratory judgment action. The hearing court also concluded that the Citizens\u2019 claims that the select rezonings would result in increases in traffic, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>creases in property values, and changes in the character of the neighborhoods were insufficient to show special aggrievement because the court \u201cfail[ed] to find that [the Citizens\u2019] interests in the matter [were] any different than the interests of a member of the general public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">On direct appeal, the Court of Special Appeals disagreed with the Circuit Court, concluding that the Citizens enjoyed property owner standing to challenge Bill 12-11. <em>Bell v. Anne Arundel County, </em>215 Md.App. 161, 79 A.3d 976 (2013). The Court of Special Appeals, relying on <em>120 W. Fayette St., LLLP v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>407 Md. 253, 964 A.2d 662 (2009) <em>[\u201cSuperblock </em>I\u201d] and <em>Long Green Valley Association v. Bellevale Farms, Inc., </em>205 Md.App. 636, 46 A.3d 473 (2012), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>432 Md. 292, 68 A.3d 843 (2013), rejected the County\u2019s contention that the <em>prima facie </em>aggrievement standard only applies to challenges to administrative land use decisions, concluding instead that it also applies to comprehensive zonings like Bill 12-11. <em>Bell, </em>215 Md.App. at 180, 79 A.3d at 987; <em>see id. </em>at 179, 79 A.3d at 987 (\u201c[W]e perceive no logical or practical reason why we should remove this case from the application of the principles espoused in <em>[Superblock </em>7] and <em>Long Green Valley </em>simply because [protestants] have challenged a comprehensive zoning ordinance, as opposed to another form of land use regulation or governmentally-imposed development control.\u201d). The intermediate appellate court determined that the property owner <em>prima facie </em>standard of presumed special aggrievement applies to judicial challenges to comprehensive zoning legislative actions, as well as quasi-judicial and other administrative land use actions generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The intermediate appellate court applied, in two stages, the <em>prima facie </em>aggrievement standard to Parcel 114 on Tax Map 37 (\u201cParcel 114\u201d), which was reclassified from a lower density residential zone to one allowing commercial offices and similar uses. First, the court concluded that properties belonging to two of the Citizens (William Chapin and Steve Bell) were close enough by distance to support \u201calmost <em>prima facie </em>aggrievement\u201d because they were located within approximately 500 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>feet of Parcel 114. <em>Bell, </em>215 Md.App. at 184, 79 A.3d at 989-90. Second, the court examined whether the Citizens\u2019 \u201cpersonal or property rights ha[d] been specially and adversely affected by the rezoning in a way different from those of the general public \u2014 what the <em>Ray </em>court called \u2018plus factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bell, </em>215 Md.App. at 183, 79 A.3d at 989 (citing <em>Ray v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>430 Md. 74, 85, 59 A.3d 545, 551-52 (2013)). Acknowledging that an increase in traffic, by itself, is insufficient to establish property owner standing, the court discussed the difference between an injury based on noise from increased traffic and an injury based on increased traffic in general, and concluded ultimately that the noise emanating from projected increased traffic and increased commercial activity was sufficient to show that the Citizens were specially aggrieved. <em>Bell, </em>215 Md.App. at 186, 79 A.3d at 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Because that court concluded that at least one of the Citizens was <em>prima facie </em>aggrieved, based solely on the proximity of his/her property to a single property rezoned in Bill 12-11, all of the Citizens had standing with respect to the select parcels rezoned in Bill 12-11. <em>See Bell, </em>215 Md.App. at 180-81, 79 A.3d at 987-88; <em>see State Center, LLC v. Lexington Charles Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>438 Md. 451, 550, 92 A.3d 400, 458 (2014) (quoting <em>Board of Supervisors of Elections v. Smallwood, </em>327 Md. 220, 233 n. 7, 608 A.2d 1222, 1228 n. 7 (1992) (quoting <em>Board of License Commissioners v. Haberlin, </em>320 Md. 399, 404, 578 A.2d 215, 217 (1990) (\u201c[Wjhere there exists a party having standing to bring an action or take an appeal, we shall not ordinarily inquire as to whether another party on the same side also has standing.\u201d))). The Court of Special Appeals vacated the judgment of the Circuit Court and remanded the case for further proceedings. <em>Bell, </em>215 Md.App. at 192-93, 79 A.3d at 994-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Petitioners, in their successful petition for a writ of certiorari to us, asked us to consider three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">1. Whether the <em>prima facie </em>aggrievement standard established in <em>[Bryniarski v. Montgomery County Board of Appeals, </em>247 Md. 137, 230 A.2d 289, 294 (1967)] should be expanded beyond challenges to administrative land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>use decisions to include challenges to comprehensive zoning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-4\">2. Whether the \u201calmost <em>prima facie\u201d </em>standard as established in <em>[Ray v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>430 Md. 74, 59 A.3d 545 (2013)] should be expanded beyond challenges to administrative land use decisions to include challenges to comprehensive zoning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">3. Whether noise from a predicted increase in traffic constitutes \u201cspecial damages\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-6\"><em>Anne Arundel County v. Bell, </em>437 Md. 422, 86 A.3d 1274 (2014) (granting certiorari). We answer the first two questions in the negative. Accordingly, no answer to the third question is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The first two questions are, at their core, one and the same: are the principles of property owner standing applicable to plaintiffs maintaining a judicial challenge to the adoption of a comprehensive zoning ordinance, as has been the standard by which judicial challenges to quasi-judicial and other administrative \u201cland use\u201d actions have been measured? We conclude that extending property owner standing to challenges to comprehensive zoning legislative actions is contrary to our case law, and unprudential as well. The principles underlying property owner standing, heretofore applied to judicial review actions and other modalities of judicial challenges to quasi-judicial and other administrative land use decisions, should not be extended to apply to challenges to comprehensive zoning legislative actions. Comprehensive zoning on the one hand, and quasi-judicial or administrative land use actions on the other, are not similar sufficiently in process or justification to warrant extension by analogy of property owner standing principles from the latter to the former. Rather, taxpayer standing is the correct standing doctrine which Respondents/Plaintiffs must satisfy before they may be allowed to maintain a judicial challenge to comprehensive zoning legislation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">We will treat the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of the County\u2019s motions to dismiss as a grant of summary judgment because the trial court considered materials (specifically, affidavits) outside the complaints (i.e., the complaints and documents attached thereto). <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 2-322(c); <em>see also Ray, </em>430 Md. at 91, 59 A.3d at 555 (treating a motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment because the trial court considered materials outside of the pleadings); <em>Converge Services Group, LLC v.

Quasi-Judicial and Administrative Land Use Decisions Versus Comprehensive Zoning: A Comparison</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">The zoning process, broadly viewed, is designed to implement growth</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">in a manner that allows for the expansion of economic activities and opportunities in the area or region for the benefit of its residents, while at the same time attempting to maintain the quality of life of the region, all without unduly disturbing the reasonable expectations of the citizenry as to the permissible uses they may make of real property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIE\"><em>Mayor and Council of Rockville v. Rylyns Enterprises, Inc., </em>372 Md. 514, 532, 814 A.2d 469, 479 (2002). Decisions whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>to zone or rezone properties are made by local zoning authorities in Maryland through three primary processes: establishment of original zoning through adoption of a zoning map, comprehensive rezoning of substantial areas of the jurisdiction through a legislative-type process initiated by the local government, and piecemeal rezoning of individual properties (by application of the owner or contract purchaser) through a quasi-judicial process. <em>See id. </em>Original and comprehensive zoning are accomplished solely through legislative processes culminating in legislative acts, while piecemeal rezoning is achieved through a quasi-judicial process leading to a technical legislative act. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">\n<em>A. Comprehensive Zoning</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Comprehensive zoning \u201cis fundamentally legislative and no significant quasi-judicial function is involved.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Woodward &amp; Lothrop, Inc., </em>280 Md. 686, 713, 376 A.2d 483, 498 (1977), <em>see Rylyns Enterprises, </em>372 Md. at 532, 814 A.2d at 479. As comprehensive zoning encompasses a large geographical area, the process is initiated generally by a local government, rather than by a property owner or owners. <em>Rylyns Enterprises, </em>372 Md. at 535, 814 A.2d at 481. When local zoning authorities devise comprehensive zoning ordinances, the \u201cfocus is not on a single piece of property, but rather on a considerable number of properties as they relate to each other and to the surrounding area.\u201d <em>Woodward &amp; Lothrop, </em>280 Md. at 713, 376 A.2d at 498. These \u201care not adjudicative determinations affecting one property owned by one person, <em>but instead are classically legislative determinations </em>designed to affect local and regional needs and all property owners within the planning area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). During the comprehensive zoning process, the local zoning authority (which typically is comprised of local legislators wearing perhaps a different governmental \u201chat\u201d when acting as the local zoning body) considers broad policy considerations, including \u201cwhether the comprehensive rezoning takes into account future public needs and purposes; whether it is designed to provide an adequate potential for orderly growth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>in the future and to satisfy local and regional needs; and ultimately whether it bears the requisite relationship to the public health, safety and general welfare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Comprehensive rezonings \u201care limited only by the general boundaries of ... appropriate procedural and due process considerations.\u201d <em>Rylyns Enterprises, </em>372 Md. at 533, 814 A.2d at 480 (quoting <em>White v. Spring, </em>109 Md.App. 692, 696-97, 675 A.2d 1023, 1025 (1996)). In order for an act of zoning to \u201cqualify as proper comprehensive zoning\u201d it must:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\">1) cover a substantial area; 2) be the product of careful study and consideration; 3) control and direct the use of land and development according to present and planned future conditions, consistent with the public interest; and, 4) set forth and regulate all permitted land uses in all or substantially all of a given political subdivision, though it need not zone or rezone all of the land in the jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arl\"><em>Rylyns Enterprises, </em>372 Md. at 535, 814 A.2d at 481. Once an act of comprehensive zoning is enacted properly, the \u201cmotives or wisdom of the legislative body\u201d in adopting the zoning \u201cenjoy a strong presumption of correctness and validity\u201d and are not changed easily.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Rylyns Enterprises, </em>372 Md. at 535-36, 814 A.2d at 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">\n<em>B. Quasi-Judicial Processes and Administrative Land Use Actions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Administrative land use actions, whether reached via quasi-judicial or executive processes, encompass a wide variety of things, including piecemeal rezonings, special exceptions, variances, and nonconforming uses, whether granted by local administrative hearing officers, boards of appeal, or the local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>legislative body by donning its land use authority \u201chat\u201d;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as well as licenses and permits issued by state and local administrative agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Original or comprehensive zoning may be changed only by a subsequent comprehensive zoning or by a subsequent piecemeal zoning. <em>Rylyns Enterprises, </em>372 Md. at 538, 814 A.2d at 483. Piecemeal zoning is accomplished by local zoning authorities through a quasi-judicial process. <em>Anderson House, LLC v. Major of Rockville, </em>402 Md. 689, 708 n. 17, 939 A.2d 116, 127 n. 17 (2008). Notably, the act or decision reached through this quasi-judicial process is <em>\u201con individual, as opposed to general, grounds, </em>and scrutinizes a single property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). The piecemeal zoning process is decidedly un-legislative in nature, except at the end: it includes typically a deliberative fact-finding process, which entails the holding of at least one evidentiary hearing (generally), factual and opinion testimony, documentary evidence, cross-examination of the witnesses, and objections to the weighing of evidence. <em>See id. </em>This process results in a particularized set of written findings of fact and conclusions of law as to the zoning proposal for the parcel or assemblage in question. In piecemeal zoning applications seeking Euclidian zones, including those involving potential conditional zoning (where lawful to do so), the ultimate task of the zoning authority is to \u201cmake a factual determination, based on the evidence of record, as to whether there has been a change in the physical character of the neighborhood where the property is located or a mistake was made in the original zoning.\u201d <em>Woodward &amp; Lothrop, </em>280 Md. at 712-13, 376 A.2d at 498; <em>see Rylyns Enterprises, </em>372 Md. at 539, 814 A.2d at 483-84. This rule, referred to as the \u201cchange-mistake rule,\u201d does not apply to changes in zoning made in a compre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>hensive zoning or the piecemeal grant of a planned unit development (or \u201cfloating zone\u201d). <em>Rylyns Enterprises, </em>372 Md. at 539, 814 A.2d at 483-84. The grant of a floating zone requires usually written findings of fact and conclusions of law explicating (in terms of evidence or record) how the application conforms to the statutory pre-requisites for the particular zone. <em>See Aubinoe v. Lewis, </em>250 Md. 645, 653, 244 A.2d 879, 884 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Bearing in mind these differences between comprehensive zoning and administrative land use decisions and the processes through which they are reached, we turn now to examine the two standing doctrines available to complainants by which they might maintain suits regarding land use actions generally: the doctrines of property owner standing and taxpayer standing. As we shall demonstrate, property owner standing is reserved for challenges to land use decisions reached through quasi-judicial or administrative/executive processes, and taxpayer standing is the appropriate doctrine applied to available modalities of judicial challenges to land use actions reached via a purely legislative process, such as comprehensive zoning actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">IY. The \u201cAggrievement Standards\u201d of Property Owner Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Taxpayer and property owner standing provide the \u201ccause of action\u201d standing sufficient for justiciability: \u201cwhen asserted properly, [the doctrines] provide both the cause of action (or claim) and the right of the individual to assert the claim in the judicial forum.\u201d <em>State Center, LLC v. Lexington Charles Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>438 Md. 451, 517-18, 92 A.3d 400, 439 (2014). The \u201cprinciples of property owner standing in Maryland stem from the State\u2019s statutory zoning laws, which grant an \u2018aggrieved person\u2019 the right to challenge many zoning actions.\u201d <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 522-23, 92 A.3d at 442. The property owner standing doctrine recognizes that certain owners of real property may be \u201c \u2018specially harmed\u2019 by a decision or action (usually related to land use) in a manner different from the general public.\u201d <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>519, 92 A.3d at 440. Unless a complainant alleges a sufficient \u201cspecial aggrievement,\u201d or is presumed to be aggrieved specially because of the subject property\u2019s location, he, she, or it has no standing to challenge the act but is instead \u201cmerely \u2018generally aggrieved,\u2019 in a similar manner as the rest of the public.\u201d <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 521, 92 A.3d at 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">We shall explain in greater depth the requirements of the property owner standing doctrine in Part IV.A of this opinion. Although we noted in 2014 in <em>State Center </em>that principles of zoning laws \u201cpermit eligible plaintiffs to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts to challenge a greater variety of \u2018land use decisions\u2019 and actions than thought to be the case previously,\u201d <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 523, 92 A.3d at 442, this was not an invitation to hyper-extend property owner standing principles, but merely to recognize an evolving understanding of what may be deemed an administrative or executive land use decision or action, beyond the traditional notion of the grant of a piecemeal application for rezoning, special exception, or the like. We elaborate on the outer limits of the variety of land use decisions to which property owner standing applies in Part IV.B. In Part IV.C, we explain why further expansion of the property owner standing doctrine to the purely legislative process and act of comprehensive zoning is unsupported by law and ill-advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">\n<em>A. Property Owner Standing: What It Is</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">We discussed recently and at length property owner standing in several opinions. <em>See, e.g., State Center, </em>438 Md. 451, 92 A.3d 400, <em>Ray v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>430 Md. 74, 59 A.3d 545 (2013). In <em>Ray, </em>after the Baltimore City Council approved, pursuant to an owner-initiated application, a Planned Unit Development (\u201cPUD\u201d or floating zone), for an assemblage of parcels in Baltimore, a group of objecting Petitioners filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to block the PUD, which included a proposed Wal-Mart Supercenter. <em>Ray, </em>430 Md. at 77-78, 59 A.3d at 547. We analyzed property owner standing in the context of the initial grant of the PUD under Maryland Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>(1957, 2010 Repl. Vol.), Article 66B, \u00a7 2.09(a)(l)(ii),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which provided that an appeal may be filed by any \u201cperson ... aggrieved by: (i) [a] decision' of the Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals; or (ii) [a] zoning action by the City Council.\u201d <em>Ray, </em>430 Md. at 80, 59 A.3d at 548. In determining what is meant in the statute by a person \u201caggrieved,\u201d we turned to <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery County Board of Appeals, </em>247 Md. 137, 144, 230 A.2d 289, 294 (1967). <em>Ray, </em>430 Md. at 81, 59 A.3d at 549. <em>Bryniarski </em>provides two general principles that underlay any discussion of \u201cspecial aggrievement\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\">First, \u201c[a]n adjoining, confronting or nearby property owner is deemed, <em>prima facie, </em>to be specially damaged and, therefore, a person aggrieved.\u201d Second, \u201c[a] person whose property is far removed from the subject property ordinarily will not be considered a person aggrieved ... [unless] he meets the burden of alleging and proving ... that his personal or property rights are specially and adversely affected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-5\"><em>Ray, </em>430 Md. at 81, 59 A.3d at 549 (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Bryniarski, </em>247 Md. at 145, 230 A.2d at 294-95). Examining those principles in <em>Ray, </em>we observed that the \u201cstandard is flexible in the sense that it is based on a fact-intensive, case-by-case analysis.\u201d <em>Ray, </em>430 Md. at 81, 59 A.3d at 549. Reviewing comprehensively the facts of prior cases discussing property owner standing, <em>Ray </em>determined that proximity is \u201cthe most important factor to be considered\u201d in such cases. <em>Ray, </em>430 Md. at 82-83, 59 A.3d at 550. Although there is \u201cno bright-line rule\u201d for determining the perfect proximity for a property to be presumed to be specially aggrieved, <em>Ray, </em>430 Md. at 83, 59 A.3d at 550, we provided two (perhaps three<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>categories of protestants: \u201cthose who are <em>prima facie </em>aggrieved and those who are almost <em>prima facie </em>aggrieved.\u201d <em>Ray, </em>430 Md. at 85, 59 A.3d at 551. Otherwise, protestants are \u201cgenerally aggrieved\u201d and do not have standing. <em>Ray, </em>430 Md. at 85, 59 A.3d at 552. A protestant is <em>prima facie </em>aggrieved \u201cwhen his proximity makes him an adjoining, confronting, or nearby property owner.\u201d <em>Id., </em>59 A.3d at 551. A protestant is almost <em>prima facie </em>aggrieved when \u201cshe is farther away than an adjoining, confronting, or nearby property owner, but is still close enough to the site of the rezoning action ... <em>and </em>offers \u2018plus factors\u2019 supporting injury.\u201d <em>Id., </em>59 A.3d at 551-52. The category of almost <em>prima facie </em>aggrieved protestants has been found in our cases to apply only to those who have lived between 200 to 1000 feet away from the subject property, although there is no bright-line rule delineating such boundaries. <em>Ray, </em>430 Md. at 91, 59 A.3d at 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">\n<em>B. Property Owner Standing: When It Applies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">As noted above, principles of zoning laws \u201cpermit eligible plaintiffs to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts [under the doctrine of property owner standing] to challenge a greater variety of \u2018land use decisions\u2019 and actions than thought to be the case previously.\u201d <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 523, 92 A.3d at 442. This recent evolution may be traced to three opinions decided over the last six years where we pondered how expansively those principles justified applying the doctrine. The evolutionary extension of the applicability of property owner standing begins with the zombie-esque trilogy of <em>Super-block </em>cases. <em>See Superblock I, </em>407 Md. 253, 964 A.2d 662, and <em>120 West Fayette St., LLLP v. Major and City Council of Baltimore, </em>426 Md. 14, 43 A.3d 355 (2012) [hereinafter <em>\u201cSuperblock III\u2019] </em>(collectively, along with <em>120 West Fayette St., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number><em>LLLP v. Major and City Council of Baltimore, </em>413 Md. 309, 992 A.2d 459 (2010) [hereinafter <em>\u201cSuperblock II\u201d], </em>the <em>\u201cSuperblock Trilogy\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The basic facts underlying the <em>Superblock Trilogy </em>are as follows: In 1999, the Baltimore City Council (the \u201cCity\u201d) adopted an urban renewal plan for the westside of downtown Baltimore. <em>Superblock I, </em>407 Md. at 258, 964 A.2d at 665. In the process of implementing the urban renewal plan,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the City entered into a land disposition agreement (\u201cLDA\u201d) with a developer that provided for the sale and development of approximately five blocks of properties in the westside of downtown Baltimore, collectively referred to as the \u201cSuperblock.\u201d <em>Superblock I, </em>407 Md. at 259, 964 A.2d at 665. 120 West Fayette St., LLLP (\u201c120 West Fayette\u201d) is a taxpaying entity owning property outside of, but immediately adjacent to, the Superblock area. <em>Id. </em>It is no exaggeration to say that, over the course of the <em>Superblock Trilogy, </em>120 West Fayette fought \u201ctooth and nail\u201d to forestall (or re-shape) the fruition of the City\u2019s urban renewal implementation efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In <em>Superblock I, </em>120 West Fayette sought a declaratory judgment against the City, alleging that the LDA was illegal and <em>ultra vires. Superblock I, </em>407 Md. at 259-60, 964 A.2d at 665. Critically, 120 West Fayette alleged that the City violated its Charter and laws by entering into an illegal LDA; 120 West Fayette did <em>not </em>challenge the adoption a decade earlier of the urban renewal plan itself, a purely legislative act. <em>Superblock I, </em>407 Md. at 258, 964 A.2d at 664. The City moved to dismiss the complaint, and the Circuit Court granted the City\u2019s motion, concluding that 120 West Fayette failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>establish standing. <em>Superblock I, </em>407 Md. at 260, 964 A.2d at 665. 120 West Fayette appealed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>964 A.2d at 666. 120 West Fayette made two main appellate arguments: first, that they enjoyed taxpayer standing, and second, that they enjoyed property owner standing, being situated immediately adjacent to the Superblock properties. <em>Superblock I, </em>407 Md. at 265, 964 A.2d at 668. The Court analyzed these arguments in two parts, addressing first the question of whether they had taxpayer standing to challenge the LDA.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Superblock I, </em>407 Md. at 265-69, 964 A.2d at 668-71. We concluded that the allegations contained in 120 West Fayette\u2019s complaint were sufficient to establish taxpayer standing as a matter of law because the complaint alleged that the City engaged in illegal or <em>ultra vires </em>acts and that such acts would cause potentially 120 West Fayette pecuniary harm or an increase in taxes. <em>Superblock I, </em>407 Md. at 269, 964 A.2d at 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In the next part of the opinion, the Court considered the property owner standing argument. <em>Superblock I, </em>407 Md. at 269-73, 964 A.2d at 671-73. The Majority held \u201c[ajlternatively\u201d that 120 West Fayette enjoyed property owner standing as well. <em>Superblock I, </em>407 Md. at 270, 964 A.2d at 671. This part of the Majority\u2019s opinion in <em>Superblock I </em>recognized the \u201ccommon law requirement of personal and specific damage or \u2018aggrievement\u2019 [that] is embodied in Maryland\u2019s statutory [z]oning laws\u201d and discussed the meaning of the term \u201caggrievement.\u201d <em>Superblock I, </em>407 Md. at 270-71, 964 A.2d at 672. Relying on <em>Sugarloaf Citizens\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Department of Environment, </em>344 Md. 271, 297, 686 A.2d 605, 618 (1996), the Majority in <em>Superblock I </em>noted that the doctrine of property owner standing pertains to \u201cactions for judicial review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>administrative land use decisions.\u201d <em>Superblock I, </em>407 Md. at 271, 964 A.2d at 672. Analogizing implicitly actions taken under urban renewal and procurement ordinances to administrative land use decisions, \u201c[bjecause land use ... is at least one of the prime considerations with which an urban renewal plan is reasonably sure to be concerned,\u201d the Majority determined that \u201cthe principles that confer standing upon an adjoining, confronting or neighboring property owner to seek judicial review of land use decisions, logically extend to an adjoining, confronting or neighboring property owner that is challenging <em>a municipalities\u2019 </em>[sic] <em>allegedly illegal avoidance of urban renewal and procurement ordinances. </em>\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Superblock I, </em>407 Md. at 272, 964 A.2d at 673 (ellipses in original) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). This point bears repeating: the Court determined that the principles underlying the doctrine of property owner standing justified extending the doctrine to certain property owners wishing to challenge the <em>executive or administrative actions </em>of a municipality as it went about purportedly implementing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>urban renewal plan. The Court did not determine that those same principles justified extending the doctrine to property-owners wishing to challenge the legislative act of adopting the urban renewal plan. <em>See Superblock I, </em>407 Md. at 258, 964 A.2d at 665; <em>see id. </em>n. 1, 964 A.2d at 665 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">In the Third Act of the <em>Superblock Trilogy, </em>the Court limited the holding of <em>Superblock I. See State Center, </em>438 Md. at 524, 92 A.3d at 443. 120 West Fayette attempted in <em>Superblock III </em>to challenge the execution of a Memorandum of Agreement (the \u201cMOA\u201d) between the City and the Maryland Historical Trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) relating to the treatment of historic properties within the urban renewal area. <em>Superblock III, </em>426 Md. at 17, 43 A.3d at 357. The plaintiffs sought in the Circuit Court a declaration of rights regarding the terms of the MOA. <em>Id. </em>The City, along with other Appellees, moved to dismiss 120 West Fayette\u2019s complaint, suggesting that 120 West Fayette did not have standing to bring the action, as it was neither a party to nor an intended beneficiary of the MOA, as a contract. <em>Superblock III, </em>426 Md. at 17-18, 43 A.3d at 357. The Circuit Court agreed with the City and dismissed the complaint. <em>Superblock III, </em>426 Md. at 18, 43 A.3d at 357. 120 West Fayette argued on appeal, among other things,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that it had standing to seek a declaration of rights with regard to the MOA because it retained the same taxpayer and property owner standing that it did when it challenged the LDA in <em>Superblock I. Superblock III, </em>426 Md. at 25-35, 43 A.3d at 361-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">120 West Fayette argued in <em>Superblock III </em>that it retained the same taxpayer standing from <em>Superblock I </em>because it paid City and State taxes and challenged executive acts taken by government officials that were illegal and <em>ultra vires. Super-block III, </em>426 Md. at 25, 43 A.3d at 362. The Court disagreed, determining that <em>Superblock I </em>was \u201cfundamentally distin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>guishable\u201d from <em>Superblock III </em>because the complaint in <em>Superblock III </em>did not allege a violation of a City ordinance or the City Charter, but instead claimed a breach of a contractual provision of the MOA.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Superblock III, </em>426 Md. at 27-29, 43 A.3d at 363-64. Because 120 West Fayette did not allege a violation of legislative law, it was not eligible for taxpayer standing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Having determined that 120 West Fayette did not possess taxpayer standing, the Court in <em>Superblock III </em>turned to the plaintiffs property owner standing argument. 120 West Fayette argued that execution and interpretation of the MOA was a unique kind of action affecting land use because it provided a quasi-administrative body (the Trust) with control over demolition (or not) of historic (or arguably historic) structures in a designated historic area. <em>Superblock III, </em>426 Md. at 26, 43 A.3d at 362. As the execution of the MOA was a decision affecting land use, so the argument went, the alleged violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>of its terms in turn allegedly \u201cderive[d] from a quasi-land use decision.\u201d <em>Superblock III, </em>426 Md. at 25-26, 43 A.3d at 362. Thus, 120 West Fayette\u2019s property being located adjacent to the development site, it retained property owner standing, \u00e1 la <em>Superblock I. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The Court determined that the principles in <em>Superblock I </em>extending property owner standing to challenge the LDA executed in furtherance of the adopted urban renewal plan did not justify extending property owner standing to 120 West Fayette in <em>Superblock III </em>as the MOA was not a land use action by any means. <em>Superblock III, </em>426 Md. at 30, 43 A.3d at 365. The Court, for standing analysis purposes, defined a land use decision \u201cgenerally\u201d as \u201ca decision (typically an ordinance or regulation) enacted or promulgated by a legislative or administrative body for the purposes of directing the development of real estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>958 (9th ed. 2009)). The Court noted that in each instance in which <em>either </em>property owner standing <em>or </em>taxpayer standing was recognized as attributable to a complainant, the matter involved a \u201cland use decision\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">[O]ur research discloses not a single case of this Court approving the grant of <em>tax-payer or adjacent landowner standing </em>to an individual or entity in any context other than a challenge to or pursuant to a land use decision, as that term is generally understood. Indeed, in every case of this Court that we have found, the land use decision a party was seeking to challenge or enforce was either an ordinance, variance, reclassification, or special exception provided by a local zoning body, or a permit or license issued by an administrative agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-6\"><em>Superblock III, </em>426 Md. at 30-31, 43 A.3d at 365 (emphasis added). The Majority opined that the MOA could not be considered a land use decision because it was \u201cnot an ordinance, variance or permit,\u201d it \u201c[bound] only two parties (as opposed to the general public),\u201d it \u201cwas not enacted by a legislative or administrative body,\u201d and, \u201cmost important, the MOA does not direct the use or development of real estate in the Superblock.\u201d <em>Superblock III, </em>426 Md. at 33, 43 A.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>366. The Majority opinion catalogued all of the ways in which the MOA could not be considered a land use decision, in order to demonstrate, generally speaking, that the MOA fell outside of the defined category of circumstances in which <em>either </em>property owner standing or taxpayer standing might be implicated.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Majority in <em>Superblock III </em>did not state that all land use decisions would provide complainants necessarily with either property owner standing, taxpayer standing, or both. Rather, the opinion referred cursorily to a large and varied category of \u201cland use decisions\u201d to illustrate that the MOA was not numbered among them and no further \u2014 more careful \u2014 analysis was necessary to determine which type of standing \u2014 if either \u2014 120 West Fayette might have enjoyed. Stating that the MOA is not a land use decision (and thus not amenable to property owner or taxpayer standing analysis) is not the equivalent of stating that all \u201cland use decisions\u201d (as generally and vaguely defined in <em>Superblock III) </em>are eligible for both property owner <em>and </em>taxpayer standing. Ultimately, the Majority concluded that 120 West Fayette did not have standing to request a declaratory judgment regarding interpretation and enforcement of the terms of the MOA. <em>Superblock III, </em>426 Md. at 37, 43 A.3d at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">A thorough consideration of the <em>Superblock Trilogy </em>figured in our reasoning in <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. 451, 92 A.3d 400. <em>State Center </em>concerned the State Center Project, a $1.5 billion, multi-phase redevelopment project intended to replace aged and obsolete State office buildings with new facilities for significant State government office use and to revitalize an approximately 25-acre property owned by the State of Maryland in midtown Baltimore, all without burdening unduly the State\u2019s capital budget. <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 473, 92 A.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>at 413. The Maryland Department of General Services (\u201cDGS\u201d) and the Maryland Department of Transportation (\u201cMDOT\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cState Agencies\u201d) issued a Request for Qualifications (\u201cRFQ\u201d) soliciting a Master Developer who would receive the exclusive right to negotiate with the State for the entire project and receipt of a long-term leasehold interest. <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 475, 92 A.3d at 414. After extensive negotiations between DGS, MDOT, and the State Center, LLC, a prospective developer (collectively, the \u201cappellants\u201d), three main sets of agreements were executed: the Master Development Agreement (the \u201cMDA\u201d), the First Amendment to the MDA, and a collection of ground and occupancy leases between the State and State Center, LLC. <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 474, 92 A.3d at 413. Fifteen plaintiffs (all taxpayers of the State and property owners in downtown Baltimore, many with available office space for rent) (hereinafter the \u201cappellees\u201d) filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment against the State Agencies that the formative contracts for the Project were void and an injunction to halt the Project. <em>Id. </em>In a \u201cnovella-length\u201d opinion, <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 472 n. * *, 92 A.3d at 412 n. * *, we considered, among a number of issues, whether the appellees had standing under either the property owner or taxpayer standing doctrines to maintain their suits. <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 474, 92 A.3d at 413. We concluded ultimately that the appellees did not enjoy standing under the property owner doctrine, <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 538, 92 A.3d at 451, but did as taxpayers.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 583, 92 A.3d at 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Appellants in <em>State Center </em>argued that property owner standing was not available to the appellees because such standing is available \u201conly to challenges of pure-bred land-use decisions, such as zoning and nuisance claims.\u201d <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 522, 92 A.3d at 442. Because the claim did not concern a land-use decision, but was instead grounded on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>alleged violation of the State Procurement statutory scheme, as the argument went, property owner standing did not apply. <em>Id. </em>We noted that, pursuant to the holdings and reasoning of the <em>Superblock Trilogy, </em>property owner standing was only applicable in instances of \u201cland use decisions.\u201d <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 525, 92 A.3d at 443-44. We then considered whether the MDA, the First Amendment, or the collection of ground and occupancy leases fell within the category of land use decisions implicating the doctrine of property owner standing. <em>Id. </em>We determined ultimately that the MDA and First Amendment were land use decisions for the purpose of property owner standing analysis, but that the occupancy and ground leases were not. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">We reasoned that, although the MDA and First Amendment were not \u201ctraditional land use regulations or ordinances,\u201d they were \u201cformative contracts\u201d that \u201cgovern[ed] the development of real estate at the State Center.\u201d <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 525, 92 A.3d at 444. The principles that justified applying the property owner standing doctrine in <em>Superblock I </em>compelled us to extend property owner standing to matters such as where the MDA governed the development of real estate. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Superblock I, </em>407 Md. at 272, 964 A.2d at 673 (\u201c[T]he principles that confer standing upon an adjoining, confronting or neighboring property owner to seek judicial review of land use decisions, logically extend to an adjoining, confronting or neighboring property owner that is challenging <em>a [Govern</em>ment\u2019s] <em>allegedly illegal avoidance of </em>... procurement ordinances [or statutes].\u201d (alterations added in <em>State </em>Center) (emphasis added) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted))). Critically, negotiation and execution of the MDA (and, accordingly, the First Amendment) was considered rightly an executive function, being an agreement entered into by the State Agencies. In contrast, we suggested that the ground and occupancy leases did not constitute land use decisions as such because they did not \u201cdirect the development of any real property.\u201d <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 526, 92 A.3d at 444. Just as in <em>Superblock III, </em>this comment does not endorse the conclusion that just \u201cland use decisions\u201d \u201cdi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>rectfing] the development of any real property\u201d warrant testing according to property owner standing; rather, the comment suggests that the ground and occupancy leases simply fall outside of the universe in which the doctrine of property owner standing <em>might </em>be implicated. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">As demonstrated by <em>Superblock I, Superblock III, </em>and <em>State Center, </em>the doctrine of property owner standing may apply to administrative land use decisions and other land use actions undertaken as executive functions. We have not applied heretofore the doctrine to purely legislative processes and actions, nor does our body of case law on the subject warrant applying the doctrine to judicial challenges to legislative acts reached through solely legislative processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">\n<em>C. Property Owner Standing: Why Extending It Further Is Ill-Advised</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">It takes scant imagination to foresee the problems that would arise if complainants may satisfy the judicial requirement of standing based on the doctrine of property owner standing when challenging comprehensive zoning ordinances. As noted above, the comprehensive zoning ordinance at issue here examined approximately 59,045 discrete parcels or lots spread across 4,265 acres of Anne Arundel County. Of those 59,045 parcels or lots, the pre-existing zoning classifications for 264 individual parcels or lots were changed. If one of those reclassifications were found to be improper, do all fall because the overall process was a comprehensive one? How might severability be approached, if at all?<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If the Citizens\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>understanding of property owner standing was correct, a protestant who wishes to challenge a comprehensive zoning ordinance would be deemed \u201cspecially aggrieved\u201d merely because the person or entity owns property \u201cadjoining, confronting or nearby\u201d a target property <em>{prima facie </em>aggrieved) or owns property slightly farther away (generally speaking, between 200 to 1000 feet away from a target property), but with additional \u201cplus factors\u201d (almost <em>prima facie </em>aggrieved). <em>See Ray, </em>430 Md. at 81-91, 59 A.3d at 549-54. This could mean, practically speaking, that the owners of 59,045 parcels or lots <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>in Councilmanic Districts I and IV, along with other property owners located adjoining, confronting, or nearby the external boundaries of those Districts, as well as other property owners located between 200 to 1000 feet from the borders of the Districts (so long as they allege additional \u201cplus factors\u201d) may <em>all </em>have standing to challenge Bill 12-11. Hypothetically, thousands of plaintiffs with the benefit of property owner standing could have standing to challenge comprehensive zoning legislation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This would be unworkable entirely.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Court has been reticent in the extreme to construe standing doctrines so broadly, out of the reasonable fear that to do so would eviscerate altogether the distinct doctrines.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">In <em>Ray, </em>two individual residents located approximately 0.4 miles away from an approved PUD argued that they were specially aggrieved in a manner different from the general public in their attempt to challenge judicially the PUD\u2019s approval. <em>Ray, </em>430 Md. at 78-80, 59 A.3d at 547-48. On direct appeal, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that the two residents\u2019 aggrievement was the same as that of the general public, so they did not have property owner standing. <em>Ray, </em>430 Md. at 79-80, 59 A.3d at 548. Before us, the petitioners argued that the intermediate appellate court compared improperly them to other residents of the neighborhoods which they asserted the PUD would impact. <em>Ray, </em>430 Md. at 86, 59 A.3d at 552.

Taxpayer Standing: What Is It?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">We discussed the doctrine of taxpayer standing at length in <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 538-83, 92 A.3d at 451-79. This common law standing doctrine \u201cpermits taxpayers to seek the aid of courts, exercising equity powers, to enjoin illegal and <em>ultra vires </em>acts of public officials where those acts are reasonably likely to result in pecuniary loss to the taxpayer.\u201d <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 538, 92 A.3d at 451. The doctrine exists to ensure that governments act within the bounds of the law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">In this state the Courts have always maintained with jealous vigilance the restraints and limitations imposed by law upon the exercise of power by municipal and other corporations; and have not hesitated to exercise their rightful jurisdiction for the purpose of restraining them within the limits of their lawful authority, and of protecting the citizen from the consequence of their unauthorized or illegal acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-6\"><em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 539-40, 92 A.3d at 452 (quoting <em>Baltimore v. Gill, </em>31 Md. 375, 395 (1869) (emphasis added in <em>State </em>Center)). Like the doctrine of property owner standing, taxpayer standing provides the \u201ccause of action\u201d standing sufficient for justiciability. <em>See State Center, </em>438 Md. at 546, 92 A.3d at 456 (\u201c[T]axpayer suits in this State do not require also a separate private right of action....\u201d). Neither the doctrines of taxpayer standing nor property owner standing provide unfettered access to the courts to citizens unhappy with all actions taken by state or local governing bodies, however. Under the taxpayer standing doctrine, as well as the property owner standing doctrine, \u201cthe complainant must have a special interest in the subject-matter of the suit distinct from that of the general public.\u201d <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 519, 92 A.3d at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Due to the \u201cdisorganized\u201d and \u201cseemingly contradictory\u201d state of our earlier cases discussing the doctrine of taxpayer standing, the- <em>State Center </em>opinion took some pain to examine the application of the doctrine, clarify it, and set it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>straight. <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 540-41, 92 A.3d at 453. A party satisfies the \u201cspecial interest,\u201d also called \u201cspecial damage,\u201d standing requirement by alleging \u201cboth T) an action by a municipal corporation or public official that is illegal or <em>ultra vires, </em>and 2) that the action may injuriously affect the taxpayer\u2019s property, meaning that it reasonably may result in a pecuniary loss to the taxpayer or an increase in taxes.\u2019 \u201d <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 540, 92 A.3d at 453 (quoting <em>Kendall v.

After establishing those two general principles, the <em>State Center </em>opinion discussed preliminarily the \u201crequisites for eligibility\u201d to assert standing under the doctrine, <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 547-55, 92 A.3d at 457-62, and then discussed in depth the requirements to constitute a \u201cspecial interest\u201d distinct from that of the general public. <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 556-83, 92 A.3d at 463-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">To establish eligibility to maintain a suit under the taxpayer standing doctrine, a \u201ccomplainant must allege two things: (1) that the complainant is a taxpayer and (2) that the suit is brought, either expressly or implicitly, on behalf of all other taxpayers.\u201d <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 547, 92 A.3d at 457; <em>see id. </em>(\u201c[U]nder the taxpayer standing doctrine, a complainant\u2019s standing rests upon the theoretical concept that the action is brought not as an individual action, but rather as a class action by a taxpayer on behalf of other similarly situated taxpayers.\u201d). The second required allegation to establish eligibility to bring a suit under the taxpayer doctrine touches on a tension between the requirement that the suit be brought on behalf of other taxpayers and the requirement that the complainant have a special interest in the subject matter. We explored this tension in <em>Slate Center, </em>438 Md. at 552-55, 92 A.3d at 460-62, concluding that even if the complainant does not allege expressly that he, she, or it brings their suit on behalf of other taxpayers situated similarly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">[T]he doctrine may apply yet, if the action is, in fact, on behalf of the taxpayers as a class, by necessary implication from the nature of the alleged injury pleaded in the [com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>plaint]. In other words, the allegations of the injury must apply to all taxpayers in the assumed class and not merely the plaintiffs as private complainants, in order for the taxpayer standing doctrine to apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 554-55, 92 A.3d at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Once a complainant establishes eligibility to bring a suit, he, she, or it must allege, as noted above, both a governmental action that is illegal or <em>ultra vires </em>and that the action may affect injuriously the taxpayer\u2019s property (meaning that it reasonably may result in a pecuniary loss to the taxpayer or an increase in taxes). <em>See State Center, </em>438 Md. at 540, 92 A.3d at 453. The \u201cillegal or <em>ultra vires\u201d </em>requirement \u201chas been applied leniently and seems rather easy to meet\u201d \u2014 the taxpayer need not be right ultimately in his, her, or its contention, so long as the allegation is advanced in good faith. <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 555-56, 92 A.3d at 462-63 (citing <em>Funk v.

The \u201cspecific injury\u201d requirement is forgiving similarly and \u201c \u2018has been interpreted repeatedly to require a showing that the action being challenged results in a pecuniary loss or an increase in taxes.\u2019 \u201d <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 556-57, 92 A.3d at 463 (quoting <em>Citizens Planning and Housing Ass\u2019n v.

We concluded that \u201cthe issue is not what \u2018type\u2019 of harm is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>sufficient necessarily, but rather a much more forgiving question of whether the type of harm is one that may affect the complainant\u2019s taxes.\u201d <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 565, 92 A.3d at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Naturally, there must be a \u201cnexus\u201d between the showing of potential pecuniary damage and the challenged act. <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 572-80, 92 A.3d at 472-77. This is \u201c[plerhaps the most frequent stumbling block\u201d for complainants claiming taxpayer standing. <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 572, 92 A.3d at 472. We concluded in <em>State Center </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMH\">[a] review of the cases reveals that the taxpayer must be asserting a challenge and seeking a remedy that, if granted, would alleviate the tax burden on that individual and others; otherwise, standing does not exist. The corollary to this requirement is also that taxpayers may challenge only certain statutes. In viewing other areas of law, we have not permitted taxpayers to enforce any statute unless it affects the taxpayers\u2019 individual tax burden.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-5\"><em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 572-73, 92 A.3d at 472 (footnote omitted). There must be therefore a connection between the alleged illegal or <em>ultra vires </em>act, the harm caused to the taxpayer, and the potential for the remedy to alleviate the harm incurred. <em>See State Center, </em>438 Md. at 573-75, 92 A.3d at 473-74. Furthermore, this nexus must be true not only for the complainant, but also all similarly situated taxpayers. <em>See State Center, </em>438 Md. at 575, 92 A.3d at 474 (\u201c[T]he remedy sought, if granted, must alleviate <em>all </em>similarly situated taxpayers\u2019 burden, not just the plaintiffs\u2019 personal burdens.\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">\n<em>B.

Section 1-210 appears to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>merely a codification of the common law principle that courts presume that an enactment is severable unless it appears that the legislative body intended otherwise. <em>See Park v.

The Dissent appeal\u2019s to introduce a fourth category of protestants with standing who, despite being removed from the subject property, may be able nevertheless to establish the fact that he, she, or its personal or property rights are specially and adversely affected by rezoning legislation. <em>See supra </em>note 9 and accompanying text; <em>Ray, </em>430 Md. at 85-86, 59 A.3d at 552.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b603-5\">.

Although <em>all </em>actions of rezoning result in adoption of an ordinance or resolution of some kind expressing the final decision to rezone (by whatever process leading to that decision), not all rezoning ordinances or resolutions are of the same nature, nor should they be treated the same for all purposes. None of the preceding cases <em>(Habliston v. City of Salisbury, </em>258 Md. 350, 265 A.2d 885 (1970); <em>Chatham Corporation v. Beltram, </em>252 Md. 578, 251 A.2d 1 (1969); <em>Aubinoe v.

That is because neither we nor the dissenters could find one. Thus, the trial judge here was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The focus should be on the nature of the underlying process culminating in a rezoning action to determine its true character, not the fact that an ordinance results nor the modality by which the plaintiff sought judicial review.

Contrary to the Majority, I would hold that the property owner standing doctrine (\u201cproximity standing\u201d) applied in <em>Bryniarski </em>and <em>Ray </em>is appropriate when a protestant challenges legislative comprehensive zoning. Use of this doctrine will protect landowners who are specially aggrieved by a zoning change and will not unduly burden either local governments or the courts. It is more consistent with our recent case law than the standard adopted by the Majority \u2014 taxpayer standing. The latter doctrine, applicable to challenges to governmental expenditures of taxpayer dollars, is unsuitable to address governmental land use decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">In its attempt to disavow a trend towards broad use of proximity standing, the Majority re-interprets our decisions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number><em>Superblock I,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> Superblock III,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>State Center,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>imposing a new, more circumscribed reading than is justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">In <em>Superblock I, </em>we applied proximity standing because the protestants were challenging <em>land use decisions. </em>We reasoned that \u201c[bjecause <em>land use </em>... is at least one of the prime considerations with which an urban renewal plan is reasonably sure to be concerned, ... the principles that confer standing upon an adjoining, confronting or neighboring property owner to seek judicial review of <em>land use </em>decisions, logically extend to an adjoining, confronting or neighboring property owner that is challenging a municipalit[y\u2019s] allegedly illegal avoidance of urban renewal and procurement ordinances.\u201d <em>Superblock I, </em>407 Md. 253, 272, 964 A.2d 662, 673 (2009) (first ellipses in original) (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). The Court did not ground its decision on the administrative nature of the land use decision approving the Land Disposition Agreement. <em>See id. </em>at 273, 964 A.2d at 673 (\u201cThe facts alleged by 120 West Fayette support its standing to bring its claim by virtue of its status as a property owner adjacent to the Superblock.\u201d). The Majority\u2019s claim that <em>Superblock I </em>stands for the proposition that proximity standing is limited to challenges to a decision by an administrative, executive, or quasi-judicial body is simply not supported by the language of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In <em>Superblock III, </em>this Court adopted a broad definition of \u201cland use decision\u201d: any ordinance or regulation \u201cenacted or promulgated by a legislative or administrative body for the purpose of directing the development of real estate.\u201d 426 Md. 14, 30, 43 A.3d 355, 365 (2012) (citation omitted); <em>see id. </em>at 31, 43 A.3d at 365 (providing the following examples of \u201cland use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>decisions\u201d: ordinances, variances, reclassifications, special exceptions, permits, and licenses). Recently, in <em>State Center, </em>we again endorsed that broad definition. 488 Md. 451, 525, 92 A.3d 400, 444 (2014) (Harrell, J.) (concluding that \u201calthough not traditional land use regulations or ordinances,\u201d the formative contracts for the State Center Project were land use decisions because they \u201cgovern the development of real estate\u201d). Because we held in <em>Superblock I </em>that proximity standing applies to challenges to land use decisions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and we confirmed in <em>Superblock III </em>and <em>State Center </em>that \u201cland use decisions\u201d are any decisions directing or governing the development of real estate, I deduce that proximity standing is not limited to administrative land use decisions, but also applies to legislative land use decisions like comprehensive zoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The Majority relies heavily on a \u201cfloodgates\u201d rationale, arguing that because Bill 12-11 encompassed the entirety of Councilmanic Districts I and TV, applying proximity standing to challenges to Bill 12-11 would arguably permit every property owner in these Districts to gain standing. The Majority hypothesizes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">This could mean, practically speaking, that the owners of 59,045 parcels or lots in Councilmanic Districts I and IV, along with other property owners located adjoining, confronting, or nearby the external boundaries of those Districts, as well as other property owners located between 200 to 1000 feet from the borders of the Districts (so long as they allege additional \u201cplus factors\u201d) may <em>all </em>have standing to challenge Bill 12-11. Hypothetically, thousands of plaintiffs with the benefit of property owner standing could have standing to challenge comprehensive zoning legislation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Maj. Op. at 570-71, 113 A.3d at 658 (emphasis in original). This projection is simply hyperbole. Only those property owners living in very close proximity to the 260 parcels that underwent zoning changes under Bill 12-11 could have standing to challenge the comprehensive rezoning. This entire \u201cfloodgates\u201d reasoning is unsound.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Indeed, existing law already provides a dam against flooding. The <em>Bryniarski</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>special aggrievement standard, as further explicated in Ray,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> will effectively limit the class of plaintiffs entitled to judicial relief. All property owners must demonstrate special aggrievement in order to gain standing to challenge a land use decision like a legislative comprehensive rezoning. <em>Ray v. Mayor of Balt., </em>430 Md. 74, 77, 59 A.3d 545, 547 (2013) (\u201cAs we have explained, to have standing to challenge a zoning reclassification, a person\u2019s property interest \u2018must be such that he is personally and specially affected in a way different from that suffered by the public generally.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery Cnty. Bd. of Appeals, </em>247 Md. 137, 144, 230 A.2d 289, 294 (1967))). Contrary to the Majority\u2019s view, proximity standing does not eviscerate the special aggrievement requirement, but rather allows protestants to demonstrate special aggrievement based on their proximity and other \u201cplus factors.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 85, 59 A.3d at 551-52 (the <em>prima facie </em>and almost <em>prima facie </em>aggrievement standards are based on special aggrievement).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">In <em>Ray, </em>we concluded that \u201cproximity is the most important factor to be considered\u201d when determining whether a protestant has been specially aggrieved. <em>Id. </em>at 82-83, 59 A.3d at 550. The importance of proximity to special aggrievement does not recede simply because a local government enacts a comprehensive rezoning ordinance. In this case, one of the Citizens, Rosie Shorter, owns property that adjoins or confronts property that Bill 12-11 rezoned from open space, rural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>agricultural, or low-density residential classifications to mixed-use residential. Banks, grocery stores, nursing homes, restaurants, taverns, office buildings, and health clubs are all permitted in zones classified mixed-use residential. <em>See </em>Anne Arundel Cnty. Code \u00a7 18-8-301 (b). The mechanism for a change in zoning classification of a property should not eliminate the presumption that Ms. Shorter is <em>prima facie </em>aggrieved based on her proximity to land now subject to a far more intensive use. <em>See Ray, </em>430 Md. at 81, 59 A.3d at 549 (\u201c \u2018An adjoining, confronting or nearby property owner is deemed, <em>prima facie, </em>to be specially damaged and, therefore, a person aggrieved.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Bryniarski, </em>247 Md. at 145, 230 A.2d at 294)).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">There is no reason to think that most comprehensive rezonings, which are adopted by <em>elected </em>officials, will be so offensive to property owners that, as the Majority projects, thousands (or even hundreds) of them will pursue judicial relief. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 570-71, 113 A.3d at 658. Surely, the costs of conducting such a lawsuit, together with the dismal prospects for success on the merits, will be unpalatable to most.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Even with standing secured, property owners face a precipitous up-hill battle to win a declaration that a comprehensive rezoning ordinance is invalid. We have long recognized that comprehensive rezoning ordinances are entitled to a strong presumption of correctness. <em>See, e.g., Howard Cnty., Md. v. Dorsey, </em>292 Md. 351, 355, 438 A.2d 1339, 1342 (1982) (\u201cThis Court has repeatedly recognized that there is a strong presumption of the correctness of ... comprehensive rezoning, and that \u2018strong evidence\u2019 of error is required to overcome that presumption.\u201d (citation omitted)). According Respondents standing would not change the substantive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">As we said in <em>Anderson House, LLC v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Rockville:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">Zoning decisions which are made during a comprehensive rezoning process are strongly presumed to be correct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Comprehensive rezoning is a vital legislative function, and in making zoning decisions during the comprehensive rezoning process, a [zoning authority] is exercising what has been described as its \u2018plenary\u2019 legislative power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">402 Md. 689, 723, 939 A.2d 116, 136 (2008) (alteration in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We elaborated on the strength of the presumption of correctness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqIl\">Indisputably, [the challenger] carries the heavy burden of establishing, by clear and affirmative evidence, that [the Ordinance] is invalid. Even where reasonable doubt exists, the Ordinance must be sustained. \u201cIn other words, the legislature is presumed to have acted within [its police powers] so that if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain [the Ordinance], the existence of that state of facts as a basis for the passage of the [regulation] must be assumed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 724, 939 A.2d at 137 (citations and footnotes omitted); <em>see also Dorsey, </em>292 Md. at 355, 438 A.2d at 1342 (\u201c \u2018While, in recent years, we have had occasion to enunciate a number of important principles applicable to the law of zoning, perhaps none is more rudimentary than the strong presumption of the correctness of original zoning and of comprehensive rezoning.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)). Applying proximity standing to comprehensive rezoning would not jettison this strong presumption of correctness.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Even if declaratory judgment actions do modestly increase, that cost is justified by the need to provide a judicial means to challenge an illegal legislative action injurious to a property interest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See City of Balt. v. Gill, </em>31 Md. 375, 395 (1869) (\u201cIn this State the courts have always maintained with jealous vigilance the restraints and limitations imposed by law upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>the exercise of power by municipal and other corporations; and have not hesitated to exercise their rightful jurisdiction for the purpose of restraining them within the limits of their lawful authority, and of protecting the citizen from the consequence of their unauthorized or illegal acts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The Majority holds that \u201c[t]he doctrine of taxpayer standing \u2014 already available to some complainants challenging administrative land use decisions \u2014 is the appropriate standing doctrine that complainants challenging comprehensive zoning legislation must satisfy.\u201d Maj. Op. at 575, 113 A.3d at 661. This doctrine, however, provides a more theoretical than real remedy because as I explain below, its availability is severely limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">With taxpayer standing \u201cthere must be a \u2018nexus\u2019 between the showing of potential pecuniary damage and the challenged act.\u201d Maj. Op. at 579,113 A.3d at 663 (citing <em>State Center, </em>438 Md. at 572-80, 92 A.3d at 472-77). In <em>State Center, </em>we recently explained the nexus requirement, indicating that \u201cthe challenged act must affect potentially a tax that the taxpayer-plaintiff pays.\u201d 438 Md. at 572, 92 A.3d at 472. We also concluded that a thorough review of our precedent \u201creveals that the taxpayer must be asserting a challenge and seeking a remedy that, if granted, would <em>alleviate the tax burden </em>on that individual and others; otherwise, standing does <em>not </em>exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (footnote omitted). We then went on to demonstrate that \u201c[mjany cases emphasize that standing <em>cannot </em>exist if the remedy sought would <em>not decrease the taxpayer\u2019s monetary burden.\u201d Id. </em>at 573, 92 A.3d at 472 (emphasis added); <em>see, e.g., Citizens Comm. of Anne Arundel Cnty. Inc. v. Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Anne Arundel Cnty., </em>233 Md. 398, 197 A.2d 108 (1964) (plaintiffs challenging laws authorizing licensed gambling failed to satisfy taxpayer standing because the remedy they sought, if granted, would not decrease their monetary burden as taxpayers); <em>Kerpelman v. Bd. of Pub. Works of Md., </em>261 Md. 436, 276 A.2d 56 (1971) (plaintiff challenging conveyances of state land failed to allege taxpayer standing because she did not allege that the remedy she sought would decrease her monetary burden). These cases reveal the paucity of the taxpayer standing remedy offered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>the Majority. The inadequacy of that remedy is a compelling reason to extend to comprehensive rezonings our longstanding jurisprudence that property owners with sufficient proximity can challenge zoning changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">In this case, several Respondents produced affidavits stating that their property values will decrease as a result of Bill 12-11. They cannot achieve taxpayer standing because, with reduced property values, their taxes will not increase. They would have proximity standing because they live no more than 1000 feet from the rezoned parcel, and we have concluded that a depreciated property value is a \u201cplus factor\u201d supporting special aggrievement. <em>See Habliston v. City of Salisbury, </em>258 Md. 350, 352, 354-55, 265 A.2d 885, 885-87 (1970) (protestant was specially aggrieved based on proximity and lay testimony of decreasing property value); <em>Chatham Corp. v. Beltram, </em>252 Md. 578, 579-80, 584, 251 A.2d 1, 2, 4 (1969) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">We have long held that protestants who are specially aggrieved have standing to challenge land use decisions. <em>See, e.g., Cassel v. Mayor of Balt., </em>195 Md. 348, 353, 73 A.2d 486, 487-88 (1950) (\u201cIt is an established rule that a court of equity has the power to restrain the enforcement of a void statute or ordinance at the suit of a person injuriously affected.\u201d); <em>Bryniarski, </em>247 Md. at 144, 230 A.2d at 294 (protestant has standing to challenge a zoning action if \u201che is personally and specially affected in a way different from that suffered by the public generally\u201d); <em>Ray, </em>430 Md. at 77-78, 59 A.3d at 547 (a protestant has standing to challenge a land use decision if he satisfies the special aggrievement test articulated in <em>Bryniarski). </em>The <em>prima facie </em>and almost <em>prima facie </em>aggrievement standards \u2014 the two principal components of proximity standing \u2014 both predicate standing on special aggrievement. <em>See Bryniarski, </em>247 Md. at 143-44, 230 A.2d at 294; <em>Ray, </em>430 Md. at 85, 59 A.3d at 551-52. Thus, applying proximity standing to challenges to legislative comprehensive rezoning ensures that all protestants who are specially aggrieved by such rezoning have standing to challenge it in the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Finally, we have accorded standing to owners whose property classifications were changed as a part of a legislative comprehensive rezoning. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 580-81, 113 A.3d at 664; <em>see, e.g., Anderson House, </em>402 Md. at 706, 939 A.2d at 126 (\u201cAnderson House is entitled to have the Circuit Court consider its claims as to Ordinance 7-03 because the C-T zone created by that legislation was applied to the Anderson House property through Ordinance 21-05. Thus, its rights were affected and the Circuit Court had jurisdiction to review the challenge to its enactment.\u201d); <em>Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Queen Anne\u2019s Cnty. v. Miles, </em>246 Md. 355, 364, 228 A.2d 450, 454 (1967) (protestants had standing to challenge a comprehensive rezoning ordinance because they alleged that \u201cthe resale value of [their property], for development purposes, [was] decreased by its zoning [re]classification\u201d). The Majority recognizes that these owners can challenge a comprehensive rezoning, but ignores the patent inequity of denying standing to their closest neighbors.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In conclusion, I would hold that proximity standing is the appropriate basis upon which a judicial challenge to a comprehensive zoning legislative action may be maintained. This conclusion is the one most consistent with our precedent, and it ensures that all property owners who are specially aggrieved by an act of legislative comprehensive rezoning have a means to challenge it in the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Judge BATTAGLIA and Judge McDONALD authorize me to state that they join in the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-6\">. <em>120 W.
