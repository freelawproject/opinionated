Steve Bell, </em>442 Md. 539, 113 A.3d 639, 2015 WL 1798953 (2015), filed immediately prior to the opinion in the present case, we concluded that the doctrine of property owner standing is not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>appropriate test for a judicial challenge to a comprehensive zoning action. <em>See id., </em>at 546-47, 113 A.3d 639. Rather, plaintiffs wishing to challenge in Maryland courts the legislative process and final action adopting a comprehensive zoning are required to demonstrate taxpayer standing \u2014 the standing doctrine applicable to judicial challenges to legislative actions. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, <em>Bell </em>answers the first two questions presented to us in this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>With that as a given, we proceed here to determine whether the Protestants in this matter alleged sufficiently a basis for their standing to challenge the adoption by the County Council for Anne Arundel County in 2011 of a comprehensive zoning ordinance for a large, different portion of Anne Arundel County than was involved in <em>Bell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"AbW\">Anne Arundel County (the \u201cCounty\u201d), a charter county, adopted in 2009 a comprehensive land use master plan, called a \u201cGeneral Development Plan\u201d (\u201cGDP\u201d), for the entire County. During the run-up to that action, between 2007 and 2009, the County engaged in the process of preparing the GDP. The County\u2019s Office of Planning and Zoning (the \u201cOPZ\u201d) prepared a draft of the GDP and submitted it to the County Council (the \u201cCouncil\u201d) in July 2009. After hearings on the draft (including several amendments), the Council approved the final GDP by Bill 64-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Thereafter, beginning in late 2009, the County initiated a county-wide, systematic, and comprehensive review of zoning with a mind to implementing, as appropriate, the recommendations of the GDP through a series of comprehensive zoning bills. The County is comprised of seven Councilmanic Districts, which the OPZ combined into three groups for the purpose of its zoning review and the comprehensive zoning initiatives. One of these groups consisted of properties located in Councilmanic Districts VI and VII, which are together referred to colloquially as \u201cSouth County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Property owners desiring rezoning were given an opportunity to submit applications to the County. After posting online the received property owner applications, the OPZ evaluated the applications in light of the recommendations of the GDP, made a recommendation as to each application, and incorporated its various other recommendations in a draft of what became Bill 44-11.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The County Planning Advisory Board reviewed the OPZ\u2019s recommendations and, after holding public hearings and receiving testimony and written statements from the public, made its recommendations to the County Executive.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In August 2011, the Council adopted Bill 44-11, with 40 amendments to the draft bill submitted by the OPZ. The County Executive signed Bill 44-11, but vetoed 16 of the amendments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Council voted successfully to override ten of those vetoes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Bill 44-11 became \u201cfinal\u201d and effective on 21 October 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">On 6 October 2011, several non-profit community associations and individual property owners (collectively, the \u201cProtestants\u201d or, later in this opinion, \u201cRespondents\u201d) filed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment and Equitable Relief, in which they sought specifically a declaration that certain provisions of Bill 44-11 were void because assertedly they granted illegal spot zoning and were inconsistent with the recommendations of the GDP. In the Complaint, the individual property owners each alleged that they owned property and resided \u201cnear\u201d or \u201cadjacent to\u201d one of the properties rezoned by Bill 44-11<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that \u201cthe value of [their] property and [ ] enjoyment thereof will be substantially reduced as a result of this rezoning.\u201d Owners of some of the properties rezoned by Bill 44-11 (collectively, the \u201cDefendants\u201d) filed motions to intervene, all of which were granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The County and several Defendants filed motions to dismiss the Complaint, arguing that the Protestants (1) failed to exhaust required administrative remedies; (2) failed to state a claim for a declaratory judgment; and (3) did not have standing. Protestants filed a memorandum in opposition, but, before the Circuit Court ruled on the motions to dismiss, the Protestants filed on 27 January 2012 an Amended Complaint in which they added additional plaintiffs and defendants. The other allegations of the Protestants, however, remained the same. Most of the Defendants and the County responded with another wave of motions to dismiss, reiterating their previous arguments. One of the intervening Defendants (Alva Reta Trahan, hereinafter \u201cMs. Trahan\u201d), in her motion to dismiss, argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Protestants \u201cdo not allege facts sufficient to establish taxpayer standing, and should dismiss [most of the counts of the complaint] because [Protestants] do not allege facts sufficient to establish common law standing.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ms. Trahan argued that, as the Protestants had not alleged that Bill 44-11 would result in an increase in their taxes (and in fact alleged that Bill 44-11 would result in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>decreased property values), they could not satisfy the requirements of taxpayer standing. The rest of Ms. Trahan\u2019s arguments echoed those of the other Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Protestants submitted a memorandum in opposition to Ms. Trahan\u2019s motion to dismiss (hereinafter \u201cMay 2013 Memorandum\u201d), in which they argued, among other things, that their allegations satisfied the requirements of <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery County Board of Appeals, </em>247 Md. 137, 230 A.2d 289 (1967). Furthermore, in a footnote, <em>Protestants noted that they \u201cdo not claim to have standing as taxpayers or that any of the plaintiff organizations have standing except as derivatively through their members.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Following a hearing, the Circuit Court issued an Opinion and Order on 27 March 2012, dismissing the Protestants\u2019 Amended Complaint, but granting leave to amend within 30 days. The trial judge noted, in a section entitled \u201cDisputed Legal Issues\u201d: \u201cDefendants claim that Plaintiffs lack both taxpayer and common-law standing. The Plaintiffs argue[] in response that their Complaint alleges harm to several individual plaintiffs sufficient to give them standing to bring this action.... \u201d In a later footnote, the trial judge recognized that Protestants conceded in the May 2013 Memorandum that they did not claim to have taxpayer standing, and proceeded to consider whether they satisfied property owner standing. Relying on <em>Bryniarski </em>for the proposition that a plaintiff seeking a declaratory judgment that a zoning ordinance is unlawful must allege special harm with \u201cdefinite\u201d allegations and \u201ccompetent evidence,\u201d <em>see Bryniarski, </em>247 Md. at 144, 230 A.2d at 294, the Circuit Court concluded that all Protestants lacked standing. The Circuit Court reasoned that \u201c[t]he mere fact that several [Protestants] own property adjacent to property rezoned by Bill 44-11 does not by itself meet the burden of proving special damage by competent evidence required in cases seeking a declaratory judgment.\u201d The court\u2019s reasoning continued that the Protestants\u2019 allegations of reduced property values and enjoyment of the properties were \u201cindistinguishable from those found insufficient in <em>[Ray v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>203 Md.App. 15, 36 A.3d 521 (2012), <em>affd on other grounds, </em>430 Md. 74, 59 A.3d 545 (2013) ].\u201d Finally, the Circuit Court concluded that Protestants failed to state a claim for spot zoning.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">On 26 April 2012, the Protestants filed a Second Amended Complaint, adding additional plaintiffs and defendants yet again and seeking a declaration that seven of the amendments to Bill 44-11 and the rezoning of one additional property<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>were void because they were inconsistent with the recommendations of the GDP, constituted illegal spot zoning, and exceeded the County\u2019s zoning authority. The Protestants reiterated generally the proximity of their properties to the rezoned properties, and alleged further various discrete injuries, including reduced property values, reduced enjoyment of the properties, increased traffic, increased noise and light pollution, fear of damage to trees and mailboxes on their properties as a result of increased traffic, damage to the rural nature of the properties, increased run-off from storm water, and the pressure to permit additional and more intense commercial uses in the future. One Protestant, Shirley Harrison (\u201cMs. Harrison\u201d), who owns and resides on a property \u201cadjacent to\u201d a property rezoned in Bill 44-11, reiterated her allegations that enjoyment of her property would be reduced substantially and that the rezoning would cause an increase in traffic. She alleged further in the Second Amended Complaint that she \u201calso fears that her property taxes will increase due to the R5 zoning on the adjacent rezoned property.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">In response to the Second Amended Complaint, some of the Defendants, including the County, filed new motions to dismiss, asserting that the Protestants lacked standing still, failed to state a judiciable controversy ripe for adjudication, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>failed to join all necessary parties, and failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The Protestants, in their opposition to the motion to dismiss the second amended complaint filed by the County, reiterated, among other things, their argument that their \u201callegations of special aggrievement are sufficient\u201d to establish their standing. The Protestants analyzed in this portion of their opposition <em>Bryniarski </em>and <em>Ray, </em>as well as <em>120 W. Fayette St., LLLP v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>407 Md. 253, 964 A.2d 662 (2009) [hereinafter <em>\u201cSuperblock I </em>\u201d]. In their discussion of <em>Superblock I, </em>the Protestants appear to have conflated our jurisprudence regarding property owner standing with that directed to taxpayer standing, when referring to the allegedly <em>ultra vires </em>action of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore. Furthermore, ignoring apparently certain of the limited revisions made in the allegations of their Second Amended Complaint, the Protestants suggested, in a footnote, that \u201c[a]ll of the individual Plaintiffs allege that they anticipate a reduction in the value of their property and their enjoyment of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">One of the Defendants (Boone\u2019s Estates, Inc., hereinafter \u201cBoone\u2019s Estates\u201d), focused pointedly in its motion to dismiss on the allegations of Ms. Harrison. Boone\u2019s Estates argued that Ms. Harrison\u2019s allegations failed to satisfy the \u201cspecial damage\u201d requirements of <em>Bryniarski </em>and that she failed to allege that she would be \u201cspecially affected ... in a way different from that suffered by the public generally.\u201d (emphasis removed). Specifically, Boone\u2019s Estates contended that Ms. Harrison\u2019s new allegations of an increase in traffic and an increase in property taxes did not constitute special harm because both harms would be regional in scope. Finally, Boone\u2019s Estates maintained that, \u201cif it is argued that [Ms. Harrison] should have standing to challenge Amendment 26 as a taxpayer, the argument must fail because [she] has not alleged that she will suffer pecuniary losses from the change in zoning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>The Protestants filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss filed by Boone\u2019s Estates as well. In this opposition the Protestants noted that Ms. Harrison\u2019s revised allegations were sufficient to give her property owner standing, relying on <em>Cassel v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>195 Md. 348, 353, 73 A.2d 486, 488 (1950) (concluding, with minimal analysis, that property owners residing less than 100 feet from property rezoned by a piecemeal rezoning ordinance had standing to attack the validity of the amending ordinance), and <em>Habliston v. City of Salisbury, </em>258 Md. 350, 355, 265 A.2d 885, 887 (1970) (granting property owner standing in a challenge to a piecemeal rezoning). The Protestants did not address in any way Boone\u2019s Estates arguments regarding taxpayer standing, nor did they disavow explicitly their earlier disavowal of taxpayer standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Boone\u2019s Estates replied to Protestants\u2019 opposition and, after addressing what it called Ms. Harrison\u2019s argument \u201cthat <em>Bryniarski </em>does not require a plaintiff in zoning cases at equity to make definite allegations of special damage,\u201d Boone\u2019s Estates turned to what it called Ms. Harrison\u2019s \u201calternattej\u201d argument that she had alleged sufficiently nonetheless \u201cspecial damage.\u201d Boone\u2019s Estates argued that the potential increase in property taxes was neither \u201cdefinite\u201d nor \u201cspecial,\u201d as the same effects would be felt by all owners of property located in the area of parcels rezoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Finally, the Protestants also opposed a motion to dismiss filed by Defendant 1625 Limited. In this opposition, the Protestants maintained again that they enjoyed standing as \u201cadjoining property owners,\u201d relying indiscriminately on cases discussing both property owner standing and taxpayer standing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Following a hearing, the Circuit Court issued on 11 October 2012 an Opinion and Order dismissing the Second Amended Complaint. The trial judge noted again, in a section entitled \u201cDisputed Legal Issues,\u201d that \u201cDefendants claim that Plaintiffs lack both taxpayer and common-law standing. The Plaintiffs argue[ ] in response that their Complaint alleges harm to several individual plaintiffs sufficient to give them standing to bring this action.\u201d After discussing <em>Superblock I </em>and <em>Long Green Valley Association v. Bellevale Farms, Inc., </em>205 Md. App. 636, 46 A.3d 473, <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>432 Md. 292, 68 A.3d 843 (2013), the trial judge concluded rightly that these two cases were distinguishable from the matter at hand by virtue of the fact that the protestants in those cases were challenging a land disposition agreement and an agricultural easement, respectively, not a comprehensive zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The trial judge grouped the plaintiffs by virtue of their respective allegations and addressed each group in turn to evaluate whether they enjoyed standing. Regarding Ms. Harrison, the trial judge noted, in a footnote, that \u201can increase in property value by definition is not \u2018harm\u2019 and that a tax increase for more valuable property does not constitute a viable zoning complaint.\u201d The Circuit Court went on to conclude that Ms. Harrison\u2019s allegations were too generalized to satisfy the requirement of \u201cspecial harm.\u201d The trial judge concluded that all, save two, of the Protestants lacked standing to challenge Bill 44-11. As to the two, he concluded that Richard M. Paukstitus and Elizabeth Novotny (hereinafter the \u201cWildlife Complainants\u201d) enjoyed property owner standing because of their allegation that the rezoning of a nearby parcel \u201cwill result in a loss of or a deterioration of the wildlife habitat and will destroy or drive off the currently abundant wildlife there.\u201d This assertion was deemed sufficient to \u201csatisf[y] the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>standard of special harm distinct from the general public as required in <em>Habliston </em>and <em>Bryniarski\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Regarding whether the Protestants (including Ms. Harrison and the Wildlife Complainants) failed to state a claim, the Circuit Court, relying on the Preamble to Chapter 181 of the Acts of 2009 (House Bill 297),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> concluded that the rezoning actions that Protestants challenged were \u201cnot \u2018rare\u2019 in the context of the huge number of properties contained in southern Anne Arundel County and otherwise impacted by the comprehensive rezoning process.\u201d The trial judge rejected further Protestants\u2019 argument, citing <em>(Cassel, </em>195 Md. at 354, 73 A.2d at 488, that \u201c[t]he test of invalidity of a zoning ordinance [in a piece rezoning context] is whether it is arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory, and has no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.\u201d Relying on <em>County Council of Prince George\u2019s County v. Offen, </em>334 Md. 499, 639 A.2d 1070 (1994) (challenging a comprehensive zoning action), the Circuit Court determined the appropriate standard to apply was whether Protestants alleged the County was acting \u201cwithin its legal boundaries.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>The court concluded that it \u201cmust find that the County Council acted \u2018within its legal boundaries\u2019 [because] it is required by statute to enact a GDP and comprehensive zoning.\u201d Accordingly, the Circuit Court concluded that all Protestants failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted and dismissed the Second Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The Protestants appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, where they argued again that they enjoyed property owner standing by virtue of their proximity to various rezoned parcels. The Protestants noted first, without apparent exception, that \u201c[i]n each case, the Second Amended Complaint also alleges that [the Protestants] believe that the challenged rezoning will substantially reduce the value of their property and their enjoyment of it....\u201d Although noting Ms. Harrison\u2019s allegations of increased property taxes later in their brief, at no point did the Protestants discuss or advance anything that could be construed as an argument or authorities justifying taxpayer standing. The County, in its responsive brief, reiterated its arguments that the Protestants failed to satisfy <em>Bryniarski\u2019s </em>standing requirements, and similarly did not discuss taxpayer standing further.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, relying on its opinion in <em>Bell v. Anne Arundel County, Md., </em>215 Md.App. 161, 79 A.3d 976 (2013)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>, concluded that the doctrine of property owner standing applies to declaratory judgment actions challenging comprehensive zoning legislation. Applying those standards to the present case, the intermediate appellate court concluded that \u201cthe circuit court erred in concluding that [Protestants] lacked standing with respect to their challenges of Amendments 9, 22, 26, 37, and 46 and the portion of Bill 44-11 rezoning 1625 Generals Highway.\u201d As for Amendment 43, the appellate court concluded that two of the Protestants lived close enough to the rezoned property to be almost <em>prima facie </em>aggrieved. <em>See Ray v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>430 Md. 74, 91, 59 A.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>545, 555 (2013). The panel of the court did not determine whether the Protestants alleged sufficiently \u201cplus factors\u201d supporting special damage, and instead remanded the case to permit the Protestants to amend their Complaint in light of the court\u2019s discussion of \u201cplus factors\u201d in <em>Bell. </em>The panel did not discuss taxpayer standing, save for a vague and brief comment discussing the holding in <em>Superblock I.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">The intermediate appellate court concluded also that the trial judge erred when he applied the \u201clegal boundaries test\u201d because he should have reviewed the spot zoning allegations for \u201carbitrary, unreasonable, and discriminatory action.\u201d After observing that one purpose of Chapter 674 of the Acts of 2013<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> was to \u201cclarify! ] a certain requirement of consistency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>with the plan for certain zoning laws and other local law,\u201d the court also concluded that \u201c[bjecause the circuit court did not have the opportunity to consider this legislative change and because [it was] already remanding the case, [the court would] remand on the plan consistency question, too.\u201d Accordingly, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court and remanded the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">The County and several Defendants (collectively, the \u201cPetitioners\u201d) petitioned us for a writ of certiorari, which we granted on 18 June 2014, to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">1. .Whether the <em>prima facie </em>presumption of aggrievement for nearby property owners established by <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery County Board of Appeals, </em>247 Md. 137, 230 A.2d 289 (1967) should be extended to cases in which a private citizen challenges the validity of legislatively enacted comprehensive zoning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">2. Whether the considerations established as relevant to special aggrievement in <em>Ray v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>430 Md. 74, 59 A.3d 545 (2013) apply equally to cases in which a private citizen challenges the validity of legislatively enacted comprehensive zoning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">3. Whether Maryland law required Bill 44-11 to be consistent with the County GDP? [<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-8\"><em>Anne Arundel County v. Harwood Civic Association, </em>438 Md. 739, 93 A.3d 288 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Of all the Petitioners, the County and Boone\u2019s Estates filed discrete and separate briefs.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The County advanced initially several arguments for why the Protestants did not enjoy property owner standing. The County proceeded then to discuss the Protestants\u2019 \u201calternative\u201d argument that they were specially harmed \u201cin a way different and distinct from the public at large.\u201d Boone\u2019s Estates\u2019 arguments echoed largely those of the County, with one notable exception<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>: Boone\u2019s Estates reiterated the arguments made to the Circuit Court regarding Ms. Harrison\u2019s allegations. It also referenced in a footnote the Protestants\u2019 (pre-Second Amended Complaint) May 2018 Memorandum (wherein the Protestants disclaimed taxpayer standing), concluding with the following statement: \u201cBoone\u2019s Estates here notes that [Ms. Harrison\u2019s] allegations are insufficient to give rise to taxpayer standing.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">The Protestants, in their responsive brief, argued that they enjoyed property owner standing, but did not argue that they enjoyed taxpayer standing, although they did refer tangentially to the latter doctrine several times in general discourse. Ironically, the Protestants discussed the public policy underpinnings of taxpayer standing and the necessity for standing doctrines that enable citizens to protect themselves from \u201clegislative overreach\u201d and the <em>\u201cultra vires </em>act of a legislature.\u201d The Protestants concluded their discussion of the policies behind taxpayer standing with a quotation from the taxpayer standing section of <em>Superblock I, see Superblock I, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>407 Md. at 266, 964 A.2d at 669, which they contextualized by saying: \u201cThe passage relates to the difficulties of pleading special aggrievement in a taxpayer standing case, but the difficulties faced by nearby landowners in a zoning case are no different.\u201d Later, they suggested that their Second Amended Complaint \u201calleges specific reasons why the value of their property and their enjoyment of [it] will suffer from the <em>ultra vires </em>act of the County Council.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">So ends our excruciatingly exact recital of the procedural history of this case, which we set out at length as prelude to determining whether Respondents preserved their ability to assert that they satisfied the requirements of taxpayer standing to maintain their suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">II. Taxpayer Standing: How the Respondents\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Suit Fares Here</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">As we discussed in <em>Bell, </em>in order to establish eligibility to maintain a suit under the taxpayer standing doctrine, a plaintiff must allege \u201c(1) that the complainant is a taxpayer; and (2) that the suit is brought, either expressly or implicitly, on behalf of all other taxpayers.\u201d <em>State Center, LLC v.
