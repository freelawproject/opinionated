Our sole issue, thus, is whether the judge\u2019s error could be considered harmless when a juror who was questioned at the bench, without Yancey\u2019s presence, was selected to serve. We shall hold that the judge\u2019s error was not harmless.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Eric Yancey was charged with robbery with a dangerous weapon, conspiracy to commit robbery and first degree assault.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the beginning of trial in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, at approximately 11:00 a.m., after a discussion regarding the trial motions and other matters, Yancey\u2019s counsel asked if Yancey could approach the bench during voir dire conferences with prospective jurors, about which the judge deferred to the policy of the Sheriffs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-9\">[COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: Your Honor, also, during voir dire, may my client approach during the bench conferences without the sheriffs standing right there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-10\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t know about without the sheriffs. What\u2019s the protocol on that, sheriffs? I\u2019ll go with whatever they normally do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>THE SHERIFF: We\u2019ll have to make some phone calls first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-C\">THE COURT: All right. Whatever\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-4\">THE SHERIFF: Right now, he has leg irons on, so we don\u2019t want him up there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">THE SHERIFF: With leg irons and a jury there. So\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAb\">THE COURT: Yeah. So I think counsel what you \u2014 whatever they \u2014 whatever the primary policy is, I\u2019ll go with that. So if they want to keep the leg irons on him, and you don\u2019t object to the jury seeing that, fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">[COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: I do object to the jury seeing that. And I would note that in some prior cases, it is essentially been left up to the sheriffs discretion. I\u2019ve had plenty of cases where the sheriffs have said, \u201che has not given us any kind of problem. We have no problem with him being unescorted up to the bench[\u201d]\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">THE COURT: That\u2019s fine. We have \u2014 well, I had some great sheriffs in my old days in Prince George\u2019s County, but our staff here is outstanding. And their protocol is well thought out, and I\u2019m not going to make an exception. But I\u2019ll certainly go along with whatever the protocol is, and they\u2019re going to make some calls. We\u2019ll let you know\u2014 [COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">THE COURT: \u2014what\u2019s going on with that because I find if we change it around, it causes problems. All right. We\u2019ll take a short recess. Take a short recess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">After a recess, the issue was resurrected. Yancey\u2019s counsel requested clarification from the judge as to whether Yancey would be allowed to attend bench conferences, to which the Sheriff responded negatively; the judge appeared to accede to the Sheriffs response by suggesting to Yancey\u2019s counsel that \u201cyou can just go back and talk to him then if you want about anything up there\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-11\">[COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: Well wait, but we\u2019re bringing the jury in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-12\">THE SHERIFF: He can stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>[COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: No, no, no, but if he\u2019s going to come up to the bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">THE SHERIFF: He\u2019s not going to come up. So if he has some\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">[COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: Can we delay the jury coming in until we find the answer to this then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: What\u2019s the answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">THE COURT: Rose, hang on a second. Counsel, what\u2019s the problem?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-9\">[COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: I understand the sheriffs department\u2019s still trying to determine whether they\u2019re going to allow him to come up to the bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-10\">THE COURT: But for the voir dire process, you can just go back and talk to him then if you want about anything up there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">Yancey\u2019s counsel, though, suggested to the judge that not permitting Yancey to approach would send a signal to the jury that would disadvantage him, which the judge dismissed and suggested that the attorney could \u201ctake it to Annapolis\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ain\">[COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: I can, but I feel it\u2019s a\u2014 creates a very different moral atmosphere when he\u2019s allowed to come up to the bench, and the jurors can see him do that as opposed to when he\u2019s forced to remain at counsel table where they probably do understand what\u2019s going on about him being leg-ironed, or dangerous, or somehow a less trustworthy person when he\u2019s not allowed up to the bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgR\">THE SHERIFF: Your Honor, I have a lieutenant coming up in two minutes. So I\u2019ll have an answer for you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALbj\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-12\">THE SHERIFF: \u2014it\u2019s just a matter of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-13\">THE COURT: We\u2019re not going to tell the jury he\u2019s not allowed up here. The jurors aren\u2019t going to know whether he normally would come up or not. Most attorneys in civil cases, the clients don\u2019t come up, so it\u2019s not that it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not going to be a glaring issue for the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-14\">[COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: Well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>THE COURT: I agree it would be if they see him in leg irons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-4\">[COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: From my experience from speaking with jurors after a trial, some of them said that they were shocked that the defendant was allowed to come up to the bench. And it did make them think of the person as being less dangerous when they were simply being allowed to do that. They said that if this person was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abq\">THE COURT: Well that\u2019s anecdotal, counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">[COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: I understand, but I\u2019m relying on some of that anecdotal evidence for the reason that I do on much of the reasons people make any selections in jury selections. It\u2019s not so scientific.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">THE COURT: All right. So if the sheriffs position is he can come up in leg irons or not all, then you can put it on the record. And you can take it to Annapolis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">[COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The judge continued to foreclose Yancey from approaching the bench, saying that, \u201cYour client\u2019s not prejudiced in any way. I don\u2019t \u2014 what I\u2019m saying is, he can\u2019t just come up to my \u2014 up to my desk whenever he wants even if he wasn\u2019t incarcerated. So he\u2019s not losing out on anything.\u201d The judge suggested that when voir dire began, the Sheriff would have the answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-9\">THE COURT: We\u2019re going to need the jurors whether counsel wants them or not. Let\u2019s bring them in. I can give some preliminary things. Whether over your objection, I\u2019m going to start. Please bring them in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-10\">[COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: The defense does object. THE COURT: I don\u2019t bring your client up to the bench while I\u2019m \u2014 counsel, I don\u2019t bring your client up to the bench while I\u2019m addressing the jurors in the beginning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHQR\">[COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: Understood, but I understand that that\u2019s going to prevent him from\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-11\">THE COURT: Even if some other jurors want that, I\u2019m not going to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>[COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: I understand. I understand also, however, that that\u2019s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t let the defendant wander the courtroom during the voir dire, either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">[COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: Right. But he is absolutely going to be foreclosed from coming up at all now, then, isn\u2019t that correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">THE COURT: Have a seat. You\u2019re not allowed to approach the bench, either, while I\u2019m addressing the jury. He\u2019s not going to have any less restrictions than if he were here not incarcerated until you get the word from the lieutenant. Okay? So if you don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m saying, that\u2019s fine. Just tag him. We\u2019ll see. I have to get the roll call. I have to do a lot of other things with that jury that I can start now. And it\u2019s two minutes to noon, and the jurors have been here since 8:30. Your client\u2019s not prejudiced in any way. I don\u2019t \u2014 what I\u2019m saying is, he can\u2019t just come up to my \u2014 up to my desk whenever he wants even if he wasn\u2019t incarcerated. So he\u2019s not losing out on anything. Once we get to a point where everybody\u2019s approaching the bench, and you want him to come back and forth, we\u2019ll have an answer from the sheriffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">[COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: Understood, but they\u2019d have to go under the desk then and remove his leg irons while the jury is present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">After the venire arrived, the judge stated to the prospective jurors that, \u201cMost of the questions can be answered right there where you stand. However, if a question is of a very sensitive nature or one that you would rather approach the bench on, you can do that at a certain time.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Midway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>through voir dire, the judge called only the attorneys to the bench; Yancey\u2019s counsel again advocated for Yancey\u2019s presence during any voir dire at the bench, to which the judge again demurred, saying if the Sheriff could not take the leg irons off, then \u201cthere\u2019s nothing we can do\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-4\">THE COURT: * * * Can we \u2014 I had a legal issue that I didn\u2019t get to finish. Do we \u2014 do we need to discuss that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANnc\">[COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">THE COURT: That\u2019ll take us a couple of minutes on that. Let me see what other questions we have before we. Just for this \u2014 just to \u2014 just for time purposes, can I just see the attorneys briefly, just the attorneys briefly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">BEGIN BENCH CONFERENCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj1\">THE COURT: What\u2019s our status on the issue with the leg irons?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">[COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">THE COURT: Do we know yet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I don\u2019t know what the issue is. THE COURT: Oh we don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-10\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: We can ask.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-11\">THE COURT: Why don\u2019t we ask the \u2014 Deputy, on an unrelated matter, can we ask you a question on something? Maybe they\u2019ll know. If not, we can always break for lunch. Do we have an answer on the?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-12\">THE SHERIFF: Still didn\u2019t get clearance. However, we would have to \u2014 lawyer. Still can\u2019t \u2014 attorney\u2014[unintelligible].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-13\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-14\">THE SHERIFF: [unintelligible].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-15\">THE COURT: All right. Let us know. Just give them a note, or let them know. All right. We do have a disadvantage with the construction on this building right now. We don\u2019t have the ability for the sheriffs to take him to where they need to through the regular thing, so what I\u2019m going to do is. I\u2019d like to proceed with selecting jurors. We\u2019re going to get one of two answers. We\u2019ll get an answer they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>won\u2019t take the leg irons off. In that situation, there\u2019s nothing we can do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-4\">[COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: I understand. However not having that answer, the defense would be objecting. We would also note that them having to come in because the elevators not working would not change what they\u2019d have to do at the end of each proceeding. They\u2019d have to take him out anyway. And the sheriffs\u2019 arguments essentially about why he didn\u2019t necessarily want to have to take the cuffs off him, his feelings about whether they should adjust the defendant or not I don\u2019t think are relevant. He\u2019s not a party to the case in that sense. As we mentioned, we do believe he\u2019s prejudiced by not being able to exert a moral influence by being present at the bench conferences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">THE COURT: There was one lady that mentioned that she wanted to eat pretty soon. One possibility to do this is I\u2019ll ask a few more questions. We haven\u2019t had anybody needs to approach the bench yet which is good. We could take a recess and then come back and finish at 1:30 with this jury. And then in the meantime, we\u2019ll get the answer and then go from there. So maybe that\u2019s the better way to go. So I\u2019ll try and ask a few more questions without listening to any\u2014 without any bench responses, and then go from there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Apparently, before 1:00 p.m., a bench conference with a prospective juror occurred, during which Yancey was not present. Shortly thereafter, the judge restated, \u201cI\u2019ve seen absolutely no prejudice to your client for not listening to the bench conference of the one juror\u201d and again asserted that Yancey\u2019s counsel can \u201cgo back and fill [Yancey] in without making it obvious before we make any decision on that witness if you want to\u201d:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">THE COURT: * * * I tell you what. We only have \u2014 it looks like we\u2019re only going to have maybe one person. I\u2019m going to \u2014 because the jury\u2019s now seen that I\u2019ve just brought the attorneys up. I\u2019m going to let her come up without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>getting the word on the sheriffs. And then I\u2019ll get the selections on the jury. And then we\u2019ll break for lunch. And then hopefully we\u2019ll get the answer with respect to legal bench conferences as the trial proceeds. If you object, that\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">[COUNSEL FOR YANCEY]: The defense does have an objection, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">THE COURT: But it\u2019s five after 1:00, and I\u2019ve seen absolutely no prejudice to your client for not listening to the bench conference of the one juror. Or there may be a few other jurors, and I\u2019ll certainly couch it in terms of \u2014 I\u2019ll let you go back and fill him in without making it obvious before we make any decision on that witness if you want to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The judge continued voir dire in open court; eventually he called Juror 220 to the bench with \u201cjust the attorneys\u201d, without Yancey present, wherein the juror divulged that her two brothers were \u201cbrought up on\u201d drug and sexual assault charges. In response to the question, \u201cWould you be able to listen to the facts of this case and render a fair and impartial verdict?\u201d she stated \u201cYeah\u201d; Juror 220 eventually was selected to serve on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">When trial resumed after lunch, at approximately 2:30 p.m., the Sheriff announced that there was no longer a problem with Yancey approaching the bench, and the judge permitted Yancey\u2019s leg irons to be removed. Yancey was permitted to approach the bench, although voir dire had ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Yancey appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Our intermediate appellate court, in an unreported opinion, reversed Yancey\u2019s conviction and concluded that his exclusion from bench conferences during voir dire was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In reaching its conclusion, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>court began by noting that under Maryland Rule 4-281,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201ca defendant has the right to be physically present during all critical stages of trial, including at voir dire proceedings\u201d, which \u201c \u2018includes the substantial right of the prisoner to be brought <em>face to face </em>with the jurors at the time when the challenges are made,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Bedford v. State, </em>317 Md. 659, 672, 566 A.2d 111, 117 (1989) (emphasis added by Bedford), as well as the right to \u201c \u2018be afforded every opportunity to \u2018size up\u2019 the jury and to fully examine each juror so as to assist counsel in determining which jurors should be disqualified for cause or even for no cause at all\u2019 \u201d, quoting <em>id. </em>at 673, 566 A.2d at 117. The court concluded that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because it could not \u201crule out the possibility that, had Yancey been permitted to participate in voir dire at the bench, he might have made some material contribution to his attorney\u2019s efforts\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>The State concedes error before us, however.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The issue, then, is squarely before us to determine whether the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>unwillingness to overrule the Sheriffs Office or to pause voir dire until the Sheriff responded to his inquiry about the leg irons before allowing Yancey to approach the bench during voir dire conference constituted harmless error. Heretofore, in <em>Noble v. State, </em>293 Md. 549, 569-70, 446 A.2d 844, 854 (1982), we addressed whether the failure to afford the defendant the right to be present at the bench during voir dire questioning, after which the juror was not seated, was harmless error. We determined from the record that, beyond any reasonable doubt, \u201cNoble was not harmed by his absence from the voir dire questioning of a prospective juror\u201d because, \u201cwhen the prejudice or possible prejudice of a juror or prospective juror is against the defendant, and that juror is excused at a proceeding from which the defendant is absent, the defendant would not ordinarily be harmed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571, 573, 446 A.2d at 855, 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">In <em>Noble </em>we took the opportunity, in dicta, however, to reflect about a situation analogous to the present one: \u201cWhen a defendant is absent from a stage of the trial involving the possible disqualification of jurors or prospective jurors for bias, and one or more of them are ultimately retained, it would normally be difficult to conclude that the violation of the defendant\u2019s right to be present was harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571, 446 A.2d at 855. We noted that the standard for determining whether the error was harmless or not included that, \u201cPrejudice will not be conclusively presumed. If the record demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the denial of the right could not have prejudiced the defendant, the error will not result in a reversal of his conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 568-69, 446 A.2d at 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">In applying our standard of review to determine harmlessness or not, we are mindful of the State\u2019s arguments, but are not convinced by them. The State initially argues, citing <em>State v. Nevels, </em>192 Neb. 668, 223 N.W.2d 668 (1974), and <em>People v. Carroll, </em>49 Mich.App. 44, 211 N.W.2d 233 (1973), that it is counsel\u2019s presence at bench conferences during voir dire, not the defendant\u2019s presence, that is crucial when a defendant is excluded; if this norm were true, then error in the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>situation would be the issue. It is not.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Nevels </em>and <em>Carroll </em>are also not relevant as they address error when a defendant was excluded from in-chambers discussions about juror impartiality, rather than exclusion from voir dire bench conferences. <em>Nevels, </em>223 N.W.2d at 669; <em>Carroll, </em>211 N.W.2d at 234-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">The State then seemingly argues, in a harmless error situation, that the burden is on the defendant to prove harmlessness, citing <em>United States v. Alessandrello, </em>637 F.2d 131 (3d Cir.1980), and <em>Commonwealth v. Owens, </em>414 Mass. 595, 609 N.E.2d 1208 (1993). We have steadfastly maintained, however, that the State has the burden to prove harmlessness. <em>Perez v. State, </em>420 Md. 57, 21 A.3d 1048 (2011) (burden on State to prove harmlessness when defendant was not present and was unaware of judge\u2019s response to multiple jury notes); <em>Denicolis v. State, </em>378 Md. 646, 837 A.2d 944 (2003) (burden on State to prove harmlessness when defendant was not present when trial judge responded to a jury note); <em>Taylor v. State, </em>352 Md. 338, 722 A.2d 65 (1998) (burden on the State to prove harmlessness when trial judge responded to a list of jury questions outside defendant\u2019s presence); <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 658-59, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976) (in a harmless error situation, we have stated \u201cthat the beneficiary of error [is] required to demonstrate, beyond a reasonable doubt, that such error did not contribute to the conviction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The State further argues that Yancey\u2019s exclusion from the bench conference during voir dire questioning of Juror 220 was for just a brief period of time and, therefore, harmless, citing <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>829 F.2d 119, 129 (D.C.Cir. 1987), for the proposition that a defendant\u2019s exclusion from the <em>entirety </em>of bench conferences during voir dire questioning is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>that which constitutes error that is other than harmless. <em>Gordon, </em>then, would seemingly support that the error in the present case cannot be harmless, because Yancey was excluded from the <em>entirety </em>of all of the bench conferences regarding voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Were somehow the time period that Juror 220 was questioned at the bench excised for analysis, Yancey\u2019s absence for even that brief period has not been proven by the State to be harmless. During the brief period of time at the bench, Juror 220 responded to a pivotal question regarding potential bias in which she offered at the bench that, \u201cOne of my brothers was brought up on drug charges and the other one for sexual assault.\u201d The discussion with Juror 220 about potential bias was the type of colloquy that underlies the bases for a defendant\u2019s presence at voir dire bench conferences. Such dialogue, \u201cintended to search out a prospective juror\u2019s bias, hostility or predisposition to believe or discredit the testimony of potential witnesses\u201d supports that a defendant \u201chave the opportunity to assess the juror\u2019s facial expressions, demeanor and other subliminal responses.\u201d <em>People v. Antommarchi, </em>80 N.Y.2d 247, 590 N.Y.S.2d 33, 604 N.E.2d 95, 97 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The State also proposes that excluding a defendant from voir dire conferences can be rendered harmless, when there was proof that counsel did confer with the defendant, citing <em>United States v. Cuchet, </em>197 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.1999), <em>United States v. Washington, </em>705 F.2d 489 (D.C.Cir.1983), and <em>United States v. Dioguardi, </em>428 F.2d 1033 (2d Cir.1970). Initially, we would note, as the Court of Special Appeals did, that in <em>Bedford, </em>317 Md. at 673-74, 566 A.2d at 118, we side-stepped the issue of whether side bars between a defendant and counsel would cure any error when the defendant was excluded from voir dire bench conferences. Even assuming for the sake of argument, however, that such conferences between a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>defendant and counsel could render the defendant\u2019s exclusion harmless, the State in the instant case has not proven that any dialogue actually occurred; in <em>Cuchet </em>and in <em>Washington, </em>the record reflected that the defendant had time to confer with counsel about jurors\u2019 responses to voir dire questions at the bench from which the defendant was excluded. <em>Cuchet, </em>197 F.3d at 1321; <em>Washington, </em>705 F.2d at 498.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The State\u2019s \u201cproof\u2019 is largely speculative that Yancey was not prejudiced by his exclusion from the voir dire bench conferences. The State theorizes that Juror 220 must have been \u201cfair and impartial\u201d because, upon questioning, she reassured the trial court to that effect;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> muses that, \u201cthere is no indication in the record that Juror 220 made any look or gesture that was noticed by the judge or either attorney\u201d, so that \u201cnothing in what Juror 220 said or did at the bench revealed a \u2018sudden impression\u2019 or \u2018unaccountable prejudice\u2019 from which Yancey would want to exclude her from the jury\u201d; and speculates further that Yancey could adequately observe the demeanor of Juror 220 in open court, somehow implicating personal presence at the bench. Finally, the State prematurely speculates that Juror 220 was more likely than not to be sympathetic to Yancey because her brothers had been \u201cbrought up\u201d on drug and sexual assault charges. Certainly, these tidbits of speculation do not proof of harmlessness make.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The bottom line in the present case is that Yancey requested to be at the bench during voir dire bench conferences. The trial judge deferred his decision-making entirely to the Sheriffs with respect to how to protect Yancey\u2019s rights as well as any public safety concerns; only at the end of voir dire did he allow Yancey to participate in bench conferences. The judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>repeatedly dismissed Yancey\u2019s counsel\u2019s arguments about his client\u2019s disadvantage when excluded and, instead, opined that, based on his observations, Yancey was not prejudiced, without providing any bases. The judge\u2019s errors were not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

The judge also asked whether any prospective juror or a family member had ever been charged with a crime, to which Juror 220 asked to approach the bench.

The unreported opinion of the Court of Special Appeals very ably recites the rationale underpinning Rule 4-231 and the right to be present at voir dire proceedings at the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>A criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at every stage of trial is a common-law right preserved by Article 5 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and protected, in some measure, by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. <em>Bunch v.

State, </em>317 Md. 659, 670 [566 A.2d 111] (1989). The right to be present encompasses a right to participate in bench conferences, including conferences concerning the impaneling of a jury and the possible disqualification of jurors. <em>Bunch, </em>281 Md. at 686-88 [381 A.2d 1142]; <em>see also Bedford, </em>317 Md. at 672-75 [566 A.2d 111]; <em>Haley v.

Utah, </em>110 U.S. 574, 578 [4 S.Ct. 202, 28 L.Ed. 262 (1884)]). Similarly, in <em>Bedford, </em>the Court of Appeals stressed that the right to presence \"includes the 'substantial right[] of the prisoner to be brought <em>face to face </em>with the jurors at the time when the challenges [are] made,\u2019 \u201d <em>Bedford, </em>317 Md. at 672 [566 A.2d 111] (quoting <em>Lewis v.

Likewise, in <em>Bedford, </em>317 Md. at 668-75 [566 A.2d 111], the Court disapproved of a procedure in which the circuit court, for security reasons, required a defendant in a capital-murder case to be seated about six feet from his counsel and to be flanked by deputy sheriffs during voir dire. Indeed, the Court expressed its disapproval in <em>Bedford </em>even though defense counsel had the ability to step away from the bench and to consult with the defendant during voir dire. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b658-8\">. During oral argument, the State, in response to a question from the Bench, noted that Yancey\u2019s counsel did not exercise all of his peremptory challenges. The use of peremptory challenges by counsel, though, is not a factor that we have considered when examining whether a defendant\u2019s inability to exercise the right to be at the bench during voir dire conferences is harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b660-6\">. The State, additionally, cites <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>724 F.3d 632 (5th Cir.2013), <em>United States v. Bascaro, </em>742 F.2d 1335 (11th Cir.1984), and <em>United States v. Chrisco, </em>493 F.2d 232 (8th Cir.1974), for the proposition that it is not error when the defendant is present for the substantial majority of the jury selection process. All three cases are inapposite, because the issue was whether the trial court erred in excluding the defendant during impanelment of the jury; voir dire was not in play.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b661-7\">.

The State\u2019s Petition for Certiorari also noted that Juror 220 observed Yancey in leg irons in the hallway of the courthouse at the end of the first day of trial and that, when examined by the court, she stated that she could be fair and impartial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b663-7\">McDONALD, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AcH\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">I join in the judgment, but not in the Court\u2019s opinion. The basis for reversing the conviction in this case boils down to Mr. Yancey\u2019s absence from a bench conference with one juror during voir dire of the jury panel. The rationale is that a defendant is entitled to advise his attorney whether he wishes to have a potential juror struck from the jury, whether for cause or not, and it is therefore important for the defendant to have an \u201cadequate opportunity to gain a good perception of the potential juror[ ].\u201d <em>Bedford v. State, </em>317 Md. 659, 673-74, 566 A.2d 111 (1989).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court holds that the error was not harmless because Mr. Yancey was not immediately present when Juror 220, who had previously responded to a question in open court, briefly responded to three questions in a colloquy at the bench with counsel and was ultimately seated on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>I would be willing to find harmless error if the record were clear that Mr. Yancey, who presumably had already observed Juror 220 in open court, had an opportunity to consult with defense counsel following the bench conference with her \u2014 Mr. Yancey had unused peremptory challenges available at the end of the voir dire process and could have struck Juror 220 if he had any concern about her based on his absence from the bench conference and had an opportunity to communicate that concern to his counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-9\">. Defense counsel stated a different rationale for his objection in the trial court. His objection was based on the perception that members of the jury panel would have of Mr. Yancey if he were permitted to come to the bench (\"... creates a very different moral atmosphere when he's allowed to come up to the bench ... it d[oes] make them think of the person as being less dangerous ...'') rather than on Mr. Yancey\u2019s perception of members of the jury panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">It is also notable that this Court\u2019s disapproval of the jury selection process in <em>Bedford </em>was based in large part on the fact that the procedure in that case hampered the ability of the defendant to communicate confidentially with his counsel about potential jurors. In any event, although disapproving the procedure used in that case in dicta, the Court explicitly did not conclude that it was reversible error. 317 Md. at 675, 566 A.2d 111.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
