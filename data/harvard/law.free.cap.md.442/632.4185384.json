State, Harris v. State </em>and <em>Monge-Martinez v. State, </em>consolidated for the purposes of this opinion. All three cases involve the same legal issues, those being the elucidation and implementation of our opinion in <em>Griffin v.

We shall hold in <em>Harris </em>that the trial court did not err in admitting the \u201cdirect messages\u201d and \u201ctweets\u201d in evidence.

State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Albert Sublet, the first Petitioner herein, was charged by indictment in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County with three counts of first degree assault, second degree assault and reckless endangerment, as well as with one count of carrying a deadly weapon with intent to injure. The charges against Sublet arose out of a fight that occurred among Sublet, Chrishell Parker, her mother and her sister, in late October of 2012. According to the State\u2019s theory of the case, Sublet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>became aggressive when he arrived at Ms. Parker\u2019s apartment to pick up his girlfriend, Ymani Conner, and initiated an altercation; Sublet urged, conversely, that it was Ms. Parker who was the instigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">During cross-examination of Ms. Parker, Sublet\u2019s counsel sought to introduce into evidence four pages alleged to have been a printout from Ms. Parker\u2019s Facebook page of a \u201cconversation\u201d among seven different individuals. The document submitted to Ms. Parker for review consisted of four pages and written across the top of each page was \u201cprinted on 1O30-12 from Facebook\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Each of the nineteen entries in the four pages contained the name of the profile that had allegedly created it, as well as the time the entry was created. Next to the name of the profile was also a picture. The four pages were collectively received for identification as Defense Exhibit A<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">With respect to the conversation in issue, the first page began on \u201cSaturday\u201d with a statement associated with the profile \u201cChaniea DatBytch Brown\u201d, which Ms. Parker identified as Ms. Brown\u2019s Facebook username, while the fourth post on the first page was related to the name \u201cCece Parker\u201d. When asked if she had discussed the altercation on Facebook, Ms. Parker stated that she had connected with Chaniea Brown through Facebook and that she herself used the name Cece Parker:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">[ATTORNEY FOR SUBLET]: Well, have you discussed [the fight] in social media?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">[MS.

When Sublet\u2019s counsel then inquired as to whether Ms. Parker disliked Ms. Conner, Ms. Parker asserted that she did not know Ms. Conner prior to the night of the incident and, furthermore, urged that she did not have \u201cany personal animosity against Ms. Conner\u201d. As defense counsel began to ask about the content of the entry attributed to Ms. Parker on the fourth page that read, \u201cher bf is a dead man walkn\u201d, the trial judge intervened to address the issue of authentication of the Exhibit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-10\">[ATTORNEY FOR SUBLET]: What about this statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap5\">[MS. PARKER]: That\u2019s not to her. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about. It\u2019s two different things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-11\">[ATTORNEY FOR SUBLET]: So when you said \u2014 these are your words, you said, her boyfriend is a dead man walking\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-12\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-13\">THE COURT: One moment. Just a moment. Let me ask counsel to approach the bench. And ask the jury to disregard the statement from counsel at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-14\">Outside the presence of the jury, the trial judge stated that, \u201cit [was] not clear to [him]\u201d that \u201c[Ms. Parker] agrees that everything is something that she wrote.\u201d The judge then permitted Sublet\u2019s attorney to continue questioning Ms. Parker \u201cto see if there are any things that say [\u2018Cece\u2019] that she does not agree that she wrote\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>During further questioning by Sublet\u2019s counsel, Ms. Parker affirmed that it was her picture next to the entries allegedly authored by \u201cCece Parker\u201d. Sublet\u2019s attorney then directed Ms. Parker to \u201cLook at all of the pages\u201d, \u201cIf you find one that you didn\u2019t write, please let us know\u201d, to which Ms. Parker asserted she did not write the entries on the last page, and she did not understand where they came from.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Upon further exploration by Sublet\u2019s counsel regarding the genesis of page four, Ms. Parker explained that she \u201c[gave] her logout name and password to other people\u201d, such as \u201c[t]he girl Shanika [sic]\u201d and, ostensibly, to others, who would \u201chack your page and [write] stuff on there\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">[ATTORNEY FOR SUBLET]: Do you have a Facebook page?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">[MS. PARKER]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-8\">[ATTORNEY FOR SUBLET]: Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-9\">[MS. PARKER]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-10\">[ATTORNEY FOR SUBLET]: And it is in the name of CiCi [sic] Parker, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-11\">[MS. PARKER]: Yeah, but I give my logout name and password to other people too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-12\">[ATTORNEY FOR SUBLET]: Who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-13\">[MS. PARKER]: The girl Shanika [sic] I gave it to her. So, that\u2019s why I\u2019m like, I didn\u2019t understand the last page. So, it might have been her on my page.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-14\">THE COURT: I am sorry, who did you say you gave it to? [MS. PARKER]: Shanika. [sic]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-15\">[ATTORNEY FOR SUBLET]: But you are conversing with Shanika [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-16\">[MS. PARKER]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-17\">[ATTORNEY FOR SUBLET]: So, Shanika [sic] is conversing with herself on Facebook?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-18\">[MS. PARKER]: No. That\u2019s what they do on there. Like they will hack your page and be writing stuff on there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-19\">The trial judge, thereafter, sustained the State\u2019s objection to admission of all four pages of Exhibit A, based upon three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>findings: that Ms. Parker\u2019s password was not a secret, that other people could and had presumably accessed and changed or inserted information on Ms. Parker\u2019s Facebook page, thereby attributing it to her, and that Ms. Parker\u2019s explanation was not disputed by expert testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">THE COURT: Okay. I am inclined to sustain the objection because the witness has testified, A, that her password is not a secret. B, that other people can and have hacked her Facebook page and have changed statements on it. And, C, if I am not losing track of my bullet points, we don\u2019t have expert testimony to dispute her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">So, we have only one layperson\u2019s testimony, which is that she has had the experience that people have altered her Facebook page including the statements, the conversations and therefore, she, in this particular case, thinks that is altered and she didn\u2019t actually do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">So, I don\u2019t even find by a preponderance of the evidence that there is a sufficient basis for reliability to admit it. So, I will sustain the objection at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Sublet subsequently was convicted of two counts of second degree assault and sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment with all but four years suspended, as well as five years\u2019 probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the Facebook pages.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We granted Sublet\u2019s Petition for <em>Certiorari </em>to address the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-10\">1. Did the lower courts err by excluding crucial Facebook evidence on authentication grounds where the suspected author of the Facebook posts testified at trial, admitted discussing the fight on Facebook, and recognized this specif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>ic Facebook conversation, and where the posts contained numerous distinctive characteristics demonstrating authenticity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\">A. In excluding crucial Facebook evidence on authenticity grounds, did the lower courts err by applying an incorrect legal standard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">B. In assessing the Facebook evidence, did the lower courts err by not applying a correct and complete authentication analysis?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-6\"><em>Sublet v. State, </em>438 Md. 739, 93 A.3d 288 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">\n<em>Harris v. State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Following a shooting at the Rockville Metro Station on May 18, 2012, in which Jared C.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and Wasima Gary were injured, Tavares Harris, the second Petitioner herein, was charged in a nine count indictment with two counts of attempted first degree murder, two counts of attempted second degree murder, two counts of assault in the first degree, two counts of use of a handgun in the commission of a felony and one count of conspiracy to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">The day before the subject shooting, during a fight among students at Richard Montgomery High School, Keon, a friend of Harris\u2019s, was punched by James, a friend of Jared C.\u2019s. Apparently, according to trial testimony, the punch occurred because Jared C. planned to rob Keon. Harris, according to the State, then planned to shoot Jared C. in retaliation, as reflected in \u201cdirect messages\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> sent via Twitter and recovered from an iPhone<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> found in Harris\u2019s bedroom during the execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>tion of a search warrant, as well as public \u201ctweets\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> obtained from an Android phone<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> recovered from Harris\u2019s person.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">During discovery, the State notified the defense that it \u201cintend[ed] to call Montgomery County Police Detective Jesse Grimes as an expert -witness in [this] case\u201d and that he would testify with respect to, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201canalysis and interpretation of digital evidence\u201d recovered during the investigation, including the \u201cdirect messages\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">At trial, prior to Detective Grimes\u2019s testimony as an expert in the field of forensic examination of cell phones, the State informed the trial court that it would \u201cwant to move into evidence ... those contents of the twitter messages\u201d, to which Harris\u2019s counsel objected.

Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 157 (10th ed. 2014). Authentication of a matter prior to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>admission \u201cis not an[ ] artificial principal of evidence, but an <em>inherent logical necessity\u201d, </em>(7 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2129 (Chadbourn Rev. 1978)), and is integral to establishing its relevancy. <em>See </em>2 McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 221 (7th ed. 2018) (\u201cThe proponent\u2019s assertion as to why the writing is relevant determines what the proponent claims the writing is, typically that it has some specific connection to a person or organization, whether through authorship or some other relation. It is this connection that must be proved to authenticate the writing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The role of judge as \u201cgatekeeper\u201d is essential to authentication, because of jurors\u2019 tendency, \u201cwhen a corporal object is produced as proving something, to <em>assume, on sight of the object, all else that is implied in the case </em>about it\u201d, for which Wigmore provided the following example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">[I]t is easy for a jury, when witnesses speak of a horse being stolen from Doe by Roe, to understand, when Doe is proved to have lost the horse, that it still remains to be proved that Roe took it; the missing element can clearly be kept separate as an additional requirement. But if the witness to the theft were to have a horse brought into the courtroom, and to point it out triumphantly, <em>\u201cIf you </em>doubt me, there is the very horse!\u201d, this would go a great way to persuade the jury of the rest of his assertion and to ignore the weakness of his evidence of Roe\u2019s complicity. The sight of the horse, corroborating in the flesh, as it were, a part of the witness\u2019 testimony, tends to verify the remainder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az7\">Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2129.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">We adopted Maryland Rule 5-901,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> as well as the rest of the Maryland Rules of Evidence, in 1993, to codify our com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>mon law of evidence, <em>(see </em>21:1 <em>Maryland Register </em>P-1 (Jan. 7, 1994)), which was based upon Federal Rule of Evidence 901,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> (see Court of Appeals of Maryland, Rules Order, 21:1 <em>Mary</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number><em>land, Register </em>PI). \u201c[W]e take into account common law principles on the same subject matter when interpreting the rules of evidence set forth in Title 5.\u201d <em>Brooks v.

As such, the opportunities and challenges of determining authorship of social networking communications and postings are best understood in the historical context of authentication. <em>See </em>Ira P. Robbins, <em>Writings on the Wall: The Need for an Authorship-Centric Approach to the Authentication of Social-Networking Evidence, </em>13 Minn. J.L. Sci. &amp; Tech. 1, 16-17 (discussing authentication in terms of verifying authorship).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">With respect to the authentication of the authorship of writings,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> they \u201cpurport on their face to be of a certain person\u2019s authorship\u201d and, therefore, various approaches have developed \u201cfor separating the external evidence of authorship from the mere existence of the purporting document.\u201d Wig-more, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2130. The most straightforward approach to authenticating a writing is to ask an individual with personal knowledge about the document whether the matter was what it purported to be. <em>E.g. Matthews v. J.B. Colt Co., </em>145 Md. 667, 672, 125 A. 840, 841 (1924) (testimony of witness that he saw defendant sign contract was sufficient to warrant its admission). Familiarity with the purported author\u2019s signature also has been a basis for authentication, provided that such familiarity was proven prior to authentication. <em>Smith v. Walton, </em>8 Gill 77, 77 (Md.1849) (\u201cA witness who has seen a party write, or who has corresponded with him, is qualified to speak with respect to the genuineness of his signature.\u201d).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>circumstances, comparison to a known exemplar may be accomplished through expert testimony or within the confines of the jury room. <em>See, e.g., </em>Hoover <em>v. Hoover, </em>187 Md. 646, 650, 51 A.2d 166, 168 (1947) (\u201cA bank official, whose business it was to know handwriting, testified as an expert that in his opinion the writing on the disputed note, and the admitted writing of [the alleged author] on the autographed note, were the same.\u201d); <em>Haile v. Dinnis, </em>184 Md. 144, 153-54, 40 A.2d 363, 367 (1944) (jury compared records against previously admitted exemplars to determine if they were authentic). In the absence of known exemplars, authentication of a wilting also could be obtained were the contents or subject matter of the writing to \u201ccontain circumstantial evidence indicating the identity of its author\u201d, (5 Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, <em>Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence </em>\u00a7 901.04[3][a] (Joseph M. McLaughlin ed., Matthew Bender 2d ed. 2015)), by, for example, containing information known only to a chosen few. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Sutton, </em>426 F.2d 1202, 1208 n. 53 (D.C.Cir.1969). Authentication or proof of authorship of a writing also could be accomplished under the \u201creply letter doctrine\u201d, (6A Lynn McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence </em>\u2014 State <em>and Federal </em>\u00a7 901:5(c) (3d ed. 2013)), which instructed \u201cthat where a letter ha[d] been received by the due course of mail in answer to a prior letter of the receiver, -with the name of the addressee or such prior letter signed thereto, a presumption [arose] that it [wa]s the letter of the person whose name [wa]s signed thereto.\u201d <em>Am.

The admission in evidence of a screenshot of a MySpace page of the girlfriend of Griffin, who was on trial for murder, was in issue. The printout of the \u201cscreenshot\u201d had been made by the lead investigator of the case, who testified that he had printed it from his computer. Jessica Barber, the girlfriend, had been on the stand as a witness, but had not been questioned regarding her ownership of the profile. The screenshot was relevant, the State proffered, because it showed that Ms. Barber had, prior to trial, threatened a witness to the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The screenshot contained a picture \u201cof a person that look[ed] like Jessica Barber\u201d, <em>(id. </em>at 349, 19 A.3d at 419), and described a twenty-three year-old female from Port Deposit, listing her birthday as \u201c10/02/1983\u201d, as well as the statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">FREE BOOZY!!!! JUST REMEMBER SNITCHES GET STITCHES!! U KNOW WHO YOU ARE!!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 348,19 A.3d at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">We recognized in <em>Griffin </em>that authentication of social networking evidence can pose significant problems, \u201cbecause anyone can create a fictitious account and masquerade under another person\u2019s name or can gain access to another\u2019s account by obtaining the user\u2019s username and password\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 352, 19 A.3d at 421. We rejected the mere printout of the screen-shot in issue as authentic, because the lead investigator, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>had created the document, lacked any knowledge about ownership of or who created the profile.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">We suggested, however, under Rules 5 \u2014 901(b)(1) and (4), three <em>non-exclusive </em>means of authentication of ownership of such websites. The first and most obvious method for authentication, we said, \u201cwould be to ask the purported creator if she indeed created the profile and also if she added the posting in question\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 363, 19 A.3d at 427. The second approach we discussed was to \u201csearch the computer of the person who allegedly created the profile and posting and examine the computer\u2019s internet history and hard drive to determine whether that computer was used to originate the social networking profile and posting in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The third of the non-exhaustive means of authentication we suggested was to \u201cobtain information directly from the social networking website\u201d, which would link together the profile and the entry to the person, or persons, who had created them. <em>Id. </em>at 364, 19 A.3d at 428.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">In the period since <em>Griffin </em>had been decided, cases in which authentication of social networking websites and postings has been addressed have proliferated.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In the shadow of <em>Griffin, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>we today are asked to cull the various cases to discern a standard for authentication of social networking evidence. In so doing, we find succor in the standard articulated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>United States v. Vayner, </em>769 F.3d 125 (2d Cir.2014), which, on facts analogous to those in <em>Griffin, </em>reached a similar conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">In <em>Vayner, </em>Aliaksandr Zhyltsou was charged with the transfer of a false identification document. <em>Id. </em>at 127. The government\u2019s primary witness against Zhyltsou, Vladyslav Timku, testified that he \u201cwas familiar with Zhyltsou\u2019s work as a forger because he had previously paid Zhyltsou to create false\u201d documents. <em>Id. </em>According to Timku, Zhyltsou had sent him the completed forgery via e-mail from the address, \u201cfromazmadeuz@gmail.com\u201d. <em>Id. </em>However, \u201cnear the conclusion of the prosecution\u2019s case, only Timku\u2019s testimony directly connected Zhyltsou with the [e-mail] address\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 127-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The government, before resting, indicated to the district court that it planned to call an unexpected final witness, Special Agent Robert Cline of the State Department\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service. <em>Id. </em>at 128. According to the government, it would \u201cintroduce a printout of a web page that the government claimed to be Zhyltsou\u2019s profile onVK.com (\u2018VK\u2019), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>which Special Agent Cline described as \u2018the Russian equivalent of Facebook.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Zhyltsou objected to the admissibility of the printout on the grounds that it had not been properly authenticated under Federal Rule of Evidence 901. The district court overruled Zhyltsou\u2019s objection, finding that the VK page was, in fact, Zhyltsou\u2019s VK page and there was \u201c \u2018no question about the authenticity of th[e] document so far as it\u2019s coming off the Internet now.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">As summarized in the opinion of the Second Circuit, Special Agent Cline then testified with respect to the VK page:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8R\">During his testimony, Special Agent Cline identified the printout as being from \u201cthe Russian equivalent of Face-book.\u201d He noted to the jury that the page purported to be the profile of \u201cAlexander Zhiltsov\u201d (an alternate spelling of Zhyltsou\u2019s name), and that it contained a photograph of Zhyltsou. Importantly for the government\u2019s case, Special Agent Cline next pointed out that under the heading, \u201cContact Information,\u201d the profile listed \u201cAzmadeuz\u201d as \u201cZhiltsov\u2019s\u201d address on Skype (a service that Special Agent Cline described as a \u201cvoiceover IP provider\u201d). The web page also reflected that \u201cZhiltsov\u201d worked at a company called \u201cMartex International\u201d and at an Internet caf\u00e9 called \u201cCyber Heaven,\u201d which corresponded with Timku\u2019s earlier testimony that Zhyltsou and Timku had both worked for those entities. On cross-examination, Special Agent Cline admitted that he had only a \u201ccursory familiarity\u201d with VK, had never used the site except to view this single page, and did not know whether any identity verification was required in order for a user to create an account on the site.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 128-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">The Second Circuit recognized that, initially, authentication of the VK page was in issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-9\">\u201cThe requirement of authentication is ... a condition precedent to admitting evidence.\u201d <em>[United States v.] Sliker, </em>751 F.2d [477,] 497 [ (2d Cir.1984) ]; <em>see also United States v.

Rule 901 of the Federal Rules of Evidence governs the authentication of evidence and provides, in pertinent part: \u201cTo satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 901(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 129. The Second Circuit instructed that, \u201c \u2018[t]his requirement is satisfied if sufficient proof has been introduced so that a reasonable juror could find in favor of authenticity or identification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129-30, quoting <em>United States v.

Thereafter, the jury ultimately is left to make the \u201cdetermination as to whether the evidence is, in fact, what its proponent claims\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 130, citing <em>Sliker, </em>751 F.2d at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Under the standard articulated in <em>Vayner, </em>the preliminary determination of authentication must be made by the trial judge and \u201cdepends upon a context-specific determination whether the proof advanced is sufficient to support a finding that the item in question is what its proponent claims it to be\u201d, <em>(id.), </em>based upon \u201csufficient proof ... so that a reasonable juror could find in favor of authenticity or identification\u201d, <em>(id. </em>quoting <em>Pluto, </em>176 F.3d at 49):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">Rule 901 \u201cdoes not definitively establish the nature or quantum of proof that is required\u201d preliminarily to authenticate an item of evidence. <em>[Sliker; </em>751 F.2d] at 499. \u201cThe type and quantum of evidence\u201d required is \u201crelated to the purpose for which the evidence is offered,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 488, and depends upon a context-specific determination whether the proof advanced is sufficient to support a finding that the item in question is what its proponent claims it to be.

The simplest (and likely most common) form of authentication is through \u201cthe testimony of a \u2018witness with knowledge\u2019 that \u2018a matter is what it is claimed to be.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Rommy, </em>506 F.3d 108, 138 (2d Cir.2007) (quoting Fed.R.Evid. 901(b)(1) (pre-2011 amendments)). This is by no means exclusive, however: Rule 901 provides several examples of proper authentication techniques in different contexts, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 901(b), and the advisory committee\u2019s note states that these are \u201cnot intended as an exclusive enumeration of allowable methods but are meant to guide and suggest, leaving room for growth and development in this area of the law,\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 901 advisory committee\u2019s note (Note to Subdivision (b)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-6\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). Illustration of authentication techniques, according to the Second Circuit, could be derived from documents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">Some examples illustrate the point. For instance, we have said that a document can be authenticated by \u201cdistinctive characteristics of the document itself, such as its \u2018[a]ppearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics, taken in conjunction with the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maldonado-Rivera, </em>922 F.2d at 957 (alteration in original) (quoting Fed.R.Evid. 901(b)(4) (pre-2011 amendments)); <em>see also Sliker, </em>751 F.2d at 488 (contents of alleged bank records, in conjunction with their seizure at purported bank office, provided sufficient proof of their connection to allegedly sham bank). Or, where the evidence in question is a recorded call, we have said that \u201c[wjhile a mere assertion of identity by a person talking on the telephone is not in itself sufficient to authenticate that person\u2019s identity, some additional evidence, which need not fall into any set pattern, may provide the necessary foundation.\u201d <em>[United States v.] Dhinsa, </em>243 F.3d [635,] 658-59 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>[ (2d Cir.2001) ] (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Sliker, </em>751 F.2d at 499 (voice on tape recording was sufficiently authenticated as defendant\u2019s based on comparison of taped voice with defendant\u2019s trial testimony). And in a case where credit card receipts purportedly signed by the defendant would have tended to support his alibi defense, we ruled that the defendant\u2019s copies had been sufficiently authenticated, despite some question as to when these copies had been signed, where the defendant offered testimony from store managers as to how the receipts were produced, testimony from the defendant\u2019s wife (a joint holder of the credit card) that she had not made the purchases in question, and testimony from a handwriting expert that the defendant\u2019s signature was genuine. <em>United States v.

The Second Circuit, finally, iterated that even after evidence is authenticated, \u201c \u2018the issue of [its] ultimate reliability [is left] to the jury.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 131, quoting <em>United States v.

Thus, after the proponent of the evidence has adduced sufficient evidence to support a find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>ing that the proffered evidence is what it is claimed to be, the opposing party \u201cremains free to challenge the reliability of the evidence, to minimize its importance, or to argue alternative interpretations of its meaning, but these and similar other challenges go to the <em>weight </em>of the evidence\u2014 not to its <em>admissibility.\u201d Tin Yat Chin, </em>371 F.3d at 38.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEL9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The court, however, \u201cconclude[d] that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the VK web page\u201d. <em>Id. </em>It reasoned \u201cthat information <em>about </em>Zhyltsou appeared on the VK page.... But there was no evidence that Zhyltsou himself had created the page or was responsible for its contents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132. The court opined, moreover, that the mere fact that the page existed on the internet \u201cdoes not permit a reasonable conclusion that [it] was created by the defendant or on his behalf\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-6\">As noted above, Rule 901 requires \u201cevidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.\u201d It is uncontroverted that information <em>about </em>Zhyltsou appeared on the VK page: his name, photograph, and some details about his life consistent with Timku\u2019s testimony about him. But there was no evidence that Zhyltsou himself had created the page or was responsible for its contents. Had the government sought to introduce, for instance, a flyer found on the street that contained Zhyltsou\u2019s Skype address and was purportedly written or authorized by him, the district court surely would have required some evidence that the flyer did, in fact, emanate from Zhyltsou. Otherwise, how could the statements in the flyer be attributed to him? <em>Cf. Dhinsa, </em>243 F.3d at 658-59 (\u201c[A] mere assertion of identity by a person talking on the telephone is not in itself sufficient to authenticate that person\u2019s identity... .\u201d). And contrary to the government\u2019s argument, the mere fact that a page with Zhyltsou\u2019s name and photograph happened to exist on the Internet at the time of Special Agent Cline\u2019s testimony does not permit a reasonable conclusion that this page was created by the defendant or on his behalf.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number><em>Icl. </em>The page could not be authenticated by \u201cdistinctive characteristics\u201d, the Second Circuit continued, because \u201call the information contained on the VK page allegedly tying the page to Zhyltsou was also known by Timku and likely others, some of whom may have had reasons to create a profile page falsely attributed to the defendant\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-4\">It is true that the contents or \u201cdistinctive characteristics\u201d of a document can sometimes alone provide circumstantial evidence sufficient for authentication.

Here, however, all the information contained on the VK page allegedly tying the page to Zhyltsou was also known by Timku and likely others, some of whom may have had reasons to create a profile page falsely attributed to the defendant. Other than the page itself, moreover, no evidence in the record suggested that Zhyltsou even had a VK profile page, much less that the page in question was that page. Nor was there any evidence that identity verification is necessary to create such a page with VK, which might also have helped render more than speculative the conclusion that the page in question belonged to Zhyltsou.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 132-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The Second Circuit, however, demurred from expressing a \u201cview on what kind of evidence <em>would </em>have been sufficient to authenticate the VK page\u201d, because the \u201cevidence necessary to authenticate a web page will always depend on context\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1z\">We express no view on what kind of evidence <em>would </em>have been sufficient to authenticate the VK page and warrant its consideration by the jury.

Sublet\u2019s argument that Ms. Parker\u2019s credibility was for the jury to determine misses the mark, because her denial of authenticity of the page undermined its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The evidence before the trial judge also lacked \u201cother distinctive characteristics[ ] that the offered evidence [was] what it [was] claimed to be.\u201d <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 5-901(b)(4). Ms. Parker, significantly, testified that she \u201c[gave] her logout name and password to other people\u201d who would access her \u201cpage and [write] stuff on there\u201d. Testimony that others not only had access to Ms. Parker\u2019s Facebook profile, but would regularly write posts under her name undermines her author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>ship. The last page, as well as the preceding three, were devoid of unique characteristics. It is unclear, facially, that the entries on page four were part of the conversation initiated on page one. The initial post, purportedly by \u201cChanica DatBytch Brown\u201d, was made on \u201cSaturday\u201d at an undisclosed time. Two responses are received to the Brown post, one by \u201cCanDii SoSeductive P\u201d and one from \u201cCamerin KilTEnt Johnson\u201d, before Ms. Parker\u2019s initial response, also on \u201cSaturday\u201d, at \u201c15:42\u201d. Ms. Parker responded again four and a half hours later at \u201c20:27\u201d on \u201cSaturday\u201d. The second page, with only one post, was authored by \u201cZaquane Graham\u201d on \u201cYesterday\u201d at \u201c18:42\u201d, and contained no discernable reference to the conversation from \u201cSaturday\u201d. On the third page, there are no messages from Ms. Parker\u2019s account, \u201cCece Parker\u201d; instead, the page contains a conversation among Ms. Brown, \u201cZaquane Graham\u201d and \u201cTonisha Brown\u201d from \u201cYesterday\u201d. On the fourth page, two posts are attributed to \u201cCece Parker\u201d from \u201cYesterday\u201d that follow an hour after a nonsensical post by Ms. Brown and make no reference to the circumstances underlying this case. The \u201cCece Parker\u201d posts on the fourth page are disconnected entirely from the posts on the first page that Ms. Parker had claimed ownership of, because it is unclear when \u201cYesterday\u201d was in relation to \u201cSaturday\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> and, moreover, the \u201cCece Parker\u201d posts do not refer to nor answer any of the previous messages. No showing was made from which a reasonable juror could have found the pages to be authentic and we, therefore, find no error in the trial judge refusing to admit Defense Exhibit A in evidence.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>\n<em>Harris v. State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">In <em>Harris, </em>the Petitioner asserts that there was insufficient evidence presented for the jury to find that \u201cdirect messages\u201d sent through Twitter by the profile \u201cTheyLovingTc\u201d in response to messages from \u201cOMGitsLOCO\u201d that referenced \u201caveng[ing] keon\u201d, were written by him. Harris further urges that Detective Grimes, the State\u2019s forensics expert who examined the cell phones, could only trace the messages authored by \u201cOMGitsLOCO\u201d to the iPhone, but that there was no evidence presented with respect to the source of the entries authored by \u201cTheyLovingTc\u201d. Harris, finally, asserts that the messages did not contain distinctive characteristics, because a number of individuals were aware of the fight in which Keon was punched.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The State asserts, conversely, that there were sufficient distinctive characteristics from which the trial judge could determine that a reasonable juror could find the \u201cdirect messages\u201d and tweets authentic; to wit, that Jahmil T. had identified \u201cTheyLovingTc\u201d as Harris\u2019s Twitter name and that the photographs accompanying the TheyLovingTc messages were of Harris. The State also posits that the content of the messages indicates that Harris was their author, including that they demonstrated that \u201cOMGitsLOCO and TheyLovingTc knew about the plan for a shooting.\u201d We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The substance of the conversation referenced a plan to \u201cavenge keon\u201d that had only just been created in response to events occurring that same day. That the plan subsequently came to fruition the following day also indicates that the \u201cdirect messages\u201d were written by someone with knowledge of and involvement in the situation, which involved only a small pool of individuals, as Jahmil T. stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Okay. Now, after you were at the metro station, and you heard Kev \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, you heard Jared say this about robbing Kevin, where, if anywhere, did you all go?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">[JAHMIL TJ: We went to Josh\u2019s place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And who was at Josh\u2019s place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkiE\">[JAHMIL T.]: Me, [Harris], Kevin, Keon, Josh, Amine, and Foulke.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Okay. And what, if anything, at Josh\u2019s place, did Kevin say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">[JAHMIL T.]: He said he was going to shoot him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Did \u2014 were other people \u2014 what, if anything, were other people going to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">[JAHMIL T.]: They didn\u2019t want to do nothing.

From these facts, the trial judge could have determined a reasonable juror would have found that the \u201cdirect messages\u201d were authentic.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">With respect to the public tweets, our Rule 5-901(b)(3) provides, as an illustrative means of authentication, that an item may be authenticated through comparison \u201cwith specimens that have been authenticated.\u201d Here, the trial judge had already determined that the \u201cdirect messages\u201d associated with \u201cTheyLovinTc\u201d were authored by Harris and were, therefore, authentic. The \u201ctweets\u201d, offered in evidence immediately after the trial judge\u2019s determination that the \u201cdirect messages\u201d were authentic, were authored during the time-frame of the \u201cdirect message\u201d conversation, also by \u201cTheyLovinTc\u201d. The first of the \u201ctweets\u201d was accompanied by a timestamp of \u201c10:14PM, 17 May 12\u201d, two minutes after the \u201cdirect message\u201d from \u201cTheyLovingTc\u201d at 10:12PM. The second \u201ctweet\u201d was authored at 10:26PM, ten minutes after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>the last of the \u201cdirect messages\u201d from \u201cOMGitsLOCO\u201d. Based upon the temporal proximity of the \u201ctweets\u201d to the \u201cdirect messages\u201d that had already been authenticated, a reasonable juror could have found that the \u201ctweets\u201d were also authentic and, therefore, the trial judge did not abuse her discretion by receiving the \u201ctweets\u201d in evidence.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">\n<em>Monge-Martinez v. State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Monge-Martinez asserts that the State had failed to establish that the remorseful Facebook messages Ms. Santa Maria had received while being treated for stab wounds allegedly inflicted by Monge-Martinez were authored by him. Monge-Martinez argues that there was no identifying information from the Facebook profile, such as date of birth, nor was there testimony to connect him to the authorship of the messages and, therefore, the Facebook messages could not have been authenticated. The State argues that there was circumstantial evidence connecting Monge-Martinez to the messages, because Ms. Santa Maria, who dated him for a year, could attest that he wrote the messages and that \u201cthe date and time stamps indicated] they were sent soon after the stabbing, ... were written in Spanish and alluded to the stabbing.\u201d We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">With respect to Monge-Martinez\u2019s assertion that the messages could not have been authenticated as coming from Facebook or from an account he had created, Ms. Santa Maria testified that the messages were, in fact, \u201cFacebook messages\u201d and that \u201che was on [her] account\u201d. The lack of biographical information, such as Monge-Martinez\u2019s date of birth, does not, by itself, prevent authentication, because the inquiry is con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>text-specific; what may be present, yet insufficient, in one case may not be required in another situation.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Whether the messages were actually authored by MongeMartinez could also be determined by the distinct characteristics of the messages in this context. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 5-901(b)(4). The messages were received shortly after the stabbing at a time when few people were aware of the incident,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> were written in Spanish (Monge-Martinez\u2019s mother tongue) and expressed remorse for \u201cgetting carried away by the anger\u201d. After receiving the Facebook messages, MongeMartinez also had contacted Ms. Santa Maria. According to Ms. Santa Maria, \u201c[Monge-Martinez] started calling [her] on the phone\u201d after sending the messages and, upon returning home from the hospital on the day of the stabbing, she discovered a note Monge-Martinez had left in her apartment that was also written in Spanish. Ms. Santa Maria, finally, described a letter she had received from Monge-Martinez \u201cin May of 2012\u201d following the April 23rd incident in which he sought her forgiveness, which was written in Spanish as well. The various communications from Monge-Martinez, together with the limited number of people knowledgeable of the incident as well as the use of Spanish in each message was sufficient evidence upon which the trial judge could rely to authenticate the Facebook messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Monge-Martinez\u2019s attempt to analogize his case to <em>Smith v. State, </em>136 So.3d 424 (Miss.2014), is unavailing. In <em>Smith, </em>\u201c[t]he only information tying the actual messages to Smith was [the witness\u2019s] testimony that they were Smith\u2019s messages to her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434. As we have explained, any authenticity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>determination is context-specific and in the case <em>sub judice </em>there is far more circumstantial evidence of Monge-Martinez\u2019s authorship than a bare assertion that he was the author.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">We hold that, in order to authenticate evidence derived from a social networking website, the trial judge must determine that there is proof from which a reasonable juror could find that the evidence is what the proponent claims it to be. We hold in <em>Sublet </em>that the trial court did not err in excluding the admission of the four pages of the Facebook conversation. We hold in <em>Harris </em>that the trial court did not err in admitting the \u201cdirect messages\u201d and \u201ctweets\u201d in evidence. We also hold in <em>Monge-Martinez </em>that the trial court did not err in admitting the Facebook messages authored by Monge-Martinez.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">IN CASE NUMBER 42, JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

State </em>and <em>Monge-Martinez v. State. </em>Respectfully, though, I dissent because I disagree with the Majority\u2019s application of the \u201creasonable juror\u201d standard it adopts, when it comes to authentication in <em>Sublet v. State.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">The Majority adopts a standard recently applied in <em>United States v. Vayner, </em>769 F.3d 125 (2d Cir.2014) \u2014 that the authen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>tication \u201crequirement is satisfied if sufficient proof has been introduced so that a reasonable juror could find in favor of authenticity or identification.\u201d Maj. Op. at 666, 113 A.3d at 715 (quoting <em>Vayner, </em>769 F.3d at 129-30). Under this standard, preliminary determination about authentication is made by the trial judge as to whether \u201c \u2018the proof advanced is sufficient to support a finding that the item in question is what its proponent claims it to be\u2019 based upon \u2018sufficient proof ... so that a reasonable juror could find in favor of authenticity or identification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 666, 113 A.3d at 715 (alteration in Maj. Op.) (quoting <em>Vayner, </em>769 F.3d at 130). The Majority recognized that under the <em>Vayner </em>standard, \u201cthe bar for authentication of evidence is not particularly high.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (quoting <em>Vayner, </em>769 F.3d at 130). Significantly, the Majority adopts the <em>Vayner </em>rule that \u201c \u2018proof of authentication may be direct or circumstantial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Vayner, </em>769 F.3d at 130).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In <em>Harris, </em>the Majority allows to stand the admission of direct messages sent through Twitter from \u201cTheyLovingTc\u201d based on authentication by circumstantial evidence \u2014 that the twitter message \u201creferenced a plan to \u2018avenge Keon\u2019 that had only just been created in response to events occurring that same day\u201d and that the plan \u201ccame to fruition the following day.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 674, 113 A.3d at 720. Yet in <em>Sublet, </em>the Majority rejects the combination of direct and circumstantial evidence as insufficient, concluding that \u201c[n]o showing was made from which a reasonable juror could have found the pages [of Defense Exhibit A] to be authentic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 673, 113 A.3d 719. I disagree and think the Majority fails, in its disposition of the <em>Sublet </em>case, to adhere to the relatively low threshold for admissibility that it adopts and applies to authentication issues in <em>Hams. </em>I submit that the circumstantial evidence in <em>Sublet, </em>although different from that in <em>Hams, </em>was also sufficient to pass the preliminary, low threshold test necessary to authenticate the Facebook conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The Majority finds the authenticating evidence offered by the defense in <em>Sublet </em>insufficient on two principal grounds. First, the Majority holds that because Ms. Parker, the authenticating witness, denied authoring the Facebook comments on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>page four of Defense Exhibit A (the \u201cExhibit\u201d), that \u201cundermined its admissibility,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 672, 113 A.3d at 719, even though Ms. Parker admitted posting comments on page one.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The Majority relies on <em>Makowski v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>439 Md. 169, 94 A.3d 91 (2014), to justify its inconsistent standard, concluding that \u201cwhen a witness denies having personal knowledge of the creation of the item to be authenticated, that denial necessarily undercuts the notion of authenticity.\u201d Maj. Op. at 672, 113 A.3d at 718-19 (\u201c \u2018[The witness], however, testified that he had never seen the document before nor recognized it. Accordingly, [the opposing party] failed to authenticate the document.\u2019 \u201d (alterations in Maj. Op.) (quoting <em>Makowski, </em>439 Md. at 197, 94 A.3d at 108)).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\"><em>Makowski </em>fails to sustain the Majority\u2019s conclusion. Unlike <em>Sublet, </em>at no point did the Makowski witness who was questioned about the authenticity of the document admit that he authored it. <em>See </em>439 Md. at 197, 94 A.3d at 108. In <em>Sublet, </em>before later repudiating her authorship of the comments on page four, Ms. Parker admitted that she \u201csaid those things,\u201d without qualifying her response as referring to only the first three pages of the Exhibit. Based on this testimony, a reasonable juror could find that all four pages were authentic. Although Ms. Parker later denied she authored the comments on page four, it is the province of the jury to resolve conflicting testimony. See <em>Balt. Transit Co. v. State for Use of Castrando, </em>194 Md. 421, 433, 71 A.2d 442, 446-47 (1950); <em>Dir. Gen. of Railroads v. State, </em>135 Md. 496, 504, 109 A. 321, 324. (1920) (\u201cIt was for the jury of course to pass upon the conflicting testimony....\u201d). Moreover, as explained below, circumstantial evidence supported the authenticity of page four.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The Majority rejects this circumstantial evidence as insufficient to meet the standard of Maryland Rule 5 \u2014 901(b)(4). Maj. Op. at 672-74, 113 A.3d at 719-20. Addressing whether page four contains \u201cother distinctive characteristics,\u201d the Majority concludes that Ms. Parker\u2019s two comments on that page \u201care disconnected entirely from the posts on the first page <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>that Ms. Parker had claimed ownership of,\u201d and \u201c[i]t is unclear, facially, that the entries on page four were part of the conversation initiated on page one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Majority misses the mark by ignoring that the contents and substance of the entries on page four relate directly to the entries on pages one through three.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Maryland Rule 5 \u2014 901(b)(4) provides that in addition to \u201cother distinctive characteristics,\u201d \u201ccontents\u201d and \u201csubstance\u201d can provide circumstantial evidence sufficient to support a finding of authenticity. On page one, \u201cChanica Datbytch Brown\u201d initiated the conversation by posting an entry referring to the fight that occurred \u201clast[ ]night\u201d and stating that Ymani Conner, Sublet\u2019s girlfriend, has \u201cmore to come.\u201d Ms. Parker then joined the conversation by commenting, \u201cyea everytime i see that bitch ima fuck that dirty pussy bitch up. shout out to cam cam u was riden.\u201d On page three, Ms. Brown continued to discuss her animosity toward Ms. Conner and Sublet when she posted, \u201cShe still tawkn shit mmmhm but u want to block me u not real ymani Conner u can keep hiding u an ya broke ass man that jus started working at bed bath an beyond out in the mall we will find yal or shuld i say u cuz he goin jail----\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">On page four, Ms. Parker made two entries: (1) \u201cima say this [ain\u2019t] over #fact\u201d; and (2) \u201cher bf[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] is a dead man walkn.\u201d A reasonable juror could certainly find that in the first post, the \u201cthis\u201d in \u201cthis [ain\u2019t] over\u201d refers to the altercation with and animosity toward Ms. Conner and Sublet that Ms. Parker, Ms. Brown, and others discussed on the previous three pages. A reasonable juror could also find that \u201cher [boyfriend]\u201d in the second post refers to Sublet, and that \u201cis a dead man walking]\u201d is another reference to Ms. Parker\u2019s animosity toward Ms. Conner and Sublet. If we step back and put ourselves in the jury box, can we say that we would be unreasonable if we concluded that not only did Ms. Parker author the posts under her profile that appear on page one, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>but that she continued the conversation as shown on page four of the print-out? My answer is that it would be entirely reasonable to draw that conclusion, and moreover, that it would be the unusual juror who would not draw that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Several other states have already adopted this standard, and a Delaware case is especially instructive. In <em>Parker v. State, </em>85 A.3d 682 (Del.2014), the Delaware Supreme Court was also tasked with determining whether a reasonable juror could find Facebook entries authentic. <em>Id. </em>at 682-83. Following a physical altercation between Tiffany Parker and Sheniya Brown, the state of Delaware charged Parker with second degree assault. <em>Id. </em>at 683. To demonstrate Parker\u2019s role in the altercation and discredit her self-defense argument, the state sought to introduce Facebook entries that Parker allegedly authored after the altercation. <em>Id. </em>The trial court found that based on circumstantial evidence and Brown\u2019s testimony, the state sufficiently authenticated the post. <em>Id. </em>at 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Affirming the trial court, the Supreme Court first addressed the circumstantial evidence proffered by the state, observing that \u201cthe substance of the Facebook post referenced the altercation that occurred between Parker and Brown. Although the post <em>does not mention Brown by name, </em>it was created on the same day after the altercation and referenced a fight with another woman.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688 (emphasis added). The court then addressed Brown\u2019s testimony, stating that \u201cBrown testified that she viewed Parker\u2019s post through a mutual friend. Thereafter, Brown \u2018shared\u2019 the post and published it on her own Facebook page.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on the circumstantial evidence and Brown\u2019s testimony, the court concluded that \u201c[cjollectively, this evidence was sufficient for the trial court to find that a reasonable juror could determine that the proffered evidence was authentic.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The evidence supporting authentication of the Facebook entries in this case is stronger than in <em>Parker. </em>Not only do the entries on page four refer to the fight, but also Ms. Parker\u2019s entries on that page refer to earlier entries in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Ms. Conner is explicitly mentioned by name. Additionally, Ms. Parker initially testified that she authored all the entries associated with her profile, and even after renouncing her authorship of the entries on page four, she never denied that she authored the entries on page one. In <em>Parker, </em>the defendant never admitted authorship of the entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Use of social media as evidence in civil and criminal trials is likely to become increasingly important. Today we advanced our jurisprudence by adopting the \u201creasonable juror\u201d standard and holding that circumstantial evidence can be sufficient to authenticate social media evidence. But the Majority set bad precedent in holding that a trial judge can establish such a high bar for authentication as the court did in the <em>Sublet </em>case. The Majority muddled our \u201creasonable juror\u201d standard by refusing to accept Facebook posts as authenticated, based on an undisputed admission by the witness that she made posts referring to the fight at the party in a Facebook conversation with friends the day after the party, but denying the posts on the same topic occurring shortly thereafter. We would enunciate a clearer standard and advance the law more profitably if we affirmed the trial court rulings in <em>Harris </em>and <em>Monge-Martinez, </em>but reversed the trial court in <em>Sublet.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Chief Judge BARBERA and Judge HARRELL authorize me to state that they join in the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-14\">.
