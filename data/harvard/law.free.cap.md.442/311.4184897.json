Code (1974, 2013 Repl. Vol., 2014 Supp.), \u00a7 5-301 <em>et seq. </em>of the Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d), for damages resulting from violations of the state constitution. This case arises out of the fatal shooting of Manuel Espina (\u201cEspina\u201d) by Prince George\u2019s County (the \u201cCounty\u201d) police officer Steven Jackson (\u201cJackson\u201d). Petitioners, Espina\u2019s estate, Estela Concepcion Jacome-Espina, Espina\u2019s surviving spouse (\u201cEstela\u201d), and Manuel de Jesus Espina-Jacome,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Espina\u2019s son (\u201cManuel\u201d), filed against Jackson and the County (collectively, \u201cRespondents\u201d) survival and wrongful death actions arising out of Espina\u2019s death, as well as a claim on behalf of Manuel for a violation of his constitutional rights arising out of his treatment and arrest following the fatal shooting of Espina. After a twenty-three day trial, Petitioners obtained a jury verdict in the amount of $11,505,000, which was reduced to a judgment and entered against both Jackson and the County. Our decision focuses not on the grim context, but rather on the effect of the LGTCA on the County\u2019s liability for a verdict rendered against its police officer for violations of the state constitution. In deciding this case, we must not succumb to the allure of bad facts for their tendency to create bad law. We recognize the importance our decision has not only on the victim\u2019s ability to receive compensation, but also on the local government\u2019s ability to provide indispensable services to its citizens as well as the stability of the public fisc. For the reasons explained below, we hold that the LGTCA, where applicable, limits the damages recoverable against a local government for violations of the state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">This case stems from a confrontation between Espina and Jackson, occurring on August 16, 2008, which ultimately re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>suited in the tragic death of Espina. Prior to the confrontation, Espina was having a drink with a friend outside his apartment complex.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Jackson, wearing his Prince George\u2019s County police officer uniform, was patrolling the area in his marked police cruiser when he observed the two men drinking what he believed to be alcoholic beverages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hoping they would leave the area simply by virtue of his display of authority, Jackson drove past Espina and his friend twice, then parked his police cruiser and proceeded on foot towards the men. Jackson followed Espina and his friend after they entered the apartment building, using his master key to access the locked building. Once inside, a violent confrontation ensued between Jackson and Espina. Ultimately, Jackson shot and killed Espina and arrested Manuel, who had entered the apartment complex and came to his father\u2019s aid during the altercation. Although the tragic outcome of this confrontation is clear, the versions of events presented by the witnesses at trial lie in stark contrast. For a complete statement of the underlying events as presented by each party, we refer to the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s reported opinion. <em>See Espina v. Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>215 Md.App. 611, 620-28, 82 A.3d 1240, 1245-50 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Following extensive and conflicting testimony at trial, the jury deliberated for three days and returned a verdict in favor of Petitioners, finding that Jackson (1) violated E spina\u2019s rights under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, (2) assaulted and battered Espina, (3) wrongfully caused Espina\u2019s death, and (4) violated Manuel\u2019s Article 24 rights. The jury further determined that Jackson had acted maliciously in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>committing these acts. Petitioners were awarded damages totaling $11,505,000 as follows:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">\u2022 $5 million in non-economic damages for violation of Espina\u2019s Article 24 rights;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">\u2022 $5,000 in economic damages for violation of Espina\u2019s Article 24 rights;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">\u2022 $0 for assault and battery of Espina;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">\u2022 $5 million in non-economic damages for the wrongful death of Espina (to be divided 95% to Estela and 5% to Manuel); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">\u2022 $1.5 million in non-economic damages for violation of Manuel\u2019s Article 24 rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">No punitive damages were awarded. Thereafter, the trial court entered judgment in the amount of $11,505,000 in favor of Petitioners against Jackson and the County, jointly and severally.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">On Respondents\u2019 motion for remittitur, the trial court, looking to the LGTCA\u2019s \u201climits on liability,\u201d first reduced the judgment as against the County to $805,000. Subsequently, in light of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion in <em>Leake v. Johnson, </em>204 Md.App. 387, 40 A.3d 1127 (2012), the Circuit Court further reduced the judgment entered against the County to $405,000 following Respondents\u2019 motion for reconsideration and a full hearing on the matter. Based on the jury\u2019s finding of malice and pursuant to CJP \u00a7 5-302(b)(2)(i), the Circuit Court left intact the full jury award as to Jackson. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment in part, and reduced the award entered against the County to $400,000. <em>Espina, </em>215 Md.App. at 647, 82 A.3d at 1262.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Subsequently, we granted Petitioners\u2019 <em>certiorari </em>request, <em>Espina v. Jackson, </em>438 Md. 142, 91 A.3d 613 (2014), to answer the following questions, which we have rephrased and reorganized for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">(1) Do the LGTCA\u2019s limits on liability apply to damages arising from Petitioners\u2019 state constitutional claims?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">(2) Is the imposition of the LGTCA\u2019s limits on liability to Petitioners\u2019 \u201cself-executing\u201d state constitutional claims permissible in light of the supremacy of the state constitution?<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">(3) Are the LGTCA\u2019s limits on liability, as applied to Petitioners\u2019 state constitutional claims, permissible under Article 19?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">(4) Did the Court of Special Appeals correctly apply the LGTCA\u2019s limits on liability to Petitioners\u2019 state constitutional claims, despite the jury\u2019s finding of malice and the County\u2019s stipulation as to the scope of employment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">(5) Did the Court of Special Appeals correctly reduce the verdict, as against the County, to $400,000 by reducing Petitioners\u2019 wrongful death and survivorship actions to \u201can individual claim\u201d under the LGTCA?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">For the reasons stated below, we shall answer each of the questions above in the affirmative and affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">In the present case, we are required to discern the extent to which the LGTCA \u201climits on liability\u201d (commonly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>referred to as the \u201cdamages cap\u201d) apply, or may apply, to Petitioners\u2019 \u201cself-executing\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> state constitutional claims. In essence, Petitioners urge this Court to conclude that the LGTCA damages cap has no application to state constitutional claims, or, alternatively, if the damages cap does indeed limit recovery for violations of the state constitution, its application here violates the supremacy of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, is unconstitutional under Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and was improper. Respondents contend that the trial court and the Court of Special Appeals properly applied the LGTCA damages cap to Petitioners\u2019 state constitutional claims and therefore we should affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">A. Petitioners\u2019 State Constitutional Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In addressing whether the LGTCA damages cap circumscribes Petitioners\u2019 state constitutional claims, we are confronted with an issue of statutory interpretation. We have long held that \u201c[t]he cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Williams v. Peninsula Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>440 Md. 573, 580, 103 A.3d 658, 663 (2014) (citation omitted). Our primary goal \u201cis to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by the statutory provision^]\u201d <em>Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs v. Marcas, L.L.C., </em>415 Md. 676, 685, 4 A.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>946, 951 (2010) (citation omitted). As we have so often explained, in undertaking this endeavor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">[W]e begin with the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute. If the language of the statute is unambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, our inquiry as to legislative intent ends ordinarily and we apply the statute as written, without resort to other rules of construction. We neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute[.] ... We, however, do not read statutory language in a vacuum, nor do we confine strictly our interpretation of a statute\u2019s plain language to the isolated section alone. Rather, the plain language must be viewed within the context of the statutory scheme to which it belongs, considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the Legislature in enacting the statute....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">Where the words of a statute are ambiguous and subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, or where the words are clear and unambiguous when viewed in isolation, but become ambiguous when read as part of a larger statutory scheme, a court must resolve the ambiguity by searching for legislative intent in other indicia, including the history of the legislation or other relevant sources intrinsic and extrinsic to the legislative process. In resolving ambiguities, a court considers the structure of the statute, how it relates to other laws, its general purpose, and the relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">In every case, the statute must be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is absurd, illogical, or incompatible with common sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-8\"><em>Marcas, </em>415 Md. at 685-86, 4 A.3d at 951-52 (quoting <em>Lockshin v. Semsker, </em>412 Md. 257, 274-76, 987 A.2d 18, 28-29 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Accordingly, we begin with the plain language of the Act. The LGTCA provides that \u201c[ejxcept as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a local government shall be liable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>any judgment against its employee for damages resulting from tortious acts or omissions committed by the employee within the scope of employment with the local government.\u201d CJP \u00a7 5 \u2014 303(b)(1) (emphasis added). The LGTCA further provides specific limitations on a local government\u2019s liability. Subsection (a) of \u00a7 5-303, captioned \u201cLimitation on liability\u201d states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\">(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the liability of a local government may not exceed $200,000 per an individual claim, and $500,000 per total claims that arise from the same occurrence for damages resulting from tortious acts or omissions, or liability arising under subsection (b) of this section and indemnification under subsection (c) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">(2) The limits on liability provided under paragraph (1) of this subsection do not include interest accrued on a judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">CJP \u00a7 5-303(a) (emphasis added). The LGTCA does not define the term \u201ctortious acts or omissions.\u201d At issue here is whether this term includes constitutional torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Petitioners aver that the LGTCA damages cap has no application to their state constitutional claims, which arise out of violations of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Specifically, with regard to the language of the statute, Petitioners contend that the Legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201ctort\u201d does not serve to encompass constitutional violations because constitutional violations are not torts within the meaning of the LGTCA. Petitioners explain that constitutional violations \u201care claims arising under the state constitution and not torts in the common law sense[.]\u201d Respondents counter that the broad term \u201ctortious acts or omissions\u201d is plainly inclusive of all tortious conduct, including both constitutional and non-constitutional torts. Moreover, Respondents contend that constitutional violations have been \u201croutinely referred to as \u2018constitutional torts\u2019 \u201d by our courts. The Court of Special Appeals agreed with Respondents, explaining that \u201cbased upon the statutory language, case law, and legislative history, we see no basis to conclude that the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>intended that the LGTCA damages cap not apply to claims involving constitutional violations.\u201d <em>Espina, </em>215 Md.App. at 640, 82 A.3d at 1257. We shall eliminate any uncertainty and hold, in the present case, that the LGTCA limits the amount of damages that a local government must pay for \u201ctortious acts or omissions committed by the [local government\u2019s] employee[s] within the scope of employment\u201d arising out of violations of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">The current language of the LGTCA plainly appears to encompass constitutional torts. Our prior decisions addressing the definition of \u201ctortious act or omission,\u201d albeit in a different context, indicate that the term encompasses state constitutional torts. For example, in <em>Lee v. Cline, </em>384 Md. 245, 863 A.2d 297 (2004), this Court addressed \u201cwhether the Maryland Tort Claims Act [(MTCA)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] grants qualified immunity to state personnel for tortious acts or omissions, within the scope of [employment], when those acts or omissions involve violations of state constitutional rights or constitute so-called \u2018intentional\u2019 torts.\u201d 384 Md. at 255, 863 A.2d at 303 (emphasis added). The Court explained that \u201cthe [ ] language of the [MTCA] plainly appears to cover intentional torts and constitutional torts[.] ... There are no exceptions in the statute for intentional torts or torts based upon violations of the Maryland Constitution.\u201d 384 Md. at 256, 863 A.2d at 304. Noting that there was no basis in the statutory language to exclude constitutional torts, the Court declined to do so. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">This Court also had occasion to discern the meaning of the term \u201ctort\u201d in <em>Green v. N.B.S., Inc., </em>409 Md. 528, 976 A.2d 279 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>(2009), concluding that \u201ctortious conduct\u201d encompassed a broad range of tortious actions. In <em>Green, </em>we were asked to review whether the general cap on non-economic damages contained in CJP \u00a7 11-108 served to limit recovery for damages arising from violations of the Consumer Protection Act (CPA). 409 Md. at 532, 976 A.2d at 281. In holding that a statutory cause of action under the CPA arising out of a personal injury was a \u201ctort\u201d contemplated by the cap, this Court, citing to the opinion of the intermediate appellate court, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">\u201cTortious\u201d is defined as \u201c[constituting a tort; wrongful.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1497 (7th ed. 1999). A \u201ctort\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] civil wrong for which a remedy may be obtained, usually in the form of damages; a breach of a duty that the law imposes on everyone in the same relation to one another as those involved in a given transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1496. Therefore, the term \u201ctort\u201d as defined by Blacks encompasses all \u201ccivil wrong,\u201d not just wrongs that were recognized as a civil wrong at common law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">409 Md. at 542, 976 A.2d at 287 (emphasis added). The Court went on to note that our prior opinion in <em>Lee v. Cline, supra, </em>\u201cat least suggests that the term \u2018tortious conduct\u2019 includes more than conduct that constituted a tort at common law.\u201d <em>Green, </em>409 Md. at 542, 976 A.2d at 287. There, we also recognized that, in the context of \u00a7 11-108, \u201cnothing in the legislative history suggests that the General Assembly even thought of the difference between actions claiming personal injury due to common law torts as opposed to causes of action claiming personal injury arising out of statutory or constitutional torts.\u201d <em>Green, </em>409 Md. at 544, 976 A.2d at 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Importantly, we have previously referred to constitutional violations as \u201cconstitutional torts.\u201d As this Court explained in <em>DiPino v. Davis, </em>\u201cwe have characterized civil violations of State Constitutional protections as \u2018constitutional torts,\u2019 which seems to be the common appellation now applied to them.\u201d 354 Md. 18, 50, 729 A.2d 354, 371 (1999) (citation omitted). <em>See also Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 104, 660 A.2d 447, 464 (1995) (referring to a violation of the state constitution as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\u201cconstitutional tort\u201d). Petitioners take issue with the use of the term \u201cconstitutional tort,\u201d suggesting at oral argument that it is \u201csloppy legal shorthand,\u201d or mere \u201cscholarly slang.\u201d We disagree with such a characterization, because our prior statements are consistent with our reading of the term \u201ctortious acts or omissions\u201d in light of the language the General Assembly elected to use.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Moreover, as we have explained on several occasions, \u201cthere is no exception in the [LGTCA] for constitutional torts. In fact, there is no exception in the statutory language for any category of torts.\u201d <em>Ashton, </em>339 Md. at 108 n. 19, 660 A.2d at 466 n. 19. <em>See also Prince George\u2019s Cnty. v. Longtin, </em>419 Md. 450, 521, 19 A.3d 859, 902 (2011) (Harrell, J., concurring and dissenting) (explaining that \u201c[w]e implied that the LGTCA damages cap should apply to constitutional claims [in <em>Ashton v. Browrn]\u201d); Rounds v. Md.-Nat. Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>441 Md. 621, 109 A.3d 639 (2015) (\u201cNothing in the [LGTCA\u2019s] language or its legislative history indicates that the General Assembly intended to exclude any category of tortious conduct committed by a local government or its employees, from the scope of the LGTCA notice requirement.\u201d). \u201cThis Court has been most reluctant to recognize exceptions in a statute when there is no basis for the exception in the statutory language.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>384 Md. at 256, 863 A.2d at 304. Indeed, to recognize an exception not apparent in the statutory language would be contrary to our effort to \u201cneither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute.\u201d <em>Marcas, </em>415 Md. at 685, 4 A.3d at 951 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Notwithstanding our plain reading of the text of the statute, we do not read the plain language \u201cin a vacuum,\u201d instead, we also look to the statutory scheme in which it is found. <em>Marcas, </em>415 Md. at 685, 4 A.3d at 951. Previously, we held that the LGTCA prevented plaintiffs from proceeding on their tort claims, including those involving state constitutional violations, where the plaintiffs failed to comply with the LGTCA notice requirement. <em>See Rounds, </em>441 Md. at 642, 109 A.3d at 651 (holding that, where the LGTCA is applicable, a plaintiff must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>comply with the Act\u2019s notice requirement in order to bring a cause of action for unliquidated damages for violations of the state constitution against a local government); <em>Dehn Motor Sales, LLC v. Schultz, </em>439 Md. 460, 487, 96 A.3d 221, 238 (2014) (upholding the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants on plaintiffs state constitutional tort claims for failure to comply with the LGTCA notice requirements). <em>See also Longtin, </em>419 Md. at 521, 19 A.3d at 902 (Harrell, J., concurring and dissenting) (\u201c[W]e recognize, at least implicitly, that the LGTCA procedural requirements (e.g., notice) apply also to constitutional tort claims.\u201d); <em>Williams v. Maynard, </em>359 Md. 379, 391, 754 A.2d 379, 386 (2000) (\u201cThe plain language of \u00a7 5-304 of the LGTCA indicates a legislative intent to make the notice requirement broadly applicable to tort actions brought directly against local governments.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">We also view the plain language in light of the statutory scheme\u2019s purpose. <em>Marcas, </em>415 Md. at 685, 4 A.3d at 951. The language of the LGTCA begins by noting, in part, that it is \u201c[f]or the purpose of establishing a limit on the liability of the local governments of the State.\u201d Chapter 594, Laws of Maryland 1987. As we explained previously, \u201c[i]t is clear that the limitation on liability provision [of the LGTCA] was enacted \u2018for the purpose of limiting the civil liability of local government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marcas, </em>415 Md. at 686, 4 A.3d at 952 (quoting S. Judicial Proceedings Comm., Summary of Com. Rep., S.B. 237, at 3 (Md. 1987)). <em>See also Balt. Police Dept. v. Cherkes, </em>140 Md.App. 282, 324, 780 A.2d 410, 435 (2001) (\u201cThe overarching purpose of the [LGTCA] was to bring stability to what was perceived as an escalating liability picture for local governments by containing their exposure while guaranteeing payment to tort victims of judgments against employees of local government entities in certain situations.\u201d). Including Petitioners\u2019 state constitutional claims within the scope of the LGTCA damages cap is clearly consistent with the Legislature\u2019s goal of limiting civil liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">To confirm our interpretation of the term \u201ctort\u201d as including Petitioners\u2019 state constitutional claims, we shall also review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the legislative history as it is relied upon extensively by the parties in this case. Petitioners make the dubious assertion that the legislative history is entirely devoid of any reference to constitutional violations. Our review of the legislative history demonstrates otherwise. \u201cThe [LGTCA] was passed in response to a perceived insurance crisis plaguing counties, municipalities and their employees.\u201d <em>Ennis v. Crenca, </em>322 Md. 285, 291, 587 A.2d 485, 488 (1991). Maureen Lamb, then Vice President of the Maryland Association of Counties, testified before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">In the Spring of 1985 the Legislative Committee of the Maryland Association of Counties became aware of the problems that local governments were having in purchasing insurance.... In analyzing the situation it was soon realized that the problem was greater than merely a down cycle of the insurance market. Insurance companies were not only raising prices, they were abandoning the business of insuring governments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">S. Judicial Proceedings Comm., Testimony of Maureen Lamb (Feb. 25, 1987). In direct response to this perceived liability crisis, then Governor Harry Hughes established a Task Force led by then Lieutenant Governor Joseph Curran, Jr. in 1985, which ultimately proposed the LGTCA, along with the non-economic damages cap of CJP \u00a7 11-108, the subsequent year. <em>See Maynard, </em>359 Md. at 391, 754 A.2d at 386 (noting that the 1985 Task Force drafted the proposed LGTCA); <em>Murphy v. Edmonds, </em>325 Md. 342, 368-69, 601 A.2d 102, 115 (1992) (explaining that the General Assembly reviewed the 1985 Task Force Report \u201c[i]n considering whether to enact the cap on [non-economic] tort damages\u201d contained in CJP \u00a7 11-108).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The Task Force Report, among other things, explains that the language of the LGTCA \u201cis patterned generally after the Maryland Tort Claims Act,\u201d which as we explained above includes within its scope state constitutional violations. <em>See Report of the Governor\u2019s Task Force to Study Liability Insurance, </em>14 (Dec. 1985). Moreover, the Task Force Report, which was before the Legislature in determining whether to enact the LGTCA, explicitly notes that \u201c[i]t is obvious that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>political subdivisions must have some form of liability coverage in an era when suits involving civil rights, environmental pollution, public safety and public employee performance abound.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18 (emphasis added). We also note that the Governor\u2019s Legislative Office prepared a briefing paper for submission to the General Assembly, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">In January, 1986 the Maryland Municipal League [MML] conducted a survey among the cities and towns in Maryland to find out their extent of litigation. Within the last 5 years [between 1985 and 1980], nearly one half of the respondents had lawsuits filed against them. Some of the towns had multiple suits. Several of these suits asked for millions of dollars in compensatory and punitive damages. The startling fact, however, is that while only 4 suits were filed in 1980, by 1985 the number had <em>increased 500% </em>to 20. The seventy lawsuits reported filed against these towns between 1980-1985 sought $106 million in damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">A summary of the MML survey, sent by MML Executive Director Jon C. Burrell on January 22, 1986, upon which the Governor\u2019s briefing paper relied, includes the \u201c[n]umber and kinds of issues being brought,\u201d in addition to outlining the 500% increase in tort litigation from four cases in 1980-81 to twenty in 1984-85. Importantly, the summary notes that of the cities and towns subject to lawsuits between 1980 and 1985, there were fourteen \u201cFalse Arrest/Police Injury\u201d cases, four \u201cVoting Rights Act\u201d cases, and seven \u201cCivil Rights Act\u201d cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">We also note that the primary opponent of the LGTCA, the Maryland Trial Lawyers Association (\u201cMTLA\u201d) (now the \u201cMaryland Association for Justice\u201d), raised concerns to the Legislature similar to those presented by Petitioners in this case. Indeed, when the LGTCA was first introduced to the General Assembly in 1986,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the MTLA contended that \u201c[i]t will impose a cap on damages in <em>all </em>claims against local governments.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Bill File to S.B. 557/H.B. 724 (1986) (emphasis in original). Against this legislative background, we find unpersuasive Petitioners\u2019 insistence that the General Assembly never considered constitutionally based tort suits. Indeed, the legislative history only furthers a conclusion that the General Assembly was aware that the LGTCA would be read as covering a broad range of civil actions, and nonetheless declined to carve out any exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">We also find support for this proposition in the General Assembly\u2019s response to our decision in <em>Housing Authority of Baltimore City v. Bennett, </em>359 Md. 356, 754 A.2d 367 (2000). In <em>Bennett, </em>this Court held that the LGTCA damage cap did not apply to <em>any </em>tort actions where the local government itself is a defendant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 359 Md. at 368, 754 A.2d at 373. In direct response to our decision, the General Assembly enacted an emergency measure \u201cclarifying that the monetary limits on the liability of a local government under the [LGTCA] apply to claims against local governments when named as defendants[.]\u201d Chapter 286, Laws of Maryland 2001. Importantly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>the General Assembly explained, in the uneodified sections 2 and 3 of the emergency legislation, that \u201cit is the intent of the General Assembly that the total liability of a local government, directly or otherwise, in an action arising from tortious acts or omissions, may not exceed the limits on liability\u201d and that the \u201cAct shall apply to any claim for damages under [the LGTCA]\u201d respectively. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Petitioners argue that Section 3 \u201cis nothing more than a timing provision.\u201d We disagree with Petitioners\u2019 reading, noting that Section 3 used the same timing provision as the original 1987 Act \u2014 namely, that the LGTCA applies to cases arising out of events occurring after its enactment on July 1, 1987. Section 3 clarifies that the LGTCA applies to \u201cany claim for damages under [the LGTCA]\u201d arising after its enactment. Petitioners attempt to cast doubt upon this interpretation of the 2001 legislation by noting that the Legislature used the term \u201ctortious act or omission\u201d in Section 2, which according to Petitioners excludes state constitutional violations. As we explained above, however, this term plainly includes Petitioners\u2019 state constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">in the interest of completeness, we now address two additional arguments advanced by Petitioners concerning the LGTCA\u2019s application to state constitutional violations. First, Petitioners argue strenuously that \u201cMaryland local governments and their employees have never enjoyed any immunity for constitutional claims\u201d and that the LGTCA, if applicable to state constitutional claims, would conflict with this longstanding principle. Petitioners\u2019 theory is that the General Assembly could not have intended to include state constitutional violations within the scope of the LGTCA because to do so would conflict with Maryland Law. We note that this is precisely the argument made by the MTLA in opposition to the LGTCA in 1986, <em>see </em>Bill File to S.B. 557/H.B. 724 (1986) (\u201c[The LGTCA] will bestow immunity upon local governments in areas in which they presently have no immunity of any sort.\u201d), and again in 1987, <em>see </em>Bill File to S.B. 237 (1987) (\u201cThis Bill represents an unwarranted extension of immunities!\".]\u201d). <em>See also </em>Statement of John J. Sellinger to Sen. Judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Proceedings Comm., S.B. <em>557 </em>(March 14, 1986) (\u201cThis Bill will extend immunity above the cap to \u2018local governments\u2019 (and other entities which presently enjoy no immunities) for activities for which there is presently no immunity.\u201d). Despite the concern of the MTLA, the Legislature declined to carve out exceptions of any sort in the LGTCA.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Petitioners also argue that if this Court holds that the LGTCA damage cap applies to the case at hand, \u201c[tjhere are serious implications for all constitutional claims in Maryland.\u201d Petitioners further contend that \u201c[tjhere is, of course, no principled way to make a distinction between limiting the remedy here and limiting other constitutional claims, like takings cases[.J\u201d We disagree for two reasons. First, our decision does not imply that <em>all </em>constitutional violations fall under the purview of the LGTCA. Indeed, such a holding would be contrary to our case law. <em>See Rounds, </em>441 Md. 621 n. 13, 109 A.3d 639 n. 13 (2015) (explaining \u201cthat a cause of action may not lie for all violations of the state constitution\u201d). Second, although we need not determine whether takings are subject to the Act\u2019s limitations on liability, as this issue is not before us, we disagree that the LGTCA damages cap as applied in the instant case would necessarily apply where a taking is alleged. We note, without deciding, that where a taking in the constitutional sense occurs, \u201cArt. Ill, \u00a7 40 [of the Maryland Constitution] [gives] rise to an implied contract between the government and a private landowner [to pay just compensation].\u201d <em>Widgeon v. Eastern Shore Hosp. Ctr., </em>300 Md. 520, 531, 479 A.2d 921, 926 (1984). As we stated in <em>Rounds, </em>\u201cwe do not wish to give the impression that a taking in the constitutional sense would implicate the provisions of the LGTCA. Indeed, we recognize that applying the LGTCA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>[damages cap] to a constitutionally based taking[, or inverse condemnation <em>(e.g. Litz v. Md. Dept. of Env\u2019t, </em>434 Md. 623, 76 A.3d 1076 (2013)),] could conflict with a vested right to just compensation[.]\u201d 441 Md. 621, n. 17, 109 A.3d 639, n. 17 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">B. Supremacy</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Petitioners contend that applying the LGTCA damages cap to \u201climit remedies for constitutional violations runs afoul of the supremacy of the state constitution.\u201d In essence, Petitioners argue that because their constitutional claims are self-executing, meaning that they arise directly from the state constitution,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> those claims, and the remedies that flow from them, may not be limited or restricted by statute. In addition, Petitioners contend that limiting the local government\u2019s liability would clearly and impermissibly impair their cause of action arising from Art. 24, which would, again, impair their self-executing rights under Art. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Petitioners cite, rather cursorily, to several out of state cases which stand for the proposition that self-executing rights may not be \u201crestricted,\u201d \u201cdestroyed,\u201d or \u201climited\u201d by statute. Upon review, however, we find these cases wholly inapposite and unpersuasive. Petitioners, for instance, cite to the Supreme Court of Colorado\u2019s 1950 opinion in <em>Baker v. Bosworth, </em>122 Colo. 356, 222 P.2d 416 (1950). In <em>Baker, </em>the court was asked to consider whether the legislature, by itself, could alter a provision in the state constitution providing that eight percent of the legal voters were needed to propose any law by referendum, when the constitution expressly reserved the power to propose constitutional amendments to the people, \u201cindependent of the general assembly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417. The court concluded that the legislature\u2019s attempt to raise the referendum requirement to fifteen percent was plainly unconstitutional as it conflicted with the express language of the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>constitution vesting all power to amend the constitution in the people. <em>Id. </em>at 417-19. In the present case, there is no such conflict. Apart from Article 19, discussed <em>infra, </em>Petitioners cite to no provision of our state constitution that is being contravened in a similar manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Moreover, of the numerous cases Petitioners rely upon, none involve a finding that a limitation on liability for damages in tort is unconstitutional on supremacy grounds. Indeed, the cases cited by Petitioners involve issues irrelevant to our discussion. <em>See, e.g., Shell v. Jefferson Cnty., </em>454 So.2d 1331 (Ala.1984) (addressing the validity of a statute limiting the County\u2019s authority to set sewer services rates, where such authority was unrestricted under the state constitution); <em>Loonan v. Woodley, </em>882 P.2d 1380 (Colo.1994) (reviewing a challenge to an initiative petition \u201cthat would require parental notification of an unemancipated minor\u2019s decision to have an abortion\u201d for failure to collect a sufficient amount of signatures); <em>In re Inter-Faith Villa, L.P., </em>39 Kan.App.2d 810, 185 P.3d 295 (2008) <em>abrogated by In re Mental Health Ass\u2019n of Heartland, </em>289 Kan. 1209, 221 P.3d 580 (2009) (reviewing a decision of the Kansas State Board of Tax Appeals denying appellants\u2019 application for exemption from ad valorem taxes); <em>Movants to Quash Multicounty Grand Jury Subpoena v. Dixon, </em>184 P.3d 546 (Okla.2008) (reviewing a challenge concerning the authority of a multicounty grand jury to investigate illegal activity occurring in one county).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Apart from relying upon inapplicable, out of state cases, Petitioners cite to our opinion in <em>Longtin </em>for the proposition that the application of the damages cap to a constitutional claim is violative of the supremacy of the state constitution because it \u201cimpairs\u201d a plaintiffs cause of action. We find this reliance misplaced. In <em>Longtin, </em>this Court held that the <em>retroactive </em>application of the LGTCA damages cap was unconstitutional, because \u201cLongtin had a vested right in bringing his cause of action \u2014 with no statutory cap on damages \u2014 prior to the enactment of the LGTCA revisions.\u201d 419 Md. at 489-90, 19 A.3d at 883. In other words, in that case, the retroactive application of the cap would \u201cimpair\u201d Longtin\u2019s right to bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>a cause of action, as it existed at the time his injury accrued. <em>Id. </em>This is plainly not at issue here. Thus, <em>Longtin </em>provides no support for Petitioners\u2019 position. In our view, application of the LGTCA damages cap to state constitutional claims does not violate the supremacy of the state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">C. Article 19</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Petitioners assert that the application of the LGTCA damages cap to their constitutional claims, which strips nearly 98% of the total jury verdict, is unconstitutional under Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Article 19 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU7\">That every man, for any injury done to him in his person or property, ought to have remedy by the course of the Law of the land, and ought to have justice and right, freely without sale, fully without any denial, and speedily without delay, according to the Law of the land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">We have explained that Article 19 essentially \u201cprotects two interrelated rights: (1) a right to a remedy for an injury to one\u2019s person or property; [and] (2) a right of access to the courts.\u201d <em>Piselli v. 75th St. Med., </em>371 Md. 188, 205, 808 A.2d 508, 518 (2002). This Court set forth the history of Article 19 in <em>Piselli </em>and again in <em>Jackson v. Packman, </em>422 Md. 357, 30 A.3d 854 (2011):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">Article 19 was part of the original Maryland Declaration of Rights adopted in 1776, although it was then designated as Article 17 of the Declaration of Rights. Except for one word, the wording today is identical to the 1776 wording.[FN]5 All of the original state constitutions adopted at the time of the Revolutionary War, except Virginia\u2019s and North Carolina\u2019s, contained provisions like Article 19. While the United States Constitution contains no comparable provision, today the constitutions of 39 states have clauses similar to Article 19. These provisions, often referred to as \u2018Remedy Clauses\u2019 or \u2018Open Courts Clauses\u2019 or \u2018Access to Courts Clauses,\u2019 are based on Chapter 40 of the Magna Carta or, more particularly, Lord Coke\u2019s interpretation of Chapter 40_[fn]6 por a review of the history, purpose, interpretation, and application of such clauses, <em>see, e.g., Smothers v. Gres</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>ham Transfer, Inc., </em>332 Or. 83, 23 P.3d 333 <em>(2001); </em>Comment, <em>The Kansas Remedy by Due Course of Law Provision: Defining a Right to a Remedy, </em>47 Kan.

Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which also contains the phrase \u2018Law of the land,\u2019 is based upon Chapter 39 of the Magna Carta.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-7\"><em>Dackman, </em>422 Md. at 376-77, 30 A.3d at 865-66 (quoting <em>Piselli, </em>371 Md. at 204-05, 808 A.2d at 517-18). In addition, \u201c[w]e have held that \u2018it is a basic tenet, expressed in Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, that a plaintiff injured by unconstitutional state action should have a remedy to redress the wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Piselli, </em>371 Md. at 205, 808 A.2d at 518 (quoting <em>Dua v. Comcast Cable, </em>370 Md. 604, 644, 805 A.2d 1061, 1084 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Petitioners contend that application of the LGTCA damages cap to their constitutional claims in this case is contrary to this \u201cbasic tenet\u201d and violates Article 19, because it effectively demolishes their remedy for constitutional violations by reducing their total judgment by approximately 98%. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Thus, Petitioners argue, the LGTCA damages cap is an unreasonable restriction on their right to a remedy. Respondents counter that the application of the LGTCA to Petitioners\u2019 claims does not infringe Article 19 because the Legislature may place reasonable limits on common law actions for damages,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the LGTCA damages cap is reasonable. The Court of Special Appeals agreed with Respondents, distinguishing the LGTCA cap from the substituted remedy that we held to be unreasonable in <em>Dackman. Espina, </em>215 Md.App. at 644, 82 A.8d at 1260. The intermediate appellate court further concluded that the LGTCA damages cap is more like the general non-economic tort damages cap contained in CJP \u00a7 11-108, which this Court has upheld as constitutional. <em>Espina, </em>215 Md.App. at 645, 82 A.3d at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">We have previously held that the notice provision of the LGTCA does not violate Article 19. <em>See Rios v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>386 Md. 104, 136-39, 872 A.2d 1, 20-21 (2005). In <em>Rios, </em>we explained that \u201c[ajbsent the enactment of the LGTCA, local governments would not be required to defend and indemnify their employees in suits arising out of non-constitutional torts committed during \u2018governmental\u2019 activities.... Therefore, the LGTCA cannot be described as restricting a \u2018traditional remedy or access to the courts\u2019 when it legislatively permits plaintiffs to enforce judgments obtained from suit against the employee against the local government.\u201d 386 Md. at 139, 872 A.2d at 21 (citation omitted). The Court of Special Appeals, relying on <em>Rios, </em>has also explained that, rather than <em>restricting </em>a plaintiffs right to a remedy, \u201cthe LGTCA ensures that injured persons will be compensated for their injuries \u2014 up to the damages cap \u2014 by requiring local governments to pay judgments entered against their employees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>prohibiting local governments from asserting governmental immunity as a defense to that responsibility.\u201d <em>Holloway-Johnson v. Beall, </em>220 Md.App. 195, 212-13, 103 A.3d 720, 731 (2014) (citing <em>Rios, </em>386 Md. at 139, 872 A.2d at 21).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">This is our first occasion to address specifically an Article 19 challenge to the LGTCA damages cap. At issue in this case is Petitioners\u2019 right to a remedy.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In reviewing an Article 19 challenge to a legislative restriction on a remedy, we apply a reasonableness test. <em>See Dackman, </em>422 Md. at 379, 30 A.3d at 867 (\u201cArticle 19 permits the Legislature to impose a reasonable limit upon non-economic damages recoverable in tort cases.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">It is useful to begin by reviewing restrictions that we have previously held to be unreasonable. \u201cWe have indicated, with regard to causes of action to recover for violations of certain fundamental rights, that an abrogation of access to the courts which would leave the plaintiff totally remediless would be unreasonable.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>325 Md. at 366, 601 A.2d at 113 (emphasis added). Restrictions resulting in no compensation or \u201cdrastically inadequate\u201d compensation <em>(ie., </em>\u201calmost no compensation\u201d) were held to be unreasonable in <em>Piselli </em>and <em>Dackman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">In <em>Piselli, </em>we were called upon to address whether the three-year statute of limitations for an action brought against a health care provider by a plaintiff whose injury occurred during childhood should commence from the discovery of the injury by the child\u2019s parents or by the child. <em>Piselli, </em>371 Md. at 193, 808 A.2d at 510-11. In 1993, the plaintiff in that case, age 10, suffered a leg injury and was taken to the 75th Street Medical Center for treatment. <em>Piselli, </em>371 Md. at 194-95, 808 A.2d at 511-12. The treating physician at the Medical Center <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>diagnosed the plaintiffs injury as a pulled hamstring muscle, and sent him home. <em>Piselli, </em>371 Md. at 195, 808 A.2d at 512. Three days later, the child\u2019s leg was further injured, and he was ultimately taken to Johns Hopkins Hospital, where it was discovered that he had suffered a \u201cslipped capital epiphysis.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>As a result of the injury, the child was required to restrict his mobility, and subsequently developed \u201cavascular necrosis,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which required several surgeries to correct the condition. <em>Id. </em>In 1998, five years after the injury, the child\u2019s parents filed in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland a medical malpractice action against the Medical Center. <em>Piselli, </em>371 Md. at 196, 808 A.2d at 512. Following trial, the jury found for the plaintiff and awarded damages. <em>Piselli, </em>371 Md. at 197, 808 A.2d at 513. For purposes of the statute of limitations, the jury found that the child\u2019s parents discovered the injury when it occurred in 1993, but that the child did not discover the injury until 1999, after the suit was filed. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, the trial court ruled as a matter of law that the action accrued in 1993 and was therefore time-barred pursuant to CJP \u00a7 5-109. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Before this Court, by certification from United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the plaintiff argued that the commencement of the statute of limitations from the time his parents discovered his injury, when he was a minor and therefore unable to bring suit on his own behalf, deprived him of his Article 19 right to access the courts and to a remedy for his injuries. <em>Piselli, </em>371 Md. at 198, 808 A.2d at 514. We agreed, stating that by applying the three-year statute of limitations to an action arising out of an injury to a child, \u201cthe statute unfairly and unreasonably may abrogate a child\u2019s medical malpractice cause of action when the child is not at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>fault.\u201d <em>Piselli, 371 </em>Md. at 215, 808 A.2d at 524. In other words, by applying the three-year statute of limitations to the child\u2019s cause of action before the child could legally bring the action himself, the child was denied a remedy for his injury. Thus, we held that \u201cbarring an injured child\u2019s medical malpractice claim before the child is able to bring an action is an unreasonable restriction upon the child\u2019s right to a remedy and access to the courts guaranteed by Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d <em>Piselli, </em>371 Md. at 216, 808 A.2d at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\"><em>Dackman </em>bears somewhat more similarity to the instant case than does <em>Piselli, </em>because <em>Dackman </em>involved a statutory \u201csubstituted remedy\u201d with a maximum recovery of $17,000.00. Specifically, <em>Dackman </em>involved a provision of the Reduction of Lead Risk in Housing Act (\u201cRLRHA\u201d) that, under certain conditions, substituted a statutory remedy in exchange for a grant of immunity to rental property owners. 422 Md. at 361, 30 A.3d at 856. The RLRHA provided, in relevant part, that a property owner would be immune from suit for injuries from lead paint ingestion, if the property were registered and in compliance with the RLRHA, and, under certain conditions, if he or she had submitted to the injured tenant a \u201cqualified offer.\u201d <em>Dackman, </em>422 Md. at 364-68, 30 A.3d at 858-59. Under the statute, a \u201cqualified offer\u201d had a statutory maximum of $17,000.00, most of which would be payable directly to the injured person\u2019s service provider rather than to the injured person. <em>Dackman, </em>422 Md. at 365-66, 30 A.3d at 859-60. The RLRHA further provided that the property owner would be required to make a \u201cqualified offer\u201d only if the tenant had given notice of the injured person\u2019s blood lead levels. <em>Dackman, </em>422 Md. at 368, 30 A.3d at 860. In addition, the immunity from suit applied whether or not the tenant accepted the \u201cqualified offer.\u201d <em>Dackman, </em>422 Md. at 366-67, 30 A.3d at 859. Moreover, we noted, the immunity provisions indicated that they were \u201cintended to be very broad.\u201d <em>Dackman, </em>422 Md. at 368, 30 A.3d at 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The plaintiff/tenant in <em>Dackman </em>brought suit against the defendants/landlords for damages suffered due to lead in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>gesti\u00f3n while living in defendants\u2019 rental properties. 422 Md. at 370, 80 A.3d at 861. The defendants maintained that they were immune from suit, however, because they were in compliance with the RLRHA and the plaintiff had given no notice of the injured child\u2019s blood lead levels, and, consequently, the defendants had no opportunity to make a \u201cqualified offer.\u201d <em>Dackman, </em>422 Md. at 378, 30 A.3d at 863. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment based on those grounds. <em>Dackman, </em>422 Md. at 374, 30 A.3d at 864. On appeal before this Court, the plaintiff argued that the immunity provisions of the RLRHA violated Article 19. <em>Dackman, </em>422 Md. at 375, 30 A.3d at 865. We agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In undertaking our Article 19 analysis, we were concerned with two possible results in <em>Daekman. </em>The first, as in that case, involved the scenario where no qualified offer was made, or was required to be made, or where a qualified offer was rejected by the plaintiff, but the landlord nonetheless would be immune from suit. In that situation, we explained, the plaintiffs would \u201chave no remedy under the statute.\u201d <em>Dackman, </em>422 Md. at 381, 30 A.3d at 868. Second, we considered the \u201csubstituted remedy,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the $17,000 maximum amount allowed for a qualified offer, paid in return for immunity from suit. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that the substituted remedy was \u201ctotally inadequate and unreasonable\u201d because \u201cthe remedy which the [RLRHA] substitutes for a traditional personal injury action results in either no compensation (where no qualified offer is made or where a qualified offer is rejected) or drastically inadequate compensation (where such qualified offer is made and accepted).\u201d <em>Dackman, </em>422 Md. at 381-82, 30 A.3d at 868. Therefore, we held that the immunity provisions of the RLRHA violated Article 19. <em>Dackman, </em>422 Md. at 383, 30 A.3d at 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">To summarize, in <em>Piselli, </em>we concluded that the limitations statute completely denied the injured child a remedy. Likewise, in <em>Daekman, </em>we held that the RLRHA immunity provisions operated either to completely deny the injured child a remedy, or to provide the injured child with a \u201cdrastically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>inadequate\u201d remedy of $17,000, most of which was payable directly to an individual other than the injured child or guardian. <em>Dackman </em>is distinguishable from the case at bar, in that <em>Dackman </em>involved immunity provisions in the law that prevented the claimant from bringing a case at all \u2014 the $17,000 \u201csubstituted remedy\u201d was supposed to be offered in exchange for claimants not bringing their claims in court. Stated differently, in <em>Dackman </em>and <em>Piselli, </em>the statute operated to keep the injured parties out of court, such that they could not pursue any common law action for damages in a court of law. Unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Dackman </em>and <em>Piselli, </em>Petitioners here brought their claims in the trial court and were awarded damages. The issue here is whether the LGTCA\u2019s $200,000 per individual claim/$500,000 per occurrence damages cap is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Damages caps have been upheld as reasonable under Article 19 in other contexts.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Most instructive is the general non-economic tort damages cap contained in CJP \u00a7 11-108. In <em>Murphy v. Edmonds, </em>we stated: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>325 Md. at 365-66, 601 A.2d at 113-14 (citations omitted). Similarly, in this case, neither Petitioners\u2019 cause of action nor right to bring their case in the courts has been affected by the LGTCA. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s conclusion, consistent with our own case law, that \u201cthe LGTCA damages cap modifies the law of damages applied in cases involving claims against local governments. It does not operate \u2014 as the Espinas suggest \u2014 as a restriction upon access to the courts.\u201d <em>Espina, </em>215 Md.App. at 645, 82 A.3d at 1260.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Article 19 does guarantee access to the courts, but that access is subject to reasonable regulation. A statutory restriction upon access to the courts violates Article 19 only if the restriction is unreasonable.... There is a distinction between restricting access to the courts and modifying the substantive law to be applied by the courts. The plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action based on negligence was not abolished by \u00a7 11-108. Instead, \u00a7 11-108 simply modifies the law of damages to be applied in tort cases. While the right to recover noneconomic damages exceeding $350,000 was abrogated, this change in the substantive law is not a restriction upon access to the courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Petitioners argue that the LGTCA damages cap is \u201cdrastically inadequate,\u201d like the substitute remedy in <em>Dackman, </em>and that the Court of Special Appeals erred in distinguishing <em>Dackman. </em>The Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">The LGTCA damages cap of $200,000 per claim is over ten times the amount of the qualified offer at issue in <em>Dackman. </em>Moreover, in <em>Dackman, </em>if a qualified offer was rejected, the landlord had full immunity, including immunity against future claims by an injured child once she reaches majority, leaving a lead paint poisoned child with no remedy whatsoever. There is no similar immunity provision in the LGTCA, and plaintiffs injured by a local government may recover up to $200,000 per individual claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\"><em>Espina, </em>215 Md.App. at 644, 82 A.3d at 1260. We agree that the LGTCA damages cap is distinguishable from <em>Dackman, </em>because the statute at issue in that case granted immunity to the alleged tortfeasor and provided a substituted remedy, in exchange for the grant of immunity, that was not only \u201cminuscule\u201d but also primarily payable to individuals other than the injured plaintiff. <em>Dackman, </em>422 Md. at 382, 30 A.3d at 868. It is necessary to emphasize, however, that in comparing the $200,000 LGTCA cap to the $17,000 substituted remedy, we do not mean to imply that there is any bright line monetary value that we use to determine whether a remedy is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Petitioners further argue that the cap is unreasonable because the maximum amount allowed by the cap decreased the amount awarded by the jury in their case by approximately 98%. Respondents refute this argument as irrelevant, stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>that, by comparing the jury award to the damages cap, Petitioners are improperly claiming that the cap \u201cis unconstitutional under Article 19 \u2018as applied\u2019 to the verdict in this case.\u201d We agree with Respondents that in undertaking our Article 19 analysis, we cannot and do not focus on the disparity between the jury award and the statutory cap. <em>See Prince George\u2019s Cnty. v. Longtin, </em>419 Md. 450, 517 n. 13, 19 A.3d 859, 900 n. 13 (2011) (Harrell, J., concurring and dissenting) (rejecting the notion that a \u201cdamages cap becomes more or less valid, depending on the size of the trial award\u201d). Rather, in assessing the reasonableness of the damages cap, the question before us is whether application of the damages cap leads to no remedy or a \u201cdrastically inadequate\u201d remedy, <em>i.e., </em>the equivalent of \u201calmost no compensation\u201d to the plaintiff. <em>Dackman, </em>422 Md. at 382, 30 A.3d at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">This Court has explained, \u201c[t]o be sure, applying a damage cap does not vitiate a person\u2019s remedy altogether.\u201d <em>Longtin, </em>419 Md. at 488, 19 A.3d at 882. In his concurring and dissenting opinion in <em>Longtin, </em>Judge Harrell further stated that \u201cthe LGTCA is not so unduly low as to equate with cutting off all remedy.\u201d 419 Md. at 520, 19 A.3d at 901 (Harrell, J., concurring and dissenting). We are unable to conclude that the LGTCA\u2019s $200,000 per individual claim/$500, 000 per occurrence damages cap leaves the plaintiff \u201ctotally remediless\u201d or is \u201cdrastically inadequate.\u201d Although not necessary for our conclusion that the cap is reasonable, we note also, as did the Court of Special Appeals, that in a case involving malice on the part of the government employee, like in this case, the plaintiff may still attempt to enforce the judgment against the employee individually. The Legislature has determined, however, that the responsibility of the local government entity to indemnify the employee should be limited to $200,000 per individual claim and $500,000 per occurrence.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This decision is a matter of policy, and it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>unreasonable. <em>See Longtin, </em>419 Md. at 490, 19 A.3d at 883 (\u201cThe legislature may, in its wisdom, limit tort damages prospectively.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Petitioners also maintain that if the LGTCA damages cap applies to constitutional violations, plaintiffs will be forced to rely on \u201cthe lesser protections\u201d of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 actions to seek redress for their injuries. This, in Petitioners\u2019 view, would be \u201can extraordinary retreat for Maryland\u2019s public policy\u201d and would render Maryland state constitutional claims a \u201cdead letter.\u201d We agree with Respondents, however, that Petitioners\u2019 arguments in this regard are unpersuasive. Not only does 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 have no bearing on this case because Petitioners elected to bring their claims under state law in state court, but also in no way does our decision cause Maryland state constitutional claims to become a \u201cdead letter.\u201d Petitioners point out that, unlike the LGTCA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 does not include a cap on damages and provides for an award of attorney\u2019s fees to a successful plaintiff. At the same time, however, we note that under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a municipality is not vicariously liable for torts committed by its employees, unless the plaintiff shows that the tort occurred as a result of a custom, practice, or policy embraced by the municipality. <em>See Longtin, </em>419 Md. at 492-93, 19 A.3d at 884-85 (discussing the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Monell v. New York City Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978)). For this reason, we explained in <em>Longtin </em>that \u201cMaryland\u2019s constitutional protections require more from public officials and municipalities than \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Longtin, </em>419 Md. at 496, 19 A.3d at 886-87. Our decision today does not change the liability of a municipality for the torts of its employees, and in no way signals a \u201cretreat\u201d from Maryland\u2019s longstanding public policy of protecting individual constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>D. Judicial Admission and Finding of Malice</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Petitioners urge this Court to \u201cavoid the constitutional clash\u201d purportedly created by the application of the LGTCA in this case, and hold the County liable \u201cas it has multiple times represented it is.\u201d Petitioners aver that the County\u2019s opening statement before the jury, in which counsel explained that \u201cif the plaintiffs\u2019 theory is true about Officer Jackson ... then Prince George\u2019s County is going to be [liable] for it\u201d is judicially binding on the County. Essentially, Petitioners contend that because the County said it would be liable for Jackson\u2019s conduct, the County must now pay the entire amount awarded in favor of the Espinas. Petitioners\u2019 argument is devoid of any merit. The County correctly realized that, in accordance with the LGTCA, it would be liable for Jackson\u2019s conduct committed within the scope of employment. Having stipulated to the scope of employment, the County knew it would be liable <em>up to the limit imposed by the LGTCA </em>upon a verdict against Jackson and the County. We decline the invitation to take counsel\u2019s opening remarks as binding the County to the entirety of a then-unknown multimillion dollar verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">We also address Petitioners\u2019 apparent confusion over two related concepts: \u201cscope of employment\u201d and \u201cmalice.\u201d Under the LGTCA, a local government is required to defend and indemnify, up to certain limits, its employees acting within the scope of employment. CJP \u00a7 5-302(a) (\u201cEach local government shall provide for its employees a legal defense in any action that alleges damages resulting from tortious acts or omissions committed by an employee within the scope of employments\u201d) (emphasis added); CJP \u00a7 5-303(b)(l) (\u201c[A] local government shall be liable for any judgment against its employee for damages resulting from tortious acts or omissions committed by the employee within the scope of employments\u201d) (emphasis added). In other words, whether the employee acts within the scope of employment is the lynchpin of the local government\u2019s liability. Petitioners appear to suggest that the local government\u2019s liability is dependent upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>the employee\u2019s malice or lack thereof. This is plainly incorrect. If the employee acts with malice, <em>the employee </em>is <em>also </em>liable. CJP \u00a7 5 \u2014 302(b)(2) (\u201c(i) An employee shall be fully liable for all damages awarded in an action in which it is found that the employee acted with actual malice, (ii) In such circumstances the judgment may be executed against the employee and the local government may seek indemnification for any sums it is required to pay[.]\u201d) (emphasis added). In other words, theoretically, Petitioners may (1) enforce the judgment entered against the County, up to the limit imposed by the LGTCA because it stipulated that Jackson acted within the scope of his employment, and (2) enforce the judgment entered against Jackson in its entirety, less any amount the County pays, because he acted with malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">E. Aggregation of Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Petitioners\u2019 final question asks us to consider whether the Court of Special Appeals concluded correctly that all of Petitioners\u2019 survivorship and wrongful death claims should be reduced to one claim for the purposes of the LGTCA cap because the family\u2019s wrongful death claims were derivative of the decedent\u2019s estate\u2019s claims. In this case, the Circuit Court originally reduced the jury\u2019s verdict as to the County from $11,505,000 to $805,000,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> but, after the Court of Special Appeals issued its opinion in <em>Leake v. Johnson, </em>204 Md.App. 387, 40 A.3d 1127 (2012), it aggregated the wrongful death claims of the family with the survivorship claims of the decedent\u2019s estate to further reduce the verdict as to the County to $405,000: $200,000 for the survivorship/wrongful death claims, $200,000 for Manuel\u2019s claim for violation of his own constitutional rights, and $5,000 in non-economic damages. The Court of Special Appeals concluded that the Circuit Court \u201cproperly applied <em>Leake </em>when it found that Estela and Manuel\u2019s wrongful death claims were derivative of Espina\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>survival claim and limited recovery to $200,000.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that the Circuit Court was correct in \u201cfinding that Manuel\u2019s constitutional claim was separate and not derivative[,]\u201d therefore, Manuel\u2019s claim was properly reduced to $200,000. <em>Espina, </em>215 Md.App. at 647, 82 A.3d at 1262. Finally, the Court of Special Appeals determined that the trial court erred in awarding $5,000 in economic damages, because \u201cthe LGTCA damages cap does not differentiate between economic and noneconomic damages[,]\u201d and, therefore, the total damages award should have been reduced to $400,000. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The answer to the question of aggregation of claims turns on the interpretation of the phrase \u201cper an individual claim\u201d as used in the LGTCA. CJP \u00a7 5-303(a)(l) provides that \u201cthe liability of a local government may not exceed $200,000 per an individual claim, and $500,000 per total claims that arise from the same occurrence for damages resulting from tortious acts or omissions.\u201d This Court already addressed the interpretation of this section in <em>Board of County Commissioners v. Marcas, L.L.C., </em>415 Md. 676, 4 A.3d 946 (2010). <em>Marcas </em>involved the application of the LGTCA damages cap in a negligence case brought by a property owner against the Board of County Commissioners of St. Mary\u2019s County. In that case, the plaintiff alleged multiple tort counts arising out of the alleged contamination of the plaintiffs property that occurred over an extended period of time. <em>Marcas, </em>415 Md. at 678, 4 A.3d at 947. The Board of County Commissioners argued that, though the complaint included numerous counts, the complaint only asserted one \u201cindividual claim,\u201d whereas the property owner argued that each day that the property was contaminated gave rise to an \u201cindividual claim.\u201d <em>Marcas, </em>415 Md. at 684-85, 4 A.3d at 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">In <em>Marcas, </em>we began by noting that \u201c[t]he terms, \u2018individual claim,\u2019 and \u2018same occurrence,\u2019 are not defined in the LGTCA.\u201d 415 Md. at 684, 4 A.3d at 951. In defining \u201cindividual claim,\u201d we looked to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary and determined that \u201c[c]laim is synonymous with \u2018cause of action[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Marcas, </em>415 Md. at 689, 4 A.3d at 953. A \u201ccause of action,\u201d in turn, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>defined as \u201ca set of facts sufficient to justify a court in rendering judgment for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Paul Mark Sandler and James K. Archibald, Pleading Causes of Action 2 (4th ed. 2008)). In the context of that case, we concluded that the plaintiffs complaint, although it asserted numerous tort counts, contained one cause of action, arising from the contamination of the property caused by the county\u2019s negligence, and therefore constituted one \u201cindividual claim\u201d for the purposes of the LGTCA damages cap. <em>Marcas, </em>415 Md. at 689, 4 A.3d at 954. We also noted, more broadly, that \u201cif a local government negligently fails to comply with applicable state and federal regulations pertaining to a particular landfill, and that negligence is the proximate cause of contamination to one or more adjacent properties, each adjacent property owner\u2019s claim for money damages would constitute an \u2018individual claim,\u2019 regardless of how many theories of recovery are asserted.\u201d <em>Marcas, </em>415 Md. at 688, 4 A.3d at 953. Therefore, we held that if there were multiple affected properties, each property owner\u2019s claims for damages would constitute one \u201cindividual claim.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">In <em>Marcas, </em>we also discussed the legislative history of the LGTCA, referring specifically to the difficulties of local governments in purchasing liability insurance. We explained that \u201cthe General Assembly intended that courts would use the insurance industry\u2019s definitions of \u2018individual claim\u2019 and \u2018same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>occurrence\u2019 when applying [the LGTCA damages cap].\u201d 415 Md. at 687, 4 A.3d at 952. For that reason, our cases discussing insurance caps on wrongful death claims are instructive in wrongful death cases involving the LGTCA. The Court of Special Appeals applied that reasoning in <em>Leake v. Johnson, </em>a case involving claims against police officers by the decedent\u2019s estate, wife, and son, after the decedent died as a result of injuries sustained during an arrest and subsequent transportation in a police vehicle. 204 Md.App. at 389, 40 A.3d at 1128. After trial in that case, the jury found for the plaintiffs and awarded damages \u201cto the estate of Mr. Johnson in the amount of: (1) $87,000 for compensatory, economic damages; and (2) $5,000,050 for compensatory, non-economic damages, including pain and suffering!; and] ... to both [sons], individually, in the amount of: (1) $34,000 for loss of financial support; and (2) $1,100,000 for non-economic damages.\u201d <em>Leake, </em>204 Md.App. at 399, 40 A.3d at 1134-35. For purposes of applying the LGTCA damages cap, the trial court decided that there were three individual claims arising out of one occurrence, and therefore reduced the verdict from $7,405,000 to $416,500. <em>Leake, </em>204 Md.App. at 401-02, 40 A.3d at 1136.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Both parties in <em>Leake </em>took issue with the trial court\u2019s reduction of the verdict, based upon the unique issues presented by wrongful death claimants. The question on appeal, therefore, was \u201cwhether wrongful death claims are aggregated with a survivor claim, or considered separately, with respect to the LGTCA limitation of liability \u2018per an individual claim.\u2019\u201d <em>Leake, </em>204 Md.App. at 412, 40 A.3d at 1142. Relying on this Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Daley v. United Services Automobile Association, </em>312 Md. 550, 541 A.2d 632 (1988), and <em>Surratt v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>320 Md. 439, 578 A.2d 745 (1990), two wrongful death cases, the Court of Special Appeals explained that wrongful death claims are derivative from the claim based on the injury to the decedent. <em>Leake, </em>204 Md.App. at 412, 40 A.3d at 1142. In <em>Daley, </em>this Court determined that where an insurance policy set a maximum recovery for bodily injury to one person, \u201cconsequential or derivative damages are comput<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>ed together with the claim for injury of which they are a consequence.\u201d <em>Daley, </em>312 Md. at 554, 541 A.2d at 634. As explained in <em>Leake, </em>this Court applied the conclusion in <em>Daley </em>regarding aggregating derivative damages in <em>Surratt </em>to conclude that \u201cwrongful death claims were derivative of the claim based on the injury to the [decedent], and therefore, all three claims presented a single claim under [the County Charter\u2019s] \u2018per individual\u2019 limit of liability.\u201d <em>Leake, </em>204 Md.App. at 415, 40 A.3d at 1144. Thus, applying this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Daley </em>and <em>Surratt, </em>the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Leake </em>held that \u201ca wrongful death claim will be aggregated with the claim of the injured person in applying the LGTCA limitation of liability of a local government to $200,000 per an \u2018individual claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leake, </em>204 Md.App. at 417, 40 A.3d at 1145.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Petitioners in this case contend that the lower courts\u2019 reliance on <em>Leake </em>to aggregate their wrongful death claims for the purposes of the LGTCA damages cap is inconsistent with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion in <em>Goss v. Estate of Jennings, </em>207 Md.App. 151, 51 A.3d 761 (2012). In <em>Goss, </em>filed shortly after <em>Leake, </em>in which the court refused to aggregate wrongful death and survivorship claims for the purposes of applying the general noneconomic tort damages cap contained in CJP \u00a7 11-108. <em>Goss, </em>207 Md.App. at 173-74, 51 A.3d at 773-74. In that case, Jennings, a prison inmate, was struck and killed by a dump truck owned and operated by Goss during a highway litter pickup detail. <em>Goss, </em>207 Md.App. at 157, 51 A.3d at 764. Following his death, Jennings\u2019s estate, the estate of his mother, and three beneficiaries filed a wrongful death/survival action. <em>Id. </em>The jury found for the plaintiffs and awarded damages in both the survival and wrongful death actions. <em>Id. </em>On the defendant\u2019s post-trial motion, the trial court reduced only the wrongful death award pursuant to CJP \u00a7 11-108, and left the jury\u2019s survival award intact. <em>Goss, </em>207 Md.App. at 163, 51 A.3d at 768. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed, relying on the key provisions of CJP \u00a7 11-108 relating specifically to damages in wrongful death actions. <em>Goss, </em>207 Md.App. at 172-73, 51 A.3d at 773-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>In <em>Goss, </em>the Court of Special Appeals specifically distinguished <em>Leake, </em>stating \u201cthat conclusion turned on the particular <em>language of </em>the LGTCA, where the cap was keyed to claims that arise from \u2018the same occurrence.\u2019 Quite simply, <em>Leake\u2019s </em>holding flowed from the extremely narrow language of the LGTCA.\u201d <em>Goss, </em>207 Md.App. at 173-74, 51 A.3d at 774 (citations omitted). This statement is not exactly an accurate characterization of the court\u2019s holding in <em>Leake </em>because the <em>Leake </em>court concluded that the wrongful death and survival claims should be aggregated because they constitute \u201can individual claim\u201d as used in the LGTCA, rather than arising from \u201cthe same occurrence.\u201d Nevertheless, we agree with the <em>Goss </em>court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that <em>Leake </em>is distinguishable from <em>Goss </em>based on the difference between the LGTCA and CJP \u00a7 11-108. As explained in <em>Goss </em>and in our own cases, CJP \u00a7 11-108 was amended in 1994 \u201cto make clear that, from and after October 1, 1994, the cap applied to non-economic damages awarded in wrongful death actions. <em>See </em>1994 Md. Laws, ch. 477.\u201d <em>Dixon v. Ford Motor Co., </em>433 Md. 137, 163, 70 A.3d 328, 343 (2013). In doing so, the General Assembly also provided a damages cap specifically for wrongful death plaintiffs, as compared to plaintiffs in personal injury cases. <em>See </em>CJP \u00a7 11 \u2014 108(b)(3)(ii); <em>Goss, </em>207 Md.App. at 173, 51 A.3d at 774 (\u201cWhile the 1994 legislature ... focused in part on [the difference between multiple claimants in a personal injury case and multiple claimants in a wrongful death case] in capping wrongful death damages, the State made no fundamental change to damage awards in personal injury cases, including a survival action.\u201d).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The LGTCA makes no such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>distinction. In other words, the LGTCA contains \u201cextremely narrow language\u201d applicable to all claims brought under it. <em>Goss, </em>207 Md.App. at 174, 51 A.3d at 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Petitioners also contend that <em>Leake </em>is inconsistent with our opinion in <em>Mareas, </em>which they assert stands for the principle that each legally cognizable plaintiff may bring a separate \u201cclaim\u201d for purposes of calculating the LGTCA damage cap. We disagree. First, <em>Mareas </em>involved a single plaintiff who filed numerous tort claims against the county arising out of contamination of the plaintiffs property. 415 Md. at 679, 4 A.3d at 947-48. Second, our statement in that case that \u201cif a local government's] ... negligence is the proximate cause of contamination to one or more adjacent properties, each adjacent property owner\u2019s claim for money damages would constitute an \u2018individual claim,\u2019 \u201d 415 Md. at 688, 4 A.3d at 953, does not mean that any \u201clegally cognizable plaintiff\u201d in any action would have an \u201cindividual claim\u201d for purposes of the LGTCA. Rather, an \u201cindividual claim,\u201d as we defined it in <em>Marcas, </em>will depend on the cause of action and the set of facts necessary to create that cause of action. <em>See </em>415 Md. at 689, 4 A.3d at 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">We are mindful of our longstanding principle that wrongful death and survival actions are \u201cseparate and distinct.\u201d Owen<em>s-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v.

Light &amp; Power, </em>104 Md. 332, 65 A. 49 (1906)____ stands for the proposition that survival actions are separate and distinct from wrongful death actions.\u201d). At the same time, however, \u201cit is not wholly incorrect to state that a wrongful death claim is derivative of the decedent\u2019s claim in some sense. The two actions stem from the same underlying conduct[.]\u201d <em>Mummert v. Alizadeh, </em>435 Md. 207, 222, 77 A.3d 1049, 1058 (2013). As explained above, for the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>damage awards, \u201cconsequential or derivative damages are computed together with the claim for bodily injury of which they are a consequence.\u201d <em>Daley, </em>312 Md. at 554, 541 A.2d at 634. Based on our review of <em>Marcas, Daley, Surratt, </em>and <em>Leake, </em>we agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s conclusion that, for the purposes of the LGTCA damages cap, \u201cwrongful death claims, which are derivative of another person\u2019s claim of injury [the survival claim], are considered collectively as one individual claim.\u201d <em>Leake, </em>204 Md.App. at 416, 40 A.3d at 1144. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals aggregating Estela and Manuel\u2019s wrongful death claims with the estate\u2019s survivorship claims for the purpose of limiting recovery to $200,000. Like the Court of Special Appeals, we leave intact the $200,000 award for Manuel\u2019s claim for violation of his constitutional rights. Manuel\u2019s claim arises out of Jackson\u2019s treatment of him during the confrontation. It is not derivative of the estate\u2019s survivorship claims, which arise out of the fatal shooting of Espina. Therefore, Manuel\u2019s claim constitutes \u201can individual claim\u201d under the LGTCA separate from the survivorship/wrongful death claims. Thus, Petitioners\u2019 recovery against the County is limited to $400,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Petitioners use the term \"self-executing rights\u201d to describe their state constitutional claims under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. We clarify what is meant by \"self-executing.\u201d A constitutional right is self-executing where \"[i]t supplies a sufficient rule by means of which the right given may be enjoyed and protected, or the duty imposed may be enforced ... it is self-executing only so far as it is susceptible of execution.\u201d <em>Benson v.
