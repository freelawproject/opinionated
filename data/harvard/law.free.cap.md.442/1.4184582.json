Coceo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bar Counsel charged that Coceo, in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>with her representation of Robin L. Jones, engaged in professional misconduct by issuing an invalid subpoena and threatening third parties with suit if they did not comply. Bar Counsel alleged that in the course of her representation of Jones, Respondent violated a number of Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">As permitted by Maryland Rule 16-752(a), we referred the Petition to the Honorable Mark S. Chandlee of the Circuit Court for Calvert County to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact and conclusions of law. After Coceo failed to file an answer, Bar Counsel filed a Motion for Order of Default on June 26, 2014. Approximately two weeks after the court granted the Motion, Coceo filed a Motion to Vacate Order of Default and Motion to Dismiss and Request for Punitive Damages Against Plaintiff and Attorney for Plaintiff Lydia Lawless (\u201cMotion to Vacate\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Coceo neither filed an answer to the Petition nor responded to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for admissions. She did not attend the hearing conducted on August 8, 2014 by Judge Chandlee. At the hearing, Bar Counsel filed a motion pursuant to Maryland Rules 16-756 and 2-424(b) to have the requests for admissions deemed admitted, which the Circuit Court granted. After the hearing, the court denied Cocco\u2019s Motion to Vacate and issued the findings of fact and proposed conclusions of law set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>THE HEARING JUDGE\u2019S FINDINGS OF FACT</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">Coceo was admitted to practice law in Maryland on June 15, 2004. Robin L. Jones retained Coceo to pursue claims against a Walmart located in California, Maryland, sometime after sustaining injuries in an accident at the store on May 4, 2009. Although she and Jones agreed to file suit in St. Mary\u2019s County, Coceo never filed a lawsuit on behalf of Jones in any court.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">In July 2009, Coceo attempted to obtain a copy of surveillance video of the May 4 incident from Walmart employees, but was informed that a subpoena was required. Approximately two months later, in September 2009, Coceo returned to the store and \u201cdemanded that the Wal-Mart employees immediately provide her with a copy of the surveillance videotape[, threatening] that, if the Wal-Mart employees did not comply with her demand to produce a copy of the surveillance videotape, a lawsuit would be filed.\u201d At this time, Coceo presented to the employees a knowingly invalid subpoena from the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County. Although the subpoena was signed by the clerk and bore the seal of the court, Judge Chandlee found the subpoena to be invalid because \u201cno lawsuit had been filed, it was not addressed to any individual and it requested immediate production of evidence.\u201d <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-510(c) (\u201cEvery subpoena shall contain: (1) the caption of the action, [and] (2) the name and address of the person to whom it is directed[.]\u201d). When the employees questioned the subpoena\u2019s validity, Coceo threatened to sue them personally if they did not comply immediately. As a result of these threats and the subpoena, the employees gave the video to Coceo. Cocco\u2019s representation of Jones was later terminated by the client before suit was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Bar Counsel began its investigation in response to a complaint filed by Christopher R. Dunn, an attorney for Walmart. Coceo responded to Bar Counsel\u2019s initial inquiry, arguing both that the complaint should be dismissed due to the statute of limitations or estoppel and that the subpoena was used to obtain pre-trial evidence to which Jones was entitled. Bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Counsel replied to Coceo, indicating that she had failed to respond to Dunn\u2019s core allegation: that she had presented a knowingly invalid subpoena and threatened the store\u2019s employees with suit if they did not immediately comply with her demands for the surveillance video. Coceo again responded, writing: \u201cGive[n] that the alleged behavior happened on 9/17/09 it is well past the 3 year Statute of Limitations^] accordingly I have nothing else to say on this matter.\u201d Bar Counsel notified Coceo that the complaint had been docketed, informed her that attorney disciplinary matters are not subject to statutes of limitations, and requested a response to its most recent letter. Coceo responded that she \u201cwas unable to recall any additional information about the September 17, 2009 incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">THE HEARING JUDGE\u2019S CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Judge Chandlee found, by clear and convincing evidence, that Coceo violated MLRPC 3.4(c); 4.1(a)(1); 4.4(a); 8.1(a) and (b); and 8.4(a), (c), and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">MLRPC 3.4(c) provides that a lawyer shall not \u201cknowingly disobey an obligation under the rules of a tribunal except for an open refusal based on an assertion that no valid obligation exists.\u201d The court concluded that Coceo violated Rule 3.4(c) when she \u201cknowingly issued and served an invalid subpoena in violation of Maryland Rules 2-404, 2-411, and 2-412 and demanded immediate compliance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">MLRPC 4.1(a)(1) provides that \u201c[i]n the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly ... make a false statement of material fact or law to a third person.\u201d The court concluded that Coceo violated Rule 4.1(a)(1) when she \u201cmisrepresented to Wal-Mart employees that they were required to comply with the invalid subpoena.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">MLRPC 4.4(a) provides that \u201c[i]n representing a client, a lawyer shall not use means that have no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person, or use methods of obtaining evidence that the lawyer knows violate the legal rights of such a person.\u201d The court conclud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>ed that Coceo violated Rule 4.4(a) when she presented the invalid subpoena and misrepresented to the employees that they were obligated to comply.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-4\">MLRPC 8.1 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">An applicant for admission or reinstatement to the bar, or a lawyer in connection with a bar admission application or in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">(a) knowingly make a false statement of material fact; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">(b) fail to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in the matter, or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">The court concluded that Coceo violated Rule 8.1(a) when she \u201cmisrepresented to Bar Counsel that the subpoena was a valid means of obtaining pretrial discovery\u201d and 8.1(b) when she \u201cfailed and refused to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information regarding the issuance of the subpoena and the communications between [Coceo] and Wal-Mart employees.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag\">MLRPC 8.4 provides in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-9\">It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-10\">(a) violate or attempt to violate the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-11\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-12\">(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-13\">The court concluded that Cocco\u2019s violation of several MLRPC provisions constituted a violation of Rule 8.4(a). It also found a violation of Rule 8.4(c) from Cocco\u2019s presentation of the invalid subpoena and misrepresentation to the employees that they were obligated to comply. In explaining that Coceo also violated Rule 8.4(d), the court summarized: \u201c[Cocco\u2019s] conduct, taken as a whole including issuing and serving an invalid subpoena, threatening Wal-Mart employees, . . . and refusing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information, brings the profession into disrepute and violat[es] Rule 8.4(d).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ADQ\">Standard Of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\u201cIn attorney discipline proceedings, this Court has original and complete jurisdiction and conducts an independent review of the record.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Thus, \u201cthe ultimate determination ... as to an attorney\u2019s alleged misconduct is reserved for this Court.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Garfield, </em>369 Md. 85, 97, 797 A.2d 757, 764 (2002) (alteration in original) (citations omitted). \u201cIn that regard, we examine the record to ascertain whether there was sufficient evidence to support the hearing judge\u2019s legal conclusions, by a clear and convincing standard of proof.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Tanko, </em>427 Md. 15, 27-28, 45 A.3d 281, 288 (2012) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">No Exceptions \u2014 Respondent\u2019s Admissions</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">Neither Coceo nor Bar Counsel notes any exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And, because Coceo filed no response to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>admissions, they are deemed admitted. Md. Rule 2-424(b); <em>see Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

When an attorney has failed to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for admissions and attempted to challenge a Rule 2-424(b) admission for the first time before this Court, we have denied the request. We have opined that an attorney \u201ccannot challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the findings of fact by advocating for the consideration of evidence that is contradictory to her admissions or not in the record.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Thus, we do not disturb the factual findings deemed admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">As to any findings not deemed admitted due to Cocco\u2019s failure to respond to the request for admissions, both parties were permitted to file \u201c(1) exceptions to the findings and conclusions of the hearing judge and (2) recommendations concerning the appropriate disposition[.]\u201d Md. Rule 16-758(b). Cocco filed no exceptions. Thus, we shall accept the hearing judge\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact as established for the purpose of determining appropriate sanctions.\u201d Md. Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">We also agree with the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that Coceo violated MLRPC 3.4(c); 4.1(a)(1); 4.4(a); 8.1(b); and 8.4(a), (c), and (d). In knowingly presenting an invalid subpoena in contravention of Maryland Rule 2-510,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Coceo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>violated MLRPC 3.4(c). <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mixter, </em>441 Md. 416, 517-18, 109 A.3d 1 (2015) (concluding attorney had violated MLRPC 3.4(c) when he disobeyed obligations under Maryland Rule 2-413(a)(2)). This misrepresentation was also a clear violation of MLRPC 4.1(a)(1) and 8.4(c). <em>See id. </em>at 520, 523-25, 109 A.3d 1 (concluding attorney had violated MLRPC 4.1(a)(1) and 8.4(c) when misrepresenting the enforceability of subpoenas to third parties). In presenting the invalid subpoena, Coceo threatened Walmart employees with personal suit, a clear violation of MLRPC 4.4(a). <em>See id. </em>at 521-24, 109 A.3d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">During the course of Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation, Coceo failed repeatedly to respond to the allegations that she had threatened third parties with an invalid subpoena. This was a violation of MLRPC 8.1(b). <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Weiers, </em>440 Md. 292, 306-09, 102 A.3d 332, 341-42 (2014) (concluding attorney had violated MLRPC 8.1(b) when although he had responded to the AGC, he \u201cfail[ed] to cooperate readily and fully with Bar Counsel\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We also agree with the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that, overall, Cocco\u2019s conduct was \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d and, consequently, an 8.4(d) violation. <em>See Mixter, </em>at 524-27, 109 A.3d 1 (discussing MLRPC 8.4(d) and concluding that attorney had violated the Rule). Taken together, these violations also constitute a violation of MLRPC 8.4(a). <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Van Nelson, </em>425 Md. 344, 363, 40 A.3d 1039, 1050 (2012) (\u201cRule 8.4(a) is violated when other Rules of Professional Conduct are breached.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">Bar Counsel recommends that Coceo be disbarred or, alternatively, placed on inactive status. In its Recommendation for Sanction, Bar Counsel highlights Cocco\u2019s use of an invalid subpoena and her threats of suit to the Walmart employees if they did not comply. Bar Counsel also draws the Court\u2019s attention to Cocco\u2019s prior unrelated reprimand from the AGC in November 2010. This reprimand arose from a violation of MLRPC 8.4(d) for presenting \u201cinappropriately provocative and inaccurate accusations of misconduct by an opposing counsel and [not following] appropriate procedures in pursuing her client\u2019s interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">As we recently discussed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">In selecting a sanction, we are cognizant of the principle that attorney discipline proceedings are not instituted to punish an offending lawyer, but rather to protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession. Imposition of a sanction protects the public in two ways: through deterrence of the type of conduct which will not be tolerated, and by removing those unfit to continue in the practice of law from the rolls of those authorized to practice in this State. Our selection of an appropriate sanction is guided by the nature and gravity of the violation, the intent with which the violation was committed, and the particular circumstances surrounding each case....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-7\"><em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Park, </em>427 Md. 180, 195, 46 A.3d 1153, 1161 (2012) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">When determining the appropriate sanction, we must also consider any mitigating factors. <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Roberts, </em>394 Md. 137, 165, 904 A.2d 557, 574 (2006) (\u201cThe appropriate sanction depends on the facts and circumstances of each case, including any mitigating factors.\u201d (citation omitted)). Here, the hearing judge found no mitigating factors, and there is no reason to upset that finding. <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. West, </em>378 Md. 395, 411, 836 A.2d 588, 597 (2003) (\u201cOn review, we keep in mind that the findings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the trial judge are <em>prima facie </em>correct and will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Coceo committed an egregious misrepresentation when she used an invalid subpoena to threaten individual third parties into complying with her demand for information. \u201cA lawyer, as a member of the legal profession, is a representative of clients, <em>an officer of the legal system </em>and a public citizen having special responsibility for the quality of justice.\u201d Md. Rule 16-812, Preamble: A Lawyer\u2019s Responsibilities (emphasis added). Despite a client\u2019s expectation that an attorney be a zealous advocate, \u201c[a] lawyer should use the law\u2019s procedures only for legitimate purposes and not to harass or intimidate others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In knowingly presenting an invalid subpoena to Walmart employees and threatening them with personal liability for failure to comply, Coceo failed to meet the high bar of ethical behavior set for an attorney. <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Childress, </em>360 Md. 373, 381, 758 A.2d 117, 121 (2000) (\u201c[A] lawyer, upon admission to the Bar, accepts and agrees to be held to a higher standard of rules of conduct that are significantly more stringent than the requirements of law held to society at large.... \u201d). Cocco\u2019s misrepresentation, threats, and intimidation depart from this model of conduct and were a grave transgression and an abuse of her role as an officer of the legal system.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">So, too, was Cocco\u2019s conduct harmful to the public perception of lawyers in general. By her actions, Coceo posed a risk to the public perception of the integrity of attorneys in general, and specifically of those serving a subpoena. Such misconduct is particularly significant because lawyers, unlike other persons, may obtain signed blank subpoenas to be completed as they see fit prior to service. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-510(b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>An intentional misrepresentation \u2014 particularly one of this magnitude and with the broader implications discussed <em>supra </em>\u2014 ordinarily will warrant disbarment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-4\">Unlike matters related to competency, diligence and the like, intentional dishonest conduct is closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character to such a degree as to make intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer almost beyond excuse. Honesty and dishonesty are, or are not, present in an attorney\u2019s character. Disbarment ordinarily should be the sanction for intentional dishonest conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-5\"><em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 418, 773 A.2d 463, 488 (2001) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Here, Coceo committed a misrepresentation in the name of the court in an attempt to threaten and bully third parties who were unaware of the fallacious nature of the subpoena. In so doing, she seriously abused her trusted position as an officer of the court. Absent any mitigating factors, and with due consideration paid to the potential harm visited upon the public perception of lawyers in general, Cocco\u2019s transgressions warrant the strictest sanction. Time and again, we have reached the conclusion that disbarment is the appropriate sanction for intentional misrepresentations, particularly when they cast disrepute upon the public perception of lawyers. <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Goodman, </em>381 Md. 480, 499, 850 A.2d 1157, 1168 (2004) (disbarring an attorney for intentional misrepresentation after reasoning that \u201c[o]nly in the case of compelling extenuating circumstances will we even consider imposing less than the most severe sanction of disbarment in cases involving dishonesty and fraudulent conduct\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.
