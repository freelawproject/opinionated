Within moments, when Green was about to leave, Smiley asked him, \u201cdid [you] see where he went?\u201d, to which Green did not reply. When Green was about to enter his truck, Smiley fired the first shot at him, at close range.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">After Green attempted to escape by sliding across the front seat of the truck and fleeing, Smiley gave chase while shooting at Green, striking him in his right arm, abdomen and thigh. Though out of ammunition, \u201c[Smiley] kept clicking the gun, you know, it wasn\u2019t no more bullets left in it\u201d, according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Green, who asked, \u201cwhat are you still trying to shoot me for, what is this about, money?\u201d Smiley, though, did not answer and \u201cjust took off after\u201d the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Green was flown to Shock Trauma for treatment, where two days later Special Agent Matthew Beccio of the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives presented him with a photographic array created by the Wicomico County Bureau of Investigation. The photo array contained six photographs, including that of Smiley, created from digital images cached in an electronic database of those who \u201chad the same physical appearance, facial appearance as [Smiley]\u201d. The six photographs had been arranged in two rows of three, with Smiley\u2019s photograph located in position five. Green selected Smiley\u2019s photograph in \u201capproximately 30 or so seconds\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">At the subsequent hearing, in the Wicomico County Circuit Court, during which the array was scrutinized by Judge Newton Jackson, III, Judge Jackson noted that four of the photographs in the array were \u201cslightly elongated with respect to the head, neck and what little bit of the torso of each individual can be seen\u201d, but still resembled people \u201cwho have that kind of build.\u201d Judge Jackson also described the similarities among the subjects of the photographs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">They depict six African-American males, all roughly of the same age, all with close-cropped hair, no corn rows, no dreadlocks, no Afros, all close-cropped hair. Five of the six have receding hairlines. All six have facial hair of the same style.... They all have the same expression on their faces, too, people who aren\u2019t happy having their picture taken, they look rather glum. Nobody is smiling. In other words, picture number five, who apparently is the individual identified, does not wear a different facial expression than the other five photographs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Elmer Duffy, who had been an employee of a painting contractor in Salisbury, Maryland, observed the shooting and related a story consistent with that of Green\u2019s to investigators for the Wicomico Bureau of Investigation. In an interview <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>recorded three days after the shooting, Mr. Duffy explained that, on the morning of December 10, he was to paint the house next door to Green\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s, when, as he walked up, he immediately recognized Smiley, with whom he had played basketball \u201cway back in the '80s\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While inside the house, Mr. Duffy raised the blinds to \u201csee what [Smiley] be doing\u201d. Mr. Duffy told the investigators the same story as that given by Green: Smiley charged at Green as Green approached his truck; Smiley shot at and chased Green; and Smiley fled after the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The morning after Mr. Duffy\u2019s interview, Smiley made two telephone calls from the Wicomico County Detention Center, which were recorded by the Detention Center as part of its regular practice. In the two calls, one of which was to his mother and the other to an unidentified female, Smiley stated that he knew Mr. Duffy would testify against him, which he wanted to prevent; in the first conversation with his mother, Smiley asked that his nephew, Keith \u201cHeathcliff\u2019 Parker,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> get Mr. Duffy \u201cout of the picture\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">[SMILEY]: That\u2019s crazy, [M]om. But let \u2014 let Heathcliff\u2014 Heathcliff and Kev and them know that the boy who lives across the street from Kevin/<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Elmer Duffy, was a witness. He \u2014 he told people he seen me standing outside and he seen me running with the gun and all that stuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Elmer \u2014 Elmer Duffy, the boy that lives across the street from Kevin, [M]om. The boy that lives across the street from Kev.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">* <em>Of</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">You see that boy Elmer, get him out of the picture. You know, I don\u2019t want that stuff. I ain\u2019t trying to go out like that, [M]om.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">[SMILEY]: And Kevin, I\u2019ll take him \u2014 I\u2019ll see him Sunday, man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">[SMILEY\u2019S MOTHER]: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">[SMILEY]: Make sure he take care of everything, [M]om, what I\u2019m talking about. You know what I\u2019m talking about\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-10\">[SMILEY\u2019S MOTHER]: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">In the second telephone call, Smiley tells the unidentified female to tell \u201cHeathcliff\u2019 to \u201cmake sure that [Mr. Duffy] don\u2019t ... come to court\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-12\">[SMILEY]: ... I think Heathcliffs number is 359-1366. Take that number down, too. (443) 359-1366.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-13\">MS. SPEAKER: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-14\">[SMILEY]: Okay. And tell him that I said, man, make sure that [Mr. Duffy] don\u2019t \u2014 he don\u2019t come to court, man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-15\">MS. SPEAKER: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-16\">[SMILEY]: And make sure they don\u2019t \u2014 do you know what I mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-17\">MS. SPEAKER: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-18\">Two months after Smiley\u2019s telephone calls, Mr. Duffy was murdered, for which Keith \u201cHeathcliff\u2019 Parker was indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-19\">With respect to the incident with Green, Smiley was charged in a seventeen count indictment with attempted first degree murder, attempted second degree murder, four counts of first degree assault, four counts of second degree assault, four counts of reckless endangerment, wearing, carrying or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>transporting a handgun, use of a firearm in the commission of a felony and possession of a firearm after having been previously convicted of a felony. A motions hearing was held later before Judge Jackson to address, <em>inter alia, </em>Smiley\u2019s motion to suppress Green\u2019s identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Smiley argued that the identification was blighted by an impermissibly suggestive photo array as a result of the elongated appearance of the other men in the four photographs. Smiley presented Dr. John C. Brigham, who had testified as an expert in the field of eyewitness identification, who opined that, \u201cpeople presumably would be unlikely\u201d to pick a distorted image. Judge Jackson, however, did not find the array to be impermissibly suggestive in stating, \u201cit\u2019s not a perfect photographic array, but it\u2019s an adequate photographic array for purposes of making an identification without impermissibly suggesting to the viewer which picture to pick out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">After Mr. Duffy\u2019s murder, the State noted its intent to introduce at trial Mr. Duffy\u2019s recorded statement to investigators, under Section 10-901 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl. Vol., 2012 Supp.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Maryland Rule 5-804(b) (2012),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as a result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Smiley\u2019s alleged procurement of Mr. Duffy\u2019s death. The State\u2019s notice included a statement that Parker had been charged for Mr. Duffy\u2019s murder. The defense objected, although acknowledged that Parker had been charged for the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">At the pretrial hearing before Judge Leah J. Seaton of the Circuit Court for Wicomico County, an inmate testified that, upon hearing of Mr. Duffy\u2019s death, Smiley was relieved that Mr. Duffy would not testify at trial and was \u201cjumping up and down\u201d in excitement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Tell Judge Seaton what the defendant said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>[INMATE]: It was just like, it was in regards to the fact that [Mr. Duffy] was, I guess he was an eyewitness or something to whatever he had done or whatever, and I guess he was just more or less relieved that person was ... the fact that that person wouldn\u2019t be there to testify against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-5\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Okay. What, if any, actions on the defendant\u2019s part did you observe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">[INMATE]: At first, he was like he, it was like, it was like totally, I guess it was like disbelief, and then it was like excitement, and I guess he went through a lot of different emotions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: How did he express excitement? [INMATE]: One time, it was like he was, I guess he was just excited, I guess, like happy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-8\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: What was he doing to show that? [INMATE]: I guess he was like, he was jumping up and down like he was happy or something.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">During the hearing before Judge Seaton, the inmate also testified that Smiley had told him that Parker was involved with Mr. Duffy\u2019s murder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-10\">[SMILEY\u2019S COUNSEL]: Do you remember that [the investigating officer] told you that the police thought that Keith Parker murdered Mr. Duffy and that Mr. Keith Parker\u2019s nickname was Heathcliff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-11\">[INMATE]: Yeah, after we got talking more about the whole situation after.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-12\">[SMILEY\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, he told you. You didn\u2019t tell him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-13\">[INMATE]: No, I told him \u2014 I told him because, because when we were back in there \u2014 when we were back in the cell, he was saying something about his nephew, Heathcliff. I wanted to know who Heathcliff was and not unless if he told me\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">Judge Seaton, during the hearing, also took judicial notice of the case file for the murder charge filed against Parker, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>case number K12-0587, in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County, Maryland, which included Parker\u2019s indictment for the first degree murder of Mr. Duffy. Judge Seaton found that Smiley had specifically requested that Parker prevent Mr. Duffy from appearing at trial, that the inmate\u2019s testimony regarding Smiley\u2019s statement and reaction was credible and that Parker took part in Mr. Duffy\u2019s murder. Judge Seaton then found, by clear and convincing evidence, that Smiley \u201cengaged in, directed or conspired to commit the wrongdoing that procured the unavailability of Mr. Duffy\u201d and, therefore, concluded that Mr. Duffy\u2019s statement about seeing Smiley shoot Green was admissible at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-4\">[THE COURT]: The State\u2019s Notice of Intent to submit the recorded statement of Elmer Duffy was opposed by the defendant. Section 10-901 of Courts and Judicial Proceedings governs the admissibility of the recorded statement. The Court has considered the State\u2019s notice, the defendant\u2019s opposition and supplemental filing and oral arguments, admitted exhibits, the testimony of [the inmate], and the recorded statement and transcript of that conversation which actually reflected the conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">Under [Section] 10-901, the Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant engaged in, directed or conspired to commit the wrongdoing that procured the unavailability of Mr. Duffy. Mr. Duffy was murdered. Keith Parker has been charged with that murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">The Court finds that [the inmate\u2019s] testimony about the defendant\u2019s statements and his reaction to the news of Mr. Duffy\u2019s murder to be credible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">In addition, the Court notes that in the conversation with his mother, the defendant wanted to, quote \u201cget Mr. Duffy out of the picture,\u201d end quote. He also tells \u2014 well, the quote part is \u201cout of the picture\u201d. He also tells his mother at the end of the conversation quote, \u201cmake sure they take care of everything, Mom. I\u2019m talking about, you know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d period end quote.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">The Court takes judicial notice of the case file in this court, Case Number K12-0587 in which the murder charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>are pending against Mr. Parker. It is not persuaded by counsel\u2019s argument that the State has not proven the wrongdoing, nor that the State has failed by clear and convincing evidence to establish that the defendant engaged in, directed or conspired to commit the wrongdoing that procured the unavailability of Mr. Duffy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">During Smiley\u2019s trial, Green testified and identified Smiley as the individual who had assaulted him; Mr. Duffy\u2019s recorded statement, as well as its transcript, also were admitted. Smiley was convicted of attempted first degree murder, use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence, three counts of reckless endangerment and the possession of a regulated firearm after having been previously convicted of a crime of violence; he was sentenced to life imprisonment plus ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">In a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the admission of both Green\u2019s extrajudicial identification and Mr. Duffy\u2019s statement. <em>Smiley v. State, </em>216 Md.App. 1, 28, 37, 84 A.3d 190, 205, 211 (2014). Our intermediate appellate court concluded that it was not clear error for Judge Jackson to find that the photo array was not impermissibly suggestive and that he was within his discretion to admit the identification into evidence at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 37, 84 A.3d at 211. The court also held that it was not clear error for Judge Seaton to find that Smiley was involved in procuring Mr. Duffy\u2019s unavailability, based upon the facts she found connecting Smiley to the murder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">1) that [Smiley] ardently and insistently sent word to his nephew to get rid of Elmer Duffy, 2) that Elmer Duffy was subsequently murdered, 3) that [Smiley] jubilantly reacted to the news of the murder, and 4) that nephew Heathcliff Parker was, indeed, then charged with that murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 24, 84 A.3d at 203.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">We granted Smiley\u2019s Petition for Certiorari to consider the following questions, which we have renumbered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>1. Did the lower court err in failing to suppress an extrajudicial identification of Mr. Smiley where his photograph was one of only two in a photographic array which was not visibly altered and his clothing matched the shooter\u2019s described attire?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">2. Should Maryland adopt, either as a matter of State constitutional or evidentiary law, a standard for evaluating the admissibility of eyewitness identifications which better reflects present scientific knowledge concerning eyewitness memory?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">3. Did the trial court err in admitting the statement of an unavailable witness after finding that Mr. Smiley procured the witness\u2019s unavailability at trial based on a proffer that Mr. Smiley\u2019s nephew was charged with murdering that witness?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-7\"><em>Smiley v. State, </em>437 Md. 637, 89 A.3d 1104 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">We shall affirm and shall hold that the elongation of the face and torso of four of the photographs in the photo array did not render the array impermissibly suggestive. We shall also decline to adopt the theories and methodologies promulgated by the New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>State v. Henderson, </em>208 N.J. 208, 27 A.3d 872 (2011), to review whether extrajudicial identifications are suggestive, because we are satisfied with the two-part test set out in <em>(Gregory) Jones v. State, </em>310 Md. 569, 577, 530 A.2d 743, 747 (1987), <em>cert. granted, judgment vacated on other grounds, </em>486 U.S. 1050, 108 S.Ct. 2815, 100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>L.Ed.2d 916 (1988), <em>conviction aff'd, sentence vacated and remanded, </em>314 Md. 111, 549 A.2d 17 (1988), for determining the admissibility of an extrajudicial eyewitness identification. We, finally, shall hold pursuant to Section 10-901 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code, and Maryland Rule 5-804(b)(5)(B), that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the statement of Mr. Duffy.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Smiley, with respect to the first question before us, argues, as he did before the trial court and the Court of Special Appeals, that the photo array was impermissibly suggestive, because of the elongation of the head and torso in four of the photographs, none of which was his. The State asserts, with respect to the first question, as it did before the trial court and the Court of Special Appeals, that the elongation did not create an impermissibly suggestive photo array.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The admissibility of an extrajudicial identification is determined in a two-step inquiry. <em>(Gregory) Jones, </em>310 Md. at 577, 530 A.2d at 747. \u201cThe first question is whether the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the procedure is not impermissibly suggestive, then the inquiry ends. If, however, the procedure is determined to be impermissibly suggestive, then the second step is triggered, and the court must determine \u201cwhether, under the totality of circumstances, the identification was reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If a <em>prima facie </em>showing is made that the identification was impermissibly suggestive, then the burden shifts to the State to show, under a totality of the circumstances, that it was reliable. <em>(Kevin) Jones v. State, </em>395 Md. 97, 111, 909 A.2d 650, 658 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Suggestiveness can arise during the presentation of a photo array when the manner itself of presenting the array to the witness or the makeup of the array indicates which photograph the witness should identify. <em>See (Gregory) Jones, </em>310 Md. at 577, 530 A.2d at 747; <em>see also Conyers v. State, </em>115 Md.App. 114, 121, 691 A.2d 802, 806 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>346 Md. 371, 697 A.2d <em>111 </em>(1997) (\u201cThe sin is to contaminate the test by slipping the answer to the testee.\u201d) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>In a case in which we concluded that a photo array was not impermissibly suggestive, we explained that a photo array \u201c \u2018to be fair need not be composed of clones.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bailey v. State, </em>303 Md. 650, 663, 496 A.2d 665, 671 (1985), quoting <em>Webster v. State, </em>299 Md. 581, 620, 474 A.2d 1305, 1325 (1984). In that case, Bailey alleged that the photo array shown to the victim was impermissibly suggestive, because the men in four of the six photographs did not resemble him. We concluded that the array was not impermissibly suggestive, because the mug shots that comprised the array reflected a number of similarities, to include: each man was photographed from the same camera angle; each man had the same photo card around his neck, the text of which had been blacked out; each individual was a young black male; each individual had close-cropped hair; several of the men had slight mustaches, though none was bearded; the men wore different styles of casual shirts; and none of the individuals had any unusual features.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In a subsequent case, <em>Evans v. State, </em>304 Md. 487, 499 A.2d 1261 (1985), we held that the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive when only a single photograph was presented to the witness, under circumstances that were not exigent. In <em>Evans, </em>the prosecutor, during a grand jury proceeding, presented a single photograph of the suspect, Evans, to the witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">\u201cQ. PROSECUTING ATTORNEY: As you were playing games with [the accomplice] in the bar, a fellow by the name of Shorty comes in, calls [the accomplice], and [the accomplice] and Shorty go outside, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">\u201cA. [WITNESS]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">\u201cQ. PROSECUTING ATTORNEY: Now, I show you a Baltimore County Police photograph No. 126237. It is a mug shot, and next to that number are the numbers 6/08/83, indicating the date. Is this the Shorty that you saw?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-9\">\u201cA. [WITNESS]: That is him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-10\">\u201cQ. PROSECUTING ATTORNEY: For the record, that is a photograph of Vernon Evans, Junior.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 497-98, 499 A.2d at 1266. The single photograph procedure, we stated, was impermissibly suggestive \u201cunder the circumstances shown by [that] record\u201d, because \u201c[t]here were no exigent circumstances justifying the presentation of a single photograph rather than an appropriate array.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498, 499 A.2d at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">In the instant matter, Agent Beccio presented Green with an array containing six photographs, which; as Judge Jackson found, portrayed six African-American males of roughly the same age with the same hairstyle, the same facial hair and with the same facial expression. With respect to elongation, Judge Jackson also found that, while the pictures were not perfectly identical and that four of the faces \u201cappeared] to be slightly elongated\u201d, they were not \u201ccartoonish\u201d and, even with the elongation, two of those four photographs depicted individuals \u201cwho have that kind of build.\u201d None of the four elongated photographs included that of Smiley, who was depicted in one of the two remaining photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Faced with a similar, albeit converse, situation of elongation of a photograph, the Virginia intermediate appellate court reasoned, in <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>61 Va.App. 112, 733 S.E.2d 683, 688 (2012), that the elongation of only the suspect\u2019s photograph, but not those of the other individuals in the array, was not impermissibly suggestive. The court opined that an elongated face did not, intrinsically, <em>\u201csuggest </em>to the victim that the long-faced person was one of the assailants\u201d and, moreover, there was no implication at any point in the investigation that a long-faced man was the assailant. <em>Id. </em>at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Here, the elongation of the four photographs, other than that of Smiley\u2019s photograph, did not suggest to Green that Smiley was the perpetrator. The dissimilarity related to the elongation of the four photographs and those depicting Smiley and another man did not render the photo array impermissibly suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">As to the second question, Smiley urges, as he did in the lower courts, that Judge Jackson, in addressing whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>array was suggestive, should have adopted the theories and methodologies suggested by the New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>State v.

The State further asserts that we should not adopt the <em>Henderson </em>theories and methodologies, because \u201cthe studies referred to in <em>Henderson </em>have limited value\u201d and, before adoption, any evidence supporting them \u201cshould be developed at the trial level\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">In <em>Henderson, </em>a special master was appointed by the New Jersey Supreme Court \u201cto evaluate scientific and other evidence about eyewitness identifications.\u201d 208 N.J. 208, 27 A.3d at 877. The special master heard testimony from individuals who were qualified as experts in eyewitness identification and received various studies regarding the same, from which he made recommendations to the New Jersey Supreme Court with respect to factors that a trial court should consider when assessing the suggestibility and reliability of an eyewitness identification. <em>Id. </em>at 884-85, 895.

We decline to do so, because this Court, as well as the Court of Special Appeals, have consistently reaffirmed application of the procedure in <em>(Gregory) Jones </em>for examining challenges to the admissibility of eyewitness identifications. <em>See, e.g., (Kevin) Jones, </em>395 Md. at 109-10, 909 A.2d at 657-58; <em>Thomas v.

The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-10\">(6) <em>Forfeiture by Wrongdoing. </em>A statement offered against a party that has engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b218-11\">. Other provisions in the bills, which were ultimately redacted by the legislature, included increasing the penalty for procuring a witness\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>unavailability, additional laws criminalizing the solicitation of another to cause a witness\u2019s unavailability and removing juvenile court jurisdiction over those sixteen years old or older who had been accused of wrongdoing related to an unavailable witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b222-10\">.

Smiley has challenged that there is nothing in the record connecting Smiley to Mr. Duffy\u2019s murder, because there was only a \"proffer\u201d of Parker's arrest. Judge Seaton, however, took \"judicial notice of the case file in [the Circuit Court for Wicomico County], Case Number K12-0587 in which the murder charges [were] pending against Mr. Parker\u201d, which included an indictment for Mr. Duffy\u2019s murder. Judge Seaton properly took judicial notice of the Circuit Court file, because a court may take notice of its own records. <em>E.g. King v. State, </em>400 Md. 419, 427, 929 A.2d 169, 174 (2007) (\"The court then granted the State's request that the court take judicial notice of the court file in the underlying criminal case\u201d.).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
