Thus, a duty to defend may extend even beyond instances in which an insured is liable and the insurer must indemnify. In this case, we must assess whether an insurance company had a duty to defend its insured under a commercial general liability policy\u2019s \u201cadvertising injury\u201d clause against a suit sounding in breach of contract and arising out of a joint business venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ASr\">The Business Venture</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">In October 2006, Robert M. Gray, President of RMG Direct, Inc. (\u201cRMG\u201d), first met John F. Black, President and Chief Executive Officer of Blackstone International, Ltd. (\u201cBlackstone\u201d). During their initial conversation, Black informed Gray that he \u201cwas in the business of manufacturing and selling lamps and other lighting products designed to assist low vision consumers.\u201d Gray then informed Black of his role at RMG and his \u201cprofessional background in the vision field.\u201d The two men then proposed a joint venture to \u201cmarket and sell lighting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>products to people with low vision problems,\u201d and agreed to discuss the venture at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">Approximately one month later, Gray and Black met to discuss the possibility of working together. At this time, Gray outlined his experience in low vision medicine and his working relationships with many of the field\u2019s leading practitioners. In early December 2006, Gray visited Blackstone\u2019s offices, where he met Blackstone\u2019s Product Development Manager and a member of its sales department. At this meeting, Black and Gray \u201cagreed that RMG and Blackstone would form a confidential relationship and collaborate [on a] joint venture to develop plans for the design, marketing and sale of low vision lighting products to retailers[.]\u201d Gray also agreed to work \u201cin exchange for remuneration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Throughout the next four years, Gray \u2014 working on behalf of RMG \u2014 worked in collaboration with Black and Blackstone employees to develop and market their joint venture. During this time, Gray performed multiple tasks without compensation, including: (1) developing the product brand name \u201cVision Enhance\u201d; (2) creating graphics for use in sales sheets; (3) developing and reviewing packaging and marketing of \u201cVision Enhance\u201d; (4) contacting low vision experts and sufferers on behalf of the venture, which involved obtaining written testimonials; and (5) \u201cprocur[ing] the placement of a full page color advertisement in an industry journal,] introducing the \u2018Vision Enhance\u2019 brand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">As part of his work with Blackstone, Gray participated in the development of a sales presentation to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (\u201cWal-Mart\u201d) in an effort to place the product line for sale in its stores. Although Gray did not attend the presentation, he played a significant role in creating the materials and responding to Wal-Mart\u2019s inquiries. Although Black had informed Gray that no progress had been made with WalMart, Gray learned that \u201cVision Enhance\u201d was stocked and sold in Wal-Mart locations across the United States. Blackstone continued to sell \u201cVision Enhance\u201d and other low vision lighting products \u2014 which Gray believes were procured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>through its initial relationship with the retailer via \u201cVision Enhance\u201d \u2014 under the label \u201cMainstays\u201d at Wal-Mart locations. Blackstone \u201cus[ed] all, or substantially all, of the ideas, information, input and efforts of Gray[,]\u201d including \u201cthe use of the \u2018Vision Enhance\u2019 name on the boxes[, and use of] the same or substantially similar box design, copy on the box, and product instructions[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">While performing this work for Blackstone, Gray believed that RMG and Blackstone had reached an agreement that Blackstone would create a new division for its low vision products, and that RMG would receive a 7% sales commission for and a 50% equity interest in the low vision products. In mid-2007, Gray approached Black in an effort to memorialize their verbal agreement. Over the course of the following months, Gray proposed multiple written agreements, each of which Black modified or rejected. The two men never reached a written agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">On February 22, 2010, RMG filed suit against Blackstone and Black in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. It later filed two amended complaints, alleging substantially the same facts and the following causes of action: breach of contract (Count I); promissory estoppel (Count II); unjust enrichment (Count III); quantum meruit (Count IV); intentional misrepresentation (Count V); and accounting (Count VI). This Second Amended Complaint formed the basis of the underlying suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Blackstone\u2019s Insurance Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Blackstone has been insured by Maryland Casualty Company and Northern Insurance Company of New York (collectively, \u201cInsurers\u201d) for commercial general liability insurance since 2001. Its Commercial General Liability Coverage Form (the \u201cPolicy\u201d) included coverage for Personal and Advertising Injury Liability. In relevant part, the Policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-8\">[Insurer] will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u201cpersonal and advertising injury\u201d to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>any \u201csuit\u201d[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any \u201csuit\u201d seeking damages for \u201cpersonal and advertising injury\u201d to which this insurance does not apply. We may, at our discretion, investigate any offense and settle any claim or \u201csuit\u201d that may result.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">In part, the Policy defines \u201cpersonal and advertising injury\u201d as \u201cinjury ... arising out of ... [t]he use of another\u2019s advertising idea in your \u2018advertisement.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the terms of the Policy, \u201c \u2018Advertisement\u2019 means a notice that is broadcast or published to the general public or specific market segments about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>your goods, products or services for the purpose of attracting customers or supporters.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">On February 17, 2011, Blackstone and Black wrote to Insurers, requesting coverage and litigation defense under the personal and advertising injury provisions of the Policy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On May 17, 2011, Insurers filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment, seeking a judgment that they had no duty to defend the claims because, they argued, the Second Amended Complaint did not allege that Blackstone had engaged in advertising, that RMG had suffered an advertising injury, or that there was any \u201ccausal connection between any of RMG\u2019s claimed damages ... and any advertising conducted by Blackstone.\u201d Insurers also contended that all six counts in the Second Amended Complaint were excluded from coverage by the Policy\u2019s terms. Thus, Insurers asserted, there was no potentiality of coverage for Blackstone\u2019s claim, and Insurers had no duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Summary Judgment Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. Following a hearing, the Circuit Court entered summary judgment in favor of Insurers. Blackstone appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which reversed the Circuit Court. <em>Blackstone Int\u2019l Ltd. v. Md. Cas. Co., </em>216 Md.App. 471, 477, 88 A.8d 792, 795 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>The intermediate appellate court concluded that the Policy\u2019s definition of \u201cadvertisement\u201d was implicated in a Blackstone website that allegedly used RMG\u2019s advertising ideas, that \u201cVision Enhancement\u201d product packaging constituted an advertisement, and that Gray\u2019s advertising ideas could be described as \u201canother\u2019s,\u201d although RMG contended that Blackstone owned the rights to the ideas due to their agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 482-85, 88 A.3d at 798-800. The Court of Special Appeals also rejected Insurers\u2019 contention that RMG did not allege an advertising injury. <em>Id. </em>at 486, 88 A.3d at 801. Concluding that Insurers had waived any defense raised by the Policy\u2019s exclusions, it reasoned that their duty to defend depended only upon whether RMG\u2019s claims \u201c \u2018arose out of the use of RMG\u2019s advertising ideas in Blackstone\u2019s advertisements, without regard to whether the acts were intentional or rooted in breach of contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488-89, 88 A.3d at 802-03. The court also relied upon the exclusions as support for its conclusion that \u201chad intentional conduct and breaches of contract <em>not </em>been excluded, they would fall <em>within </em>the agreement\u2019s broad and unambiguous definition of \u2018advertising injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488, 88 A.3d at 802 (emphasis in original). The Court of Special Appeals concluded that RMG\u2019s unjust enrichment claim did arise out of Blackstone\u2019s use of its advertising idea, and, thus, that Maryland law obligated Insurers to defend Blackstone against all of RMG\u2019s claims. <em>Id. </em>at 489-90, 88 A.3d at 803-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">We granted Insurers\u2019 Amended Petition for Writ of Certiorari to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">1. Did the [Court of Special Appeals] err in holding that product packaging was \u201cadvertisement,\u201d and that the \u201cuse of another\u2019s advertising idea\u201d need not be \u201cwrongful use,\u201d when it substituted its own definitions of those terms for the clear and unambiguous definitions contained in the Policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">2. Did the [Court of Special Appeals] err in applying this Court\u2019s binding precedent requiring an insured to establish all three elements of coverage for \u201cadvertising injury\u201d to trigger the duty to defend by concluding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>the \u201ccausal relationship\u201d element was not necessary in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-4\">3. Did the [Court of Special Appeals] err in finding that Insurers waived policy exclusions as bases for denial of coverage and creating liability beyond the bounds of the Policy when, as a matter of public policy, coverage may not be expanded by waiver?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">4. Did the [Court of Special Appeals] err in finding that Insurers waived Policy exclusions as bases for denial of coverage when policy exclusion defenses were raised, argued, and preserved at the trial court level and on appeal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Because we answer yes to the second question, we need not address the other questions and shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">STANDARD OP REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">We review a grant of summary judgment as a matter of law. <em>Eng\u2019g Mgmt. Servs. v. Md. State Highway Admin., </em>375 Md. 211, 229, 825 A.2d 966, 976 (2003). \u201cThe standard for appellate review of a trial court\u2019s grant or denial of a summary judgment motion is whether the trial court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Sheets v. Brethren Mut. Ins. Co., </em>342 Md. 634, 638, 679 A.2d 540, 542 (1996) (citation omitted). Thus, we conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Walk v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., 382 </em>Md. 1, 14, 852 A.2d 98, 105-06 (2004). \u201cWe review the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and construe any reasonable inferences which may be drawn from the facts against the movant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14, 852 A.2d at 106 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">We construe an insurance policy according to contract principles. <em>Moscarillo v. Prof'l Risk Mgmt. Servs., Inc., </em>398 Md. 529, 540, 921 A.2d 245, 251 (2007). Maryland follows the objective law of contract interpretation. <em>Sy-Lene of Wash., Inc. v. Starwood Urban Retail II, LLC, </em>376 Md. 157, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>166, 829 A.2d 540, 546 (2003). Thus, \u201c \u2018the written language embodying the terms of an agreement will govern the rights and liabilities of the parties, irrespective of the intent of the parties at the time they entered into the contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Long v. State, </em>371 Md. 72, 84, 807 A.2d 1, 8 (2002) (quoting <em>Slice v. Carozza Props., Inc., </em>215 Md. 357, 368, 137 A.2d 687, 693 (1958)). \u201cWhen the clear language of a contract is unambiguous, the court will give effect to its plain, ordinary, and usual meaning, taking into account the context in which it is used.\u201d <em>Sy-Lene, </em>376 Md. at 167, 829 A.2d at 546 (citation omitted). \u201cUnless there is an indication that the parties intended to use words in the policy in a technical sense, they must be accorded their customary, ordinary, and accepted meaning.\u201d <em>Lloyd E. Mitchell, Inc. v. Md. Cas. Co., </em>324 Md. 44, 56-57, 595 A.2d 469, 475 (1991) (citations omitted). Although Maryland does not follow the rule that insurance contracts should be construed against the insurer as a matter of course, any ambiguity will be \u201c \u2018construed liberally in favor of the insured and against the insurer as <em>drafter of the </em>instrument.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dutta v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>363 Md. 540, 556-57, 769 A.2d 948, 957 (2001) (emphasis in original) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Insurer\u2019s Duty To Defend And Potentiality Of Coverage</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">In <em>Brohawn v. Transamerica Insurance Company, </em>276 Md. 396, 347 A.2d 842 (1975), we recognized an insurance company\u2019s duty to defend its insured for all claims which are potentially covered under an insurance policy. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">The obligation of an insurer to defend its insured under a contract provision ... is determined by the allegations in the tort actions. If the plaintiffs in the tort suits allege a claim covered by the policy, the insurer has a duty to defend. Even if a tort plaintiff does not allege facts which clearly bring the claim within or without the policy coverage, the insurer still must defend if there is a potentiality that the claim could be covered by the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 407-08, 347 A.2d at 850 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). To ascertain whether an insurer has a duty to defend its insured, we engage in a two-part inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-4\">In determining whether a liability insurer has a duty to provide its insured with a defense in a tort suit, two types of questions ordinarily must be answered: (1) what is the coverage and what are the defenses under the terms and requirements of the insurance policy? (2) do the allegations in the tort action potentially bring the tort claim within the policy\u2019s coverage? The first question focuses upon the language and requirements of the policy, and the second question focuses upon the allegations of the tort suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-5\"><em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Pryseski, </em>292 Md. 187, 193, 438 A.2d 282, 285 (1981). \u201c[W]here a potentiality of coverage is uncertain from the allegations of a complaint, any doubt must be resolved in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Cochran, </em>337 Md. 98, 107, 651 A.2d 859, 863-64 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Bearing these principles in mind, we consider the allegations in RMG\u2019s Second Amended Complaint to determine whether the action potentially brings a claim within the Policy\u2019s coverage. In determining whether Insurers had a duty to defend, we are restricted in the first instance to the Second Amended Complaint and may not look to extrinsic evidence. <em>See Walk, </em>382 Md. at 16, 852 A.2d at 106 (\u201cAn insured may rely on extrinsic evidence where the underlying complaint neither conclusively establishes nor negates a potentiality of coverage.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As will be evident <em>infra, </em>because we find the terms of Blackstone\u2019s Policy and the allegations in RMG\u2019s Second Amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Complaint to be conclusive, we do not consider any extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">Advertising\u2019 Injury In Commercial General Liability Policies</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Blackstone contends it is entitled to insurance coverage under the advertising injury provision of its commercial general liability insurance policy. As discussed <em>supra, </em>the Policy<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> covers advertising injury, which it defines, in part, as \u201cinjury ... arising out of ... [t]he use of another\u2019s advertising idea in [Blackstone\u2019s] \u2018advertisement.\u2019 \u201d It further defines \u201cadvertisement\u201d as \u201ca notice that is broadcast or published to the general public or specific market segments about [Blackstone\u2019s] goods, products or services for the purpose of attracting customers or supporters.\u201d The Policy also contains an exclusion, which provides that advertising injury does not apply to that \u201c[a]rising out of a breach of contract, except an implied contract to use another\u2019s advertising idea in your advertisement[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">In the Second Amended Complaint, RMG asserted breach of contract, promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment, quantum meruit, intentional misrepresentation, and accounting for allegations including: (1) developing the product brand name \u201cVision Enhance\u201d; (2) creating graphics for use in sales sheets; (3) developing and reviewing packaging and marketing of \u201cVision Enhance\u201d; (4) contacting low vision experts and sufferers on behalf of the venture, including obtaining written testimonials; and (5) introducing the \u201cVision Enhance\u201d brand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>by placing a full-page color advertisement in an industry journal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Provisions offering coverage for advertising injury became common in commercial general liability policies during the second half of the Twentieth Century. 2 Jeffrey W. Stempel, <em>Stempel on Insurance Contracts, </em>\u00a7 14.06[A] 14-60-62 (3d. ed., 2015 supp.). Such provisions \u201cprovide[ ] coverage for damages that occur in the course of the insured\u2019s advertising activities, arise out of one of the offenses enumerated in the policy, and occur during the policy period.\u201d 2 Barry R. Ostrager <em>&amp; </em>Thomas R. Newman, <em>Handbook on Insurance Coverage Disputes, </em>\u00a7 25.03, at 1970 (17th ed.). A court will consider three inquiries when determining whether a policy provides coverage for advertising injury: \u201c(1) Is there an \u2018advertising injury\u2019 offense as defined by the policy?; (2) Was the offense committed in the course of advertising your goods, products or services?; and (3) Is there a causal connection between the advertising and the injury?\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 4 Leo P. Martinez, Marc S. Mayerson, &amp; Douglas R. Richmond, <em>New Appleman Insurance Law Practice Guide, </em>\u00a7 43.15, at 43-23 (2015). These three elements have been recognized and applied in Maryland. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number><em>See Walk, </em>382 Md. at 16-17, 852 A.2d at 107 (\u201cThe [pjolicy requires that the underlying plaintiffs allege the potential for three things: (1) an \u2018advertisement\u2019; (2) an \u2018advertising injury,\u2019 ...; and (3) a causal relationship between the advertising injury and the alleged damages.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">The Causal Connection Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Insurers underscore the causal connection requirement. Citing <em>Walk, </em>they maintain that the Court of Special Appeals disregarded the requirement that there be a causal relationship between the advertising injury and the claimed damages and contend that RMG did not allege its damages were causally related to any Blackstone advertisement. For its part, Blackstone counters that the Court of Special Appeals considered the causal connection between advertisement and damages and properly concluded that it was subsumed in the Policy\u2019s definition of \u201cadvertising injury.\u201d It is helpful to preface our evaluation of these arguments with additional review of relevant authorities addressing advertising injury liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Advertising injury provisions are typically specified risk coverages whose terms \u201care designed to provide coverage for the enumerated claims only and not to provide generalized liability coverage.\u201d <em>Stempel </em>at 14-62.6. Thus, \u201c[t]o be covered, the claims made against the policy holder must arise from advertising activity. A highly attenuated connection to advertising is not sufficient to create coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14-62.7 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">To meet the causal connection requirement, \u201cthe advertising injury claimed must be \u2018caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising.\u2019 \u201d 3 <em>New Appleman Law of Liability Insurance, </em>\u00a7 17.02[2][c], at 17-15 (2d ed.2014). \u201cWhen there are no allegations that the claimant suffered damages as a result of advertising, there will be no advertising injury claim.\u201d <em>New Appleman Insurance Law Practice Guide, </em>\u00a7 43.18, at 43-29 (citation omitted). Although courts \u201chave not discussed the causation issue in terms of proximate cause versus \u2018but for\u2019 causation ... there are overtones of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>distinction in the caselaw.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201c[t]he question is not whether the injury could have taken place without the advertising, but whether the advertising did in fact contribute materially to the injury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Courts have addressed advertising injury\u2019s causal connection requirement in a variety of different circumstances and have helped to define the parameters of coverage. At times, courts have found coverage. <em>See, e.g., Am. Simmental Ass\u2019n v. Coregis Ins.

Despite our study of the cases presented by the parties and our extensive independent research, we have found no case that addressed a suit to collect a fee for creative services or enforce an alleged joint venture, like this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Although expressed in six counts, the crux of RMG\u2019s complaint is that Blackstone failed to accord RMG a share of profits or an equity interest in return for Gray\u2019s services as called for in an oral contract between them. As might be discerned from the above cases, this claim differs markedly from those that have been recognized as falling within advertising injury coverage. In <em>Bank of the West v. Superior Court,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the \u201cmodern watershed case construing advertising injury coverage,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the California Supreme Court observed that the causal connection requirement limits commercial general liability policies so that they do not encompass every claim related to an insured\u2019s business. This observation is instructive, and we agree with Insurers that the lack of causation is dispositive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>RMG plainly alleged that Gray and Black formed an oral contract \u2014 that they mutually promised to perform their ends of the bargain. One of the aims of the enterprise was for Blackstone to use Gray\u2019s work in its advertisements. Given this agreement, it cannot be fairly said that RMG suffered injury from the use of advertising materials Gray willingly delivered to Blackstone for that purpose. The wrong RMG alleged was Blackstone\u2019s failure to pay RMG a percentage of profits and give it an equity stake in the venture involving the sale of Blackstone\u2019s product. The fallacy in Blackstone\u2019s current claim against Insurers is that Blackstone\u2019s use of RMG\u2019s creative ideas could only enhance RMG\u2019s claims for profits or an equity share, not injure him.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><em>Novell, Inc. v. Federal Insurance Company, </em>141 F.3d 983 (10th Cir.1998) is another example of an injury caused by a breach of contract and not by an advertisement. In <em>Novell, Inc. </em>the underlying claim against Novell was based on claims by Ross, the designer of certain software, that Novell violated its oral and written representations to the plaintiff that Novell would not \u201cuse, appropriate, or usurp ideas or concepts [developed by Ross] or do anything to compete with Ross.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 985. The Tenth Circuit, applying Utah law, rejected Novell\u2019s claim of an advertising injury, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\">Here, Ross alleged Novell/WordPerfect, in direct violation of its own oral and written representations to Ross, misappropriated his product idea ... and developed and marketed a competing product.... Even if Novell/WordPerfect advertised or otherwise marketed [a competing product], the violations alleged by Ross were not the result of Novell/WordPerfect doing so. Rather, Ross was injured when Novel/WordPerfect created and sold a competing product in direct contravention of oral and written statements to him. The fact that it may have advertised the competing product to consumers simply did not cause Ross\u2019 injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 988 (omissions added); <em>see also Microtec Research Inc. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>40 F.3d 968, 971 (9th Cir.1994) (harm was \u201ccaused by misappropriation of the [computer] code, not by the advertising itself\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Courts have rejected other entreaties by insureds to extend comprehensive general liability coverage to breach of contract claims, because that would fundamentally alter the nature of the insurance relationship and effectively render the insurer a surety. <em>See Fallon McElligott, Inc. v. Seaboard Sur. Co., </em>607 N.W.2d 801, 804 (Minn.Ct.App.2000) (\u201cInsurer protection of contractual performance is provided by performance bonds, by errors-and-omissions policies, by insurer guarantees of indemnification agreements or debt repayment, and some other types of policies. But [the insured\u2019s] enumerated-risks <em>liability </em>policy ... was not such a policy.\u201d) (emphasis in original); <em>Structural Bldg. Prods. Corp. v. Bus. Ins. Agency, </em>281 A.D.2d 617, 619, 722 N.Y.S.2d 559, 562 (N.Y.App.Div.2001) (\u201cThe general rule is that a commercial general liability insurance policy does not afford coverage for breach of contract, but rather for bodily injury and property damage. To hold otherwise would render an insurance carrier a surety for the performance of its insured\u2019s work.\u201d (citation omitted)). Although \u2014 unlike this case \u2014 the underlying suit against the insured in <em>Fallon McElligott </em>claimed professional negligence in addition to breach of contract, we still consider this case apropos.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Blackstone cannot expand the scope of its Policy simply by pointing to its \u201carising from\u201d language. That language is intended to restrict, not expand, coverage. We find instructive the reasoning employed by the Minnesota Court of Appeals in <em>Fallon McElligott, Inc. v. Seaboard Surety Company, supra. </em>In that case, an advertising agency \u201cprepared for a client advertisements that copyright holders believed violated their copyrights.\u201d <em>Fallon McElligott, </em>607 N.W.2d at 802. When its client sued for breach of contract and professional negligence, the advertising agency tendered the defense to its insurer, which denied coverage on the ground that it was beyond the scope of coverage. <em>Id. </em>The agency\u2019s insurance policy provided that the insurer would defend any suit seeking damages \u201cresulting from ... any infringement of copyright or of title or of slogan.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 803. The agency settled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>claim and attempted to recover settlement and defense costs from its insurer. <em>Id. </em>at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">The court rejected the agency\u2019s arguments that the clause was implicated: \u201cBecause [the client\u2019s] underlying claim is grounded on [the agency\u2019s] failure to fulfill a contract obligation, it falls both outside the ... policy insuring clause and within the exclusion for \u2018failure of performance of contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 804. The court found unconvincing the insured\u2019s argument that the policy\u2019s \u201cresulting from\u201d language \u2014 similar to the \u201carising from\u201d language found in Blackstone\u2019s Policy\u2014 extended coverage to the claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">[The insured] claims that the insuring clause (which covers \u201cliability imposed upon\u201d the advertising agency for \u201cmoney damages resulting from * * * infringement of copyright\u201d) covers the [underlying] claim, arguing that the losses [its client] sought to recover through its claim of contract breach and professional negligence should be viewed as \u201cresulting from\u201d the copyright violation. [The insured] tries to accomplish too much with the two words \u201cresulting from.\u201d The policy might well have used: \u201carising from,\u201d \u201cfollowing upon,\u201d \u201cbecause of,\u201d or a myriad of other phrases to describe a relationship of causation. But no matter what phrase was used, the intent would not have been to cover losses based on a \u201cbut-for-the-insured\u2019s-conduct\u201d standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKd\"><em>Id. </em>at 804-05. Similar to the sentiments articulated by other courts discussed supra, the Minnesota Court of Appeals expressed concern that a liberal interpretation of the term \u201cresulting from\u201d could drastically expand the scope of coverage beyond what was intended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">Insurance-industry scriveners would bear an unrealistic burden if an occasional phrase could convert a liability policy into a totally different type of policy. The policy in this case is \u2014 notwithstanding the \u201cresulting from\u201d phrase\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>still an enumerated-perils policy providing protection against liability claims, rather than coverage for a failure to perform a contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">We agree with the Minnesota court. Advertising injury clauses do not extend to breach of contract claims, and the mere inclusion of the phrase \u201carising from\u201d in the Policy does not expand the scope to contract claims that happen to have a relationship with advertisement activity. To do so would transform insurers into sureties and subvert advertising injury coverage. Our view is consonant with the intermediate appellate court\u2019s reasoning that contract-based claims do not meet the causal connection requirement because \u201cthe claims remained viable even if Blackstone had never used the disputed advertising ideas to sell its products.\u201d <em>Blackstone, </em>216 Md. App. at 489, 88 A.3d at 803. Thus, we agree with the holding of the Court of Special Appeals that insurance coverage was not invoked by counts I, II, V, and VI.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">RMG\u2019s Unjust Enrichment Count</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">We part company with the Court of Special Appeals, though, in its analysis of RMG\u2019s unjust enrichment claim, which is the only count given credence by the intermediate court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In its decision to preserve Blackstone\u2019s insurance defense, it reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\">RMG\u2019s remaining unjust enrichment claim <em>did, </em>however, depend on Blackstone\u2019s use of RMG\u2019s advertising ideas. In that count, RMG alleged that Blackstone was unjustly enriched by retaining the benefit flowing from its use of RMG\u2019s ideas in advertisements for Blackstone\u2019s products. The complaint\u2019s count for unjust enrichment therefore bore a \u201cdirect and substantial\u201d relationship to the use of RMG\u2019s advertising ideas in Blackstone\u2019s advertisements, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>making that claim an \u201cadvertising injury\u201d under the parties\u2019 insurance agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 489-90, 88 A.3d at 803 (internal citation omitted) (emphasis added). We disagree because we see the same causation problem for the unjust enrichment count as we identified for the other counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Count III recites: \u201c[RMG] conferred [a litany of] benefits upon Blackstone, with whom it had a confidential relationship.\u201d This count includes the same nucleus of factual allegations as was discussed <em>supra: </em>RMG\u2019s development of the brand name; creation of copy and graphics for sales sheets; development of packaging and marketing materials; and placement of a full page advertisement in an industry journal. The facts alleged merely reiterate those set forth in the Second Amended Complaint: Gray, on behalf of RMG, did creative work for Blackstone and did not receive the promised dividends.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">We have described the core principle of unjust enrichment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">A person who receives a benefit by reason of an infringement of another person\u2019s interest, or of loss suffered by the other, owes restitution to him in the manner and amount necessary to prevent unjust enrichment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-8\"><em>Berry &amp; Gould, P.A. v.

It is not based on intention or consent of the parties, but is founded on considerations of justice and equity, and on doctrine of unjust enrichment. It is not in fact a contract, but an obligation which the law creates in absence of any agreement, when and because the acts of the parties or others have placed in the possession of one person money, or its equivalent, under such circumstances that in equity and good conscience he ought not to retain it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-5\"><em>Cnty.

Dobbs, <em>Law of Remedies </em>(2d Ed.1993) (\u201cDobbs\u201d), which declared restitution to be a \u201c \u2018simple word but a difficult subject, partly because restitutionary ideas appear in many guises.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alternatives, </em>155 Md.App. at 455, 843 A.2d at 275 (emphasis added) (quoting Dobbs at 551-52). The treatise described the evolution of unjust enrichment claims, and how they \u201c \u2018went under a splendid variety of names like Money Had and Received, Money Paid, Money Lent, Quantum Meruit and many others,\u2019 \u201d but \u201c \u2018are now perceived to be merely subsets of restitution. The modern view is that unjust enrichment is a unifying principle for all such cases and restitution is the award made to ... those that used to be brought in equity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454, 843 A.2d at 275 (emphasis and omission added) (quoting Dobbs at 564).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>This bit of history regarding unjust enrichment confirms our sense that unjust enrichment is both elemental and elusive. Nevertheless, we can see clearly that the unjust enrichment claim asserted against Blackstone does not qualify as a suit invoking the \u201cAdvertising Injury Liability\u201d under the Policy. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">The allegations and cause of action in Count III are duplicative of RMG\u2019s Counts I and II \u2014 its breach of contract and promissory estoppel claims. As in those counts, the facts alleged clearly reveal that RMG was not injured by the advertisements Blackstone published. RMG was allegedly injured by Blackstone\u2019s refusal to pay to RMG its share of the fruits of that advertising, <em>i.e. </em>profits. But the profits from the sale of Blackstone\u2019s product were <em>enhanced </em>by the advertising which was the subject of RMG\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Styling this count as \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d does not transform the nature of the injury. The measure of damages in an unjust enrichment claim is the value of the goods or services rendered by the plaintiff in the hands of the defendant. <em>See Mogavero v. Silverstein, </em>142 Md.App. 259, 276, 790 A.2d 43, 53 (2002) (\u201cThus, the classic measurement of unjust enrichment damages is the gain to the defendant, not the loss by the plaintiff.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). This is the same measurement of damages that would apply in RMG\u2019s claims for breach of contract and promissory estoppel, which averred entitlement to a share of profits and an equity share in the joint venture, both of which were only enhanced by the advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">In sum, in all of the counts alleged by RMG, the advertising done by Blackstone using Gray\u2019s ideas was all for the positive \u2014 it enhanced the value of the profits and joint venture interest to which RMG claimed entitlement. The advertising, even though utilizing Gray\u2019s ideas, did not injure RMG. Unlike the majority of cases finding an advertising injury, it had no competing business. See, <em>e.g., Letro Prods., Inc. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>114 F.3d 1194 (9th Cir.1997) (advertising injury clause implicated when insured infringed upon competitor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>products when using photographs of competitor\u2019s products in its promotional materials) and other cases cited, <em>supra. </em>Nor did it claim that it could profit from a different use of those advertising ideas, which were specifically designed for Blackstone\u2019s product, \u201cVision Enhance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">In conclusion, after reviewing the coverage and defenses under the Policy and the allegations in the underlying action, we hold that there was no potentiality of coverage. Blackstone did not show an advertising injury because none of the allegations of the underlying suit brought by RMG identified any injury that was caused by the advertisements created by RMG. Thus, Insurer had no duty to defend its insured. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.

Relying on this same case law, we conclude that the issue of whether product packaging constitutes advertisement is immaterial to our decision. Because the three requirements to determine whether a policy will provide coverage are conjunctive, absence of a causal connection is dispositive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b733-5\">. 2 Cal.4th 1254, 10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 560, 833 P.2d 545, 553 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b733-6\">.

The Majority Opinion appears to assume, but not address, that product packaging can constitute \u201cadvertising\u201d within the meaning of the Policy, and instead focuses on the \u201ccausal connection\u201d requirement as determinative. I would hold that product packaging constitutes \u201cadvertising\u201d as that term is defined in the insurance policy; and the issues as to policy exclusions were not preserved for appellate review. As such, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">Insurers contend that the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding that a product\u2019s packaging was an \u201cadvertisement.\u201d According to Insurers, in interpreting the terms of the Policy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>the Court of Special Appeals improperly substituted its own definition of relevant terms in place of the unambiguous definitions within the Policy. Blackstone responds that the Court of Special Appeals was correct in holding that a product\u2019s packaging fits within the Policy\u2019s definition of \u201cadvertisement!;,]\u201d and argues that nothing within the Policy\u2019s definition of \u201cadvertisement\u201d excludes a product\u2019s packaging or a product\u2019s display from being an \u201cadvertisement.\u201d In Blackstone\u2019s view, the Policy\u2019s definition of \u201cadvertisement\u201d focuses on the act of broadcasting or publishing to the general public. I agree with Blackstone.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">In determining whether an insurer has a duty to defend an insured, the Court must engage in a two-part inquiry: \u201c(1) what is the coverage and what are the defenses under the terms and requirements of the insurance policy? (2) do the allegations in the tort action [underlying action] potentially bring the tort claim within the policy\u2019s coverage?\u201d <em>Walk v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., </em>382 Md. 1, 15, 852 A.2d 98, 106 (2004) (citations omitted) (brackets in original). Thus, I would begin the analysis with the scope of coverage under the relevant terms and provisions of the Policy. <em>See id. </em>at 15, 852 A.2d at 106. The \u201cpersonal and advertising injury\u201d provision of the Policy provides, in pertinent part: \u201c[Insurers] will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018personal and advertising injury\u2019 to which this insurance applies. [Insurers] will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking those damages.\u201d The Policy defines \u201cadvertisement\u201d as \u201ca notice that is broadcast or published to the general public or specific market segments about your goods, products or services for the purpose of attracting customers or supporters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">In the complaint, RMG alleged that Blackstone sold the \u201cVision Enhance\u201d product to Wal-Mart, which resold the product under its \u201cMainstays\u201d label. According to RMG, \u201csome of the \u2018Mainstays\u2019 low vision lighting products actually include[d] the use of the \u2018Vision Enhance\u2019 name on the boxes, and use the same or substantially similar box design, copy on the box, and product instructions that are identical to the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>\u2018Vision Enhance\u2019 product, that was created in substantial part by ... RMG.\u201d From my perspective, the initial inquiry is whether a product\u2019s packaging falls within the scope the Policy\u2019s definition of \u201cadvertisement.\u201d I would hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">In examining the Policy\u2019s definition of \u201cadvertisement,\u201d I note that the terms used \u2014 specifically, \u201cnotice,\u201d \u201cbroadcast\u201d and \u201cpublished\u201d \u2014 are exceptionally broad and are not defined within the Policy. Impliedly, Insurers assert that \u201cbroadcast\u201d and \u201cpublished\u201d should be strictly construed to encompass only traditional marketing mediums, such as television, magazines, and internet.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Such a constricting definition is not supported by the plain and common use of the terms. Indeed, \u201cbroadcast\u201d means \u201cto make widely known,\u201d Broadcast, Merriam-Webster, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ broadcast, and \u201cpublish\u201d means \u201cto make generally known\u201d or \u201cto disseminate to the public,\u201d Publish, Merriam-Webster, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/publish. Under these broad definitions, it can fairly be said that a product\u2019s packaging \u201cdisseminates\u201d or \u201cmakes known\u201d to the public information about a product or good.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Having determined that product packaging falls within the Policy\u2019s definitional scope of \u201cadvertisement,\u201d I would next consider whether RMG\u2019s allegations trigger coverage under the Policy. <em>See Walk, </em>382 Md. at 15, 852 A.2d at 106. \u201cEven if a tort plaintiff does not allege facts which clearly bring the claim within or without the policy coverage, the insurer still must defend if there is a <em>potentiality </em>that the claim could be covered by the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16, 852 A.2d at 106 (emphasis in original). This inquiry, of necessity, involves consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>whether the allegations of RMG\u2019s complaint demonstrate that RMG claimed an \u201cadvertising injury\u201d as that term is defined in the Policy. <em>See id. </em>at 16, 852 A.2d at 107 (\u201cUnder the terms of the Policy, [insurer] had a duty to defend [insured] only if the [underlying] complaint and the extrinsic evidence claim an \u2018advertising injury.\u2019 \u201d). Here, in agreement with the Court of Special Appeals, I would conclude that RMG\u2019s allegations of unjust enrichment, which specifically refer to the \u201cVision Enhance\u201d name, box design, copy, and product instructions, sufficiently alleged an \u201cadvertising injury\u201d and thus could potentially be covered under the Policy; thus, I would resolve the duty to defend in Blackstone\u2019s favor. I explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">In the complaint, in the claim for unjust enrichment, RMG alleged that Blackstone was unjustly enriched because it \u201ccontinues to retain the benefit conferred upon it by Plaintiff through, in part, its use of concepts, expert evaluations, \u2018Vision Enhance\u2019 brand name and packaging, all of which were developed by Plaintiff or with Plaintiff\u2019s assistance.\u201d (Emphasis added). Under the clear terms of the Policy, an \u201cadvertising injury\u201d \u201cmeans injury ... arising out of one or more of the following offenses: ... [t]he use of another\u2019s advertising idea in your \u2018advertisement\u2019; or [i]nfringing upon another\u2019s copyright, trade dress or slogan in your \u2018advertisement\u2019.\u201d (Paragraph breaks omitted). In my view, RMG\u2019s unjust enrichment claim alleged that it was injured by Blackstone\u2019s use of RMG\u2019s ideas in advertisements for Blackstone\u2019s product, thus bringing it within the definition of \u201cadvertising injury\u201d under the terms of the Policy. In other words, the unjust enrichment claim did, indeed, allege an advertising injury resulting from Blackstone\u2019s use of RMG\u2019s advertising ideas in its advertisements. Having determined that the coverage and requirements of the Policy include a product\u2019s packaging as advertising and that the allegations of RMG\u2019s complaint potentially brings the claim for unjust enrichment within the Policy\u2019s coverage, I would conclude that Insurers had a duty to defend.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>The Majority also does not address the issues of preservation and waiver. Blackstone asserts that Insurers waived all defenses, including Policy exclusions, that it did not raise in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Maryland Rule 8 \u2014 131(a) provides, in pertinent part: \u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court[.]\u201d Appellate review of a grant of summary judgment must be \u201cconfined to the basis relied on by the trial court.\u201d <em>Sadler v. Dimensions Healthcare Corp., </em>378 Md. 509, 536, 836 A.2d 655, 671 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>At bottom, Insurers contend that they did not have a duty to defend Blackstone against RMG\u2019s suit. To support this position, Insurers, both in their pleadings and during the hearing on the motion for summary judgment before the circuit court, relied exclusively on the argument that RMG\u2019s claims did not fall within the scope of an \u201cadvertising injury\u201d as defined under the Policy. Indeed, in a statement of undisputed facts, Insurers emphasized that, in addressing \u201cwhether coverage exists under the insuring agreement of the policy!, they have] not relied on the breach of contract exclusion.\u201d Moreover, during his argument before the circuit court, Insurers\u2019 counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-4\">Pit\u2019s clear on the face of [RMG\u2019s] second amended complaint that the allegations don\u2019t come within the [P]olicy[\u2019s] coverage!]. But even if Blackstone could get over that hurdle, then we do look down to the ... exclusions. And there are two relevant exclusions in this case.... [A]nd there\u2019s a very clear reason why [Insurers] didn\u2019t put [the exclusions] in the litigation at this point.... If we go down to the exclusion, it becomes [the Insurers\u2019] burden [of proof]. It makes it harder to deal with on summary judgment!,] and so we decided not to include it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The Court of Special Appeals held that Insurers affirmatively \u201cwaived\u201d an exclusion-based defense to the denial of coverage that was not raised or addressed in filings or at the hearing. <em>See Blackstone Int\u2019l Ltd. v. Md. Cas. Co., </em>216 Md.App. 471, 486, 88 A.3d 792, 801 (2014). I agree with this characterization of Insurers\u2019 procedural posture before the circuit court, and would conclude that the issue of an exclusion-based defense to the denial of coverage was not raised or addressed by Insurers in the circuit court such that they could raise the issue on appeal. <em>See </em>Md. R. 8-131(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>For the above reasons, respectfully, I dissent and would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Judge BATTAGLIA has authorized me to state that she joins in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-7\">. It should be noted that Insurers do not contend that a product\u2019s packaging is not a \u201cnotice\u201d within the scope of \"advertisement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b744-8\">. Insurers cite numerous cases from other jurisdictions to support its position that a product\u2019s packaging cannot constitute \"advertising.\u201d Insurers\u2019 reliance on these cases is misplaced, as the other jurisdictions\u2019 courts held that a product itself, not a product\u2019s packaging, cannot be considered \"advertising.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Krueger Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>647 F.Supp.2d 1024, 1035 (E.D.Wis.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b745-5\">. The Majority relies on language from <em>Walk, </em>382 Md. at 17, 852 A.2d at 107, for the proposition that three requirements must be satisfied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>constitute an advertising injury: \"The policy requires that the underlying plaintiffs allege the potential for three things: (1) an 'advertisement\u2019; (2) an 'advertising injury,' which entails the copying of an advertising idea or style into an advertisement; and (3) a causal relationship between the advertising injury and the alleged damages.\u201d Significantly, in <em>Walk, id. </em>at 17, 852 A.2d at 107, the three requirements were specifically limited to the insurance policy at issue. Moreover, in <em>Walk, </em>the only discussion of a causal relationship is in the above-quoted language. In <em>Walk, </em>the large part of the analysis concerned only whether the insured demonstrated that the underlying complaint alleged an advertising injury, and concluded that the insured did not show the allegation of an advertising injury either in the complaint or through extrinsic evidence; i.e., additional discussion of a causal relationship is not included in the case and the causal relationship prong is not applied. <em>See id. </em>at 17-24, 852 A.2d at 107-11. And, aside from <em>Walk, </em>the Majority relies on no other Maryland case discussing or applying the causal relationship requirement, and instead cites to cases from other jurisdictions as well as a treatise. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 698-702, 114 A.3d at 684-85. In my view, Maryland case law requires only that a court engage in the two-part inquiry set forth above \u2014 (1) what is the coverage and defenses under the terms and requirements of the policy and (2) do the allegations of the underlying complaint potentially bring the claim within the policy\u2019s coverage. Thus, examining solely whether a causal connection exists is not consistent with Maryland case law. In any event, in this case, I agree with the Court of Special Appeals that determination of whether an \"advertising injury\u201d was alleged in RMG's complaint subsumes the discussion of causation. <em>See Blackstone Int'l Ltd. v. Md. Cas. Co., </em>216 Md.App. 471, 481 n. 6, 88 A.3d 792, 798 n. 6 (2014). By the terms of the Policy, a determination that an advertising injury was alleged necessarily involves a causation analysis and the determination that the injury alleged \"arise[s] out of one or more of the following offenses: ... [t]he use of another\u2019s advertising idea in your 'advertisement' \u201d; <em>i.e., </em>one must determine that RMG's claims \"arise[ ] out of\u201d the use of RMG\u2019s advertising ideas in Blackstone\u2019s advertisements, a causation analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b747-6\">. Although the Majority asserts that it does not rely on the provision of the Policy excluding breach of contract actions from coverage as an \u201cadvertising injury,\u201d <em>see </em>Maj. Op. at 698 n. 10, 114 A.3d at 683 n. 10, the Majority discusses breach of contract actions exclusions and concludes that \u201cLa]dvertising injury clauses do not extend to breach of contract claims, and the mere inclusion of the phrase 'arising from' in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>the Policy does not expand the scope to contract claims that happen to have a relationship with advertisement activity[,]\u201d Maj.

Op. at 708-09, 114 A.3d at 689-70. Thus, in my view, whether Insurers waived or failed to preserve the Policy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>exclusions, including the breach of contract actions exclusion, should have been addressed on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
