SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b869-18\">Plaintiffs-appellants challenge the coupon allotment system established by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to implement the directive of the Food Stamp Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2011 \u2014 2025, that food stamp recipients be given \u201can opportunity to obtain a nutritionally adequate diet * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2013(a). <em>See also id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2011, 2014(a), 2016(a). We find that the Secretary of Agriculture violated the procedural requirements of Section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1970), in promulgating the coupon allotment system, that the system is therefore void as promulgated, and that the case must be remanded to the Secretary for new proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b869-21\">The Food Stamp Act (the Act) was first passed in 1964. Its purposes were to distribute the agriculture surplus of this nation in a beneficial manner, to safeguard the health and well-being of our citizens, and to raise the level of nutrition among low-income households. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011 (1964). The Act allows eligible recipients to purchase food stamps (coupons) at prices significantly below their face value. The stamps, in turn, may be used at face value to purchase food at certain retail stores. The cost of the coupons for each household is variable; the Act directs that it \u201cshall represent a reasonable investment on the part of the household, but in no event more than 30 per centum of the household\u2019s income * * *.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2016(b). The original Act directed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Secretary of Agriculture (the Secretary) to administer the program so that \u201celigible households * * * shall be provided with an opportunity <em>more nearly </em>to obtain a nutritionally adequate diet through the issuance to them of a coupon allotment * * *.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2013(a) (1964) (emphasis added). In 1971, however, the Act was amended and this language was significantly altered. The italicized words \u201cmore nearly\u201d were deleted from the Act, so that the Secretary\u2019s duty became to provide food stamp recipients \u201cwith an opportunity to obtain a nutritionally adequate diet * * 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2013(a). <em>See also id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2011, 2014(a), 2016(a). Essentially, it is the effect of this change that is here at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Following the 1971 amendments, the Secretary published notice of a proposed rule-making, 36 Fed.Reg. 7240 (1971), inviting comments from interested parties. New regulations, all dealing with the administration of the program, not with the size of the coupon allotments, were issued on July 29, 1971. <em>Id. </em>at 14102-14117. New coupon allotments were issued on April 16 and 17, <em>id. </em>at 7273, 7320 \u2014 7321, and reissued in slightly revised form on July 29, 1971. <em>Id. </em>at 14118 \u2014 14120. The coupon allotment system was based on the cost to a hypothetical family of four<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the so-called Economy Food Plan, the least costly of five \u201cfamily food plans\u201d developed by USD A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The allotment for this hypothetical family was $108 per month, with allotments ranging from $32 per month for a family of one person to $180 per month for a family of eight persons. For each person over eight $16 was added to the monthly allotment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 14118. The allotments thus reflected the economies of scale that would benefit larger households.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">Plaintiffs-appellants began this litigation in December 1971, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief because of the Secretary\u2019s alleged violations of the Food Stamp Act. The individual appellants are members of nine low-income households, all of which receive food stamps. They sue on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated. The other appellants are the City of New York, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the National Welfare Rights Organization and its affiliates. In District Court appellants charged the Secretary was violating the Act in two ways:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (1) the Secretary\u2019s Economy Food Plan allegedly did not provide a nutritionally adequate diet and so its use violated the Act; and (2) the allotment system, because it was based on an average family and on average food prices and preferences, and because it did not continually reflect the current cost of food, did not provide all food stamp recipients with the opportunity to purchase even the Economy Food Plan. Complaint, UH 6 &amp; 9, App. 9a \u2014 11a. In addition, appellants sought a preliminary injunction to prevent implementation of the new coupon allotments because they raised the cost of the coupons significantly, increasing the burden on low-income families. This request for preliminary relief was withdrawn when USDA rolled back its price increases on January 26, 1972. 37 Fed.Reg. 1180.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>On April 7, 1972 USDA submitted, with supporting documents, a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. App. 113a. The District Court granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on July 7, 1972, holding that the Secretary\u2019s price rollback had mooted the controversy. App. 251a\u2014 252a. On appeal, this court reversed the District Court and remanded the case for further proceedings. Rodway v. United States Department of Agriculture, 157 U.S.App.D.C. 133, 482 F.2d 722 (1973). We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-5\">.While the rollback in the price increases for stamps removed this cause of complaint and rendered this issue moot, it did not alter or render moot the more substantial claim that the allotment levels established by USDA failed to satisfy the requirements of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">157 U.S.App.D.C. at 137, 482 F.2d at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">On remand, the District Court sought to narrow the issues so as to permit a final adjudication. Thereupon, appellants submitted a motion for partial summary judgment, App. 273a, accompanied by a statement of material facts not in dispute, App. 276a \u2014 292a, and a statement of genuine issues, App. 293a \u2014 298a. USDA filed a supplemental memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment. App. 299a \u2014 301a. Without hearing oral argument, the District Court, on December 12, 1973, granted USDA\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied appellants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment. Rodway v. United States Department of Agriculture, D.D.C., 369 F.Supp. 1094 (1973). Appellants again appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">At oral argument it became apparent that the Secretary\u2019s compliance with the procedural requirements of the APA in promulgating the allotment regulations was a substantial issue in this case, although it had not been raised in the District Court or in the prior appeal to this court. On their face the regulations had seemingly been promulgated without notice, solicitation of comments, or issuance of a basis and purpose statement. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553. Accordingly, we ordered the parties to respond in writing to a list of questions probing the consequences of this apparent omission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Now the parties have provided their answers. We find that the Secretary has indeed failed to comply with the requirements of the APA, and that the failure is fatal to the asserted validity of the allotment regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b871-13\">All parties agree that the APA would not, by its own terms, govern the issuance of the allotment regulations. Expressly exempted from the procedural requirements of Section 4 are any matters \u201crelating to * * * public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(a)(2). The food stamp program would appear to be a matter relating to public \u201cgrants\u201d or \u201cbenefits,\u201d thereby exempting rules relating to the program from the APA. <em>See </em>Rodriguez v. Swank, N.D.Ill, 318 F.Supp. 289 (1970), affirmed, 403 U.S. 901, 91 S.Ct. 2202, 29 L.Ed.2d 677 (1971) (A.F.D.C. benefits excluded). <em>See generally </em>Bonfield, Public Participation in Federal Rulemaking Relating to Public Property, Loans, Grants, Benefits, or Contracts, 118 U.Pa.L.Rev. 540 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>On July 24, 1971, however, as a result of a recommendation of the Administrative Conference of the United States, USDA promulgated a regulation making the procedural requirements of Section 4 of the APA applicable to all of its rule-making relating to \u201cpublic property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts.\u201d The regulation was effective immediately. 36 Fed.Reg. 13804. It is, of course, well settled that validly issued administrative regulations have the force and effect of law. <em>See, e. g., </em>Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 235, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974); Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U.S. 535, 539-540, 79 S.Ct. 968, 3 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1959); Service v. Dulles, 354 U.S. 363, 388, 77 S.Ct. 1152, 1 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1957). Thus the regulation fully bound the Secretary to comply thereafter with the procedural demands of the APA. The allotment regulations here at issue were promulgated five days later, on July 29, 1971. 36 Fed.Reg. 14118-14120.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">USDA does not argue that it was not bound by the regulation of July 24, 1971,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but rather suggests that it has indeed complied fully with the APA in its promulgation of the allotment procedures. However, even a superficial examination of the challenged regulations and USDA\u2019s purported manner of compliance shows this to be untrue. The APA requires an agency to provide the public with notice of proposed rules, an opportunity to comment upon them, and \u201ca concise general statement of their basis and purpose\u201d that justifies the rules in light of the comments received. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553. In promulgating its allotment regulations, USDA followed none of these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">To show its compliance with the APA, USDA points to the procedures surrounding its adoption of various rules for the administration of the food stamp program. For these rules, there was notice soliciting comments published on April 16, 1971, 36 Fed.Reg. 7240, final rules incorporating changes suggested by comments received published on July 29, 1971, <em>id. </em>at 14102-14117, and a subsequent analysis of the comments received published on October 16, 1971, <em>id. </em>at 20145 \u2014 20148. Nonetheless, the answer to USDA\u2019s argument is short: however procedurally proper the adoption of these rules, they did not concern in any way the allotment regulations that are the subject of this lawsuit. The proposed rule-making dealt with a vast number of rules necessary for administration of the program. Proposed rules outlined the participation of state agencies, individual households, wholesale and retail food stores, and banks. Plans were proposed for emergency food assistance for disaster victims, and procedures were outlined for adminstrative and judicial review of USDA actions. But of the basic ingredient of the program, the allotments system, there was not a word. <em>See </em>36 Fed. Reg. 7240-7254. Admittedly, the notice was framed broadly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-11\">Notice is hereby given that the [USDA] intends to revise the regulations governing the operation of the Food Stamp Program for the purpose of incorporating the applicable provisions of [the 1971 amendments].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b872-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 7240. The provisions that followed, however, were only the proposed administrative regulations described above. Such notice is insufficient to include the allotment system by inference. Section 4 of the APA is clear in its demands: the notice must include \u201ceither the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3). The nptice appearing at 36 Fed.Reg. 7240 does not meet this requirement so far as the allotment system is concerned.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>USDA essentially admits as much by arguing in the alternative that notice was unnecessary because the legislative history of the 1971 amendments makes clear that Congress knew the Secretary would use the Economy Food Plan and family of four averaging system. ' Thus</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-5\">[i]t is clear that all interested persons were on actual notice, without the formal issuance of a Notice <em>in haec verba, </em>of the Secretary\u2019s intention in this regard. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">USDA Supplemental Memorandum at 4. While 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b) does exempt from the formal notice requirement situations where \u201cpersons subject [to the proposed regulations] are named and either personally served or otherwise have actual notice thereof in accordance with law,\u201d the exception plainly does not apply to this case. Appellants, of course, were named nowhere. Moreover, they did not have actual notice. Even if the legislative history fully supported the Secretary\u2019s view of the law, it cannot seriously be asserted that the congressional debates provided more than constructive notice to appellants. Only publication in the <em>Federal Register </em>meets the APA requirement of constructive notice. If the notice requirement of the APA could be avoided by reference to inferential discussions obscurely placed throughout various federal publications, much of the salutory purpose of the procedural rule-making requirements of the APA would be vitiated. Absent actual notice, the public should be held accountable only for notice plainly set forth in the <em>Federal Register. </em>By this standard, USDA\u2019s asserted notice must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">Having failed to comply with the first procedural requirement of informal rule-making, USDA in due course failed to comply with the other two. Since there was no notice, there was no solicitation of comments. Unremarkably, no comments on the allotment regulations were received. And, when the revised allotment figures were promulgated on July 29, 1971, they were accompanied by no basis and purpose statement. 36 Fed. Reg. 14118-14120. USDA relies on the analysis that finally was produced for those administrative regulations that were a product of orderly rule-making. But that analysis dealt, again unremark-ably, only with the comments received concerning those regulations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See </em>36 Fed.Reg. 20145 \u2014 20148. Thus, as for the allotment regulations, the APA procedures were ignored from start to finish.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number> While not conceding the invalidity of its procedures, USDA argues that we may look beyond the administrative record (or nonrecord) to find the justification for its allotment regulations. Specifically the Department suggests that the affidavits of two USDA officials offered to the District Court in this litigation may provide the equivalent of a basis and purpose statement. Without passing on whether the affidavits contain sufficient explanation to pass muster as a basis and purpose statement,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we find them inadequate for two more fundamental reasons. First, courts have traditionally looked with hostility upon explanations of agency officials submitted in affidavit form during the course of litigation. These <em>\u201cpost hoc </em>rationalizations\u201d are typically found to be an inadequate basis for review. Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 419, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971); Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168-169, 83 S.Ct. 239, 9 L.Ed.2d 207 (1962); SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 87, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943). Appellees rely on two cases where exceptions to this general rule were made. These cases, however, only show why an exception would be inappropriate in this case and bring us to the second reason for refusing to accept the affidavits as a substitute basis and purpose statement. In Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, <em>supra, </em>the Supreme Court did recognize the possibility that the District Court could require the Secretary of Transportation to explain in court his reasons for approving the routing of a highway through a city park. But in <em>Overton Park </em>there was a full administrative record; only the Secretary\u2019s explanation was lacking.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In Aguayo v. Richardson, 2 Cir., 473 F.2d 1090, 1103 (1973), the procedural requirements of the APA did not apply, so no administrative record was available. The Second Circuit was forced to make do with the inferences from the papers on which the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare had acted and with \u201cthe largely unhelpful documents prepared specifically for this litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Here, unlike <em>Overton Park, </em>there is no full administrative record on which to base review, but, unlike <em>Aguayo, </em>an administrative record is required. Thus we see no reason to depart from the well settled rule that litigation affidavits are an unacceptable basis for appellate review of agency decision-making.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">The absence of an administrative record has significance apart from the doubt it casts upon after-the-fact explanations. Even if the proffered affidavits did provide an acceptable explanation of the Secretary\u2019s decision, it would be an explanation of a decision reached without the comments of interested parties. Not only would appellants\u2019 com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>ments have been ignored, but the comments of those who might have responded to a general published notice would have been bypassed as well. The basis and purpose statement is not intended to be an abstract explanation addressed to imaginary complaints. Rather, its purpose is, at least in part, to respond in a reasoned manner to the comments received, to explain how the agency resolved any significant problems raised by the comments, and to show how that resolution led the agency to the ultimate rule.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, 143 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 444 F.2d 841 (1970), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2229, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971); Portland Cement Assn v. Ruckelshaus, 158 U.S.App.D.C. 308, 486 F.2d 375 (1973). The basis and purpose statement is inextricably intertwined with the receipt of comments. Thus we think the Secretary\u2019s failure to solicit comments on his allotment regulations is, by itself, fatal to their validity. His present explanations cannot address comments never received. Moreover, the absence of comments makes the appellate function impossible. The APA requires the reviewing court to \u201creview the whole record\u201d in measuring the validity of agency action. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (1970). The whole record in an informal rule-making case is comprised of comments received, hearings held, if any, and the basis and purpose statement. In this case, there is plainly no whole record to review and the District Court could not perform its appellate function.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">In sum, the- Secretary failed to comply with the procedural command of the APA in promulgating allotment regulations for the food stamp program. This failure cannot be cured by litigation affidavits because, as <em>post hoc </em>rationalizations, they are unacceptable substitutes for a contemporaneous basis and purpose statement and because they do not provide a \u201cwhole record\u201d to review. Accordingly, we find the regulations are invalid as promulgated.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This case must be reversed and remanded to the District Court, which in turn must return it to the Secretary for a rule-making proceeding in compliance with the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">In so holding, however, we are mindful of the critical importance of the allotment regulations to the functioning of the entire food stamp system, on which over ten million American families are now dependent to supplement their food budgets. Thus we do not order the regulations vacated pending the rule-making proceedings. Rather, they must continue in effect, and the Secretary must continue to make the cost-of-living adjustments mandated by the Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2016(a), until validly promulgated regulations can take their place. However, we think that transition should occur with expedition. In matters as vital as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>basic nutrition there is no excuse for delay, especially when this litigation has already dragged on for over three years. Accordingly, we order the Secretary to complete the new rule-making process within 120 days of the issuance of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Since this case must be remanded for a new rule-making proceeding, we have no occasion to address the substantive validity of the present regulations. Whether the Economy Food Plan provides the basis for a nutritionally adequate diet is plainly a factual question within the Secretary\u2019s expertise. While we can review his ultimate determination to see whether it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law * *,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(1)(A), we can offer him no guidance at this point in making that initial determination.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On the other hand, appellants\u2019 second claim \u2014 that the Secretary\u2019s allotment system, including use of the hypothetical family of four, is invalid because it does not provide all recipients with the opportunity to purchase a nutritionally adequate diet\u2014 presents mixed questions of fact and law. We think it will help expedite the administrative process to address the questions of law at this time. Those questions are assuredly before us, having been properly brought to the District Court, decided there, and now brought to this court by appellants. And resolution of this issue now will provide substantial guidance to the Secretary as he attempts to formulate new regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">Once the Secretary determines what constitutes a nutritionally adequate diet, the Economy Food Plan or something else, any distribution mechanism must necessarily comport with the demands of the Act. We think it plain that the Food Stamp Act requires the Secretary to distribute the food stamp coupons in such a way that all, or at least virtually all, recipients are given the \u201copportunity to obtain a nutritionally adequate diet * * *.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2013(a). We reach this conclusion from the face of the statute itself, and from its legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">The statute offers no suggestion that any distribution system that offered significant numbers of recipients less than that necessary to purchase a nutritionally adequate diet would be acceptable. Congress found substantial malnutrition in America and sought to alleviate it. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011. The food stamp program was designed to permit \u201clow-income households to purchase a nutritionally adequate diet through normal channels of trade.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That the program would offer recipients this opportunity is repeated again and again throughout the Act. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2013(a), 2014(a), 2016(a). We find no suggestion on the face of the Act, or any reason to impute one, that the opportunity is not to be offered to <em>all </em>eligible recipients.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">This conclusion is bolstered by reference to the legislative history. Most sig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>nificant is the change, mentioned earlier, from the promise of the 1964 Act, \u201can opportunity <em>more nearly </em>to obtain a nutritionally adequate diet\u201d to that of the 1971 amendments, \u201can opportunity to obtain a nutritionally adequate diet.\u201d At the same time, the purpose of the Act was changed from \u201craising levels of nutrition\u201d to enabling eligible households \u201cto purchase a nutritionally adequate diet.\u201d <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 91 \u2014 1402, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., 14 (1970), 1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 6025. The changes were the result of an Administration proposal. <em>See </em>115 Cong.Rec. 11669 (1969) (President\u2019s message). In support of the changes, then Secretary of Agriculture Hardin testified before a House committee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-5\">In short, we are proposing that the food stamp program be revised so that stamp purchase requirements are realistic \u2014 so that they encourage the poor to purchase a nutritious diet rather than discourage their participation in this program. Under the present law, the food stamp program is designed only to help participants improve their diet. <em>There is no assurance that a participating family can meet its minimum nutritional needs.

In explaining to the Senate why the conferees had settled on the House version, Senator Miller made it quite clear that a nutritious diet for all recipients was intended, no matter what the cost:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-14\">The conference report contains the language of the House bill, which is simply that an adequate and nutritious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>diet will be provided for. It so happens that the way the Department of Agriculture is administering this program today, an adequate and nutritious diet for ' a family of four is deemed to cost around $106 a month. But, as the House conferees pointed out, <em>they did not care whether it cost $50, $100, or $150; whatever it cost must provide for an adequate and nutritious diet. </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-4\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-5\">I attempted to get the two sides together by suggesting that we split the difference [between the House and Senate versions] and go to about $121 as our starting point, and I thought at one time that the House conferees were going to agree, but finally they refused to agree, and <em>they said the adequate and nutritious diet provision in their bill meant exactly what it said, nothing more and nothing less, </em>and refused to budge on it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">116 Cong.Rec. 44440-44441 (1970) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">We are thus convinced by the language of the statute and by the legislative history that the 1971 amendments marked a major shift in the policy of the Food Stamp Act, a shift from supplementing the diets of low-income households to <em>guaranteeing </em>those households the opportunity for an adequate diet. Congress plainly intended the 1971 amendments to assure that no eligible family need go malnourished; the Government would provide all the opportunity to be healthfully fed. Manifestly, that congressional intent is frustrated if the food stamp program is administered in such a way that a substantial number of eligible households do not receive sufficient coupons to purchase what the Secretary determines to be a nutritionally adequate diet.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> For a family that needs a loaf of bread, the offer of a slice is poor comfort. We think such an administrative system would violate the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-14\">While we have no need to determine whether the present administrative system, based on the cost of a nutritionally adequate diet for a hypothetical family of four, complies with the Act,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we shall outline the showing necessary to support such a system.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> At oral argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>USD A conceded that the present system results in the individual appellants receiving substantially less than that necessary for them to purchase even the Economy Food Plan.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In part this is so because, by USDA\u2019s own figures, the cost (and composition) of a nutritionally adequate diet varies according to an individual\u2019s age and sex.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The allotment regulations, however, do not consider age <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>and sex at all. Rather they calculate the cost of the Plan for a family composed of two adults, ages 20 \u2014 35, one child, age 6-9, and one boy, age 9 \u2014 12. Deposition of Dr. Robert L. Rizek at 112, App. 167a. Thereafter, this cost is adjusted only for the <em>number </em>of persons in each eligible household, without regard to its individual composition. Thus every four-person household receiving food stamps receives the same amount each month \u2014 that necessary to feed the hypothetical family of four \u2014 although some households need substantially more than the hypothetical family of four and some need substantially less.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">USDA\u2019s failure to account for the composition of each recipient household by age and sex is not the only reason why appellants receive less than they need to purchase a nutritionally adequate diet. The recipient\u2019s health and the amount of his daily physical activity also influence the cost to him of a nutritionally adequate diet. The fact that, in accordance with the Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2016(a), the Secretary adjusts the allotment figures for inflation only twice a year, and in so doing uses cost of food data current six months prior to the effective date of the new allotment schedules, means that the actual cost of the Economy Food Plan is frequently higher than the allotment even for the hypothetical family of four. Moreover, appellants are all from Northeastern states where the cost of food is higher than the national average, which the Secretary uses in pricing the Economy Food Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">All this the Secretary concedes.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> He defends the allotment system not on its accuracy but on the ground of administrative necessity.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> He further sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>gests that appellants\u2019 allotments fall short because they are members of \u201cunusual families.\u201d Brief for appellee USDA at 21. We agree that there is room for administrative convenience and necessity in the administration of the food stamp program. The number of variables affecting the needs of individual recipients is, ultimately, infinite, and we certainly do not expect the Secretary to embark upon extensive metabolic examinations of each food stamp recipient to determine individual need. But we do not think that justifies automatically ignoring generalized, easily quantified, and easily verified differences among recipients under the rubric of administrative necessity.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The purposes of the Food Stamp Act \u2014 the health and well-being of our populace \u2014 are too important, and the legislative intent that those purposes be achieved for substantially all recipients too clear, for us to allow their administrative evisceration. We think that an averaging system such as that now used can be sustained only if the Secretary can show that such a system will deliver coupons to substantially all recipients sufficient to allow them to purchase a nutritionally adequate diet.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> If such an \u201cefficient\u201d system does not meet this test, which we think is congressionally mandated, then the Secretary must individualize his computations to the extent necessary to achieve this result, or increase the amount of the \u201caverage\u201d allotment so that virtually all recipients are swept within it. And, needless to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>say, whatever approach is utilized must be supported by the administrative record developed on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Further than this we do not go. We express no view on what allotment system is to be preferred, or, should an individualized approach be used, how many variables should be accommodated. That is initially to be determined by the Secretary, and we think a proper determination must await the presentation of facts not now before us. But we stress that the Secretary must make an active inquiry into the facts and must take whatever steps are required to comply with the legislative mandate. The nation\u2019s poor and low-income families who are so dependent on the relief promised by the Food Stamp Act deserve no less.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Accordingly, this case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to return it to the Secretary for a new rule-making proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-8\">.

It is not administratively practicable to provide for the determination of a coupon allotment for each household participating in the program on the basis of the actual composition of each household taking into consideration such factors as the age, health, sex, and degree of physical activity of each household member even though such factors to some degree affect the total nutritional needs of a household. To do so would require the obtaining and verification of substantial amounts of additional information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>from applicant households in order to certify their eligibility and more frequent recertifi-cations, for example, at the birthday of each household member to insure that the changing ages were resulting in the appropriate increases or decreases in the household\u2019s coupon allotment. To this end, the Department has tried to reduce, rather than add to, the complexity of the certification process and to simplify rather than complicate the judgments which must be made by certifying officials to insure that the certification process itself does not present a barrier to the participation of eligible households. Therefore, after reviewing available data on the typical composition of poverty families by age and sex, coupon allotments were established on the basis of household size alone, taking into account that large households should be able to buy food more economically than small households. The available data concerning such economies of scale, particularly for the largest households which participate in the program \u2014 some in excess of 15 members \u2014 are limited. Again to minimize the calculations for caseworkers, and thus speed up the certification process, the revised regulations allow the caseworker to quickly calculate the coupon allotment for the largest households by adding to the published allotment for an eight-person household the uniform amount of $16 for each member in the household in excess of eight. On the basis of the limited information available on the economies of scale, and the fact that large-size households typically contain many school-age children receiving school lunch benefits, I determined that these allotments are sufficient to provide a nutritionally adequate diet.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Affidavit of Richard E. Lyng, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Marketing and Consumer Services, App. 106a-108a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b881-8\">. While USDA suggests that quantification of age and sex variables would require substantial amounts of additional data from recipient households and frequent and complex recertifi-cations of households, <em>see </em>note 25 <em>supra, </em>we are not, at least in the absence of a factual record, immediately convinced. USDA already requires state agencies to certify eligible households as to income and number of family members. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 271.4 (1974). Typically, a household must be recertified every three months; no household may be certified for more than 12 months. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 271.4(a)(4). To add to this the burden of certifying household members\u2019 ages and sexes does not seem to us intolerable. And as for the problem of constant recertification, upon which USDA places much emphasis, sex is unchanging, and the ages of all recipients can be adjusted administratively each year, so that no recertification is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">The variables of inflation and the differential price of food in different parts of the country are already quantified by the Government itself. Adjustment for these figures in a system that works largely through individual state programs does not seem difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">The variables of health and individual physical activity may be more difficult to quantify m any efficient manner, but we would expect the Secretary on remand to inquire diligently into the significance of these variables, as well as any others of import raised by the comments, and the possibility of their quantification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b881-11\">.
