Holden, Chief Judge. This diversity action was brought after plaintiff\u2019s husband was electrocuted while holding an aluminum pole saw, 18 feet in length, which he had rented from United to trim trees at a \u201cY\u201d camp. The saw apparently had come in contact with a Citizens Utilities power line. The jury awarded plaintiff $100,000 against appellants and the camp.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The issues here are simple. United and Citizens Utilities both claim that the deceased was contributorily negligent. United also claims that it was not negligent, but Citizens Utilities does not appeal the determination of its negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Appellants have a heavy burden to overcome in the jury\u2019s findings. See 5A ' J. Moore, Federal Practice 1 50.07[2] (2d ed. 1948), 6A id. U 59.08[5]. Apparently the trial judge, long familiar with Vermont law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> did not believe that they had sustained that burden when he denied defendants\u2019 motions; neither do we. For example, on the question of the deceased\u2019s contributory negligence, on which defendants had the burden of proof,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> there was an issue as to whether the deceased should have seen the wires; there was also evidence from which the jury could have found that the deceased reasonably believed that the wires were insulated or not energized.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This would, of course, negate contributory negligence. See, e. g., Stoffel v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. R., 205 F.2d 411, 413 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 346 U.S. 898, 74 S.Ct. 222, 98 L.Ed. 399 (1953). Similarly, since United customarily warned persons who rented aluminum ladders not to use them near power lines, the jury was free to find that it was negligence not to warn the deceased about the same danger inherent in aluminum pole saws. <em>Cf. </em>Harrington v. Sharff, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">LUMBARD, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-6\">. The appeal of the Vermont Y.W.C.A., doing business as Camp Hochelaga, was dismissed by stipulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b80-7\">. Before coming to the federal bench, Judge Holden was a member of the Vermont Supreme Court for many years and its Chief Justice for a good portion of that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b80-21\">.
