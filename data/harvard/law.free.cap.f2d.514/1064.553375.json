District Court Judge Gesell held that CLC\u2019s decision was founded upon a rational basis, was not procedurally infirm, and accordingly, granted summary judgment for CLC\u2019s successor, defendant-appellee Federal Energy Administration (FEA). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-11\">On December 19, 1973, CLC, without a hearing, amended its Phase IV price regulation covering domestic crude petroleum to permit an immediate one dollar per barrel increase to the maximum ceiling price charged for \u201cold\u201d oil. 38 Fed. Reg. 34985-86 (Dec. 21, 1973). CLC articulated two basic reasons for its action. First, it maintained that the increase was in furtherance of its stated policy to \u201cmonitor the ceiling prices on domestic crude petroleum and ... to make periodic upward adjustments in the ceiling price toward the higher world prices for crude petroleum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34985. After briefly describing the situation confronting it \u2014 a \u201cvery wide spread between domestic crude prices and world crude prices,\u201d and a two to four dollar spread between the price of \u201cold\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d domestic crude within its two-tier pricing system of regulation \u2014 CLC advised that \u201c[sjpreads of this magnitude are potentially de-stabilizing and cannot long be maintained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, CLC observed that while the increase \u201ccan be expected to generate only marginal increments to crude supply in the. short run, . . . [it] will create additional incentive for the petroleum industry to pursue further research and developments efforts, new exploration and new technology to augment our energy resources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In closing, CLC specifically found that \u201c[b]ecause the purpose of these amendments is to provide immediate guidance and information with respect to the decisions of [CLC], . publication in accordance with normal rulemaking procedures is impracticable and . . good cause exists for making these amendments effective in less than 30 days.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> FEA, CLC\u2019s successor with respect to its energy authority under the Economic Stabilization Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> has adopted the regulation as amended by CLC. <em>See </em>6 C.F.R. \u00a7 150.353 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-18\">On July 9, 1974, appellants filed this action in district court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>broadly attacked CLC\u2019s amendment of the regulation and FEA\u2019s subsequent adoption of it as \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, in excess of statutory authority, without observance of procedure required by law, and otherwise not in accordance with law, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2) . . . .\u201d Nader v. Sawhill, Civil No. 74-1025, complaint, 1123 (D.D.C., filed July 9, 1974), J.A. 9. To bolster their allegations, appellants submitted copies of CLC memo-randa utilized in its decision to amend the regulation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Relying upon these memoranda, appellants asserted that CLC\u2019s reasons for the price increase were insufficient because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-4\">(i) the price spreads referred to in the statement of reasons posed no significant threat to any national interest cognizable by the CLC under the Economic Stabilization Act, and (ii) even if such a national interest was threatened by said price spreads, it could have been protected by the taking of other actions that would have been more efficacious and far less injurious to plaintiffs and other consumers than the price increase</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">Nader v. Sawhill, <em>supra, </em>Civil No. 74-1025, Complaint, 123(a), J.A. 9-10. Lastly, appellants argued that CLC\u2019s amendment and FEA\u2019s adoption of it were proeedurally defective because of the absence of formal hearings and prior notice or opportunity for public comment. <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">To rebut appellants\u2019 assertions, extensive expository affidavits were filed by CLC\u2019s former Director, John T. Dunlop, its former General Counsel, William N. Walker and FEA\u2019s Deputy Assistant Administrator for Policy Integration and Evaluation, Bert M. Concklin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The affidavits reiterated the reasons originally announced by CLC when it issued the amendment to the regulation and detailed the economic considerations supporting those reasons. For example, former Director Dunlop, noting the portentous prospect of decontrol in light of the price spread between domestic oil and foreign oil, explained that \u201c[t]he severe consequences of a \u2018one-shot\u2019 increase in crude oil prices at the end of controls, which would contribute to the inflationary spiral, were hoped to be avoided by a step-by-step process whereby small increases would be spread out over a period of time.\u201d J.A. 34. Additionally, he observed that CLC \u201chad reason to believe that the increase in the ceiling price of old oil would serve to improve crude supplies,\u201d which was of \u201ccontinuing concern\u201d to CLC in view of our country\u2019s vulnerable reliance upon imported petroleum. J.A. 35-36. Beyond these two basic reasons, Mr. Dunlop also noted CLC\u2019s concern that the growing price spread increased the temptation \u201cfor producers to \u2018cheat\u2019 the system.\u201d J.A. 35. Concerning CLC\u2019s departure from normal rulemaking procedures, Mr. Dunlop confirmed CLC\u2019s determination that the decision</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-10\">had to be made promptly and without advance notice of the price change. For in addition to the need for immediate action to provide production in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>centives to domestic producers in view of the Arab oil embargo, to have given crude producers thirty-days notice of a price advance would quite naturally have affected adversely sales and deliveries during this difficult period of supply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">J.A. 39. The remaining affidavits were in full accord with and complemented Mr. Dunlop\u2019s explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, Judge Gesell held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-7\">There is clearly a rational basis for the conclusions conscientiously and deliberately arrived at and it is of no consequence that others could have reached a different decision or decided to follow a different approach based on a different economic analysis. . The knowledge of past regulatory efforts and their purpose and effect and shifts in supplies affecting the price structure were all properly weighed and the standards governing the action under 203(a) of the Economic Stabilization Act were given proper consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1125-9\">Nader v. Sawhill, 387 F.Supp. 1208 (D.D.C., 1974), J.A. 105-06. As to the procedural challenge, Judge Gesell held that, under decisions of this court, Mr. Dunlop\u2019s and Mr. Walker\u2019s explanations of the situation sufficed to meet the requirements of section 207 of the Economic Stabilization Act and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553, in that \u201c[a]n emergency matter was presented which required immediate action and hearings were not possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1209, J.A. 106-07. Thus, summary judgment was granted in favor of FEA, and the complaint was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-11\">Appellants\u2019 arguments on appeal are essentially those previously presented to the district court. They-again argue that the decision to increase the price of \u201cold\u201d domestic crude was arbitrary and capricious, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1904 (note) \u00a7 211(d)(1) (Supp. Ill, 1973) \u2014an abuse of agency discretion, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1970). Initially, we note that the Supreme Court has most recently reaffirmed its characterization of this standard, which governs our review here, as \u201ca narrow one\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-12\">A reviewing court must \u201cconsider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment. . . Although this inquiry into the facts is to be searching and careful, the ultimate standard of review is a narrow one. The court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, <em>supra, </em>401 U.S. at 416, 91 S.Ct. at 824. The agency must articulate a \u201crational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168, 83 S.Ct. 239, 246, 9 L.Ed.2d 207.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1125-14\">Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 285, 95 S.Ct. 438, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Given the record before us, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>are constrained to agree with the district court that there is a sufficiently rational basis for the price increase to withstand our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\">While the decision to implement the price increase may not have evolved from the type or quantum of economic analysis that appellants would require, our examination of the record reveals that economic considerations were in fact studied, alternatives weighed, and consequences debated. <em>See, e. g., </em>J.A. 13 \u2014 18, 31-38, 97-99. Although we cannot characterize the record as replete with complex economic analysis, we think that it is sufficient to pass muster under the rubric of \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d. In view of the very real prospect of decontrol, it was not irrational for CLC to seek to \u201cclose the spread\u201d between the price of \u201cold\u201d domestic crude and world prices. Reams of economic analysis are certainly not necessary to appreciate the inflationary impact of a sizable \u201cone-shot\u201d increase in the price of a commodity as ubiquitous and indispensable as petroleum. J.A. 101-102. We also think that CLC\u2019s second reason for the increase, to provide additional incentive for the private sector to augment supply, is sound. That an increase in supply can be expected to result from an increase in price is simply a recognition of the traditional functional relationship between price and supply. In-de\u00e9d, the record in this case indicates that favorable supply results were in fact achieved by the increase. J.A. 75-79. Thus, we do not accept the thrust of appellants\u2019 argument that \u201cCLC simply failed to engage in a reasoned exercise of agency discretion.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-5\">Appellants\u2019 argument concerning the procedural issue is two-fold. \u201c[A]s a preliminary matter\u201d, they contend that the decision not to adhere to normal rulemaking procedures \u201cwas not an agency decision at all, but rather a unilateral determination made by the CLC General Counsel William Walker, who failed to communicate his advice to the Council.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 17. We think appellants have simply misinterpreted the record, for the affidavits upon which they rely to support this conclusion make clear that the decision was CLC\u2019s, not Mr. Walker\u2019s. J.A. 39, 99-100.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-7\">Appellants\u2019 primary procedural argument is that CLC did not make an adequate showing of \u201cgood cause\u201d to dispense with the procedural requirements of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Initially, we agree with. appellants that if CLC\u2019s conclusory statement that normal procedures were not followed because of the need \u201cto provide immediate guidance and information with respect to the decisions of the Council,\u201d 38 Fed.Reg. 34986, \u201cconstitutes \u2018good cause\u2019, then an exception to the notice requirement would be created that would swallow the rule.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 19. Thus, as appellants contend, our inquiry cannot end here. Nonetheless, without dwelling at length on the issue, we think good cause was present in this case based upon CLC\u2019s concern that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1126-8\">the announcement of a price increase at a future date could have resulted in producers withholding crude oil from the market until such time as they could take advantage of the price increase. In view of the shortages beginning to be felt as a result of the [Arab] embargo and the even more critical shortages expected in the near future, it was believed that any action which might aggravate the shortage situation should be avoided to the maximum extent possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1126-9\">J.A. 93. That this reasoning was not expressed by CLC with its announcement of the increase is but a technical violation of normal procedures, which we do not think warrants reversal, considering the expeditious nature of the proceedings and that good cause in fact was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>present. <em>See, e. g., </em>California v. Simon, 504 F.2d 430, 439-40 (T.E.C.A.), cert. denied, 1021 U.S. 419, 95 S.Ct. 496, 42 L.Ed.2d 294 (1974); DeRieux v. Five Smiths, Inc., 499 F.2d 1321, 1332-33 (T.E.C.A.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 896, 95 S.Ct. 176, 42 L.Ed.2d 141 (1974). However, we warn that repeated technical noncompliance will not be tolerated. Moreover, we stress categorically that our resolution of the procedural issues herein is founded upon the unique circumstances in which <em>this </em>price increase was formulated. Assuming less calamitous circumstances, we fully expect that any future decisions will take the utmost advantage of full and open public comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1123-12\">. 38 Fed.Reg. 34986. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 as made applicable to CLC rulemaking proceedings by section 207 of the Economic Stabilization Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1904 (note) (Supp. Ill, 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1123-13\">. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1904 (note (1970), as amended, (Supp. Ill, 1973).

Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 1577, 91 L.Ed. 1995, we will uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned.

On this basis, appellants assert that portions of the expository affidavits filed with the district court present \u201cnew\u201d justifications for the price increase, and thus should be disregarded.
