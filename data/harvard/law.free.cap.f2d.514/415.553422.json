S. Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Prisoners Carroll and Gaston, invoking the district court\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) and claiming violations of their civil rights, brought this action for monetary, injunctive and declaratory relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985. Finding that plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. We vacate the judgment and remand for a hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The prisoners were transferred from the Pontiac branch to the Stateville branch of the Illinois State Penitentiary without a hearing. They argue here that summary judgment was improper because (1) there were unresolved material issues of fact and (2) they were <em>pro se </em>litigants, incarcerated throughout the proceedings below and not informed by the district court of the requirements for response to a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">We agree that material issues of fact exist as to whether the prisoners lost compensatory \u201cgood time,\u201d whether the transfer involved such \u201cgrievous loss\u201d as to have required the provision of appropriate due process safeguards, and whether the prisoners were improperly deprived of certain personal property. We express no views on the merits or the relief, if any, to be fashioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">The district court found that the complaint failed to state a cause of action respecting \u201cgood time\u201d because there was no allegation of affirmative action by prison officials denying it,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and because jurisdiction was lacking under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-14\">We find, however, that the complaint alleged a loss of opportunity to earn <em>Compensatory </em>\u201cgood time.\u201d Evidence of record<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> indicates that affirmative action denying ordinary \u201cgood time\u201d is not applicable to the present claim respecting compensatory \u201cgood time.\u201d A question of fact was thus raised and remains unresolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-15\">We' do not find jurisdiction lacking. The district court relied on Preiser v. Rodriquez, 411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973), but it was there stated that \u201ca prisoner\u2019s state remedy must be adequate and available, as indeed [28 USC] \u00a7 2254(b) provides.\u201d Though the New York state remedies were adequate in <em>Preiser, </em>the statement applies in Illinois, where habeas corpus in the state courts and state administrative remedies are limited to plaintiffs who would be immediately released upon receipt of the \u201cgood time\u201d sought. Because these were not such plaintiffs, we hold that a complaint alleging loss of compensatory good time states a cause of action herein under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-16\">Whether, assuming its existence, the loss of opportunity to earn compensatory \u201cgood time\u201d constituted a \u201cgrievous loss,\u201d and thus in itself invoked a requirement for procedural due process in connection with the transfer, must await the findings of the district court after an \u25a0 evidentiary hearing. Concerning other bases for the claim of grievous loss, we note the district court\u2019s reliance on <em>defendants\u2019 </em>affidavits respecting the reasons for the prisoners\u2019 segregation and the conditions in Cell House \u201cC\u201d to which they were confined. Functioning <em>pro se, </em>Carroll and Gaston filed no counter affidavits but did file a sworn \u201cMemorandum of Law\u201d specifically challenging factual allegations in defendants\u2019 af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>fidavits and raising factual issues concerning the effect of the transfer on their interests. Whether they suffered \u201cgrievous loss\u201d as a result of the transfer, in the light of this record, depends upon an inquiry into the actual differences between the two institutions at the time of their transfer, the reason for the transfer,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the basis for their segregation at Stateville, and whether the facts thus determined reflect such substantial deprivations as to have required at least minimum due process. Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974); United States ex rel. Haymes v. Montanye, 505 F.2d 977 (2d Cir. 1974); Newkirk v. Butler, 499 F.2d 1214 (2d Cir. 1974), cert. granted, <em>sub nom., </em>Preiser v. Newkirk, 419 U.S. 894, 95 S.Ct. 172, 42 L.Ed.2d 138 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The judgment concerning the property issue rested in part on defendants\u2019 showing that the prisoners had \u201csigned for the return of legal documents and law books.\u201d Nothing of record establishes, however, that the typewriter and currency were returned. Defendant-appellees admit the confiscation, but argue that the absence of affidavits, identifying specific property not returned, made summary judgment appropriate. We think not. Appellants were proceeding <em>pro se. </em>See Hudson v. Hardy, 134 U.S.App.D.C. 44, 412 F.2d 1091 (1968). The prisoners\u2019 \u201cMemorandum of Law,\u201d though inadequate under ordinary conditions, in effect repeated the demand for return of their property. Their complaint sought to enjoin defendants from retaining the typewriter and currency. Defendants\u2019 \u201creceipt\u201d did not appear to reflect return of these items or even that all of the confiscated law books had been returned. As Rule 56(e) states, it is to be applied \u201cif appropriate.\u201d Considering the entire record, we hold its application, in the matter of the prisoners\u2019 property in this case, to have been inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The district court\u2019s statement that allegations of unlawful appropriation of non-legal property do not state a cause of action under the Civil Rights Act appears contrary to guidance provided in Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., 405 U.S. 538, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972), wherein the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">This Court has never adopted the distinction between personal liberties and proprietary rights as a guide to the contours of \u00a7 1343(3) jurisdiction. Today, we expressly reject that distinction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">In <em>Lynch, </em>as here, plaintiff brought action for unlawful deprivation of property under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The holdings in <em>Lynch; </em>Watson v. Stynchombe, 504 F.2d 393 (5th Cir. 1974); Russell v. Bodner, 489 F.2d 280 (3rd Cir. 1973); and Cruz v. Cardwell, 486 F.2d 550 (8th Cir. 1973) strengthen our conviction that appellants\u2019 allegations of deprivation of property did serve to state a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">For all of the foregoing reasons, the judgment below is vacated and the cause is remanded to the district court for appropriate evidentiary hearing on the issues discussed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-11\">.

Stateville Correctional Center, Bulletin No. 50, dated April 2, 1974, entitled \u201cCompensatory Time Clarification,\u201d indicates that compensatory good time could not be earned from April to September 1973 by those who, like appellants, were not assigned to work or were assigned to segregation during that period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b475-12\">.

One of defendants\u2019 affiants (Warden Petrilli) stated that the alternative to transfer was a disciplinary proceeding and a hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
