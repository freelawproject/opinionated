(St. Louis), physically controlled inventory of Smith\u2019s Pride Food, Inc. (Smith\u2019s), which secured loans made by plaintiff, Commercial Credit Business Loans, Inc. (Commercial), to Smith\u2019s pursuant to a field warehousing bailment agreement among St. Louis, Smith\u2019s and Commercial. Under the agreement, St. louis was not to release Smith\u2019s inventory from its warehouse except as authorized by Commercial.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">Commercial\u2019s collateral became impaired by a $200,000 shortage of inventory in the St. Louis warehouse, and Commercial brought suit. The district court found that $175,277.55 of the shortage resulted from unauthorized deliveries not reflected on St. Louis\u2019 records as having been delivered. It further found the unrecorded deliveries to have occurred between January 30, 1971, and June 4, 1971, during which time Commercial had expressly authorized St. Louis to release inventory at Smith\u2019s request on the condition that St. Louis first obtain Smith\u2019s check for 55% of the releases and forward the check to Commercial. Consequently, with respect to the $175,277.55 shortage, the district court limited recovery to the 55% which Commercial would have received had St. Louis complied with Commercial\u2019s authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-16\">Commercial argues on appeal that it was damaged by 100%, not 55%, of the $175,277.55 shortage. We have carefully examined the trial record and fail to discern any proof of damage beyond the 55% of the value of the released inventory Commercial would have received had St. Louis complied with the authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-17\">Commercial further urges that no competent evidence was presented to the district court by St. Louis to prove that the shortage resulted from unrecorded deliveries during the \u201c55% period.\u201d On the contrary, St. Louis presented the uncontroverted results of an audit conducted by St. Louis to determine the cause of the shortage, supported by documentary evidence (bills of lading and invoices), and explained through the testimony of the St. Louis employee who supervised the audit. In light of this evidence, the findings of the district court are not clearly erroneous. <em>See, e.g., </em>McAllister v. United States, 1954, 348 U.S. 19, 75 S.Ct. 6, 99 L.Ed. 20; Gulf Banana Co. v. Reefer Shipping Corp., 5 Cir. 1968, 391 F.2d 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>For the first time on appeal Commercial contends that it was damaged beyond the 55% since, had the deliveries been reported, it would have obtained the resulting accounts receivables as collateral, and furthermore it might have rescinded the \u201c55% authorization\u201d at an earlier time. Because neither these assertions nor proofs of these assertions were presented at trial, we decline to consider them on appeal. <em>See, e.g., </em>D. H. Overmyer Co. v. Loflin, 5 Cir. 1971, 440 F.2d 1213; American Surety Co. v. Coblentz, 5 Cir. 1967, 381 F.2d 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
