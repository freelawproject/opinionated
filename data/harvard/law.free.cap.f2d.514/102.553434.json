After sentence was imposed, they moved to withdraw their guilty plea. Their motions were denied and the Veras appeal. We find that Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 was not complied with and therefore reverse and remand to enable defendants to plead anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 requires that the court may not entertain a plea of guilty \u201cwithout . . . determining that the plea is made . . , with understanding of the nature of the charge\u201d and \u201cunless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d The inquiry must be \u201cfactually precise enough and sufficiently specific to develop that [defendants\u2019] conduct on the occasions involved was within the ambit of that defined as criminal.\u201d Jiminez v. United States, 5 Cir. 1973, 487 F.2d 212, 213. <em>See also, </em>United States v. Davis, 5 Cir. 1974, 493 F.2d 502; United States v. Bethany, 5 Cir. 1974, 489 F.2d 91, 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">Abuid and Gustavo were arraigned separately. During Abuid\u2019s arraignment the district court\u2019s inquiry evoked responses which cast serious doubt on Abuid\u2019s guilt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-13\">THE COURT: Now they have \u2014 you plead guilty to Count two which is possession with intent to distribute approximately five hundred and fifty-four pounds of Marijuana; now what was your part in this, what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-14\">DEFENDANT ABUID VERA: Well, I just came along, I guess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-15\">THE COURT: You just came along? Well, were you, did you have some of the Marijuana in your possession? DEFENDANT ABUID VERA: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-17\">THE COURT: Did you drive the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOS\">DEFENDANT ABUID VERA: Well, it wasn\u2019t my car at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-18\">THE COURT: It wasn\u2019t your car but you were the driver of the car that had the Marijuana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-19\">DEFENDANT ABUID VERA: No, sir, I didn\u2019t drive that one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-21\">THE COURT: You didn\u2019t drive that one. You were driving another car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AufI\">DEFENDANT ABUID VERA: We didn\u2019t have anything,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-23\">THE COURT: You knew what was going on? You knew that there was Marijuana being transported did you?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6\">Assistant United States Attorney McCullough then interrupted and attempted to describe the circumstances under which Abuid, Gustavo, and other defendants were arrested; however, he never explicitly stated Abuid\u2019s and Gustavo\u2019s involvement. The court, interested in pinning down Abuid\u2019s involvement, shifted its inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-24\">THE COURT: What did, what did this man have to do with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-25\">MR. McCULLOUGH: Specifically, Your Honor, these two gentlemen were together at all times that we have any knowledge of this case. And I couldn\u2019t say what one of them did that the other did not. '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-27\">THE COURT: Well, let me ask you\u2014 did you, did you know that there was Marijuana on, on the ranch where you were, did you know? When did you find out there was Marijuana involved?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-28\">DEFENDANT ABUID VERA: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-29\">THE COURT: When did you find out there was Marijuana involved? Right off the bat, or was it\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>At this point defendant\u2019s counsel interjected his assurances to the court that Abuid understood the entire matter. The court\u2019s questioning ceased and Abuid\u2019s plea was accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Before accepting a plea of guilty, \u201c[t]he judge must determine \u2018that the conduct which the defendant admits constitutes the offense charged in the indictment . . . \u201d McCarthy v. United States, 1968, 394 U.S. 459, 467, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 1171, 22 L.Ed. 418. Abuid was not asked whether the explanation of the Assistant United States Attorney was correct. <em>See </em>Torres v. United States, 5 Cir. 1974, 505 F.2d 957, 958. The only implicating information Abuid disclosed in response to the district court\u2019s questioning was his awareness that there was marijuana on the ranch while he was there. Without a determination of the time when Abuid found out about the marijuana, or the circumstances surrounding his knowledge, the fact that at some time he knew that there was marijuana on the ranch cannot be equated with possession with intent to distribute, the charge against him. Particularly in light of the earlier exculpatory responses of Abuid, the court should have extended its factual inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The trial court must also be satisfied that the \u201cdefendant possesses an understanding of the law in relation to the facts.\u201d <em>McCarthy, supra </em>394 U.S. at 466, 89 S.Ct. at 1171. Without further questioning of Abuid and without advising him fully what acts were necessary to establish guilt, the court could not have determined that Abuid understood his conduct, in light of the law, to be criminal. Hulsey v. United States, 5 Cir. 1966, 369 F.2d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Finally, the mere assurance of defense counsel is not sufficient. The district court must \u201cpersonally inquire whether the defendant understood the nature of the charge.\u201d <em>McCarthy, supra </em>394 U.S. at 467, 89 S.Ct. at 1171. The \u201cfactual basis must appear <em>on the record.\u201d Davis, supra </em>at 503. <em>See also </em>Santobello v. New York, 1971, 404 U.S. 257, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427. The record here contains insufficient information to disclose a factual basis for Abuid\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">The determination by the court of Gustavo\u2019s criminality, based on the following limited colloquy, was more tenuous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">THE COURT: Well, can you tell me just what you did yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIE\">DEFENDANT GUSTAVO VERA [Who understands little English \u2014 In the third party, through an interpreter]: He says the story is very long; he says that he knew what was being delivered, and that he was promised a dollar per pound for what was actually delivered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-11\">THE COURT: He knew he was dealing with Marijuana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-12\">DEFENDANT GUSTAVO VERA: He said he did know what was going to be delivered. His son said they were going to pick up a package.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-13\">THE COURT: He knew it was Marijuana?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-14\">DEFENDANT GUSTAVO VERA: He did not know what was in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-15\">THE COURT: That\u2019s as far as we can go now, Mr. McCullough. All right, we will just \u2014 the plea of guilty has been accepted and entered, and we will defer arraignment, I mean we will defer sentencing at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-16\">The contradictory responses do not tend to prove that Gustavo, Abuid\u2019s father, possessed anything. They certainly do not support a finding that Gustavo knowingly possessed marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-17\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
