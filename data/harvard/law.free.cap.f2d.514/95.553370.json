Presumably on the strong protests of the Joint Task Force on Organized Crime for the Eastern District of New York, the Board of Parole on August 23, 1974 informed McIntosh that a reconsideration would be held by the en banc Board. His counsel was permitted to make an oral statement to the en banc Board, but was then required to leave without participating further. Shortly afterward, the Board announced, with brief statement of its reasons, that McIntosh would not be paroled. McIntosh claims denial of due process procedural rights in the rescinding of the earlier order.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Sexton v. Wise, 5 Cir., 1974, 494 F.2d 1176 directly controls this case. McIntosh argues that the somewhat later Supreme Court opinion in Wolff v. McDonnell, 1974, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935, requires us to overrule <em>Sexton. </em>We disagree, and hold ourselves bound by the panel decision in <em>Sexton.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-15\">. Upon oral argument, McIntosh\u2019s counsel renewed application for bail pending appellate disposition of the case. In light of our action, the motion is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
