NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).

United\u2019s Washington outlet had a poor signal due to antiqui-dated operating specifications originally granted as a pioneer UHF facility. These shortcomings made it virtually impossible to compete with other stations in the area. Attempts by the licensee to improve and increase the signal were stymied by the Commission\u2019s duopoly provisions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, since increasing the signal strength of the Washington station (WFAN-TV) would result in an overlap with the service area of another United-owned station (WMET-TV) in Baltimore. When United proposed to sell WMET \u2014 TV in order to permit upgrading of WFAN-TV, the Commission refused to allow the transfer until other ongoing proceedings into United\u2019s character qualifications were concluded.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fear underlying this refusal, that permission to sell would allow the licensee to evade possible future sanctions, seems unfounded as United itself admitted that it would remain under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Commission as the owner of various other licenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Faced with this denial and continuing financial losses, United applied for and received permission from the Commission to suspend broadcast operations pending the outcome of the other proceedings. A year and a half later, the FCC rescinded this permission and ordered United to resume broadcasting on WFAN-TV and WMET-TV at their original signal strengths until all review and appeals of the various proceedings were concluded.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> United was thus presented with the following problem: It could not sell the Baltimore station or improve the Washington station without FCC approval, yet it could not resume operation of either outlet financially at the original broadcasting specifications. Caught between Scylla and Charybdis, United decided not to resume telecasting; soon after, the licenses for both stations were revoked.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The decision of the Commission to revoke the two licenses in addition to the previous refusals of United\u2019s requests, appear to run counter to two affirmative policies of the agency. First, the Commission found that WFAN-TV provided \u201cmeritorious programming service\u201d, particularly for the Black community in Washington.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The programs were also produced and presented in large part by minority staff. The Commission has long recognized that the ascertainment of community needs and problems is a primary responsibility of a licensee,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and has stressed the importance of minority employment in broadcasting,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> yet here it seems to have taken little notice of United\u2019s accomplishments or of the impact on the Black community of this license revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Second, the Commission has adopted a policy since 1962 of encouraging the greater use of UHF facilities and has implemented various proposals to make the \u201chigh-band\u201d stations more competitive with the more established VHF channels.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here United sought to upgrade its signal and services in order to compete with an entrenched VHF market. The Commission\u2019s actions in denying the proposal to sell WMET-TV so that WFAN-TV could be improved and the subsequent revocation of both licenses can hardly be seen as encouragement in the use of UHF.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-18\">The Commission appears to be of the view that <em>some </em>signal is better than no signal at all.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The FCC, however, ignores the economic realities of producing a poor signal in a major market and then insures by its own actions that there will be no signal.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-19\">Apart from these policy considerations, it seems that the Commission was hardly impressed with our decision in Channel 16 of Rhode Island v. FCC,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a case that is similar on its facts. There we reversed a revocation and directed the FCC upon remand to consider, in light of unusual circumstances, a modification of its previous strict application of rules. The Commission has attempted to distinguish <em>Channel 16 </em>on its facts in three ways: (1) <em>Channel 16 </em>dealt with a grant of extension of time for a construction permit, whereas United\u2019s construction had already been completed. This distinction seems insignificant, especially in view of United\u2019s poor quality signal, and its repeated application for construction to improve this signal. (2) The delay in Channel 16 was caused exclusively by the FCC in its inquiry into CATV operations; the delay in <em>United </em>was due to the licensee\u2019s own requests during the evidentiary hearing. While it should be noted that United is far from blameless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>in causing procedural delay, they should not be penalized solely for exercising due process rights.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (3) In the Channel 16 viewing area, there was no absence of other available channels, but there was such an absence in the Washington area. This reasoning suggests that United\u2019s blackingout deprived other potential broadcasters of an available channel, while no such deprivation occurred in Rhode Island. However, if we look to the possible harm caused the <em>public, </em>rather than potential broadcasters, it would seem that less damage occurs when one out of <em>many </em>local stations goes off the air than when the <em>only </em>local station (Channel 16) blacks out.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> I wonder if these distinctions either miss or ignore the basic thrust of the <em>Channel 16 </em>decision \u2014 that the Commission should use its powers of equitable discretion to adapt its policies to fit the needs of special circumstances.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AuS\">Instead of reaching a solution that would serve both the licensee and the public interest, the agency\u2019s inflexibility has left the realities of the situation even more complicated. The effect of the present decision is that in place of two full-capacity UHP stations in the Washington-Baltimore area with two owners, we now have neither station operating pending new applications for both, a lengthy, unnecessary process.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">Fortunately, however, the injustice wrought by the FCC\u2019s mechanical decision will be ameliorated ultimately. For if the character hearings are resolved in United\u2019s favor, it may reapply for its Washington license. If successful, United would have had de facto permission to suspend operations with the right to resume broadcasting upon the completion of the character proceedings. Presumably, United would not receive a demerit in a later application because of the blackout and revocation; if it did, judicial review would be available.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">Since United\u2019s situation may well be rectified and since this case does not present an important question of law, I do not think the extraordinary procedure of rehearing <em>in banc </em>is warranted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-12\">.

However, any potential buyer would be forewarned of the \u201ccloud\u201d on the license and United has already stipulated that it would sell its station at no profit. If the FCC is fearful lest United be unjustly enriched should the renewal fail, it might consider a less drastic alternative, e. g., to require that any proceeds from a sale of the license be placed into an escrow account pending final resolution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\">.
