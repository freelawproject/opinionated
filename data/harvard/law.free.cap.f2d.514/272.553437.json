News Corp. (P.A.M.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> challenges on statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>and first amendment grounds an innovation inaugurated by the Market News Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) which allows subscribers to hook-up directly to USDA\u2019s information circulation system. Finding the government\u2019s action both statutorily authorized and constitutionally permissible, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">P.A.M.\u2019s business is the dissemination of agricultural information. Its service focuses upon the fresh fruit and vegetable industry; utilizing data collected both from USDA, its own staff of reporters, and other news sources, P.A.M. collates, edits, analyzes, and assembles the information into its own format and then transmits it to its customers over facilities leased from Western Union Telegraph Company. Topics covered range from prices, market conditions and forecasts to weather reports and business and general news items. A. 54. Similarly, LFM News, Inc., focusing upon the livestock, feed, and meat industries, collates, edits, analyzes, and transmits its information over a teletypewriter circuit leased from American Telephone and Telegraph Company (A.T.&amp;T.) to subscribing packers, brokers, and growers. A. 55-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">Since its creation, USDA, under its statutory mandate,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> has disseminated agricultural information to the public. Since 1917, it has utilized a wire network leased from A.T.&amp;T., connecting USDA Market News Service branch offices, in order to expedite the collection and dissemination of information. However, prior to August 1, 1963, USDA did not permit any information carried over its wire network to be received directly off that network by anyone utilizing direct extension connections (drops) to the network. A. 61. Certain users of USDA Market News could arrange, at the user\u2019s expense, to receive some of the information <em>after </em>it had cleared the wire network.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">On August 1, 1963, USDA inaugurated a service whereby the public could arrange with A.T.&amp;T. for a direct extension off .its wire service and thereby receive news service information directly.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The innovation was prompted by technological advances which permitted USDA to transmit certain private inter-office information over the network while bypassing the drop customer\u2019s receiving machines. 2A. 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">On November 4, 1963, appellant filed suit against the government and A.T.&amp;T. seeking declaratory and injunctive relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>alleging that the direct extension service was not authorized by statute, and even if authorized, violated the first amendment. In 1968, the district court dismissed the complaint and held that appellant, \u201calleging mere competitive injury, lack[s] standing to complain of the operation of the direct extension service\u201d and that the service resulted in no abridgement of appellant\u2019s first amendment rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On appeal, we reversed the district court\u2019s holding on standing. P.A.M. News Corp. v. Hardin, 142 U.S. App.D.C. 227, 440 F.2d 255, 257 (1971). However, we did not reach the merits of appellant\u2019s constitutional claims because \u201c[cjourts generally prefer to rule upon constitutional questions which involve the scope of power of an administrative agency only after the agency itself has considered the constitutional issue and made a determination about the weights of competing administrative policies and interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Since we found that the record did not indicate whether USDA had complied with section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by publishing a statement of the basis for its action, we remanded the case with instructions to consider that issue. 440 F.2d at 258 \u2014 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Following that decision, the district court entered an order requiring that ap-pellees comply with the APA and that the rule without an accompanying concise general statement was unlawful^ null and void. 2A. 19 \u2014 20. Thereafter, USDA published a statement of purpose on April 25, 1972. 37 Fed.Reg. 8121 (1972). On February 7, 1973, the district court held that this statement fulfilled USDA\u2019s APA obligations and that the case was ripe for consideration on the merits. 2A. 39 \u2014 40. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court found for the government, holding that the direct extension service does not violate appellant\u2019s first amendment or statutory rights. 2A. 73. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">Appellant urges four grounds for reversal. It argues that USDA has still failed to comply with APA requirements, that the challenged innovation is in excess of appellee\u2019s statutory authority, and that the service must be invalidated since it constitutes an unconstitutional infringement of appellant\u2019s first amendment rights. Finally, it asserts that the grant of summary judgment and refusal to allow discovery were improper. We turn first to the procedural argument on which appellant prevailed in its first appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">P.A.M. asserts that the Governmental News Service is still being operated under a rule adopted without observance of APA requirements. It charges that the April 25, 1972 general statement was defective in that seventeen of its twenty-two pages were a verbatim reproduction of a document submitted to a United States Senator in 1963 coupled with conclusional and argumentive material. Thus, P.A.M. opines that the statement fails to reflect a \u201creasoned consideration\u201d of the constitutional questions raised in which the government must engage. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 46 \u2014 49; <em>see </em>440 F.2d at 257, 258 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">We disagree. Section 553(c) only requires \u201ca concise general statement;\u201d we have noted that \u201c[wjhen promulgating a rule, an agency is not required to abide by the same stringent requirements of fact findings and supporting reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>which apply to adjudication.\u201d Mobil Oil Corp. v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n, 152 U.S.App.D.C. 119, 469 F.2d 130, 139 (1972), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 931, 93 S.Ct. 2749, 37 L.Ed.2d 159 (1973). Our previous decision in this case, while ensuring USDA\u2019s complaince with statutory requirements and with the basic administrative rule of reasoned decision-making, was also made in light of our recognition that \u201c[a]ny judicial review of administrative action \u2014 whether the question is the constitutionality of the relevant action or the statutory authorization \u2014 is more intelligently undertaken when it is informed by the agency\u2019s own view of its authorized powers.\u201d 440 F.2d at 259 n. 6. USDA\u2019s view has now been placed on the record in the appropriate form and manner. Moreover, we also believe the statement indicates adequate consideration of the potential problems posed by the direct extension system. The statement responds to arguments posited by the American Newspaper Publishers Association which raised similar objections to P.A.M.\u2019s and concludes that \u201cthe system does not abridge the constitutional guarantees of any person . . . .\u201d 2A. 64; <em>see id. </em>at 52 \u2014 63. The incorporation of a 1963 letter does not make the statement defective, as it canvassed the relevant issues, and the 1972 statement affirmed that the letter continues to represent its views.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">We now turn to the gravamen of P.A. M.\u2019s complaint \u2014 that the direct extension service constitutes an unconstitutional infringement of appellant\u2019s first amendment rights. Appellant\u2019s argument, grounded upon the free press guarantee, is fourfold. P.A.M. asserts that its service is entitled to first amendment protections; that \u201cunlawful and unfair competition by a government agency with a press entity violates the first amendment;\u201d that the USDA news extension service has seriously damaged it in the exercise of its first amendment rights; and that the government has not demonstrated the necessary compelling interest to override the abridgement of appellant\u2019s rights. Appellant\u2019s Br. 26-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">At the outset, we strongly endorse many of P.A.M.\u2019s premises concerning the question before us. Any possible governmental interference with the rights of a free press must be searchingly scrutinized. <em>See, e. g., </em>Ashton v. Kentucky, 384 U.S. 195, 86 S.Ct. 1407, 16 L.Ed.2d 469 (1966). \u201cA broadly defined freedom of the press assures the maintenance of our political system and an open society.\u201d Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U.S. 374, 389, 87 S.Ct. 534, 543, 17 L.Ed.2d 456 (1967). Among the \u201cevils to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>be prevented\u201d by the first amendment press guarantee are \u201cnot the censorship of the press merely, but any action of the government by means of which it might prevent such free and general discussion of public matters as seems absolutely essential to prepare the people for an intelligent exercise of their rights as citizens. Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U.S. 233, 249-50, 56 S.Ct. 444, 449, 80 L.Ed. 660 (1936), <em>quoting </em>2 Cooley\u2019s Constitutional Limitations 886 (8th ed.). Thus, first amendment rights \u201care protected not only against heavy-handed frontal attack, but also from being stifled by more subtle governmental interference.\u201d Bates v. Little Rock, 361 U.S. 516, 523, 80 S.Ct. 412, 416, 4 L.Ed.2d 480 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">We also agree with appellant that its wire services fall within the protective umbrella of the first amendment press guarantee. <em>See, e. g., </em>Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147, 150, 80 S.Ct. 215, 4 L.Ed.2d 205 (1959); Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 531, 65 S.Ct. 315, 89 L.Ed. 430 (1945). However, we cannot endorse P.A.M.\u2019s conclusion that the direct extension service represents an unconstitutional infringement on its first amendment rights because we conclude that the USDA\u2019s actions do not abridge any cognizable first amendment interest of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">As P.A.M. makes clear, it is not arguing that USDA cannot, consistent with the first amendment, disseminate agricultural information, but is claiming that the <em>means </em>chosen by USDA, the direct extension service, abridges its first amendment rights. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 35-37. However, the direct extension service does not result in a prior restraint or restriction on what appellant may publish, does not insulate sources of information from appellant, nor does it impose any tax or penalty for the privilege of publishing. <em>Cf. </em>Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 681, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972). What the new service represents is an increase of the public\u2019s access to information. The information, which appellant had requested exclusive access to in 1959, is now available to all on an equal basis. Appellant\u2019s news gathering ability has only been enhanced, not abridged, by the USDA\u2019s innovation making its information available more directly and rapidly. Moreover, in a larger sense, the Government\u2019s actions here further a cornerstone of the first amendment \u2014 the maximum distribution of information in the marketplace. <em>See, e. g., </em>Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U.S. 301, 85 S.Ct. 1493, 14 L.Ed.2d 398 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\"> It is clear that not every action by the government which affects the press violates the first amendment. \u201cThe Amendment does not forbid [governmental activity] which ends in no restraint upon expression or in any other evil outlawed by its terms and purposes.\u201d Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, 327 U.S. 186, 193, 66 S.Ct. 494, 497, 90 L.Ed. 614 (1946) (footnote omitted). <em>See also </em>Branzburg v. Hayes, <em>supra; </em>Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1, 65 S.Ct. 1416, 89 L.Ed. 2013 (1945); Associated Press v. NLRB, 301 U.S. 103, 57 S.Ct. 650, 81 L.Ed. 953 (1937). However, appellant argues that it has been economically injured by this governmental action and has been placed at an insurmountable competitive disadvantage.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This, it claims, violates the first amendment, relying upon Grosjean v. American Press Co., <em>supra, </em>297 U.S. at 244-45, 56 S.Ct. 444, for the proposition that government activity which curtails the press\u2019 income and inhibits circulation is constitutionally impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>We cannot agree that the instant case falls within the rationale of <em>Grosjean. </em>As the Court there made clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\"><em>The tax here involved is not bad because it takes money from the pockets of the [press]. . . </em>It is bad because, in the light of its history and of its present setting, it is seen to be a deliberate and calculated device . to limit the circulation of information to which the public is entitled in virtue of constitutional guaranties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 250, 56 S.Ct. at 449 (emphasis added). That is not the case here. The Government is increasing, not limiting, the flow of information. The first amendment profits from this sort of governmental activity. Any economic loss suffered by appellant occurs because P.A.M. need no longer serve as a re-transmitter of government information. If P.A.M. performs a valuable press service through offering additional items of news and analysis, it will succeed and thrive in the marketplace. In sum, we hold that the wire extension service infringes no first amendment interest of appellant. In light of that conclusion, we need not balance the governmental interest behind the innovation against the alleged unconstitutional abridgement.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">We now briefly dispose of appellant\u2019s final two arguments. P.A.M. contends that the direct extension service is not authorized by statute. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 39-45. The foundation appellant lays for acceptance of this argument is that it avoids reaching the \u201cserious constitutional doubts\u201d surrounding USDA\u2019s action. However, since we have concluded that the innovation is free of the unconstitutional coloration with which P.A.M. attempts to taint it, we no longer consider that factor. We reject appellant\u2019s argument and find ample statutory authority for the service. <em>See </em>note 2 <em>supra. </em>We recognize that the agency has primary discretion in implementing its statutory mandates, e. <em>g., </em>United States v. Shimer, 367 U.S. 374, 381 \u2014 82, 81 S.Ct. 1554, 6 L.Ed.2d 908 (1961), and think that USDA has exercised that discretion in a proper and publicly beneficial manner here.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Finally, appellant asserts that the district court erred in denying it discovery which could have established the existence of a material disputed fact. Thus, P.A.M. argues the grant of summary judgment was improper. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 51 \u2014 56. The thrust of its argument is that discovery would have tested whether USDA had in fact sufficiently consulted with state agricultural departments as required by 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 (1970) and had in fact considered the submitted comments, under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553, before promulgating its rule. P.A.M. relies primarily on our decision in Committee for Nuclear Responsibility, Inc. v. Seaborg, 149 U.S.App.D.C. 380, 463 F.2d 783 (1971), for the proposition that such discovery was warranted before summary judgment could be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">We believe, however, that summary judgment was properly granted. We note first that the district court found adversely to appellant on both the sections 1621 and 553 questions. 2A. 39\u2014 40, 69. Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 is not a mandatory requirement, but merely urges consultation with state agencies \u201c[t]o the maximum extent practicable;\u201d we cannot see how discovery could have raised a material factual question vis-a-vis this section.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On its second point, P.A.M. hoped to establish that insufficient weight, contrary to the APA, was given to the submitted comments. <em>Nuclear Responsibility </em>cannot aid appellant here; in that case discovery was appropriate to probe for the existence of evidence that would have to be disclosed and evaluated in an environmental impact statement. 463 F.2d at 787 \u2014 88. Section 553 of the APA does not require the explicit inclusion of specific information; in this circumstance, the district court was correct in finding as a matter of law that the APA requirements had been met and granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>In sum, we have considered the arguments ably raised by appellant, but find that none necessitate reversal. The judgment, therefore, is</p>\n<p id=\"AM4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-29\">. L.F.M. News, Inc., the other plaintiff in this suit has now merged with P.A.M.

In its establishing statute, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 (1970), USDA is charged, <em>inter alia, </em>with the duty \u201cto acquire and to diffuse among the people of the United States useful information on subjects connected with agriculture . ..\u201d In 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1622(g), (k) (1970), the Secretary of Agriculture is directed and authorized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">To collect and disseminate marketing information, including adequate outlook information on a market-area basis .... . .

To do so, the teletypewritten tape would be taken off the USDA receiving machines and then transmitted on a sending machine the user had provided in the USDA office over other teletypewriter circuits leased and paid for by them. A. 60-61. One such user was the predecessor of P.A.M. which also paid a wordage charge to USDA for this service. A. 46, 348.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b332-15\">. The inauguration of this service was preceded by May 1, 1963 notice in the Federal Register announcing that consideration was being given to the innovation in order \u201cto facilitate more rapid and more extensive dissemination of market news\u201d and soliciting comments. 28 Fed.Reg. 5240 (1963). P.A.M. submitted a telegram objecting to the proposal. A. 65-66. In July, USDA issued a press release announcing the new service and issued a circular, AMS-510, describing the system\u2019s operation. A. 67-68. P.A.M. filed a \u201cpetition to Suspend or Reject\u201d the A.T.&amp;T. tariff authorizing the system with the Federal Communication Commission; on July 31, 1963, the petition was denied. A. 68-69.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b333-7\">. A. 106. The district court also dismissed the complaint against A.T.&amp;T. That dismissal was not seriously challenged on appeal, and was affirmed by this court which stated \u201cAT&amp;T need no longer be a party to this action.\u201d P.A.M. News Corp. v.

The relevant portion of the statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">(c) After notice required by this section, the agency shall give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the ruling making through submission of written data, views, or arguments with or without opportunity for oral presentation. After consideration of the relevant matter presented, <em>the agency shall incorporate in the rules adopted a concise general statement of their basis and purpose.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(c) (1970) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b334-7\">. 2A. 39. P.A.M. also argues that even if USDA\u2019s general statement were adequate, its failure to comply with other APA requirements in April, 1972, renders the rule void. Appellant asserts that the district court\u2019s order of April 21, 1972, declaring the 1963 rule \u201cunlawful, null and void,\u201d 2A. 19, coupled with this court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe institution of the direct extension service . . . constituted the adoption of a \u2018rule\u2019 within the meaning of\u2019 the APA, 440 F.2d at 258 n. 4, yields the conclusion that USDA was required to comply fully with section 553 in April, 1972. Appellant asserts that USDA failed to give the required notice and that therefore reversal is mandated on that ground. We disagree. We note first that P.A.M. objected to the 1963 rule on notice grounds, that the district court made adverse findings against appellants on the issue, and that P.A.M. failed to pursue the matter on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 258 n. 5. It appears clear that the crux of this court\u2019s holding was that appellees develop a general statement of purpose, assuming it wished to adhere to its proposed rule. Although striking down the rule itself, the general statement was also the main concern of the district court\u2019s April 21, 1972 Order. 2A. 19-20. USDA has fully complied with those instructions. However, even if we read the district court\u2019s order as appellant does, it is equally possible to interpret USDA\u2019s Statement of April 24th as in compliance with section 553. The reaffirmation of the rule is a republication by reference. 37 Fed.Reg. at 8124 (1972). Previously submitted comments were \u201ccarefully considered.\u201d The statement noted that \u201c[a]ll interested persons have had actual and timely notice of the system for many years.\u201d In light of the above two statements, \u201cit does not appear that further public procedures with respect to this matter would develop any further useful information regarding the matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This provides a statement of reasons for dispensing with notice and public procedures as authorized by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3)(B); that USDA technically violated the statute by failing to include an explicit finding that such procedures were \u201cimpracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest\u201d does not constitute cause for reversal <em>here </em>in light of the conflicting inferences inherent in the court opinions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b335-7\">. Appellant hints that the government has deliberately attempted to destroy it economically. It accuses USDA of \u201cengaging in the crassest type of commercial competitive activity\u201d by \u201centering into head-to-head competition with the private press parties; undercutting prices; [and] copying features, formats and coverage.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 3. However, the district court found that USDA was motivated by technological advances. 2A. 67. There is no finding of fact evidencing that the government engaged in cutthroat competition; instead, the court found that those claims \u201clack merit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74. We do not believe that finding was erroneous and will confine our discussion to the inevitable economic loss resulting from the direct extension service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b336-11\">.
