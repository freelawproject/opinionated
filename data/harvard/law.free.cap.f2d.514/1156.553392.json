The district court held that the Truth in Lending Act did not require Carte Blanche to disclose its method of apportioning payments. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-14\">Defendant-appellee Carte Blanche Corporation (Carte Blanche)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is a national credit card company, which gives to cardholders the privilege of charging items at retail establishments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Non-business retail purchases are recorded in the cardholder\u2019s Carte Blanche <em>general account; </em>are billed on a monthly basis; apparently are not subject to finance charges, and are payable upon receipt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-15\">A cardholder may also use his credit card to purchase airline tickets. Charges incurred for airline ticket purchases are billed in monthly installments under an extended payment plan and, in contrast to general account billings, are subject to finance charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-9\">During the. time period from January 1, 1970 to November 1, 1970, Carte Blanche with its monthly billing statement made the following disclosures with reference to a cardholder\u2019s airline account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-10\">\n<em>\u201cAirline Charges</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a7d-dedup-0\">\n<em>Explanation of Extended Pay Plan</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"avs-dedup-1\">Monthly installments are billed as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-12\">\n<em>Amount of Individual Ticket Monthly Installment</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"arr-dedup-0\">$600 or less <em>Yiz </em>(min. $10 per .mo.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"al9-dedup-0\">$600.01 to $900 \u25a0Us</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aob-dedup-0\">$900.01 or more <em>Yz\u00ed</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-16\">\u201cLarger payments may be made, or the entire remaining balance may be paid at any time without penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-17\">\u201cA monthly finance charge imposed at the periodic rate of 1V2% of the unpaid balance at billing date is added in accordance with tariff filed by airlines. This is an annual percentage rate of 18%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1216-18\">\u201cDefault in any payment due may, at our option, render the entire balance due.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1216-19\">The quoted language makes no mention of how a payment which exceeds the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>airline monthly installment (i.e. an \u201coverpayment\u201d) is applied to the cardholder\u2019s airline and general accounts. During the period in question, unless specifically instructed by the cardholder,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> an <em>airline account </em>overpayment, if less in amount than the total airline account balance then due, was not applied to reduce the airline account. Instead the overpayment was credited to the cardholder\u2019s general account, without regard to whether or not there were any outstanding charges in the cardholder\u2019s general account.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Carte Blanche\u2019s practice in applying an overpayment is best understood by illustration. For our purposes here, we have assumed: (1) an airline charge of $600.00 was incurred by a cardholder; (2) this charge required a monthly installment payment of $50.00, and (3) no specific instruction as to allocation of payments was given to Carte Blanche by the cardholder.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1217-4\">1. <em>Example 1: </em>The cardholder, with a <em>general account </em>balance of $150.00, pays a total of $500.00. The airline account would be credited with $50.00 (thereby leaving an outstanding balance of $550.00 in the airline account upon which finance charges would be incurred). The general account balance of $150.00 would be deemed paid in full. The remainder of the payment made [$500.00 minus ($150.00 + 50.00)], $300.00, would then be credited to the general account for application against future charges and would bear no interest. The remaining $550.00 balance in the airline account would not be reduced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1217-10\">2. <em>Example 2: </em>The cardholder, with no general account balance, pays a total of $550.00. The airline account would be credited with only $50.00 (thereby leaving an outstanding balance of $550.00 in the airline account upon which finance charges would be incurred). The balance of the payment made ($500.00) would be credited to the general account for application against future charges and would not bear interest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1217-11\">The practice in applying airline account overpayments is easily summarized. No advice was given by Carte Blanche to its cardholders that they could direct the allocation of payments between two accounts. Accordingly, unless the cardholder paid the entire airline account balance plus any outstanding general account balance, the airline account would be reduced only by the amount of the minimum monthly installment due. Any overpayment credited to the cardholder\u2019s general account would not bear interest, although the airline account balance remaining unpaid would be subject to finance charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-12\">On August 30, 1971, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, plaintiff-appellant Zeltzer filed this action against Carte Blanche. He alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>that Carte Blanche violated the Truth in Lending Act from January 1, 1970 to November 1, 1970 by failing to disclose its practice in applying overpayments made in connection with a cardholder\u2019s airline account. Carte Blanche moved under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to dismiss the complaint for the following alternative reasons: (1) the court lacked <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction over Carte Blanche by reason of defective service; (2) the complaint failed to set forth a claim for relief under the Truth in Lending Act;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (3) if a claim for relief under the Truth in Lending Act were alleged, plaintiff\u2019s action was barred because it was already included within another purported class action then pending before the same district court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> With the consent of all parties, further proceedings in this case were postponed pending decision of this Court in Katz v. Carte Blanche Corp., 496 F.2d 747 (3rd Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 885, 95 S.Ct. 152, 42 L.Ed.2d 125 (1974). Following decision of this Court in <em>Katz, </em>plaintiff filed an amended complaint<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and moved for class determination pursuant to Fed.R. Civ.P. 23. Thereafter the district court granted summary judgment to Carte Blanche, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c), holding that Carte Blanche was not obligated under the Truth in Lending Act to disclose \u201cthe method of allocating overpayment credits to accounts.\u201d Zeltzer v. Carte Blanche Corp., 375 F.Supp. 717 (W.D.Pa.1974).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-11\">The complaint alleged that the Truth in Lending Act obligated Carte Blanche to disclose the manner in which it applied payments to airline account balances and that Carte Blanche had failed to make these disclosures. Accordingly, we address ourselves to the sole question of whether Carte Blanche disclosed all that it was required to disclose under the Truth in Lending Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-12\"> The Truth in Lending Act requires disclosure of terms and conditions of credit extension under open end credit plans. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637, Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.7. When airline tickets are purchased by a Carte Blanche cardholder on a deferred payment basis, finance charges are imposed upon the balance remaining \u201copen\u201d at the end of each month in the airline account. Hence, the Carte Blanche airline account, unlike Carte Blanche\u2019s general account, is an open end credit plan, for which disclosures are required. <em>See </em>III, <em>infra; </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(i); Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.2(r).</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-13\">The pertinent disclosure provisions of the Act provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-14\">(a) Before opening any account under an open end consumer credit plan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>the creditor shall disclose to the person to whom credit is to be extended each of the following items, to the extent applicable:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-5\">$ sf: H&lt; sf: :js</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-6\">(2) The method of determining the balance upon which a finance charge will be imposed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-7\">jjc !(s $ sf: sfc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-8\">Statement required with each billing cycle</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-9\">(b) The creditor of any account under an open end consumer credit plan shall transmit to the obligor, for each billing cycle at the end of which there is an outstanding balance in that account or with respect to which a finance charge is imposed, a statement setting forth each of the following items to the extent applicable:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-10\">(8) The balance on which the finance charge was computed and a statement of how the balance was determined. If the balance is determined without first deducting all credits during the period, that fact and the amount of such payments shall also be disclosed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-11\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1219-12\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637. Section 105 of the Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604) delegates to the Federal Reserve Board broad regulatory and rulemaking powers to effectuate its purposes. <em>See </em>Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., 411 U.S. 356, 364, 93 S.Ct. 1652, 36 L.Ed.2d 318 (1973); Bone v. Hibernia Bank, 493 F.2d 135, 138 (9th Cir. 1974). Pursuant to the broad powers granted it, the Federal Reserve Board promulgated Regulation Z. The specific disclosures required by Regulation Z, and alleged to have been violated by Carte Blanche, are disclosures to be made on opening a new account,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and disclosures to be made by periodic statements after an account has been opened.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-18\">Referring to the literal words of Regulation Z the district court speculated \u201cthat plaintiff, under this state of facts, [might have] stated a cause of action . . ..\u201d 375 F.Supp. at 720. However, interpreting Regulation Z in accordance with an interpretive ruling of the Federal Reserve Board, the district court held that a cause of action was not so stated. <em>Cf. </em>Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., 411 U.S. at 372, 93 S.Ct. 1652; Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16 \u2014 17 (1965); Bone v. Hibernia Bank, 493 F.2d at 139-40. The district court reached its conclusion without regard to whether disclosure was required under the Act. In so doing, the district court bypassed the question of whether disclosure was mandated and proceeded directly to hold that Carte Blanche\u2019s practice would nevertheless be exempt from disclosure. As a result of this approach, we first deal with the issue of \u201cexemption\u201d under the interpretive ruling and then consider if disclosure is mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-20\">For its holding, the district court emphasized, and apparently relied upon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>just one sentence of the interpretive ruling: <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-4\">(b) In disclosing the method of determining the balance(s) upon which finance charges are computed, it is not necessary to show the method of allocating payments or other credits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.706(b). Our analysis of the entire subsection (b) however, discloses that the interpretive ruling cannot support the district court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">First, when read in full context, subsection (b) limits drastically the scope of the introductory sentence which was central to the district court\u2019s opinion. Subsection (b), through example, narrowly limits the types of charges (\u201clate charges,\u201d \u201coverdue balances,\u201d \u201cinsurance premiums,\u201d etc.) to which payments may be applied without the necessity for disclosure. In this context, the ruling only exempts (by interpretation) a creditor from having to disclose the mechanics involved in allocating credits to those \u201cinternal\u201d charges which, in aggregate, constitute the balance in an <em>open end credit plan. </em>It is evident from the full text of the interpretive ruling<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that the ruling applies only where payments are allocated among <em>charges; </em>it does not apply where, as here, payments are allocated between <em>accounts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-11\">Second, subsection (b) by its express terms, as well as by its title,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> applies solely to open end credit plans. It has no relation or application to payments or credits made with respect to an account which is \u201cother than an open end credit plan.\u201d As we have discussed earlier, an open end credit plan is distinguished from others in that such a plan is subject to finance charges; e. <em>g., </em>Carte Blanche\u2019s airline account. Therefore, as Carte Blanche\u2019s <em>general account </em>is not subject to finance charges, it is an \u201cother than open end credit plan\u201d and is accordingly beyond the reach of subsection (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-12\">Finally, subsection (b) is directed solely to the allocation of monies <em>within </em>an account. It does not encompass the threshold allocation of monies between two distinct accounts. To the extent that subsection (b) comes into play, it does so only <em>after </em>an initial division of monies has been made as between, in this instance, the airline and general accounts. It is only the \u201cinternal\u201d allocation of monies, as distinct from the initial division of monies, which need not be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>Therefore, no matter how broadly the interpretive ruling may be read, it cannot exempt Carte Blanche from disclosing its division of monies between two separate accounts: one, an open end credit plan on which finance charges are imposed; and the other a general account not subject to such charges. It is this very Carte Blanche practice which is at issue here, for when Carte Blanche receives payments from a cardholder without instructions, <em>see </em>p. 1158 &amp; note 5, <em>supra, </em>it unilaterally allocates the payment between the cardholder\u2019s airline and general accounts. <em>See </em>examples at p. 1159 &amp; n.7, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">Having determined, contrary to the district court\u2019s holding, that the interpretive ruling does not exempt Carte Blanche from disclosure of its allocation practice, we now consider whether such a disclosure, if not so exempted, is required by the Truth in Lending Act. For that determination, we turn to the statute. <em>See </em>Philbeck v. Timmers Chevrolet, Inc., 499 F.2d 971 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">It is the declared congressional purpose of the Truth in Lending Act to assure consumers a meaningful disclosure of credit provisions, thus enabling the consumer to compare more readily various available credit terms and to avoid the uninformed use of credit. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>see </em>Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., 411 U.S. at 364, 93 S.Ct. 1652. The language of the Truth in Lending Act requires the creditor of a consumer open end credit plan to disclose the method by which a bal-anee is determined both before the opening of an account and by a periodic statement once the account has been opened. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637(a)(2), (b)(8). Similar disclosure requirements are imposed by the implementing language of Regulation Z. <em>See </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.-7(a)(2), (b)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-11\">Under Carte Blanche\u2019s system of allocation, undisclosed to its cardholders, it is not until the succeeding billing cycle that a cardholder would discover that an airline account overpayment would not be applied to reduce the airline account balance. This we believe is in direct contravention of the express language of the Act which, as noted, requires disclosure of \u201cthe method of determining the balance upon which a finance charge will be imposed.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-12\">The language here quoted is found in that section of the Act pertaining to disclosure before the opening of an account. A corresponding disclosure requirement is imposed upon a creditor once an account has been opened. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637(b)(8). Although the language of (b)(8) is more detailed than that of (a)(2), this difference results only because (b)(8) contemplates the disclosure of transactions which can only occur <em>after </em>an account has been opened. Thus, (b)(8) in full requires a statement setting forth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"au1-dedup-0\">(8) The balance on which the finance charge was computed and a statement of how the balance was determined. <em>If the balance is determined without first deducting all credits during the period, that fact and the amount of such payments shall also be disclosed.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637(b)(8); <em>see </em>Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.7(b)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">Here, under Carte Blanche\u2019s procedure, airline account balances were computed \u201cwithout first deducting all credits during the period.\u201d Under such a practice, a cardholder would be uninformed as to whether monthly payments would or would not be allocated by Carte Blanche as \u201ccredits\u201d to the cardholder\u2019s airline account. The legislative history indicates to us that the crucial objective of the Act was to insure that consumers be afforded access to information so that they could compare the cost of credit. <em>See </em>1968 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News \u00e1t 1970 \u2014 71. In our view, an informed comparison of credit costs, as well as an informed determination of credit use, cannot be made where a creditor does not disclose information concerning the manner in which payments are applied to reduce an outstanding credit balance. It is not realistic to expect that a consumer will be able to make an informed credit decision where, as here, the creditor fails to reveal that payments received will be divided between accounts subject to finance charges and accounts not subject to finance charges.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In the context of Truth in Lending disclosures, we cannot conceive of anything more fundamental than the furnishing of this type of credit information to a credit consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-5\">Even if the statutory language of the Act were less explicit, and even if the announced congressional purpose were less clearly defined, we nonetheless would be obliged by sheer logic to hold that Carte Blanche\u2019s allocation practices are within the scope of the Act\u2019s required disclosure provisions.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, in resolving the issue presented here, we are not obliged to consider an ambiguous statute or an ill-defined congressional purpose. The statutory language before us is explicit and the congressional objective clear. In our view disclosure is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-9\">Inasmuch as we hold that plaintiff\u2019s allegations state facts under which Carte Blanche was required to disclose the manner of its allocation of payments between accounts, the complaint suffices to state a cause of action arising under the Truth in Lending Act. Accordingly, Carte Blanche\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint should not have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-10\">The other grounds for dismissal urged by Carte Blanche in its motion to dismiss (see pp. 1159, 1160 supra) were not ruled upon by the district court in light of its disposition (now held erroneous) of this motion. Hence, on remand those grounds, if renewed, should be considered together with any other issues that may be raised by the parties. We express no opinion as to the disposition of the other issues raised in defendant\u2019s motion, none of which were ruled upon by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-11\">We will reverse the order of April 30, 1974 which dismissed the complaint and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1216-20\">.

As noted in our discussion, see <em>infra </em>at 1159, 1160, the district court properly considered defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss as one for summary judgment inasmuch as the court considered matters outside the pleadings. Carter v. Stanton, 405 U.S. 669, 671, 92 S.Ct. 1232, 31 L.Ed.2d 569 (1972); Tomalewski v. State Farm Life Ins. Co., 494 F.2d 882 (3d Cir. 1973).

If the general account charges are not paid in full within the requisite time period, late charges may be assessed on the overdue unpaid balances. As the plaintiff here does not allege that such late charges are in fact finance charges for which disclosure is required, <em>compare </em>Katz v. Carte Blanche Corp., 496 F.2d at 750 n.2, we do not treat this aspect of Carte Blanche\u2019s practices. <em>Cf. </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.401. It was represented to this Court at oral argument, however, that failure of a cardholder to tender prompt payment after late charges are imposed upon the general account, may result in the account being deemed delinquent, the account being terminated, and collection proceedings being instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-25\">For purposes of this appeal, we assume, as did the parties at oral argument, that a Carte Blanche general account is not subject to finance charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1217-5\">.

Consequently, the cardholder would have an unpaid airline account balance of $550.00, upon which finance charges would be incurred. The cardholder would also have a general account balance of $50.00, which would not be subject to a finance charge, but which would be subject to Carte Blanche\u2019s delinquency account procedures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1217-15\"><em>See </em>Carte Blanche Brief at 19 n.5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">.

By granting summary judgment on the merits to Carte Blanche on the ground that plaintiff\u2019s allegations failed to state a cause of action under the Truth in Lending Act, the district court did not pass upon plaintiff\u2019s motion for class determination.
