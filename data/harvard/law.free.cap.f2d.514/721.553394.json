It is true, as the appellant points out, that it is not necessary to name Larkin as a defendant in order to assert a claim against American Employers as Larkin\u2019s insurer under the Louisiana Direct Action Statute, LSA-R.S. 22:655. Liles\u2019 complaint, however, also failed to allege that American Employers was obligated under a policy that provided coverage of claims against Larkin as well as against his employer, Riblet Products. Nor did it otherwise give notice that American Employer\u2019s was being sued as Larkin\u2019s insurer. Such averments are necessary, at least, to show the district court\u2019s jurisdiction over the subject of the claim. See Rule 9, Fed.R.Civ.P.; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c). Liles\u2019 claim against Larkin or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>against American Employers Insurance Company in its capacity as Larkin\u2019s insurer was not, therefore, raised by the pleadings, was not passed on by the district court, and is not properly before this court on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
