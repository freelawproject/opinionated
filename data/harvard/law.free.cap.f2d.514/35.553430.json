The case was submitted to the court upon a stipulation of facts. We affirm the judgments below.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">Appellants raise seven issues on appeal, of which only one has merit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(1)(c) requires a wiretap applicant to include \u201ca full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried * * *.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(3)(c) further requires the court to find that \u201cnormal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried * * Appellants contend that the government showing was deficient on this point.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>An affidavit by Special Agent Larry Montague was filed in support of the wiretap application. It summarized the evidence produced by the following investigative techniques: physical surveillance of the suspects, inspection of phone company records and police records, a previous wiretap, and the use of informants. Special Agent Montague declared that all informants had stated they would refuse to testify even if granted immunity and he determined that the remaining evidence would not suffice to support a conviction. The affidavit concludes with Montague\u2019s reasons for believing that other investigative procedures would be unlikely to produce usable evidence, specifically the general unwillingness of bookmaking customers to testify and the proclivity of bookmakers to keep unintelligible records, if any, and to destroy them in case of search.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">We agree with appellants that the boilerplate recitation of the difficulties of gathering usable evidence in bookmaking prosecutions is not a sufficient basis for granting a wiretap order. To hold otherwise would make \u00a7 2518(1)(c) and (3)(c) mere formalities in bookmaking cases. However, in this case, agents had engaged in investigation for over three months, including physical surveillance of the suspects, had reasonably established that their informants would not testify, and had reason to believe that the other evidence thus far produced would not support a conviction. Further, physical surveillance of the residence identified by informants as housing the four \u201cfront office\u201d telephones disclosed that it was fronted by a 5-foot high chain link fence topped by 3-stranded barb wire and had two large dogs patrolling the area between house and fence. Thus the government demonstrated a factual basis for its concern that the suspects might have time and inclination to destroy evidence in case of search.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">While this Court gives little weight to conclusionary statements about the likely outcome of future investigations, we also recognize that the law does not require that a wiretap be used only as a last resort. On balance we find that the affidavit submitted in this case, while marginal, does suffice to meet the requirements of \u00a7 2518(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-8\">. A discussion of the other six issues follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">1. Appellants contend that \u00a7 1955 cannot constitutionally be applied to them, because the government stipulated that investigation had disclosed no contacts with organized crime, interstate gamblers or police corruption. Our decision in United States v. Sacco, 491 F.2d 995 (9th Cir. 1974), disposed of this contention. \u201cIf the class of activities is within the reach of the federal power and the regulation imposed is reasonable, a court\u2019s investigation is concluded. There is no need for inquiring on a case-by-case basis or proof that a particular activity had an effect on commerce, [citations omitted]\u201d 491 F.2d at 999. This holding that \u00a7 1955 is a valid exercise of Congressional power under the Interstate Commerce Clause disposes of appellants\u2019 Tenth Amendment objections that the statute impermissibly invades the reserved powers of the states.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">2. Appellants claim that the classification of \u00a7 1955 violations as felonies violates equal protection since the very same conduct might only result in a misdemeanor conviction in state court. (See Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 337a.) Congress\u2019 power to proscribe conduct carries with it the power to impose appropriate penalties without attempting to match them to varying state punishments for similar conduct. Hence, the potentially different treatment of \u00a7 1955 violators as compared to California Penal Code \u00a7 337a violators raises no cognizable equal protection infringement nor does it invade any power reserved under the Tenth Amendment to the state to prosecute violations of penal laws within its borders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-11\">3. Appellant Kerrigan\u2019s assertion that her prior state conviction was for the exact same conduct as the federal indictment is not clear from the stipulated facts. Her further contention that the double jeopardy clause makes it a bar to the federal prosecution is completely contrary to law. Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S. 187, 195, 79 S.Ct. 666, 3 L.Ed.2d 729 (1959); see Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121, 136-158, 79 S.Ct. 676, 3 L.Ed.2d 684 (1959).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-16\">4. Appellant Berk asserts that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he \u201cconducted\u201d an illegal gambling business. The evidence of his activity in settling bets and in disseminating a phone number and code name for placing bets was substantial; thus, the lower court properly concluded that the test of <em>Sacco, supra, </em>491 F.2d at 1002-1003, had been met.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-17\">5. Appellants\u2019 convictions were based in large part on evidence gained through two court-ordered wiretaps. Appellants\u2019 claim of privilege for the wiretapped conversations is based upon a wholly unsupportable construction of both California Penal Code \u00a7 631 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517(4). We find no basis for believing that California attempted to prohibit the use of federally authorized wiretaps in federal prosecutions, or that Congress intended to sanction such a prohibition by the preservation of privilege set forth at \u00a7 2517(4).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-18\">6. Appellants claim that the United States Attorneys making the wiretap applications failed to use independent judgment in determining the need for the interceptions, as required by United States v. Giordano, 416 U.S. 505, 515, 94 S.Ct. 1820, 40 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974). The application disclosed that the United States Attorneys fulfilled their obligations by engaging in extensive .discussions with special FBI agents assigned to the case as well as officials of the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section, Criminal Division, Department of Justice, prior to making the wiretap application.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b95-19\">. The issue of whether the Attorney General\u2019s automatic signature upon recommendation of a Deputy Assistant Attorney General constitutes compliance with the further requisites of <em>Giordano </em>was alluded to in appellants\u2019 reply brief. However, since it was neither raised in appellants\u2019 initial brief nor urged at oral argument, we do not consider it one of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
