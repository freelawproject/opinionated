Counsel further advised the Court in Jones\u2019 presence that he intended to solicit Jones\u2019 wishes in reference to further questioning of the witness and expressed the view that \u201cat that time, perhaps, I may come to the Court with a request to recall him.\u201d The Court thereupon called a recess and subsequently, again in the absence of the jury, addressed Jones directly informing him of his right to be present during his trial, as well as his right to \u201cstay back in the cell block\u201d and be tried in absentia if that were his wish.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-17\">Jones, who did not express to the Court any dissatisfaction with his counsel, replied that he would \u201crather be in the cell block.\u201d The Court, 'after ascertaining that Jones understood that his voluntary absence would not abort the proceedings, made further inquiry of him regarding his wish to be in the cell block by specifically asking him if he \u201cwould like to tell the Court why you would like to be in the cell block?\u201d, to which he replied in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-18\">During the same colloquy the Court advised Jones of his right to testify or not as he chose, suggesting that he exercise such choice based upon his own inclination and advice of counsel. After some further colloquy between the Court and counsel, Jones acknowledged once again that his exclusion from the courtroom was his own desire as was his decision not to testify. Whereupon the defendant Jones left the courtroom, and at his counsel\u2019s request a further recess was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>granted so that he might \u201cattempt to get him to change his mind.\u201d Counsel subsequently reported to the Court that his client was reclining on a bench and indicated no interest in further conferences with counsel. The defense offered no evidence and the jury returned the guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-4\">Prior to the jury\u2019s return, the defendant\u2019s counsel informed the Court that his client did not wish to be present to hear the verdict, and described Jones\u2019 views as being that he felt the government\u2019s witnesses were untruthful and he was \u201cso exercised about the whole thing that he thereafter just did not want to participate in the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-5\">Jones contends that the trial judge erred (a) in not making a \u201csearching inquiry\u201d into the basis of his dissatisfaction with trial counsel, and (b) by failing to inform him of his right to conduct his defense \u201cpro se.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-6\">We do not find from this record any failure on the part of the trial court warranting a reversal of this case, and hence we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-7\">It should be noted that nowhere in this record did Jones express to the Court any dissatisfaction with his trial counsel. Although given ample opportunity to address himself to the reasons for his apparent disinterest in participating further in the trial, the defendant chose not to give any explanation. The only reasonable explanation for defendant\u2019s conduct, we believe, is that given by his counsel to the effect that defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-8\">seemed to think that the Government\u2019s witnesses were telling untruths about him and he became very exercised about that fact, and despite my assurances to him that he could take the stand and contradict them, and leave it up to the jury as to who would be believed, for some reason or another he was so exercised about the whole thing that he thereafter just did not want to participate in the trial. (Tr. 129.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1391-9\">Indeed, immediately prior to the Government\u2019s calling its last witness, the defendant, being addressed by the Court in reference to the replacement of a juror with an alternate juror for reasons not material to the instant issue, advised the Court that his counsel spoke for him and that he concurred in his counsel\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-11\">To now, in the face of this record, claim a dissatisfaction with counsel giving rise to an obligation on the part of the trial judge to advise him of his right to proceed propria persona appears, at this late stage, as wishful hindsight. Jones was given every reasonable opportunity by the trial court to express any desire that he may have had to have his counsel relieved, or to have articulated any reasons, other than those expressed by his counsel, as to the basis of his alleged dissatisfaction with his attorney\u2019s effectiveness. His failure to so do gave no rise to an occasion for the trial judge to advise him of his right to proceed propria persona.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-12\">In the absence of circumstances, as in the instant case, giving rise to an indication of a desire on the part of the defendant to proceed without counsel, there was no duty on the trial court to advise him of his right to so proceed. United States v. White, 139 U.S.App.D.C. 32, 429 F.2d 711, 712 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-13\">We do not deal here with a situation where a defendant either in person or through counsel alerts a trial court to the reasonable conclusion that he desires to proceed without counsel. On the record before this Court, the defendant opted not to respond to the Court\u2019s invitation to state why he would like to be in the cell block. He was fully advised of his right to remain in the Court during the trial as well as the fact that he would be tried in absentia if that were his wish. On this record his dissatisfaction with counsel was limited to counsel\u2019s cross-examination of a witness. In the absence of any other evidence, we conclude that the trial court was fully advised of the alleged dissatisfaction and the reason therefor. The case did not proceed until the Court had given the defendant an adequate opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>articulate any reason for his desire to remain in the cell block. This he declined to do and he cannot now be heard to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-4\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on Brown v. United States, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 77, 264 F.2d 363, cert. denied, 360 U.S. 911, 79 S.Ct. 1299, 3 L.Ed.2d 1262 (1959), is misplaced. <em>Brown </em>was a case factually and legally different from the instant one. Unlike <em>Brown, </em>no request was made nor indication given that Jones desired a discharge of trial counsel. Indeed, as we have already pointed out, Jones had, shortly before the Court was advised of his having expressed dissatisfaction with counsel\u2019s cross-examination of a witness, advised the Court that his counsel spoke for him. Unlike <em>Brown, </em>Jones was personally addressed by the Court soliciting reasons for his apparent desire not to personally participate further in the trial. The issues in the instant case, unlike <em>Brown, </em>do not go to whether Jones had a right to dispense with the services of his counsel and proceed in propria persona. The contention here goes not to the right to have his counsel relieved but whether the Court failed to make appropriate inquiry as to the grounds of dissatisfaction, if any, and whether under the circumstances the Court erred in failing to, sua sponte, advise him of his right to proceed in propria persona.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-5\">That Jones had a right to so proceed is unquestioned. See United States v. Dougherty, 154 U.S.App.D.C. 76, 473 F.2d 1113 (1973). See also Brown v. United States, <em>supra, </em>at 369 \u2014 70 (Washington, J., dissenting); Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U.S. 269, 279, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1942); and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1654. The right to proceed in propria persona, whether it be founded on a constitutional or statutory right, is one which must be timely asserted and accompanied by a valid waiver of counsel. See United States v. Dougherty, <em>supra, </em>at 1123. Neither element is present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-7\">Not the slightest issue referring to counsel arose until the Government had rested its case. The record is devoid of any indication that there was further evidence to be adduced by either the prosecution or the defense. Jones, after being personally advised by the Court of his right to testify or to remain silent, chose the latter. He gave no indication of a desire that his counsel be removed; hence it follows there was no duty on the Court under the circumstances of this case to advise him of his right to proceed propria persona and this be so regardless of its source. To hold otherwise would be to require that the Court in every instance, whether a defendant has counsel or not, so advise a defendant. No case has so held, and we decline any such invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-8\">The issue here is resolved by the language of Judge Fahy of this Circuit in United States v. White, 429 F.2d 712, wherein the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-9\">Nor do we find error in the circumstances of this case in the omission of the trial court to advise appellant of his right to proceed pro se. We need not resolve the question whether this right has constitutional status \u2014 see the opinions in Brown v. United States, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 77, 264 F.2d 363 (en banc), cert. denied, 360 U.S. 911, 79 S.Ct. 1299, 3 L.Ed.2d 1262 (1959) \u2014 for, whether or not, the situation here did not require such advice. Appellant gave no indication of a desire to proceed without counsel. He made no request to be permitted to do so. In expressing dissatisfaction with appointed counsel he was appealing rather to the discretion of the court to substitute another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1392-10\">The convictions must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
