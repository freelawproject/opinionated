For all purposes as to this appeal, Edgar McCord, t/a Mac\u2019s Cities Service, is deemed petitioner and John F. Cephas, deceased, is deemed the respondent.</p>\n<author id=\"b256-24\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"Af1\">John F. Cephas was shot during a holdup at Edgar McCord\u2019s service station on December 29, 1968, and died of his wounds three days later. On January 15, 1969, his widow filed a claim for death benefits under the Longshore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>men\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, as amended, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq., which was adopted as the District of Columbia\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 36 D.C.Code \u00a7 501. Mrs. Cephas alleged that her late husband was employed by McCord and that he had died as a result of accidental injuries received within the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">McCord denied that Cephas had ever been in his employ. The deputy commissioner held a formal hearing on the claim on September 20, 1972, at which McCord did not appear, and issued a compensation order on October 13, 1972. On January 31, 1973, with advice of counsel, McCord filed a petition for modification pursuant to section 22 of the Act, alleging that the deputy commissioner\u2019s finding of employment was based upon a mistake of fact. The deputy commissioner decided that according to the 1972 amendments to the Act, P.L. 92 \u2014 576, 86 Stat. 1251, his own formal hearing powers had been transferred to the Administrative Law Judges in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554. Having found McCord\u2019s petition timely, he therefore referred the matter to the Office of the Administrative Law Judges of the Department of Labor for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Before the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) all parties were represented by counsel. The transcript of the hearing before the deputy commissioner was accepted into evidence. Based upon that record, and the representations made to him, the ALJ issued a new order on March 26, 1974, terminating, vacating and setting aside the deputy commissioner\u2019s compensation order and denying Mrs. Cephas\u2019 claim on the ground that the finding of employment was erroneous and contrary to fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Mrs. Cephas appealed the decision of the ALJ to the new Benefits Review Board, an agency created by the amend-atory legislation of 1972. The Board vacated the decision of the ALJ on grounds that the order surpassed his jurisdiction, and reinstated the original compensation order of the deputy commissioner directing McCord to pay Mrs. Cephas all death benefits and funeral expenses on August 16, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">McCord has filed a Petition For Review in this court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">(c) Any. person adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order of the Board may obtain a review of that order in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the injury occurred, by filing in such court within sixty days following the issuance of such Board order a written petition praying that the' order be modified or set aside.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">Petitioner McCord joined the Benefits Review Board as a party respondent, and this order is upon a motion of the Board \u201cTo Dismiss Petition For Review As to the Benefits Review Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">Clearly, the statute directs, again at 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c), that the Clerk of this court, upon filing a Petition For Review of a final order of the Board, shall transmit a copy of the Petition to the Board:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-13\">A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court, to the Board, and to the other parties, and thereupon the Board shall file in the court the record in the proceedings as provided in section 2112 of Title 28. Upon such filing, the court shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and shall have the power to give a decree affirming, modifying, or setting aside, in whole or in part, the order of the Board and enforcing same to the extent that such order is affirmed or modified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>At issue in the Board\u2019s unopposed motion is whether the command of the statute intends only notice to the Board, so that it may properly deliver up the record, or requires that it be joined as a party and compelled to participate in litigation over the propriety of its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">In arguing that it has been improperly made a party to this appeal, the Board makes three cogent arguments. First, under the statute, transmittal of the record confers plenary power upon the court of appeals, and any order framed in the interest of justice can be carried out without any action by the Benefits Review Board. We concur. Second, no jurisdictional hurdle to the effective adjudication of the appeal is raised by deletion of the Board as a party. The rationale of Rule 15(a), Fed.R.App.P., which requires that in review of an order of an administrative agency, board, commission or officer \u201cthe agency shall be named respondent,\u201d is here inapplicable. Normally, a single private party is contesting the action of an agency, which agency must appear and defend on the merits to insure the proper adversarial clash requisite to a \u201ccase or controversy.\u201d But Rule 1(b), Fed.R.App.P., says that \u201c[t]hese rules shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals as established by law.\u201d Here, there is sufficient adversity between McCord and Mrs. Cephas to insure proper litigation without participation by the Board. To require the Board to appear as a party would parallel requiring the District Court to appear and defend its decision upon direct appeal. Further, the Supreme Court has held that indispensability of parties is to turn on practical considerations. Shaughnes-sy v. Pedreiro, 349 U.S. 48, 54, 75 S.Ct. 591, 99 L.Ed. 693 (1955); Williams v. Fanning, 332 U.S. 490, 68 S.Ct. 188, 92 L.Ed. 95 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The Board\u2019s third and primary contention is that the statute in no wise requires the Board to be a <em>party </em>to proceedings for review of its actions. Determination of this question turns upon our interpretation of one sentence from the above-cited statute: \u201cA copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court, to the Board, and to the other parties, and thereupon the Board shall file in the court the record in the proceedings as provided in section 2112 of Title 28.\u201d We perceive that Congress did not intend by the reference to \u201cother parties\u201d to infer that \u201cthe Board\u201d was to be one of the parties to the proceeding. Rather that portion of the sentence was to be interpreted as though it read \u201cto the Board, and to the parties <em>other than the petitioner.\u201d </em>If we were to interpret \u201cto the Board, and to the other parties\u201d to mean that Congress intended the Board to be a party, we would be construing such provisions as though they read \u201cto the Board, and to the parties <em>other than the Board.\u201d </em>Such construction would require the Clerk of this court to send a copy of the petition back to the petitioner himself, clearly a useless, duplicative act. We thus believe that the better reading of the statute is as we have stated above. That Congress intended such reading is supported by the punctuation used. Placement of a comma and repetition of the word \u201cto\u201d between \u201cthe Board\u201d and \u201cthe other parties\u201d indicates a desire to separate them. Had the phrase' read \u201cto the Board and the other parties,\u201d without a comma, the contrary interpretation would be more supportable. We are therefore confident that the statute does not intend that the Board be made a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Despite the arguable literal applicability of Rule 15(a), Fed.R.App.P., it is clear that a requirement that the Benefits Review Board litigate herein as a party would merely burden the time and resources of that agency. We accordingly treat the motion as a motion to dismiss the Board as a party respondent, and have granted this motion. The Ninth Circuit has acted similarly in two recent cases. Westfall v. Benefits Review Board, Reichart v. Benefits Review Board, et al. (No. 73-2578 &amp; No. 73-2579, 9th Cir. Dec. 5, 1973); Walker v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Benefits Review Board, et al., American Motorists Insurance Co. v. Benefits Review Board (No. 74 \u2014 1340 &amp; No. 74-1494, 9th Cir. Aug. 9, 1974) (unreported).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\">. The Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, United States Department of Labor, has also petitioned this court for review of the Board\u2019s order of August 16, 1974, under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c). In that case, however. the Benefits Review Board was not named a party respondent. Therefore, the instant motion does not reach that petition although both cases were consolidated unde-this court\u2019s order of December 30, 1974, pe Bazelon, C.

Judge Richey refused to enjoin further proceedings, and the civil litigation has been held in abeyance pending disposition of the instant review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
