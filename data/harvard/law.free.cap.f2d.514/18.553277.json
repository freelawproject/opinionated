Edward Lumbard, United States Circuit sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b77-11\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b77-12\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">Marshall Andre Kelly, a California state prisoner, petitioned the United States District Court for a writ of habe-as corpus. He urged as grounds for relief prosecutorial misconduct during his state court trial. The district court denied him relief, and he has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-14\">Kelly is black, and the charge was forcible rape. In these circumstances, the district attorney\u2019s exhortation in a closing argument to the jury to \u201c[tjhink about the consequences of letting a guilty man, a man guilty of a serious and rather horrible crime, go free. Because maybe the next time it won\u2019t be a little black girl from the other side of the tracks; maybe it will be somebody that you know; maybe it will be somebody that I know. And maybe the next time he\u2019ll use the knife. . . .\u201d constituted a highly inflammatory and wholly impermissible appeal to racial prejudice. (R. 29-30) Guilty verdicts must, of course, be based upon solid evidence, not upon appeals to emotion. <em>See </em>United States ex rel. Haynes v. McKendrick, 481 F.2d 152 (2nd Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-17\">Moreover, the district attorney violated the <em>Griffin </em>rule. (Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965).)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-18\">The charge being rape brought the accused and his role in the alleged affair into particularly sharp focus. And although the district attorney did not directly comment that Kelly had not taken the witness chair to deny or give his version of the affair, her repeated assertions to the effect that the alleged victim\u2019s testimony of non-consent stood unchallenged \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d (Hayes v. United States, 368 F.2d 814, 816 (9th Cir. 1966)) emphasized Kelly\u2019s testimonial silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-19\">Finally, the district attorney\u2019s peroration that \u201cIf you can\u2019t find the defendant guilty on the facts that I have presented to you, I feel like I just might as well, you know, close up shop and go home . . . .\u201d was not only a highly improper expression of personal opinion but constituted a veiled threat to the jury to return a guilty verdict. The trial judge\u2019s prompt direction to disregard at most lessened the force of the district attorney\u2019s declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-21\">We are not prepared to hold that any one of these improper comments and inflammatory statements during the argument to the jury destroyed or materially impaired the fact finder\u2019s fairness and impartiality. But we deem manifest the conclusion that, taken together, they operated to deny Kelly a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-22\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>with directions to grant Kelly a writ of habeas corpus releasing him from custody, unless the State of California, within 90 days from the date of the filing of the remand, grants Kelly a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
