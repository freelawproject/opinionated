No. 56 (1974); and</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-22\">On review of the briefs and records in this proceeding and finding therein substantial evidence on the whole record to support the findings of fact of the Administrative Law Judge and the Board; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-23\">Further noting that the legal conclusion arrived at by the Administrative Law Judge and the Board to the effect that the company\u2019s insistence upon a penalty clause being added to an otherwise agreed upon contract represented insistence upon a nonmandatory subject where good faith bargaining had resulted in an agreement upon all mandatory subjects and was therefore unlawful; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-24\">That said conclusion is directly supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in NLRB v. Wooster Division of Borg-Warner Corp., 356 U.S. 342, 78 S.Ct. 718, 2 L.Ed.2d 823 (1958). .</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-25\">Now, therefore, the petition for enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
