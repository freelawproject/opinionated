The case is remanded to the District Court to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>appellees, in the first instance, to make that decision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b918-4\">1. It is clear that a comprehensive impact statement is required for \u201cbroad agency programs\u201d as well as for \u201cparticular facilities.\u201d Scientists\u2019 Institute for Public Information, Inc. v: AEC (SIPI), 156 U.S.App.D.C. 395, 481 F.2d 1079 (1973). The courts will look beyond agency denials to see if, in fact, a \u201cbroad agency program\u201d is under way or proposed. <em>Infra, </em>169 U.S.App.D.C. at -, -, 514 F.2d at 870-875.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b918-7\">2. Here appellees\u2019 course of conduct and public statements over the past five years, as well as the findings of the District Court, prove beyond doubt that a broad agency program, regional development of the Northern Great Plains, is contemplated and that plans for controlling that development are being formulated. <em>Infra, </em>169 U.S.App.D.C. at ----, 514 F.2d at 875-878.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b918-9\">3. While federal officials are entitled to dream out loud without filing an impact statement, a statement is required when a proposal moves beyond the \u201cdream\u201d stage into some tangible form of sufficient ripeness. The standard of ripeness is low because the statement should be prepared before irretrievable commitments are made or options precluded by agency action. The statement is designed to aid agency decision-making, not to provide <em>ex post facto </em>justification for it. <em>Infra, </em>169 U.S.App. D.C. at---, 514 F.2d at 878-880.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b918-11\">4. Four balancing tests are adopted from <em>SIPI </em>to determine if the time is ripe for an impact statement. Application of those tests in this case produces an uncertain result. Since certain dis-positive elements of the balancing test, now uncertain, are about to be resolved, the case is remanded to the District Court to allow appellees initially to decide whether an impact statement is now necessary. <em>Infra, </em>169 U.S.App.D.C. at ---, 514 F.2d at 880-882.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b918-12\">5. On remand, appellees must report to the District Court the present posture of their plans for development of the Northern Great Plains and their decision regarding the present need for an impact statement. Appellants will be able to challenge appellees\u2019 decision. <em>Infra, </em>169 U.S.App.D.C. at---, 514 F.2d at 882-883.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b918-16\">'6. This court\u2019s limited temporary injunction is continued pending appel-lees\u2019 decision. Adoption by appellees of a policy of restraint with regard to development of the Northern Great Plains pending ultimate decision and preparation of a comprehensive impact statement may make enlargement of the injunction unnecessary. <em>Infra, </em>169 U.S. App.D.C. at----, 514 F.2d at 883.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b918-19\">The District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for appellees is reversed and this case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b918-20\">MacKinnon, Circuit Judge, filed the dissenting opinion.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b918-22\">Bruce J.

SKELLY WRIGHT.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-19\">Dissenting opinion filed by Circuit Judge MacKINNON.</p>\n<author id=\"b919-20\">J. SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b919-21\">Appellants brought suit in District Court seeking declaratory judgment, injunction, and mandamus against the federal appellees, the Departments of the Interior, the Army, and Agriculture, alleging that appellees had violated Section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2), by allowing development of coal resources in the Northern Great Plains without issuing a comprehensive environmental impact statement (EIS) for the region. We must decide whether appellees\u2019 attempts to control development of coal resources in four western states constitute a major federal action within the meaning of Section 102(2), and, if so, whether those attempts are sufficiently developed to require the filing of a comprehensive regional impact statement. Answering the first question in the affirmative, we reverse the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the federal appellees and remand this case to give the federal appel-lees the opportunity to decide the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b919-23\">The Northern Great Plains Province (the Province), which covers northeastern Wyoming, eastern Montana, western North Dakota, and western South Dakota, and extends southerly through strips of Nebraska and Colorado, is one of the world\u2019s richest basins of relatively untapped coal reserves.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Most of the coal in the Province is located in the Fort Union and Powder River formations, which occupy the four northernmost states. The coal resting under those plains is highly desirable because it is of low sulphur content, which makes it environmentally preferable, and because it is relatively close to the surface, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>makes it readily accessible by strip mining. Since some 85 per cent of the nation\u2019s low-sulphur coal reserves is located on public land under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior, prudent development of this valuable national asset is largely subject to federal initiative and control. In recent years, as concern about greater national self-sufficiency in energy matters has mounted, steps toward such development in the Province have been taken. But while the coal reserves of the Province are in great demand, both over the long and the short term,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the massive development of the area necessary to secure, utilize, and deliver those resources necessarily entails broad environmental consequences. In addition to the obvious environmental effects of strip-mining acres of now-fertile land, development would also affect the region\u2019s water supply and quality, air quality, wildlife, population distribution and composition, and economic structure. These effects would be caused not only by the mines themselves, but by the power plants, coal gasification plants, railroads, aqueducts, pumping plants, reservoirs, dams, and new housing that would necessarily accompany the strip mines.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-14\">Needless to say, such development under federal auspices demands compliance with NEPA\u2019s dictate than an impact statement accompany all proposals for \u201cmajor Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment * * *.\u201d Section 102(2)(C), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See generally </em>Scientists\u2019 Institute for Public Information, Inc. v. AEC (SIPI), 156 U.S.App.D.C. 395, 481 F.2d 1079 (1973); Natural Resources Defense Council v. Morton, 148 U.S.App.D.C. 5, 458 F.2d 827 (1972); Greene County Planning Board v. FPC, 2 Cir., 455 F.2d 412 (1971), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 849, 93 S.Ct. 56, 34 L.Ed.2d 90 (1972); Calvert Cliffs\u2019 Coordinating Committee, Inc. v. AEC, 146 U.S.App.D.C. 33, 449 F.2d 1109 (1971). The Secretary of the Interior has shown concern over developing the coal reserves of the Province in a responsible manner consistent with NEPA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> NEPA, he recognized, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>might demand comprehensive development of the Province and a more comprehensive analysis of environmental impact therein than would be produced by impact statements designed for individual mines. Thus on May 26, 1970 the Secretary initiated the North Central Power Study, an attempt to coordinate energy development throughout the North Central States. While unfavorable private response to the Study resulted in its termination, Finding of Fact (Fdg.) 13, Appendix (App.) 237, the Secretary continued to acknowledge that development should be based upon comprehensive, rather than piecemeal, action. Affidavit of Secretary Morton, App. 194. Accordingly, on June 30, 1972 he ordered a massive federal-state inter-agency study, now known as the Northern Great Plains Resources Program (NGPRP), to assess the potential social, economic, and environmental impacts that development of the Province would cause. Secretary Morton wrote to his Assistant Secretaries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-5\">The vast reserves of coal in the Fort Union Region of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming provide an excellent opportunity for this Department to demonstrate how a responsible Federal agency can manage resource development with proper regard for environmental protection. It is important that we not lose this opportunity by engaging in single-purpose studies which are incapable of developing comprehensive information or by taking piecemeal actions which restrict our future options.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">App. 73. The NGPRP was designed to \u201ccoordinate on-going activities and build a policy framework which might help guide resource management decisions in the future.\u201d News Release, Oct. 3, 1972, App. 201. Pending its completion, the Secretary suspended a project, the Montana-Wyoming Aqueducts Study, designed to assess the availability of water for development of the vast coal resources. Fdg. 17, App. 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">In addition to concern about development of the Province, the Secretary was also concerned about national development of a coal-leasing policy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In early 1973 he determined that a national impact statement on proposed federal coal leasing was necessary, and that pending issuance of this coal programmatic statement, no coal leases would be issued except pursuant to a short-term coal-leasing policy announced to the public on February 17, 1973.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> News Release, Feb. 17, 1973, App. 196; Affidavit of Secretary Morton, App. 191; Fdgs. 15 \u2014 18, App. 237 \u2014 239. The purpose of the coal programmatic statement, now in draft form, is \u201cto provide a national overview of the impact of the entire Federal coal leasing program on the quality of the human environment.\u201d Affidavit of Secretary Morton, App. 191; Fdg. 15, App. 237 \u2014 238. It will supplement, as necessary, \u201cappropriate impact reporting on a regional basis or for individual leases.\u201d News Release, Feb. 17, 1973, App. 197. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>Besides suspending issuance of leases, the Secretary also determined to suspend issuance of any coal prospecting permits until further notice. Secretarial Order 2952, February 13, 1973, App. 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">While these suspension policies are nationwide, they apply only to federal approval of mine leases and prospecting permits. As was suggested above, however, development of the Northern Great Plains to accommodate the coal mines is not so limited in scope. In recognition of the broader, yet inescapably environmentally related, activities accompanying coal development, the Secretary has sharply restricted federal approval of any related action in the Province pending issuance of the NGPRP interim report. According to Secretary Morton,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"avs-dedup-0\">the granting or approval of leases, special use permits and all types of rights-of-way across public lands, the delivery and sale of water and approval of mining plans relating to coal development in the Northern Great Plains will be held in abeyance pending the availability of the interim report from the NGPRP study or submitted to the Under Secretary for review and concurrence prior to execution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Affidavit of Secretary Morton, App. 194; <em>see </em>Fdg. 25, App. 241. The draft interim NGPRP report was issued September 27, 1974, Supp. Fdg. 5, and the final interim report is expected to issue in February 1975. Answer of Secretary Morton to Plaintiff\u2019s Revised Supp. Interrogatories, Ans. No. 24 (hereinafter Supp. Int. to Secretary Morton).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">Despite Interior\u2019s announced moratorium on leases, prospecting permits, and other activities subject to its approval in the Province, some federal activity continues in the Northern Great Plains. Other federal agencies, all appellees here, are \u2022 to some extent responsible. The Department of Agriculture has jurisdiction over issuance of rights-of-way over lands within the national forests, and the Army Corps of Engineers has jurisdiction over the navigable rivers. While both agencies refused to consider applications for permits or rights-of-way prior to June 30, 1974, they are now both accepting applications and willing to grant them. Agriculture has received four applications for rights-of-way over lands in the Northern Great Plains within the national forests,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the Corps of Engineers has pending one application for a right-of-way over navigable rivers within the region.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, since June 30, 1974 the Corps has issued two permits for structures in the navigable waters within the Northern Great Plains,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and has pending two applications for such permits.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-12\">More importantly, the announced restrictions placed by Interior on development of the Province have some large loopholes through which federal activity can proceed. In summary form, they are as follows: (1) the short-term leasing program applies only to new leases and does not interfere with the Department\u2019s ability to approve mining plans for preexisting leases in the area; (2) some leases may be issued under the short-term leasing policy itself; and (3) feder<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>al activity in the Province is not really suspended pending issuance of the NGPRP, but rather can continue upon the approval of the Under Secretary. The first and third of these loopholes are the largest. In the states of Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota (the four-state area),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> there are 95 outstanding leases with a total acreage of 196,652 acres not subject to an approved mining plan; likewise there are nine outstanding leases on Indian lands with a total of 76,650 acres. Supp. Int. to Secretary Morton, Ans. No. 14. Mining plans can be approved for these leases, and mining can begin thereon, upon the concurrence of the Under Secretary.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Since the short-term leasing policy began, at least four mining plans, one on Indian lands,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> have been approved, and approval of four more mines in the Eastern Powder River coal basin is pending.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Environmental impact statements have been issued for most of these plans.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Approval is pending as well for eight other mining plans, one of which covers Indian lands, in the four-state area. Supp. Int. to Secretary Morton, Ans. No. 16. In addition to ongoing approval of mining plans, Interior has previously approved plans for 29 leases issued by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), only half of which are operational.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> These mines can begin operation without further federal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">Moreover, despite the short-term leasing program, there are exceptions to the leasing moratorium. The program allows a lease to be issued</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-11\">(a) When coal is needed now to maintain an existing mining operation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-12\">(b) When coal is needed as a reserve for production in the near future;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>(c) When the land to be mined will in all cases be reclaimed in accordance with lease stipulations that will provide for environmental protection and land reclamation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-5\">(d) When an environmental impact statement covering the proposed lease has been prepared when required under the National Environmental Policy Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">News Release, Feb. 17, 1973, App. 196\u2014 197; Fdg. 18, App. 238 \u2014 239. Since institution of the program, four leases have been issued throughout the nation, although none are in the Northern Great Plains. Supp. Fdg. 1. Nonetheless, there are 42 competitive lease applications pending in the four-state region for a total of 272,126 acres, and 80 preference right leases pending in the region for a total of 201,668 acres. Supp. Int. to Secretary Morton, Ans. Nos. 7 &amp; 8. Interior has proved willing to apply the exception to the leasing moratorium in the Northern Great Plains. On July 9, 1974 the Department offered for sale a lease covering approximately 320 acres south of Stanton, North Dakota. The lease was not issued only because no bids were received. Supp. Int. to Secretary Morton, Ans. No. 2. Despite the number of pending applications, however, Interi- or says it is not now considering offering any further leases in the Province under the short-term leasing program. <em>Id., </em>Ans. No. 3. The Secretary anticipates that the short-term leasing program will continue in effect \u201cat least until after the issuance of the final coal programmatic EIS and the development of a planning system to determine the size, timing and location of future coal leases.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>Ans. No. 4. The final coal programmatic statement is expected to issue shortly. <em>Id., </em>Ans. No. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Lastly, Interior has power over development of projects in the Northern Great Plains that are very closely tied to any future development of the Province\u2019s coal resources. These powers are not affected by the short-term coal-leasing policy, and are limited only by the Secretary\u2019s stated forbearance pending issuance of the NGPRP, a forbearance that evaporates upon the Under Secretary\u2019s approval of a stated project. Thus, in addition to the pending mining plans discussed above, there are now pending before the Department 14 applications for coal-related rights-of-way across the Northern Great Plains. <em>Id., </em>Ans. No. 21. Two coal-related rights-of-way have been granted since June 30, 1974 in the four-state region, but both are outside the Northern Great Plains. <em>Id., </em>Ans. No. 20. Additionally, a total of 41 applications are now pending before the Department, the Corps of Engineers, or both, for option contracts for water in the Province, although no such contracts have been executed since July 1971.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Well over two million acre feet of annual water use are at stake. Supp. Fdg. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">In sum, there are pending applications for mine leases and mining plans, for rights-of-way over public lands, navigable waterways, and national forests, and for water rights in federally-controlled waters throughout the Northern Great Plains. Few such applications have been granted in the last two years as the Secretary has studied the preferred development of the region. Yet the time' when action will be taken is close at hand. The final coal programmatic EIS and the final interim report of the NGPRP will issue shortly, if they have not issued already. The flood of applications will then be ripe for approval, and the massive development of the Northern Great Plains will begin.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">Plaintiffs-appellants are a collection of organizations interested in protection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>the environment. They brought suit on behalf of themselves and their members, <em>see </em>Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972), on June 13, 1973, charging that the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, and the Army (the federal appellees) had authorized development of coal resources in the Northern Great Plains Region (the Region), defined as northeastern Wyoming, eastern Montana, and the western Dakotas, in violation of NEPA. Specifically, appellants charged that NEPA precluded development of the Region except after preparation of a comprehensive environmental impact statement, systematic interdisciplinary studies of coal development, and a study of appropriate alternative courses of action. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(A), (C), and (D). Appellants sought a declaratory judgment that NEPA was being violated, an injunction barring future federal action in the Region until the requirements of NEPA were met, and an order compelling the federal appellees to comply with NEPA. Complaint at 22 \u2014 23, App. 22 \u2014 23. A number of coal mining companies, utility companies, and the Crow Tribe of Indians (the intervenor appellees), all having interests in development of the Province, were allowed to intervene as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">After limited discovery appellants moved, on August 81, 1973, for summary judgment. App. 66. The federal and intervenor appellees filed various cross-motions for summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings. App. 164, 168, 171. On February 14, 1974 the District Court denied appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granted appel-lees\u2019 motions. While finding, and reciting most of the facts outlined above, <em>see supra, </em>169 U.S.App.D.C. at---, 514 F.2d at 861-866, the District Court concluded that the Region, as defined in appellants\u2019 complaint, \u201cis not an entity, region, or area which has been defined by the Federal Government by statute or executive action for purposes of any Federal program, project, or action.\u201d Fdg. 7, App. 235. Moreover, despite the facts outlined above, \u201c[tjhere is no existing or proposed Federal regional program, plan, project, or other regional \u2018federal action\u2019 <em>within the meaning of NEPA Section 102(2) </em>for the development of coal or other resources\u201d in the Region. Fdg. 8, App. 235 (emphasis in original). The court then held that in the absence of regional federal action, multiple applications for individual federal action in connection with individual private projects which are unrelated to one another except geographically do not either constitute regional federal action or mandate a regional impact statement. Conclusion of Law (Concl.) 4, App. 245. Likewise, NEPA Sections 102(2)(A) and (D) do not require a regional approach unless the federal action subject to those requirements is already regionally based. Concl. 5, App. 246. Finally, the court ruled that the NGPRP \u201cis a study project and not a program for development,\u201d and, as such, it does not \u201cha[ve] life\u201d within the meaning of NEPA. Concl. 9, App. 248. Even if a regional plan existed, the court ruled, NEPA would not prohibit proceeding with individual projects and, in any case, appellants would not be entitled to an injunction since they have not shown the likelihood of irreparable harm. Concl. 10 &amp; 11, App. 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">Appellants filed their notice of appeal on March 19, 1974. On March 26, 1974 the District Court denied appellants\u2019 motion for an injunction pending appeal, and appellants then filed, on April 12, 1974, a motion in this court for an injunction pending appeal and an expedited hearing. The motion for an expedited hearing was granted on June 17, 1974. While the court, Leventhal and Tamm, JJ., denied the motion for the broad injunction pending appeal because it lacked adequate knowledge of certain dispositive facts, it noted \u201cthe spectre of significant harm to large tracts of valuable wilderness still remains,\u201d and it urged the federal appellees to exercise \u201csubstantial restraint\u201d in continuing development of coal resources in the Region lest the court\u2019s jurisdiction to decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>the need for a comprehensive impact statement be, for all practical purposes, defeated. Order filed June 17, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Argument was scheduled for mid-October, but on October 14, 1974 the court, Leventhal and Nichols, JJ., ordered, <em>sua sponte, </em>argument rescheduled for December 17, 1974, meanwhile remanding the record to the District Court for a further evidentiary hearing designed to answer certain factual questions so as to make the record as current as possible.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The parties were allowed to file supplemental memoranda concerning the District Court\u2019s supplemental findings. The District Court has provided us with full answers to the certified questions, but has adhered to its original conclusions of law. Thus we may deem the court to have found these additional facts not inconsistent with its original conclusion. After oral argument we granted appellants\u2019 motion for a limited injunction pending this decision, and ordered the Secretary of the Interior, pending further order, to take no action concerning the mining plans and railroad rights-of-way ready for approval in the Eastern Powder River coal basin and discussed in the Eastern Powder River EIS. Order filed January 3, 1975. Having the benefit of the District Court\u2019s original and supplemental findings, and the original briefs and supplemental memoranda of the parties, we must now turn to the merits.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">NEPA\u2019s applicability to the cumulative effect of individual actions was an early issue in the impact statement cases, and has continued to require definition to date.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> An environmental impact statement is only required, of course, for \u201cproposals for legislation and other <em>major Federal actions </em>significantly affecting the quality of the human environment * * *.\u201d Section 102(2)(C), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (emphasis added). While the meaning of \u201clegislation\u201d is fairly clear, the precise content of \u201cmajor Federal actions\u201d is often open to question, and was, apparently purposely, enacted by Congress without definition. When an individual project \u2014 a dam, a highway, a parking plan \u2014 crossed the boundary line from minor to major aetion was the first issue presented to the courts, and it was one capable of fairly ready resolution. <em>See, e. g., </em>Scherr v. Volpe, 7 Cir., 466 F.2d 1027 (1972); Citizens Organized to Defend Environment, Inc. v. Volpe, S.D.Ohio, 353 F.Supp. 520 (1972); Monroe County Conservation Council, Inc. v. Volpe, 2 Cir., 472 F.2d 693 (1972); Crary v. Morton, D.D.C. (Civ. No. 75 \u2014 1023, order issued Feb. 11, 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">More difficult, but also readily resolved, was the question whether the cumulative effect of various federal actions, all individually minor, could together constitute a \u201cmajor federal action.\u201d The courts, aided by the Guidelines of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), the body established by NEPA to review agency compliance with Sections 101 and 102 of the Act, 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 4344(3), have consistently held that the purposes of NEPA would be violated if an impact statement were not required in such cases. The Guidelines make clear that the statutory term \u201cmajor Federal actions\u201d must be assessed \u201cwith a view to the overall, cumulative impact of the action proposed, related Federal action and projects in the area, and further actions contemplated.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.6(a) (1974). <em>Cf. </em>36 Fed. Reg. 7724 (1971) (the original guidelines).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Guidelines further explain how minor federal actions can be \u201ccumulatively considerable.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-6\">This can occur when one or more agencies over a period of years puts into a project individually minor but collectively major resources, when one decision involving a limited amount of money is a precedent for action in much larger cases or represents a decision in principle about future courses of action, or when several Government agencies individually make decisions about partial aspects of a major action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.6(a) (1974). This interpretation of the statutory term is eminently reasonable, both because NEPA plainly mandates comprehensive consideration of the effects of all federal actions, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(A), which consideration would be defeated if impact statements were required only for <em>individual </em>projects of \u201cmajor\u201d size, and because any other interpretation would provide an escape hatch, through agency subdivision of \u201cmajor\u201d projects, from the impact statement requirement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-8\">Almost every project can be divided into smaller parts, some of which might not have any appreciable effect on the environment. The court would be forced to take each project apart piece by piece * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">People of Enewetak v. Laird, D.Hawaii, 353 F.Supp. 811, 821 (1973). Thus the courts have had no difficulty in requiring impact statements for \u201cmajor Federal actions\u201d that were no more than the cumulative effect of related minor federal actions. <em>See, e. g., </em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Grant, E.D.N.C., 341 F.Supp. 356, 367 (1972); People of Enewetak v. Laird, <em>supra; </em>Minnesota PIRG v. Butz, D.Minn., 358 F.Supp. 584, 622 (1973); SCRAP v. United States, D.D.C., 346 F.Supp. 189, 200 (1972) (three-judge court), reversed on other grounds, 412 U.S. 669, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973) (\u201cthe necessity of preparing an impact statement cannot be avoided or postponed * * * by breaking [the action] into minute component parts\u201d). <em>Cf </em>Named Individual' Members of San Antonio Conservation Society v. Texas Highway Department, 5 Cir., 446 F.2d 1013, 1022-1023, cert. denied, 403 U.S. 932, 91 S.Ct. 2257, 29 L.Ed.2d 711 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">The next problem to reach the courts involving cumulative impact of related activities was also the logical next step. If the cumulative effect of individually minor federal actions could constitute a major federal action, could the cumulative impact of admittedly major federal actions do so as.well? Even if individual impact statements were being prepared for the individual actions, would a comprehensive statement for the cumulative action also be necessary? The answer was provided by this court\u2019s <em>SIPI </em>decision. Finding no distinguishing principle separating assessment of the cumulative impact of individually minor actions from the cumulative impact of individually major actions, we held that NEPA\u2019s impact statement requirement is not limited to individual projects. Rather, in <em>SIPI </em>we demanded that the Atomic Energy Commission prepare a comprehensive impact statement for its Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor (LMFBR) program, even though an individual state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>ment had been prepared for the one existing fast breeder demonstration plant and even though the Commission planned to issue an individual statement for each future plant and test facility within the program.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-4\">The Commission takes an unnecessarily crabbed approach to NEPA in assuming that the impact statement process was designed only for particular facilities rather than for analysis of the overall effects of broad agency programs. Indeed, quite the contrary is true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">156 U.S.App.D.C. at 402-403, 481 F.2d at 1086 \u2014 1087. <em>See also </em>Natural Resources Defense Council v. Morton, <em>supra </em>(emphasizing the need for comprehensive environmental planning). <em>SIPI\u2019s </em>approach is firmly echoed by a contemporaneous First Circuit decision. In Jones v. Lynn, 1 Cir., 477 F.2d 885 (1973), the court held that preparation of impact statements on individual buildings within an urban renewal project would be both impractical and, unless the individual statement evaluated the \u201ccumulatively significant impact\u201d of the entire federal role in the project, in violation of NEPA. Instead a comprehensive statement was required.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqg-dedup-0\">[I]t would not seem sensible to adopt the piecemeal approach which HUD seeks to adopt, whereby it will prepare a modified impact statement separately for each proposed construction as a mortgage insurance application is filed, an approach akin to equating an appraisal of each tree to one of the forest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 891. <em>See also </em>Conservation Society of Southern Vermont, Inc. v. Secretary of Transportation, 2 Cir., 508 F.2d 927 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">We think <em>SIPI\u2019s </em>holding that statements are necessary for \u201cbroad agency programs\u201d in addition to \u201cparticular facilities\u201d was firmly based, and we reaffirm it here. We do not understand appellees to dispute <em>SIPI\u2019s </em>validity. In fact, we note that, in compliance with the CEQ Guidelines and with <em>SIPI, </em>Interior has itself decided a national coal programmatic statement is necessary to assess the broad impact of its national coal development policy.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Likewise, when confronted with applications for approval of four mining plans and a railroad right-of-way in one subregion of the Northern Great Plains, the Eastern Powder River coal basin, Interior properly decided to assess the cumulative environmental impact of the individual projects through a regional impact statement. <em>See </em>note 15 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">In <em>SIPI </em>the AEC admitted it was engaged in the LMFBR program. We must now decide whether to extend <em>SIPI </em>to require comprehensive impact statements in situations where the responsible agencies deny they are engaged in a broad program. Appellants would have us hold that an impact statement is necessary in this case \u201cprecisely because the federal agencies have not prepared any plan for coal development in the Northern Great Plains.\u201d Appellants\u2019 brief at 47. They rely primarily on the following provision from the CEQ Guidelines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-11\">Agencies should give careful attention to identifying and defining the purpose and scope of the action which would most appropriately serve as the subject of the statement. In many cases, broad program statements will be required in order to assess the environmental effects of a number of individual actions on a given geographical area (e. g., <em>coal leases), </em>or environmental impacts that are generic or common to a series of agency actions (e. g., maintenance or waste handling practices), or the over-all impact of a large-scale program or chain of contemplated projects (e. g., major <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>lengths of highway as opposed to small segments). Subsequent statements on major individual actions will be necessary where such actions have significant- environmental impacts not adequately evaluated in the program statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.6(d)(1) (1974) (emphasis added). Appellants read these guidelines to require a comprehensive impact statement whenever a group of individual federal projects are related geographically, environmentally, or programmatically. After extensive anaylsis of federal activities in the Northern Great Plains, appellants conclude \u201cthe projects and federal actions relating to coal development in the Northern Great Plains region are related in all three of these ways.\u201d Appellants\u2019 brief at 33. Appel-lees argue that a statement is required only when the Government has itself designated the activities at issue a \u201cprogram.\u201d They claim the CEQ Guidelines support this approach, arguing that reference to the need for \u201cbroad <em>program </em>statements\u201d means the Guidelines only define when broad statements are needed in pre-existing programs. Intervenor appellees\u2019 brief at 31 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">We reject appellees\u2019 constricted reading of the Guidelines. Whether a comprehensive impact statement is required cannot turn simply on whether the agency has denominated a comprehensive series of actions a \u201cprogram.\u201d This argument is analogous to that in the early NEPA cases when agencies denied that related minor actions constituted, <em>in toto, </em>a major action. We did not hesitate at that time in holding that major actions were involved despite the agency denials; where appropriate, we will not hesitate now. The fact of an agency denial does not end the controversy, but rather points to why the controversy exists. Surely the result in <em>SIPI </em>would have been no different had the AEC simply denied that a comprehensive program was involved, all the other underlying facts being the same. At a minimum, the courts must reserve the right to analyze federal actions to determine if, in fact, a comprehensive program, however labeled, is under way or proposed. <em>See </em>SCRAP v. United States, <em>supra, </em>346 F.Supp. at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">This conclusion is firmly supported by the recent Second Circuit decision in Conservation Society of Southern Vermont, Inc. v. Secretary of Transportation, <em>supra. </em>In <em>Conservation Society </em>the court upheld the determination of the District Court that the Department of Transportation could not proceed with improvement of a 20-mile segment of U.S. Route 7 until a comprehensive impact statement was prepared for the entire 280-mile length of Route 7. The District Court so held, although it acknowledged that there was no present plan for overall development of the road; it found, however, that ultimate conversion of Route 7 into a superhighway was a goal held by the federal defendants and that it was \u201cpossible of accomplishment with legislative and federal approval over a long-range period of time * * D.Vt., 362 F.Supp. 627, 636 (1972). Since ultimate conversion was the expectation of the federal defendants, and since completion of the 20-mile segment at issue would constitute an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources that would generate more traffic and thereby create synergistic pressure for further construction, the District Court ruled that <em>major </em>federal action was proposed, within the meaning of Section 102(2)(C), and that the time was ripe for a comprehensive impact statement. The Second Circuit agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">While we thus feel firmly grounded in inquiring into the actual nature of the Government\u2019s actions, appellants would have us go further than this. Essentially, they would have the courts require filing of a comprehensive impact statement if a comprehensive program <em>should be </em>under way. Admittedly, the CEQ Guidelines, which are entitled to great respect,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> do seem to sweep that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>broadly. Moreover, there are dicta in the cases suggesting that the duty to plan comprehensively can be imposed on the Government apart from the duty to file an impact statement for comprehensive plans. For instance, Natural Resources Defense Council v. Morton, <em>supra, </em>suggests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-4\">What NEPA infused into the decision-making process in 1969 was a directive as to environmental impact statements that was meant to implement the Congressional objectives of Government coordination, <em>a comprehensive approach to environmental management, </em>and a determination to face problems of pollution \u201cwhile they are still of manageable proportions and while alternative solutions are still available\u201d <em>rather than persist in environmental decision-making wherein \u201cpolicy is established by default and inaction\u201d and environmental decisions \u201ccontinue to be made in small but steady increments\u201d that perpetuate the mistakes of the past without being dealt with until \u201cthey reach crisis proportions.\u201d </em>S.Rep.No.91 \u2014 296, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (1969) p. 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">148 U.S.App.D.C. at 14, 458 F.2d at 836 (emphasis added). Viewed broadly, this language plainly contemplates <em>imposing </em>a requirement of comprehensive planning on the Government when it refuses to do so itself. Indeed, NEPA does declare it federal policy \u201cto use all practicable means <em>* * * to improve and coordinate Federal plans, </em>functions, programs and resources\u201d in order to protect the environment. Section 101(a), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4331(a) (emphasis added). NEPA\u2019s substantive provisions may be enforced in court as well as its procedural requisites.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Calvert Cliffs\u2019 Coordinating Committee v. AEC, <em>supra, </em>146 U.S.App.D.C. at 38, 449 F.2d at 1114. Agency violation of this substantive duty by a failure to improve its plans or coordinate its actions might justify a judicial directive to coordinate various major federal actions into one comprehensive major federal action, followed by a directive ordering issuance of a comprehensive impact statement for that newly-comprised action.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">While we approve, in theory, the legal basis for appellants\u2019 argument, we note the practical difficulties in its broad application. An infinite number of geographic, environmental, or programmatic interrelationships might be found among the various individual federal projects under way throughout the country. Surely, however, an infinite number of comprehensive plans, and comprehensive impact statements, are not required. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>Moreover, the Guidelines are intended to guide agency planners in the need for impact statements. It is, of course, the agencies that are supposed to organize the various federal projects throughout the country, not litigants who come into court seeking, possibly in opposition to one another, to force the agencies into action according- to their lights; one might seek, for instance, a coal impact statement for the Northern Great Plains, another for the four-state region, and another for the state of Wyoming alone. Use of NEPA to force a comprehensive plan on an unwilling agency as a means to force that agency to undertake a comprehensive impact statement might intrude unduly on agency discretion, while overly involving the courts in the day-today business of running the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">This is not to say appellants\u2019 claim is without merit. We have noted above the persuasiveness of their legal arguments. Since the courts would only find an agency to be in violation of the substantive provisions of NEPA if its failure to plan comprehensively was arbitrary or capricious, the dangers suggested above would be minimized.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> And there may be instances where judicial intervention is justified. Surely we are not willing to hold that the less comprehensive planning an agency chooses to do, the less NEPA requires it to do. Such a <em>reductio ad absurdum </em>would make a mockery of the Act. However, we need not decide appellants\u2019 claim here. We think the facts in the record and as found by the District Court establish that regional development of the Northern Great Plains is contemplated by the federal appellees. The proposal for such development would constitute a proposal for major federal action within the meaning of Section 102(2)(C) and demand issuance of a comprehensive regional impact statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">It is beyond question that federal action within the meaning of the statute includes not only action undertaken by the agency itself, but also any action permitted or approved by the agency. <em>SIPI, supra, </em>156 U.S.App.D.C. at 404, 481 F.2d at 1088. Approving leases to private parties and granting licenses or permits to private parties are familiar \u2014 and well-established \u2014 examples of major federal actions. <em>See, e. g., </em>Davis v. Morton, 10 Cir., 469 F.2d 593 (1972); Greene County Planning Board v. FPC, <em>supra; </em>Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. FPC, 2 Cir., 453 F.2d 463 (1971); Calvert Cliffs\u2019 Coordinating Committee v. AEC, <em>supra. </em>It is clear, and we do not understand the federal appellees to contest it, that most, if not all, of the ongoing and pending actions in the Northern Great Plains are subject to federal approval and are thereby federal actions. That these actions are major and that they significantly affect the human environment is also not contested. Certainly actions in the Region subject to Section 102(2)(C) include the approving of mining plans, the granting of rights-of-way across federal lands, and the granting of water rights from federal reservoirs. Thus the relevant question is not whether major federal actions are being taken in the Northern Great Plains, nor is it whether impact statements are necessary for those actions. The question is whether the federal appellees have treated those actions regionally in such a way that they comprise, cumulatively, a major federal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">We believe the evidence mandates an affirmative answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">The evidence is overwhelming that the federal appellees have for years been endeavoring to develop a plan for regional development of the coal resources in the Northern Great Plains. The North Central Power Study, the Montana-Wyoming Aqueducts Study, and the Northern Great Plains Resources Program were all undertaken for this purpose. The purpose of the aborted North Central Power Study was \u201cto promote the coordinated development of electric power supply in the North Central United States.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Report of Phase I, Volume I, at 2 (1971). The \u201ckey resource\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>development of that power supply was coal. <em>Id. </em>The stalled Aqueduct Appraisal Report, after recommending construction of large-capacity aqueducts to serve the industrial needs resulting from development of the coal fields, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ai--dedup-0\">The apparent impact of the development will require that full-scale comprehensive studies be initiated in the near future, in cooperation with the states and others, to assure an orderly and manageable growth pattern to minimize adverse environmental effects and impacts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 31 (1972). Now the NGPRP is under way, an interagency, federal-state task force whose primary objective is \u201cto provide information and a comprehensive analysis that can be used to place the potential impacts of coal development into perspective and thereby assist the people of the Northern Great Plains and the Nation in the management of the natural and human resources of this region.\u201d NGPRP Draft Interim Report at 1 \u2014 4 (1974). Secretary Morton tells us that all three of these programs were \u201cattempts to control development by individual companies.\u201d Affidavit of Secretary Morton, App. 190. The District Court accepted this assertion as fact. Fdg. 14, App. 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">The need for comprehensive regional development of the Northern Great Plains was recognized by responsible officials in the various agencies that subsequently became involved in the NGPRP. On May 2, 1972 Secretary of Agriculture Butz wrote to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency with reference to coal development in the Northern Great Plains: \u201cWe agree that a comprehensive, systematic, and interdisciplinary study of all aspects of the development and use of our coal reserve is needed.\u201d App. 75. On July 6, 1972 he wrote to Senator Mansfield, again with reference to the Northern Great Plains: \u201c[TJhere is considerable urgency and need for a coordinated mineral development strategy.\u201d App. 74. Likewise, on November 2, 1972 the Chief of the Forest Service wrote to Senator Mansfield concerning coal leasing in the national forests in the Region. He reported that \u201ca prerequisite to further leasing should be a plan for coordinated development consistent with adequate environmental protection and the public interest.\u201d App. 78, 119 Cong.Rec. 1504 (1973). That same year Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Public Land Management Harrison Loesch told a congressional committee that \u201c[w]e are presently investigating the necessity, and we think it is a necessity, of rather comprehensive study and planning effort in the large coal basins of Montana and Wyoming.\u201d Federal Leasing and Disposal Policies, Hearing Before the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., 85 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">The NGPRP is the federal response to these expressed concerns. It is the Government\u2019s attempt to formulate a regional program that will enable it to control development of the Northern Great Plains. This is demonstrated not only by the stated goals of the program itself, <em>see supra, </em>169 U.S.App.D.C. at -, 514 F.2d at 875, but by the suspension of activity in the Region pending its completion, by the comments of responsible officials, and by the findings of the District Court. In setting up the NGPRP in 1972, Secretary Morton described it as \u201can excellent opportunity for this Department to demonstrate how a responsible Federal agency can manage resources development with proper regard for environmental protection.\u201d App. 200; <em>see supra, </em>169 U.S.App.D.C. at-, 514 F.2d at 863. In responding to questions about development of the Region posed by a congressional committee, Interior provided this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-12\">An assurance of orderly and timely development would require an analysis and assessment of such items as regional coal demand and the relationship to existing leases. The Department is initiating a State, local and Federal program to develop a regional development plan or framework for the Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota and South Dakota area associated with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>the Powder River and Fort Union coal formations. The objective is the wise development of the region accomplished in full realization of social, economic and ecological consequences of alternative possibilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Federal Leasing and Disposal Policies, Hearing Before the Senate Committee on Interior arid Insular Affairs, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., 189 (1972). The program mentioned obviously was the NGPRP. Lastly, the District Court found that the interim report of the NGPRP</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-6\">will provide an informational foundation for decision-making and planning. This information will be utilized in decision-making for all coal related actions in the Northern Great Plains areas and will form a useful reference source for preparing environmental analyses and statements on proposed actions or groups of actions in the Northern Great Plains area.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">Fdg. 27, App. 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-16\">However, while the NGPRP does attempt to provide a framework for decision-making to allow the federal government to control development of the Northern Great Plains, it plainly recognizes the need, which it does not fill, for cumulative study of the environmental impact of that development.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The draft interim report asks, \u201cIs the impact of two mines or powerplants in the same area twice as great as the impact of one, or is it larger?\u201d It warns, \u201c[T]he impacts of coal development in the Northern Great Plains may be greater than the projection and analytic techniques used have been able to delineate.\u201d NGPRP Draft Interim Report at V \u2014 2. The NGPRP does not purport to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>answers to these problems. We believe, however, that NEPA requires those answers be found. It is our view that when the federal government, through exercise of its power to approve leases, mining plans, rights-of-way, and water option contracts, attempts to \u201ccontrol development\u201d of a definite region, it is engaged in a regional program constituting major federal action within the meaning of NEPA, whether it labels its attempts a \u201cplan,\u201d a \u201cprogram,\u201d or nothing at all. Thus, supported by the <em>Conservation Society </em>precedent and based on the evidence presented to the District Court and the facts as found by the District Court, we hold that comprehensive major federal action is contemplated in the Northern Great Plains. The District Court\u2019s contrary conclusion of law was in error.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>\n<em>IV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Our conclusion that major federal action is contemplated in the Northern Great Plains does not mean, <em>ipso facto, </em>that a comprehensive regional impact statement is required. A statement must precede the \u201crecommendation or report on <em>proposals </em>for * * * major Federal actions.\u201d Section 102(2)(C), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C) (emphasis added). This raises the question of timing that was so critical in <em>SIPI. </em>We think it patent that the term \u201cproposals\u201d does not encompass every suggestion, however unlikely to reach fruition, made by a federal officer. Certainly federal officers are entitled to dream out loud without filing an impact statement. Thus we think it proper to inquire, before an EIS is required, whether the proposal for action has progressed beyond the \u201cdream\u201d stage into some tangible form so that the time for an impact statement is ripe. <em>SIPI, supra, </em>156 U.S.App.D.C. at 409-410, 481 F.2d at 1093-1094. We should note, however, that the \u201cripeness\u201d necessary before a statement is required is slight. Preparation of a statement must precede, or at least accompany, preparation of the recommendation or report on the proposal, so that the agency may have the opportunity to assess the environmental impact of its plans before committing itself, even tentatively, to action. An impact statement is designed to aid agency decision-making, not provide an <em>ex post facto </em>justification for it. We fully adhere to our statement in Calvert Cliffs\u2019 Coordinating Committee v. AEC, <em>supra, </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-11\">[compliance [with NEPA demands] that environmental issues be considered at every important stage in the decision making process concerning a particular action \u2014 at every stage where an overall balancing of environmental and nonenvironmental factors is appropriate and where alterations might be made in the proposed action to minimize environmental costs.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-12\">146 U.S.App.D.C. at 42, 449 F.2d at 1118. But, as <em>SIPI </em>tells us,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-13\">[W]e are pulled in two directions. Statements must be written late enough in the development process to contain meaningful information, but they must be written early enough so that whatever information is contained can practically serve as an input into the decision making process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-14\">156 U.S.App.D.C. at 410, 481 F.2d at 1094.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>The problem <em>SIPI </em>notes with regard to research and development programs applies with like force to defining any \u201cproposal\u201d within the meaning of-Section 102(2)(C). <em>SIPI </em>identified four balancing factors that must be analyzed and weighed to determine if the time is ripe for an impact statement. <em>Id. Cf. </em>40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1500.6(d)(2). With minor modifications to make the factors applicable to all federal actions and not just the .research and development program at issue in <em>SIPI, </em>we adopt those factors here. Thus the agency, or the reviewing court, should inquire as follows: How likely is the program to come to fruition, and how soon will that occur? To what extent is meaningful information presently available on the effects of implementation of the program, and of alternatives and their effects? To what extent are irretrievable commitments being made and options precluded as refinement of the proposal progresses? How severe will be the environmental effects if the program is implemented?</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">As we pointed out in <em>SIPI, </em>application of this test is in the first instance a task for the agency, since answering the questions, and balancing the answers, clearly requires agency expertise. <em>See id. See also </em>Citizens Assn of Georgetown, Inc. v. Zoning Comm\u2019n of D. C., 155 U.S.App.D.C. 233, 239, 477 F.2d 402, 408 (1973); Wilderness Society v. Morton, 156 U.S.App.D.C. 121, 145, 479 F.2d 842, 866 (1973) <em>(en banc). </em>While judicial scrutiny of an agency decision that the time is not yet ripe for a statement is, of course, appropriate, <em>SIPI, supra, </em>156 U.S.App.D.C. at 410, 481 F.2d at 1094, our analysis of the balancing factors is inconclusive at this time and, because we are told that appellees are about to resolve certain dispositive uncertainties, we remand this case to the District Court to allow the federal appel-lees initially to make their own determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">We find from the record from the District Court ample evidence suggesting that, as for two of the balancing factors, the time for a statement is indeed ripe. Meaningful information on the effects of development of coal resources in the Northern Great Plains, and of alternatives to that development, is certainly available, although not yet compiled and analyzed. Of course it is the mere availability of such information that matters; compilation and analysis are the purpose of the impact statement itself.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Likewise the severity of the environmental effects of massive coal development of the Northern Great Plains is clear and inclines us toward a finding of ripeness. There is no need to expound on the effects here.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Briefly put, a region best known for its abundant wildlife and fish, and for its beautiful scenery, a region isolated from urban America, sparsely populated and virtually unindustrialized, will be converted into a major industrial complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">Weighing the other two balancing factors is not so clear-cut. While federal approval of development of the Northern Great Plains seems fairly certain to occur, and to occur in the relatively near future so as to lessen our dependence on imported oil, it seems to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>us clear that the Government has not yet finally settled on its role in granting that approval. Significantly, the relevant geographic area for development still seems somewhat uncertain.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Interi- or\u2019s broadly conceived North Central Power Study collapsed, and it responded with the Northern Great Plains Resources Program. While the NGPRP is intended to guide the Government in controlling private development of the Region, the interim report is not yet completed. As the Government grapples with its role in the Northern Great Plains, it has largely suspended activity therein. Thus so long as the suspension stays in effect, irretrievable commitments are largely being avoided while appellees determine the scope of the proposed federal action.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> On the other hand, the suspension is not absolute; four mining plans have been approved in the past two years and four more are ready for approval, stayed only by our temporary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">Thus analysis of the four balancing factors is somewhat inconclusive, inclining us simultaneously toward a finding of ripeness and a desire to stay our hand while appellees further define their roles. However, we find it unnecessary to reach a conclusive resolution of the question at this time, for the uncertainties inclining us toward restraint are about to be resolved. We are told that the final interim report of the NGPRP is about to be issued; indeed, it may have issued already. According to the federal appellees, they will then feel free to begin approving private activity in the \u25a0Northern Great Plains. We think the federal appellees will also be in a position, upon issuance of the interim report, to decide more definitely upon their role in the development of the Northern Great Plains,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and we think we should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>await their definition. If, as has been their goal, that role is one of controlling development of the region, then, as we have made clear above, a comprehensive EIS should accompany the proposal for action, which presumably would be embodied in a final NGPRP report.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> If, contrary to expectations, the federal appellees settle upon another role in the development of the Northern Great Plains, or upon no role at all, they must decide whether an impact statement is required.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> If they decide in the negative, we will require \u201ca statement of reasons why [they believe] that an impact statement is unnecessary.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Arizona Public Service Co. v. FPC, 157 U.S.App.D.C. 272, 279, 483 F.2d 1275, 1282 (1973). <em>See also SIPI, supra, </em>156 U.S.App.D.C. at 410-411, 481 F.2d at 1094 \u2014 1095; Hanly v. Kleindienst, 2 Cir., 471 F.2d 823 (1972), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 908, 93 S.Ct. 2290, 36 L.Ed.2d 974 (1973). Accordingly, we remand this case to the District Court. The federal appellees must decide within 30 days of issuance of the NGPRP Interim Report, or the date of this opinion, whichever is later,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> whether to prepare a comprehensive, programmatic impact statement for the Region, and they must report their decision, and the reasons for it, to the District Court.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> If appellees decide against attempting to control development of the Northern Great Plains, they must also report, in detail, what the federal role in the Region will be. <em>See </em>Arizona Public Service Co. v. FPC, <em>supra, </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. at 280, 483 F.2d at 1282. Appellants will be able to challenge appellees\u2019 impact statement decision and, if appellees decide not to prepare a comprehensive statement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>to present again to the District Court their theory that the geographic, environmental, and/or programmatic interrelationship of activity in the Region mandates such a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">Since we refer back to appellees the decision whether to prepare a comprehensive impact statement for the Northern Great Plains, we continue our temporary injunction of January 3, 1975 until that decision is reached. This will preserve, in large part, the <em>status quo </em>pending appellees\u2019 decision. While we do not order issuance of any more comprehensive injunction at this time, we note that our decision to refer the issue of a regional EIS to appellees for resolution in the first instance is prompted in large part by appellees\u2019 forbearance in authorizing activity in the Region pending issuance of the NGPRP. In this regard, we have two observations. First, while Interior\u2019s interim policy seems to have been embarked upon with considerable good faith, we would have more confidence in it if the escape hatch were not quite so large. As matters stand, requests for approval of any activity within Interior\u2019s jurisdiction in the Northern Great Plains</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-7\">will be held in abeyance pending the availability and analysis of the interim report from the NGPRP study <em>or submitted to the Under Secretary for review and concurrence prior to execution.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">Affidavit of Secretary Morton, App. 194 (emphasis added). No standards at all are suggested by which the Under Secretary will grant his concurrence. We think it would be appropriate, particularly if this policy were to continue following a decision to prepare a comprehensive impact statement, for the Secretary to determine and publish standards by which this significant exception will operate. Moreover, the remaining federal appellees\u2019 policy of forbearance seems to have dissolved, although they have actually approved few actions in the Region. <em>See supra, </em>169 U.S.App.D.C. at ---, 514 F.2d at 864-865. We think it would be appropriate for these appellees to adopt a policy similar to Interior\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-14\">Second, as we noted in denying appellants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction last spring, the spectre of significant, and unnecessary, harm to large tracts of valuable wilderness still remains. The number of applications for federal approval of various activities is large. We urge appellees, while deciding whether to prepare a comprehensive impact statement for the Northern Great Plains, to take no actions that would defeat the purpose the impact statement is designed to serve. Needless to say, however, the courts remain open, to appellants or others, should the federal appel-lees decide nonetheless to approve any private endeavors in the Northern Great Plains.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-15\">Whether an injunction against activity, either ongoing or proposed, in the Northern Great Plains should issue pending preparation of a comprehensive regional impact statement is a question we need not reach.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We note only that a responsible policy of restraint by the federal appellees with respect to authorizing such activity might make the question moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-16\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b941-17\">This case has presented difficult questions involving the proper balance between an agency\u2019s discretion in deciding whether, and when, to issue an environmental impact statement, and the judiciary\u2019s role in overseeing exercise of that discretion. We believe that, to the full<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>est extent possible, it is for the agency to implement the demands of NEPA. While the courts should not shirk their role, it is the responsible compliance of the federal agencies that will make environmental planning a day-to-day occurrence and that will make the needless abuse of our priceless national heritage a nightmare of the past. We are confident the agencies will not lose, or misuse, this opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-15\">.

We can dispose here of two preliminary defenses raised by appellees and given credence by the District Court, namely, whether this case presents a justiciable case or controversy, and whether appellant organizations have standing to sue. The District Court held that \u201cthe courts will not review the validity of supporting statements or studies until final Federal actions taken under NEPA Section 102(2) and until after final agency action has been taken with respect to the individual project,\u201d Concl. 7, App. 247, and that, therefore, no case or controversy had been stated. Concl. 8, App. 247. While the court is correct that as a general proposition of law NEPA challenges to individual projects can be brought only after final agency approval of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>project, <em>see e. g., </em>Committee to Stop Route 7 v. Volpe, D.Conn., 346 F.Supp. 731 (1972), the court seems to assume that (1) only individual actions can be challenged, and (2) appellants do not allege that final actions have occurred. Both of these assumptions are erroneous, and we find that appellants have stated a case or controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">First, as will be made clear in text below, <em>SIPI </em>firmly holds not only that a comprehensive program can be challenged under NEPA, but that the suit does not have to be brought via an attack on an individual action. Even though the AEC\u2019s Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor (LMFBR) program was only in \u201cthe research and development stage and no specific implementing action which would significantly affect the environment had yet been taken,\u201d <em>SIPI, supra </em>note 15, 156 U.S.App.D.C. at 398, 481 F.2d at 1082, the court found the program \u201chas life,\u201d which, for purposes of NEPA, was sufficient to make a case or controversy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-7\">The instant case is ripe under these principles since the issue tendered for review is whether an impact statement on the AEC\u2019s LMFBR program is <em>presently </em>required under NEPA. * * * In the context of a long-range program such as is involved here, judicial review of compliance with NEPA is necessary at stages at which significant resources are being committed, lest the statute\u2019s basic purpose be thwarted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">156 U.S.App.D.C. at 403 n. 29, 481 F.2d at 1086 n. 29 (emphasis in original). As we shall make clear below, we think appellees\u2019 plans to control development of the Northern Great Plains have sufficient life to state a case or controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">Second, appellants allege that appellees\u2019 conduct in the Northern Great Plains constitutes a \u201cmajor federal action,\u201d so that a NEPA statement is required. Actions, both past and imminent, have been alleged. While the courts will typically not rule in NEPA cases until after the agency decision to act, the essence of appellants\u2019 complaint is that appellees have already decided to act, although they have not admitted as much. Again, <em>SIPI </em>is directly in point. <em>SIPI </em>recognized, necessarily, the propriety of judicial intervention in determining the dictates of NEPA. While it spoke expressly only of judicial determination that the time for an EIS was ripe, 156 U.S.App.D.C. at 410, 481 F.2d at 1094, the principle and SIPI\u2019s holding apply as well for judicial determination that the Government is engaged in \u201cmajor federal action.\u201d Therefore, while in the first instance it is for the Government to decide whether an impact statement is necessary, where the Government improperly fails to treat the cumulative effect of individual actions as a \u201cmajor federal action\u201d it is appropriate for the courts to intervene, and do so sufficiently early that the purposes of NEPA are not thwarted.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">We think that in a case like this, where appellants allege the individual federal steps taken in the Northern Great Plains, considered together, constitute a major federal action, a case or controversy is stated when the challenged individual actions are alleged, along with a reasonable basis for treating them cumulatively under NEPA, and there is a claim that \u201csignificant resources are being committed.\u201d 156 U.S.App.D.C. at 403 n. 29, 481 F.2d at 1086 n. 29. We think appellants have met this test. As in <em>SIPI, </em>the issue they raise is \u201cwhether an impact statement on [development of the Northern Great Plains] is <em>presently </em>required under NEPA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). On this issue, there is \u201ca substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality.\u201d Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S.Ct. 510, 512, 85 L.Ed. 826 (1941). <em>See also </em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148-149, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967); Eccles v. Peoples Bank, 333 U.S. 426, 434, 68 S.Ct. 641, 92 L.Ed. 784 (1948); Ashwander v. TV A, 297 U.S. 288, 324, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936). Thus we think a justiciable case or controversy has been stated and the District Court erred in holding otherwise. Of course, the fact that appellants do not fully prevail on the merits does not operate, retroactively, to expunge the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-13\">The second preliminary issue concerns appellants\u2019 standing to sue. Appellants alleged, Complaint HU 3-9, App. 3-5, and the District Court found, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-14\">[m]any members of plaintiff organizations live, work, engage in recreational activities, own land and hold surface rights on or immediately adjacent to the sites of coal mining and related activities in the four-state area * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-15\">Fdg. 1, App. 233. Appellants further alleged that development of coal resources in the Northern Great Plains would cause direct harm to various of their members\u2019 economic, environmental, recreational, and aesthetic interests in the Region. Complaint, HU 10, 37, App. 5, 20-21. Such \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d if proved, plainly meets the broad test of standing outlined in Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972), and applied in United States v. SCRAP, 412 U.S. 669, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973). <em>See also SIPI, supra </em>note 15, 156 U.S.App.D.C. at 403 n.29, 481 F.2d at 1086 n.29. In this case, however, standing can be deemed to have been proved only by appellant Northern Plains Resource Council (NPRC). The issue of standing as to all appellants was raised by the denials of the federal appellees, and of various intervenor appellees as well. Answer of feder<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>al appellees, flU 3-10, 37, App. 100, 109. See, e. <em>g., </em>answer of intervenor Nebraska Public Power District, flfl 3-4, App. 138-139. Nonetheless, except for the NPRC, no appellant introduced any evidence to prove its standing, and the District Court made no express finding that any appellant had standing, presumably because there was no challenge to appellants\u2019 standing in appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Of course, standing to sue is an essential element of a cause of action and must be \u201cdemonstrated\u201d as well as \u201calleged,\u201d particularly where controverted. <em>SIPI, supra </em>note 15, 156 U.S.App.D.C. at 403 n. 29, 481 F.2d at 1086 n. 29. See <em>also </em>United States v. SCRAP, <em>supra, </em>412 U.S. at 689-690, 93 S.Ct. 2405. On remand to the District Court appellants may introduce evidence of their standing to allow the District Court the opportunity to rule on the issue if appellees continue to deny it. <em>Cf. </em>Sierra Club v. Morton, <em>supra, </em>405 U.S. at 735 n. 8, 92 S.Ct. 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">NPRC introduced into evidence two affidavits from its Vice Chairman, Christopher Muller. The affidavits relate directly to the proposed Westmoreland Resources coal mine on Crow-ceded land. <em>See </em>note 15 <em>supra. </em>Muller identifies those members of his organization who reside in the vicinity of the proposed mine and the adverse environmental, aesthetic, and economic effects on those members of continued construction of the mine. Affidavits of Christopher Muller, Nov. 7, 1973 and Dec. 21, 1973. While appellees attempted to controvert the Muller affidavits with an affidavit from W. J. Connelly of Westmoreland Resources asserting that the adverse effects on appellants were minimal, Affidavit of W. J. Connelly, Jan. 11, 1974, it is clear that minimal \u201cinjury in fact\u201d is sufficient for standing. United States v. SCRAP, <em>supra, </em>412 U.S. at 688-690, 93 S.Ct. 2405. <em>See also </em>New Jersey Chapter, Inc., A.P.T.A., Inc. v. Prudential Life Ins. Co., 164 U.S.App.D.C. 40, 44, 502 F.2d 500, 504 (1974) (\u201cStanding need not be founded on a rock; a pebble or even a cobweb may do.\u201d). That there will be at least minimal injury is uncontroverted. Of course, the fact that an impact statement has been approved for the Westmoreland mine, <em>see </em>note 15 <em>supra, </em>does not affect appellants\u2019 injury, nor does it deprive them of standing to seek a comprehensive statement for the entire Region, since the injury caused them by development of the Westmoreland mine is part of the injury regional development would cause. Since appellant NPRC has demonstrated \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d and since it does not appear to be contested that the injury is within the zone of interests intended to be protected by NEPA, <em>see </em>Data Processing Service v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970), and Barlow v. Collins, 397 U.S. 159, 90 S.Ct. 832, 25 L.Ed.2d 192 (1970), we hold that NPRC had standing to bring the suit below, and to bring this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b928-12\">.

Thus there is no need for comprehensive environmental planning, and <em>SIPI </em>and Conservation Society of Southern Vermont, Inc. v. Secretary of Transportation, 2 Cir., 508 F.2d 927 (1974), are inappo-site. Dissent <em>infra </em>169 U.S.App.D.C. at---, 514 F.2d at 887-889. We disagree. To cite two examples beyond those suggested above, the availability of water and manpower in the Region is limited. Coal mining is crucially dependent upon both. Thus development of one mine is considerably more than an irretrievable commitment to that mine. In the case of water supply, it forecloses the possibility of another, environmentally preferable, mine. In the case of manpower, it creates pressure for a population influx which, while minor for one mine, may be cumulatively considerable. As <em>SIPI </em>and <em>Conservation Society </em>tell us, it is these sorts of environmental effects that can be best addressed in a regional, comprehensive manner. <em>See also </em>note 31 infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b936-4\">. The cases relied upon by appellees and the District Court to show that no impact statement is required for a regional plan, such as the NGPRP are all inapposite. Every cited case involved the propriety of an injunction against an individual project pending completion of a regional EIS or other study. None of the cases involved a direct challenge to the need for a regional EIS. <em>See </em>Sierra Club v. Callaway, 5 Cir., 499 F.2d 982 (1974); Jicarilla Apache Tribe of Indians v. Morton, <em>supra </em>note 25; Indian Lookout Alliance v. Volpe, <em>supra </em>note 21; Sierra Club v. Stamm, 10 Cir., 507 F.2d 788 (1974); Trout Unlimited v. Morton, 9 Cir., 509 F.2d 1276 (1974); Environmental Defense Fund v. Armstrong, N.D.Cal., 356 F.Supp. 131, aff\u2019d, 9 Cir., 487 F.2d 814 (1973); Movement Against Destruction v.

Froehlke, M.D.N.C., 340 F.Supp. 222, 227 (1972), remanded, 4 Cir., 473 F.2d 664 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Of course whether an injunction will issue in such a case depends on many factors in addition to whether a regional EIS is required, including the state of construction of the challenged project and the comprehensiveness of the impact statement for that project. <em>See </em>Sierra Club v. Callaway, <em>supra, </em>499 F.2d at 987. Thus whether a regional EIS is required was not determinative for resolution of the cited cases. Moreover, many of the cases did not even raise the issue of a regional impact statement, but merely sought delay of an individual project until completion of a regional <em>study </em>that might be of some assistance in preparing the individual statement. This was the situation in Jicarilla Apache Tribe of Indians v. Morton, <em>supra </em>note 25, relied on most heavily by appellees. There plaintiffs sought to delay four individual coal-fired electric generating projects in four southwestern states pending issuance of the Southwest Energy Study. The court sensibly rejected the claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-8\">If we were to impose a requirement that an impact statement can never be prepared until all relevant environmental effects were known, it is doubtful that any project could ever be initiated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">471 F.2d at 1280. Even appellees concede that there was no claim made in <em>Jicarilla </em>that a regional impact statement was necessary. In-tervenor appellees\u2019 brief at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">Likewise, in Environmental Defense Fund v. Armstrong, <em>supra, </em>also heavily relied upon by appellees, the need for a regional statement was not at issue. Plaintiffs there sought a \u201ccomprehensive study,\u201d not an EIS, of the Central Valley Project before approval of the New Melones dam impact statement. The court refused to wait for the study, noting that \u201cno comprehensive study has been commenced, let alone completed.\u201d 356 F.Supp. at 139. This is in sharp contrast to this case where a comprehensive study is under way, and the need for a comprehensive statement is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-12\">In Sierra Club v. Callaway, <em>supra, </em>the Fifth Circuit refused to delay the Wallisville Project pending a comprehensive EIS for the entire Trinity Basin Project. The holding was based on its findings that Congress intended the two projects to be treated separately, that the Wal-lisville Project was not, in fact, a component of the Trinity Basin Project, that the Wallis-ville Project was 72% complete while the Trinity Basin Project might not be completed for 40 to 50 years, and that the Wallisville Project was well under way before the effective date of NEPA. Thus Sierra Club v. Callaway is fully distinguishable; there was no comprehensive plan at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-13\">This crucial dependence upon the facts of the case was stressed in Sierra Club v. Stamm, <em>supra, </em>also heavily relied upon by appellees. Whether the Strawberry Aqueduct and Collection System was itself a major federal action or merely a component of the larger Bonneville Unit, or the entire Central Utah Project, was a question of fact as well as law, and turned crucially on \u201cthe \u2018facts\u2019 as * * * found by the trial court * * 507 F.2d at 791. The Tenth Circuit agreed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-16\">with the trial court that the Strawberry system in and of itself constitutes a \u201cmajor Federal action\u201d and that it is not a mere increment of either the Bonneville Unit or the Central Utah Project requiring a final impact statement for something more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>the Strawberry system before work may be commenced on the Currant Creek Dam.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 792-793. Again we note this case was in the context of a challenge to the individual project and did not involve the question whether a comprehensive EIS was necessary on its own merits. Moreover, the Tenth Circuit found the facts sufficient to treat the Strawberry System apart from the overall project. To the extent, however, that the Tenth Circuit proceeded on the assumption that only one \u201cmajor Federal action\u201d could be found, either the entire Bonneville Unit, the entire Central Utah Project, or the Strawberry System, we disagree. It is clear to us that a major federal action may require an impact statement for itself and still be a part of a larger major federal action that also requires a statement. That was the holding of <em>SIPI, </em>and we adhere to it. To the extent Sierra Club v. Stamm is contrary, we decline to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">The last important case cited to us by appel-lees is Trout Unlimited v. Morton, <em>supra. </em>There the Ninth Circuit held that an EIS prepared for the First Phase of the Lower Teton Division of the Teton Basin Project was adequate despite the fact that it did not attempt to analyze the environmental impacts of the Second Phase. The court distinguished the case before it from cases requiring comprehensive impact statements by noting that the First Phase was \u201csubstantially independent\u201d of the Second, that approval of the Second was not a foregone conclusion since approval of the Secretary of the Interior and the Congress had yet to be obtained, and that the First Phase would be fully functional even if the Second were never built. We think those distinguishing factors fully distinguish <em>Trout Unlimited </em>from the instant case where the thrust of appellants\u2019 . complaint is that widespread development of the Northern Great Plains is virtually certain to occur, and that the effects of the individual projects can only be meaningfully assessed in cumulative terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b937-17\">. Compliance with the substantive demands of \u00a7 102(2)(A) and (D) is required, of course, even before an impact statement is necessary under \u00a7 102(2)(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b938-7\">. The extreme importance of prompt analysis of the effects of massive coal development of the Northern Great Plains is emphasized by the NGPRP, which does not attempt to engage in such detailed analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-8\">Considerable uncertainty remains regarding the socio-economic impacts of coal development in the Northern Great Plains. Because of the complex nature of coal development, it is extremely difficult to estimate or assess cumulative impacts. However, these impacts may be critical. Is the impact of two mines or powerplants in the same area twice as great as the impact of one, or is it larger? Furthermore, how adaptable is the socioeconomic environment? Do equal increments of change require equal adjustments or do they require successively more? It is quite possible that the impacts of coal development in the Northern Great Plains may be greater than - the projection and analytic techniques used have been able to delineate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-13\">NGPRP Draft Interim Report, at V-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b938-14\">. The effects are described vividly in appellants\u2019 brief, and we do not understand appel-lees to contest their magnitude. <em>See </em>appellants\u2019 brief at 11-18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b939-5\">. Thus, while the NGPRP covers the five states of Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska, its projected development of the area covers only northeastern Wyoming, eastern Montana, and the western Dakotas. <em>See, e. g., </em>NGPRP Draft Interim Report, Plate 5B, Most Probable Development Forcast [sic]. The North Central Power Study, on the other hand, encompassed a significantly larger area, while the Aqueduct Study covers only Montana and Wyoming. We think that, absent abuse of this power, definition of the proper region for comprehensive development and, therefore, the comprehensive impact statement should be left in the hands of the federal appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">The appellees make something of an issue of the differences between the area covered by the NGPRP and the area described by appellants in their complaint. Intervenor appellees\u2019 brief at 23-24, 43-45; federal appellees\u2019 brief at 4 n.l. The District Court also found significance in these discrepancies, ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-7\">The \u201cNorthern Great Plains region\u201d as <em>described by the plaintiffs </em>is not an entity, region, or area which has been defined by the Federal Government by statute or executive action for purposes of any Federal program, project, or action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">Fdg. 7, App. 235 (emphasis added). We find this argument to be without merit. In a case such as this, where appellants seek to have the Government acknowledge that it is treating the comprehensive development of a region as a whole, we deem it unnecessary for the complaint to define every acre of territory within the region being so treated by the Government. Precise definition of the region is one of the consequences of such a lawsuit, not a prerequisite for it. The complaint should be sufficiently precise to put the Government on notice of the scope of plaintiff\u2019s claim. That was clearly achieved here; indeed, the planning maps of the NGPRP released after initiation of this suit revealed the area defined by the appellants to describe virtually precisely the area aptually considered for development by the NGPRP.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b939-12\">. It is the lack of definition of the proposal for action and the suspension of activity in the region that crucially distinguish this case from Conservation Society of Southern Vermont, Inc. v. Secretary of Transportation, <em>supra </em>note 28, <em>see supra, </em>169 U.S.App.D.C. at---, 514 F.2d at 873-874. In <em>Conservation Society </em>the scope of the proposed action was clear \u2014 the entire 280-mile length of Route 7 \u2014 and irretrievable commitments \u2014 the 20-mile segment under construction \u2014 were being made that would determine the course of future action. Thus the proposal was sufficiently ripe to demand preparation of a comprehensive impact statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"A9b\">.

The impact statement is intended to aid agency planning and decision-making <em>before </em>the final recommended proposal for action is made. It is enough that the scope of the proposal is sufficiently clear that consideration of its environmental impact is possible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b940-4\">. If the federal appellees decide to prepare a comprehensive regional EIS for the Northern Great Plains, it is, of course, of no consequence to us what form it takes.

AEC (SIPI), 156 U.S.App.D.C. 395, 481 F.2d 1079 (1973), as holding that a challenge to a comprehensive program need not be made through an attack on an individual project.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As indicated hereafter, the record in this case does not establish the existence of any comprehensive <em>regional </em>program of the type found in <em>SIPI </em>which could justify requiring the preparation of a regional environmental impact statement at this time. However, even if one concedes that such a statement might be appropriate, the District Court was still correct in concluding that an action divorced from the review of a statement covering an individual project is not a proper means for the determination of appellants\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-17\">In deciding that the instant ease is a proper vehicle for raising a claim for a regional EIS, the majority has overlooked the required relationship between the statements prepared on individual projects and the \u201cregional\u201d statement appellants seek. If appellants are cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>rect in asserting that NEPA requires the preparation of a regional EIS before any development of the Northern Great Plains may proceed, then all the statements covering individual projects necessarily must be at present insufficient to comply with NEPA. Conversely, if an EIS on an individual project is found to comply with NEPA, it necessarily follows that NEPA does not require the preparation of a more comprehensive statement before that project may proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">Impact statements have already been issued for the Westmoreland mine, the Peabody Coal Company project, and four mines and a railroad right-of-way in the Eastern Powder River Basin. See Supp. Finding on Remand, H 9a. Of these, the Westmoreland EIS was found to be sufficient under NEPA in Redding v. Morton, Civ. No. 74 \u2014 12\u2014BLG (D.Mont., May 1, 1974), appeal pending, 9th Cir. No. 74 \u2014 1984, and the remaining statements apparently have not yet been challenged in court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> My dissent to the issuance of the temporary injunction states, and I continue to believe, that the proper method to use in assessing the need for a regional statement is for appellants to file an appeal challenging the sufficiency of the EIS covering an individual project.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 apparent inability to successfully challenge the statements on individual projects as too limited in scope is strong, if not compelling, evidence that a \u201ccomprehensive regional EIS\u201d is not required at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">The starting point for any discussion of the need for an environmental impact statement is of course section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-8\">(2) all agencies of the Federal Government shall\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-9\">***:}:* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-10\">(C) include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-11\">(i) the environmental impact of the proposed action,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-12\">(ii) any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-13\">(iii) alternatives to the proposed action,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-14\">(iv) the relationship between local short-term uses of man\u2019s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-15\">(v) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-16\">The crucial question here is whether the Federal appellees have \u201cproposed\u201d \u201cmajor federal actions\u201d which require the preparation of an EIS covering all coal-related development in the \u201cNorthern Great Plains Region.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>To place this case in perspective, it is important to keep in mind exactly what is not at issue. The federal appellees do not deny that they are taking actions related to coal development within this region. On the contrary, several projects are admitted to be in various stages of development, and the agencies have consistently prepared impact statements prior to taking action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nor is there any contention that the projects which have been approved or which may be approved in the future are not \u201cmajor.\u201d Furthermore, the agencies have consistently required that the EIS on each project consider the cumulative environmental impacts of related developments.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Where appropriate, they have prepared impact statements which consider together several related developments within an area.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>What appellants present to this court is a claim that all these good faith efforts on the part of the various agencies are not sufficient to satisfy the demands of section 102(2)(C). To carry out the alleged requirements of NEPA, appellants assert that before any development in the region may be allowed to go forward, the agencies concerned must first prepare a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d analysis of the environmental impacts of all present and potential development within the region.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">By reversing the decision of the District Court, the majority is indicating its belief that there is some substantial possibility that appellant\u2019s claims will ultimately be successful. To reach this conclusion, the opinion reasons that major federal actions can be combined to create a new major federal action for which an EIS is necessary. Its authority for this proposition is this court\u2019s decision in Scientists\u2019 Institute for Public Information, Inc. v. AEC (SIPI), 156 U.S.App.D.C. 395, 481 F.2d 1079 (1973) and the Second Circuit decision in Conservation Society of Southern Vermont, Inc. v. Secretary of Transportation, 508 F.2d 927 (2d. Cir. 1974). There is no doubt <em>SIPI </em>holds that a comprehensive statement may be required <em>in certain circumstances, </em>but like any holding it is colored by its facts and its reasoning. The difficulty arises in the application of that decision to the facts here.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">The crucial consideration which justified the requirement of a statement covering more than an individual project in both <em>SIPI </em>and <em>Conservation Society </em>was the presence of irretrievable commitments of resources beyond what was actually expended in an individual project. In <em>SIPI, </em>each development in the Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor Program made it more unlikely that the agency could in the future abandon its investment in favor of some alternate energy source:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-13\">The manner in which we divide our limited research and development dollars today among various promising technologies in effect determines which technologies will be available, and what type and amount of environmental effects will have to be endured, in the future when we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>apply some new technology to meet projected energy demand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">481 F.2d at 1090. Similarly, the court found in <em>Conservation Society </em>that the construction of a 20-mile segment of highway would generate traffic and thus create pressure for further construction along the entire route and foreclose consideration of alternatives to highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">Phrasing these decisions in terms of the potential \u201cregional\u201d development at issue in the instant case, it is clear that the courts in <em>SIPI </em>and <em>Conservation Society </em>found that a federal action at one point in the \u201cregion\u201d would cause a ripple effect which would eventually have an impact on future federal actions elsewhere in the \u201cregion.\u201d Because of this effect, each court determined that the agency involved was required to prepare a comprehensive statement for the entire \u201cregion\u201d before it could approve an individual project within the \u201cregion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">The reason for the above holdings becomes clear when one considers the purpose underlying the preparation of impact statements. Virtually every federal action \u201csignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment\u201d will necessarily involve some irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources. NEPA only requires that the agency disclose these environmental costs and consider them in arriving at a decision; it does not prevent an agency from proceeding with a project if the benefits outweigh the costs disclosed in the EIS. Thus where the only irretrievable commitments of resources are those directly associated with an individual project, an impact statement covering that project is sufficient to enable the agency to act. However, in situations where the dedsion on one federal project was found to presently cause irretrievable commitments on future projects or the foreclosure of future options, this court and the Second Circuit quite properly found that an EIS for the entire project was necessary before the initial step could be taken.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">Applying the above analysis, the instant case is readily distinguishable from both <em>SIPI </em>and <em>Conservation Society. </em>Any coal-related federal action will undoubtedly require certain associated developments. For example, the approval of a mining plan will most probably require the granting of rail rights-of-way and the construction of housing facilities for mine employees. However, these are direct consequences of the initial action, and the agencies involved have always taken the position that such impacts must be considered in the EIS which precedes approval of the mining plan. This record is devoid of the type of commitment of \u201cregional\u201d resources which justified the results in <em>SIPI </em>and <em>Conservation. Society. </em>Developments in one part of the Northern Great Plains are essentially independent from developments elsewhere in the region. For example, the decision to permit mining of sub-bituminous coal in Wyoming, to which the Federal Government has the mineral rights, in no way commits Interior to approving proposals for mining lignite, similarly owned by the United States, in North Dakota. Even within each of the Basins which comprise the Region, development of some portion of the coal reserves does not irretrievably commit the federal agencies to permit development of the entire reserve. Furthermore, it is clear that even the larg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>est of the proposed projects will not have an environmental impact on the entire Northern Great Plains Region. It may indeed be the case that widespread development of this area will eventually occur, but the impetus for that development will come from the nation\u2019s need for coal and not from the fact that partial development of the region has been allowed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">If <em>SIPI </em>and <em>Conservation Society </em>were the only relevant decisions, the majority\u2019s arguments might have some appearance of validity. However, several courts have considered arguments such as those advanced by appellants, in cases which presented facts that were considerably closer to the instant case than <em>SIPI </em>and <em>Conservation Society, </em>and have determined that a \u201cregional\u201d EIS was unnecessary before individual projects within the \u201cregion\u201d could be approved. <em>See </em>Trout Unlimited v. Morton, 509 F.2d 1276 (9th Cir. 1974); Sierra Club v. Stamm, 507 F.2d 788 (10th Cir. 1974); Sierra Club v. Callaway, 499 F.2d 982 (5th Cir. 1974); Environmental Defense Fund v. Armstrong, 356 F.Supp. 131 (N.D.Cal.), aff\u2019d, 487 F.2d 814 (9th Cir. 1973); Jicarilla Apache Tribe of Indians v. Morton, 471 F.2d 1275 (9th Cir. 1973); Movement Against Destruction v. Volpe, 361 F.Supp. 1360 (D.Md.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">In its attempt to evade the clear holdings of these cases, the majority dismisses them with the assertion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-9\">Every cited case involved the propriety of an injunction against an individual project pending completion of a regional EIS or other study. None of the cases involved a direct challenge to the need for a regional EIS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">Majority Op. at n. 29. This is a classic example of a distinction without a difference. Surely, it is not reasonable to suggest that the decisions reached by other courts are somehow less sound because they were able to assess the need for a regional EIS in the context of a challenge to the sufficiency of a specific statement whereas this court is considering a challenge in the abstract without ever determining that a particular EIS does not comply with the dictates of NEPA. If any inference can be drawn from the majority\u2019s distinction, it would be that the cited cases are entitled to considerably more weight than this court\u2019s decision in the instant ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">In <em>Jicarilla, supra, </em>the court rejected contentions that impact statements issued in connection with each of several coal-fired electric generating projects in four southwestern states violated NEPA because they were issued prior to the completion of a Southwest Energy Study by the Interior Department. The m\u00e1jority is correct in pointing out that the plaintiffs in <em>Jicarilla </em>were specifically seeking delay pending the completion of a \u201cstudy\u201d rather than delay pending the preparation of a regional EIS, but rather than forming the basis of a distinction, this fact emphasizes its similarity to the instant case. The Southwest Energy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>Study \u201cwas designed to evaluate the problems created by further development of coal-fired electric power in the Southwest;\u201d (471 F.2d at 1279), a purpose quite similar to that of the Northern Great Plains Resources Program study. The Majority opinion at this point apparently overlooks the fact that its opinion ultimately does <em>not </em>direct the preparation of a regional EIS for the Northern Great Plains but rather just arrests development within the region until the study issues, at which point the need for a regional EIS would be assessed. The Ninth Circuit found that this sort of delay was not mandated by NEPA, and my conclusion on the facts of this case is to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">In Environmental Defense Fund v. Armstrong, <em>supra, </em>the Ninth Circuit affirmed a District Court decision rejecting an argument that an EIS covering the New Melones Dam project was inadequate because it did not include a \u201ccomprehensive study\u201d covering the entire California Central Valley Project. Although the plaintiffs once again requested only a study and not a regional EIS, the language of the District Court is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-5\">Under these circumstances there is no requirement under NEPA that the EIS with respect to the New Melones Project be delayed until a comprehensive study of the Central Valley Project be completed. So long as each major federal action is undertaken individually and not as an indivisible, integral part of an integrated state-wide system, then the requirements of NEPA are determined on an individual major federal action basis. Plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion that there is need for a comprehensive study of the Central Valley Project should be made to the Congress, and not to the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">356 F.Supp. at 139. As is stated above, the federal actions related to coal development in the Northern Great Plains fall largely into this same category. The majority notes that the court in <em>Armstrong </em>refused to wait for the study because no comprehensive study had been commenced, and therefore finds the case to be in sharp contrast to the instant case where the NGPRP Study is under way. It is revealing, however, that the majority does <em>not </em>find this fact to be of significance in its discussion of <em>Jicarilla </em>where the Southwest Energy Study had been released by the time the case was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">The remaining cases cited on <em>supra, </em>169 U.S.App.D.C. at -, 514 F.2d at 889, involved demands that a comprehensive EIS be prepared prior to the approval of individual projects and thus are squarely on point with the instant case. In Sierra Club v. Callaway, <em>supra, </em>the Fifth Circuit reversed a District Court decision which had ordered that construction of the Wallisville Reservoir project be held up pending the preparation of an EIS covering the entire Trinity Basin project. The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-11\">We conclude that the Wallisville and Trinity River Projects are not interdependent. The nexus between the projects is not such as to require an EIS evaluation of the Trinity Project as a condition precedent to an EIS evaluation of Wallisville. The Wallis-ville EIS should speak for itself. Wal-lisvlle is a separate viable entity. It should be examined on its own merits. Although it has been made compatible in certain of its features with Trinity it is not a mere component, increment, or first segment of Trinity. The court erred in so holding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">499 F.2d at 990. Faced with a similar situation, the Tenth Circuit reached the same conclusion in Sierra Club v. Stamm, <em>supra. </em>There the plaintiffs attacked the final EIS for the Strawberry Aqueduct and Collection System, a subunit of the larger Bonneville Unit which was in turn a part of the Central Utah Project, because <em>inter alia :</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-13\">(1) The Statement is too narrow in its scope and should include the cumulative and collective environmental impact of the entire Central Utah Project; (2) the Statement is incomplete in that it is a <em>final </em>statement as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>to the Strawberry Collection System only, and that it should, but does not, encompass all increments of the Bonneville Unit; .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">507 F.2d at 790. Relying on <em>Callaway </em>and <em>Armstrong, </em>the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-6\">In sum, then, we agree with the trial court that the Strawberry system in and of itself constitutes a \u201cmajor Federal action\u201d and that it is not a mere increment of either the Bonneville Unit or the Central Utah Project requiring a final impact statement for something more than the Strawberry system before work may be commenced on the Currant Creek Dam.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"arx-dedup-1\">507 F.2d at 792-93. Thus both the Tenth and Fifth Circuits decided cases against the Sierra Club on the same grounds that they assert here.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">In its most recent decision on this subject, the Ninth Circuit once again rejected claims that an EIS of larger scope was required by NEPA. The Teton Dam and Reservoir project had been divided into two phases. In Trout Unlimited v. Morton, <em>supra, </em>the plaintiffs argued that the EIS prepared for the initial phase was fatally inadequate because it did not discuss the environmental impact of the Second Phase. After considering the cases relied upon by the majority here,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-8\">The distinction between those situations in which it has been held that the EIS must cover subsequent phases and that before us is that here the First Phase is substantially independent of the Second while in those in which the EIS must extend beyond the current project, that project was dependent on subsequent phases. The dependency is such that it would be irrational, or at least unwise, to undertake the first phase if subsequent phases were not also undertaken. This is not the case here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">509 F.2d at 1285 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">The majority attempts to evade the fact that its decision, is contrary to the clear weight of authority elsewhere in the federal courts of the nation by arguing that each of the foregoing decisions involved a \u201ccrucial dependence upon the facts.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Obviously all judicial decisions turn on the facts which are presented to the court, but the majority has failed to offer any convincing explanation as to why the facts of the instant case, which present the same situations as the facts in the cases cited above, require a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">The regional water projects involved in <em>Callaway, Stamm </em>and <em>Trout Unlimited </em>had certainly progressed to the point where the federal agencies involved had concrete notions as to the ultimate scope of regional development, yet the court in each case found it unnecessary to prepare a regional EIS before acting on the initial phases of the development. In contrast, even if we ignore the statements by the federal appellees that there is at present no overall coordinated program for the development of coal resources in the Northern Great Plains, appellants have failed to establish that planning has progressed to the point where some proposal for major <em>regional </em>federal action exists which could be the subject of a regional EIS.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">Furthermore, although there are undoubtedly some interrelationships between development projects along the course of a single river or in a single watershed basin, the Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Circuits were still able to find the projects sufficiently independent to render a more comprehensive EIS unnecessary. The potential development of the Northern Great Plains lacks even this slight relationship between projects. Appellants, at a time of great need for new energy sources, are seeking to halt development of three grades of coal deposits distributed through four states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>and involving nine federal agencies and at least fifteen different forms of \u201cfederal action.\u201d Clearly the developments projected for this Region by appellants themselves do not have even the minimal interrelationships one might have expected to find in <em>Callaway, Stamm </em>or <em>Trout Unlimited.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">The majority is to be credited for perceiving the \u201cpractical difficulties\u201d inherent in appellants\u2019 contention that NEPA allows the courts to impose upon the Government the duty to plan comprehensively.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Truly, such an interpretation could result in the generation of an infinite progression of comprehensive plans which would have to be justified by comprehensive impact statements. It seems obvious that NEPA was enacted as a means of facilitating agency decision making and not as a means of paralyzing the federal government. However, I am concerned. that rather than nipping such fallacious notions in the bud, the majority attempts to demonstrate that appellants\u2019 arguments have a legal basis.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although its dicta is constructed on prior dicta and on CEQ Guidelines of questionable force as legal authority, it has laid the groundwork for the perpetuation of this erroneous and impractical position in future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">From its review of the record, the majority finds \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence that \u201cthe federal appellees have for years been endeavoring to develop a plan for regional development of the coal resources in the Northern Great Plains.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, the most remarkable thing about the first two such \u201cendeavors\u201d was the fact that they collapsed without producing any plan for regional development. The only currently pending activity which could lead to the \u201cregional plan\u201d anticipated by the majority is the Northern Great Plains Resources Program Study, but there is no assurance at present that it will be any more successful than the earlier studies. Furthermore, the Study was <em>never intended </em>to produce a comprehensive regional plan for coal development. The Draft Interim Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-12\">The primary objective of the Northern Great Plains Resource Program is to provide information and a comprehensive analysis that can be used to place the potential impacts of coal development into perspective and thereby assist the people of the Northern Great plains and the Nation in the management of the natural and human resources of this region.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-13\"><em>The three coal development profiles do not represent plans for development, </em>but are instead tools designed to help measure what the effects may be at different rates of development.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-14\">Northern Great Plains Resource Program, Draft Report, Sept. 1974, 1 \u2014 4,5 (emphasis in original). Not only is the Study insufficient to be viewed as a regional EIS, as the majority correctly notes,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> its issuance will probably add little to this court\u2019s ability to determine the need for a regional EIS if on remand the federal appellees adhere to their position that they have not yet adopted or proposed a regional development program.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">Since review of the record and consideration of those cases which have dealt with claims for the preparation of more \u201ccomprehensive\u201d impact statements lead me to agree with the District Court<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> that NEPA does not require the preparation of an EIS covering all coal-related development in the entire Northern Great Plains at this time, there is no need to remand this case for further proceedings. Nor is there any justification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>in further delaying projects which are already supported by impact statements through continuation of this court\u2019s temporary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">If appellants believe at some point that an EIS issued in support of federal action on a particular project fails to adequately consider all reasonably related environmental impacts, they can challenge that project under the normal procedure for judicial review of impact statements. Furthermore, in the event the various agencies take concrete steps toward the establishment of a federally coordinated program of regional development, appellants will of course be able to bring their suit if the agencies take a \u201cmajor federal action\u201d to implement that program without the preparation of the necessary impact statements.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">While the majority\u2019s attempt to force the federal government to engage in comprehensive long-range planning might in some sense be socially \u201cgood,\u201d the question before this court is not what the agencies \u201cought to\u201d do but rather what NEPA requires that they do. To my mind it clearly does not require or authorize the continuance of the temporary injunction to hold federal agencies in check because the majority are suspicious of what the federal agencies might do. I accordingly respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-9\">.

However, the real question in this case is whether such a comprehensive study is necessary here. As here indicated, this is merely another form of the inquiry into the sufficiency of statements on individual projects.

By a stroke of luck, this vague \u201cregion\u201d roughly conformed with the 63 county area which the Northern Great Plains Resources Program (NGPRP) study later identified as the area in which development was likely to occur. However, the conclusion that a region has potential for development is a far cry from a declaration that the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>government is undertaking a program of coordinated development of the region. The District Court correctly concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-5\">The \u201cNorthern Great Plains region\u201d as described by the plaintiffs is not an entity, region, or area which has been defined by the Federal Government by statute or executive action for purposes of any Federal program, project, or action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Finding of Fact, fl 7, App. 235. Permitting appellants to define their own region for purposes of this action raises the clear possibility that other potential plaintiffs could seek an infinite progression of \u201cregional\u201d statements covering \u201cregions\u201d of their own choice, thus seriously disrupting any attempt by the federal appellees to deal with the development of a critical national resource. The majority recognizes the danger posed by its decision to allow appellants to maintain this action (Majority Op. 169 U.S.App.D.C. at---, 514 F.2d at 874, 875) but declines to give the District Court any guidance on whether it must allow new plaintiffs to maintain suits seeking to compel, for example, the preparation of statements covering all coal deposits in the nation or covering a single Basin in the Northern Great Plains Province, both of which \u201cregions\u201d have also been the subject of various studies. This entire problem could be avoided simply by requiring appellants to challenge a particular federal action, thus enabling the court to evaluate the extent of the environmental impact from that action and define the region accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b944-9\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>the impact statements prepared for the Westmoreland Resources and Peabody Coal Company mines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b944-10\">.

The geographic area for basic consideration is that part of the Powder River Coal Basin in Wyoming lying generally eastward from the Powder River to the outcrop line of the coal resource and from somewhat north of Gillette to a point somewhat south of Douglas. The area delineation is based in part on present and anticipated levels of mining activity, differing quality of the coal resource, different physical arrangement of the coal beds, somewhat different mining techniques required and differing physical reclamation requirements. Those considerations having a broader scope of geographic impact such as social conditions, economic factors, atmospheric influence, water resources, and recreation uses are treated on a larger regional basis than the primary study area. This statement discusses the existing environment, evaluates the collective impact of the proposed actions and, insofar as now possible, the impacts of potential future coal mining within the geographic area described above. This statement also examines in detail certain proposed activities for which federal actions are required.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b944-14\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Eastern Powder River Coal Basin, which covers four mines and an associated rail right-of-way. More recently, Interior has released a draft EIS for the Belle Ayr South Mine of the Amax Coal Company, also located in the Eastern Powder River Basin. The Preface to that document states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-15\">In January 1974, the Departments of Interior and Agriculture and the Interstate Commerce Commission decided that, under provisions of Section 102 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, an environmental impact statement must be prepared before any decision could be made on pending proposals for major development of federally-owned coal in the Eastern Powder River Basin of Wyoming. At that time, there were, four major strip mine plans pending approval before the Department of the Interior. There was also pending before the Interstate Commerce Commission proposed construction of a railroad some 113 miles in length, between the Belle Ayr Mine spur southeast of Gillette, Wyoming, and Douglas, Wyoming. This railroad was to serve the coal mines proposed to be developed along the proposed right-of-way in the basin. The construction of this railroad line, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>four mining proposals, as well as a number of other anticipated or possible future coal-related developments and all their impacts on the environment, were evaluated in an environmental impact statement entitled \u201cProposed Development of Coal Resources in the Eastern Powder River Basin of Wyoming.\u201d The final statement was filed with the Council on Environmental Quality by the Department of the Interior on October 18, 1974.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-8\">Part I of that final environmental impact statement (hereinafter designated FES 74-55) was devoted to a regional analysis encompassing the existing environment, all projected coal development and the cumulative effect of this development on the environment. Parts II through VI of the FES specifically dealt with the four mine plans and the construction of the railroad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-9\">Due to the increased nationwide demand for low sulphur coal for the generation of electricity, it was anticipated that a number of large strip coal mines, in addition to those four mines considered in Parts III through VI of FES 74-55, would also be proposed for development of Federal coal leases in the near future in the Eastern Powder River Coal Basin. Accordingly, the regional analysis of FES 74-55 included data and information from every proposed operation known to be under consideration by the various leaseholders in the study area. In this way the cumulative impacts of the total potential development could be assessed. Subsequent to initiation of preparatory efforts for FES 74-55 and prior to its filing in final form, other proposed mining and reclamation plans for development of existing Federal coal leases in the area were filed for' approval with the Geological Survey, Department of the Interior, as required by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-15\">Because of the submission date, these plans could not be included for site specific analyses in FES 74-55. In the assessment which follows, the site specific aspects of the proposed mining and reclamation plans for the South Belle Ayr Mine of the Amax Coal Company, are analyzed using information and data previously published in FES 74-55 together with information gained from field observations and company reports. Part I of FES 74-55 is incorporated herein by reference.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"AeGU\">.

The LMFBR has no independent significance absent such future uses.

The Majority Opinion at n. 28 cites two \u201cexamples\u201d of how it contends the various present and potential developments are interrelated \u2014 the availability of water supplies and manpower resources in the region. Actually, the use of the term \u201cmanpower\u201d is a misnomer since what the majority is really talking about is the pressure of the influx of necessary additional manpower on the area. Insofar as one mine creates pressure for a population influx, that is just one more factor to be considered in the EIS for that particular project. However, the opening of that mine in no way commits the agencies to authorizing other mines which would require the importation of additional manpower not already in the area at a future date. With respect to water resources, there is no showing here that the strip mines, which presently are the only projects actively being developed, have sufficient impact on regional water resources to foreclose future alternatives. The proper time to consider such problems will be when the agencies move to a proposed type of development which does tax regional resources. If there is insufficient water for a particular type operation, then that type operation would not be used. In any event, this entire discussion points up the importance of appellants\u2019 failure to show at any point in this record that the EIS on any particular project has failed to adequately consider all relevant environmental impacts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b949-10\">.

The majority\u2019s suggestion that the agencies might be required to prepare an impact statement or a statement of reasons to justify why they are <em>not </em>taking major federal action to control development of the Northern Great Plains (Majority Op. 169 U.S.App.D.C. at -, 514 F.2d at 881-882 and n. 37) is clearly not consistent with the provisions of NEPA. Despite the current size of the federal bureaucracy, the realm of things the federal government does <em>not </em>do is still rather large. A good many of these inactions undoubtedly have an impact on the environment, but it is difficult to see how any agency would be able to produce this nearly infinite number of \u201cnegative\u201d impact statements and still carry out its assigned functions.
