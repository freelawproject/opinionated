In this case they challenge the power of the grand jury to charge them with criminal conduct in this manner without indicting them. We conclude that the grand jury exceeded its power and authority and that its action was a denial of due process to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">\n<em>I. The facts.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Following political demonstrations and disruptions at the Republican Party National Convention at Miami, Florida, on August 21 \u2014 24, 1972, a federal grand jury sitting in the Northern District of Florida undertook an investigation into the disturbances and their causes. The grand jury\u2019s probe led it to believe in the existence of a plot to achieve riot and the widespread use of various implements of violence. On October 18, 1972, the grand jury issued a five-count indictment. We set out in the margin the pertinent parts of Count One,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which charged a conspiracy to violate various federal statutes in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 871, a felony offense. The statutes were:</p>\n<p id=\"b854-16\">\u201418 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101: organizing, promoting, encouraging and participating in a riot.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-17\">\u201418 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(i): malicious destruction of property by means of explosives.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-18\">\u201418 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(h): use of explosives to commit federal felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>\u201426 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d): possession of unregistered firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">\u201426 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(c): possession of non-tax paid firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The alleged conspirators included ten named persons plus others not named. Of the ten persons named, seven were made defendants and three were not. The latter three, although accused of participation in the criminal conspiracy, were denominated in the indictment as \u201cunindicted co-conspirators.\u201d Of the persons not named some were alleged to be known and others unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Prior to the trial of the seven named defendants, two of the three named but unindicted persons, Robert Wayne Beverly and John Victor Chambers, filed a petition in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida, seeking entry of an order expunging the references to them in Count One of the indictment. The United States Attorney appeared and contested the application. The named defendants did not object to expunction of references to Beverly and Chambers. The District Judge denied the petition without opinion or statement of reasons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The petitioners appealed. Pending appeal and following a month-long trial before a jury,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the indicted conspirators were acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">The issue for decision appears to be of first impression at the appellate level.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-15\">\n<em>II. Justiciability, standing and mootness.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b855-16\">We hold that there is a case or controversy, that the appellants have standing, and that the acquittal of the persons named as defendants does not moot the case. The government\u2019s position to the contrary on each of these points is founded upon its argument that since the appellants were not indicted, and particularly since those named as defendants were acquitted, the formal branding of appellants as alleged felons and as participants in a distasteful conspiracy is a mere chimera, neither substantial nor injurious. This is at least disingenuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-17\">Beverly and Chambers complain of injury to their good names and reputations and impairment of their ability to obtain employment. The courts have recognized in many contexts that these are substantial and legally cognizable interests entitled to constitutional protection against official governmental action that debases them. Wisconsin v. Constanti-neau, 400 U.S. 433, 91 S.Ct. 507, 27 L.Ed.2d 515 (1971), concerned validity of a Wisconsin statute providing for posting of public notices labelling persons as excessive drinkers. The Court characterized \u201ca person\u2019s good name, reputation, honor, or integrity\u201d as protected interests and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-18\">It would be naive not to recognize that such \u201cposting\u201d or characterization of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>an individual will expose him to public embarrassment and ridicule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 435-36, 91 S.Ct. at 509, 27 L.Ed.2d at 518. The Court observed that to some persons posting under the statute might be merely the mark of an illness, but to others it was \u201ca stigma, an official branding of a person,\u201d the imposition of a \u201cdegrading\u201d and \u201cunsavory\u201d label. <em>Id. </em>at 437, 91 S.Ct. at 510, 27 L.Ed.2d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">In Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), the Supreme Court recognized that a teacher\u2019s \u201cinterest in liberty\u201d would be adversely affected if the state, in declining to rehire him, made \u201cany charge against him that might seriously damage his standing and associations in his community.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The public ignominy of being accused of crime is one of the factors underlying the Sixth Amendment right to speedy trial. Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U.S. 213, 221, 87 S.Ct. 988, 18 L.Ed.2d 1, 7 (1967). In Jenkins v. McKeithen, 395 U.S. 411, 89 S.Ct. 1843, 23 L.Ed.2d 404 (1969), the interest of appellant that was recognized was that he not be publicly branded as a criminal without a trial through the means of a state-created \u201cCommission of Inquiry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">In Application of American Society for Testing and Materials, 231 F.Supp. 686 (E.D.Pa.1964), the court acted to protect the name and reputation of a named but unindicted conspirator in an antitrust action. The American Society (ASTM) was a nonprofit corporation comprised of persons drawn from major industries of the United States, having as one of its purposes the standardization of specifications and methods of testing various materials, and headed by persons described by the court as \u201cdedicated, selfless scientists.\u201d In the same series of litigation the court acted to also protect the name of a business concern that was another named but indicted conspirator. Application of Turner and Newall, Ltd., 231 F.Supp. 728 (E.D.Pa., 1964).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">The legally protected right in Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 71 S.Ct. 624, 95 L.Ed. 817 (1951), was that of a charitable organization \u201cto carry on its work, free from defamatory statements of the kind discussed.\u201d 341 U.S. at 140-141, 71 S.Ct. at 632, 95 L.Ed. at 837 (designation of an organization as communist by the Attorney General of the United States).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">Appellants complain also of injury to their economic interests. One\u2019s right to hold specific private employment and to follow a chosen profession free from unreasonable governmental interference comes within the \u201cliberty\u201d and \u201cproperty\u201d concepts of the Fifth Amendment. Greene v. McElroy, 360 U.S. 474, 492, 79 S.Ct. 1400, 3 L.Ed.2d 1377, 1388 (1959) (denial of security clearance for access to classified information resulting in loss of job and inability to find other employment); with respect to public employment, <em>cf. </em>Board of Regents v. Roth, <em>supra, </em>Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972). It would be unrealistic to deny that an accusation, even if unfounded, that one has committed a serious felony may impinge upon employment opportunities.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">In the present case the District Judge recognized the injury to appellants\u2019 interests. Addressing government counsel at the hearing on appellants\u2019 application he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-14\">There are two points involved. One is their right to be heard and beyond that is the basic right they assert. What these people, what these cases are really saying is just this. How would you or how would I or how would any around this room like to have the Grand Jury come in and name us as a co-conspirator and yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>not indict us and give us no chance to be heard, and these cases do get into pretty serious areas in that respect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIq\">Beverly and Chambers were not subjected to the burdens of trial and the risk of conviction, as were the persons named as defendants. They do not, however, seek to protect their reputations against these hazards but rather against the opprobrium resulting from being publicly and officially charged by an investigatory body of high dignity with having committed serious crimes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition to being serious, the offenses charged were given wide notoriety and were peculiarly offensive. An alleged conspiracy to disrupt the national nominating convention of a major political party strikes at the core of democratic institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The government defies common sense \u2022 with its theory that one\u2019s interests are not adversely affected to any extent by being publicly branded as a felon so long as he is not named as a defendant for trial. We reject as frivolous the contention that if appellants have suffered injury it is at the hands of only the news media to whom they should repair for relief. Coupled with these two arguments by the government is a third, which can be described as \u201cinnocence by association,\u201d that is, that the judgment of acquittal of the seven named defendants both exonerated the appellants and repaired any injury they may have suffered. Certainly the judgment did not in a legal sense exonerate Beverly and Chambers, who were not on trial and had no access to the forum. It does not bar later indictments against them. It is mere speculation to say that in a practical sense the vindication of the named defendants rubs off on the appellants and ameliorates their injury. The acquittal of a named defendant is not wholly curative of the reputational injury suffered by having been charged and tried, but our system permits the residual injury in its pursuit of overall societal interests. The appellants ar\u00e9 not even the beneficiaries of such a partial cure. So far as we, the parties, and the public at large can discern, the jury may have considered Beverly and Chambers \u2014 -not present to defend themselves \u2014 as the real culprits. The indictment remains in the official records of the Northern District of Florida and presumably of the Department of Justice. The currency given to it \u2014 at least that in written form \u2014 remains unretracted in libraries and depositories.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">What we have said leads to several conclusions. There is an actual case or controversy. It is narrow, sharply drawn, and concrete. On one side are the persons who complain of injury to them by a single document, and on the other side is the sovereign, defending the power of the grand jury to do what was done. The appellants fulfill the standing requirements established by the Supreme Court in Ass\u2019n of Data Processing Service Organizations v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970), and in Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972). <em>See </em>Florida v. Weinberger, 492 F.2d 488 (CA5, 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">The issue is not political. The subject matter has not been expressly reserved to the executive or legislative branches. <em>See </em>Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947, 959 (1968); Gilligan v. Morgan, 413 U.S. 1, 93 S.Ct. 2440, 37 L.Ed.2d 407, 415-416 (1973). The court will be able to resolve the issue without doing violence to the doctrine of separation of powers, and the relief sought is within the power and competence of the judicial branch. <em>See </em>Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 217, 82 S.Ct. 69, 7 L.Ed.2d 663, 685-86 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">The dispute has not been resolved by subsequent developments, and an opinion will not be merely advisory. <em>See </em>California v. San Pablo &amp; Tulare Ry. Co., 149 U.S. 308, 37 L.Ed. 747, 748-49 (1893); C. Wright, Law of Federal Courts, \u00a7 12, at 35 \u2014 36 (2d Ed., 1970). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Both the dispute and the injury to appellants are real, direct and continuing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">From these threshold issues we turn to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">\n<em>III. The merits.</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-6\">The institution of the grand jury is deeply rooted in Anglo-American history. In England, the grand jury served for centuries both as a body of accusers sworn to discover and present for trial persons suspected of criminal wrongdoing and as a protector of citizens against arbitrary and oppressive governmental action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 342-343, 94 S.Ct. 613, 617, 38 L.Ed.2d 561, 568 (1974). In its investigative-accusative function the grand jury determines if there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed, and issues indictments accordingly. <em>Id.; </em>Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">In its function of shielding and protecting the citizen against arbitrary and oppressive governmental action the grand jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-9\">Historically . . has been regarded as a primary security to the innocent against hasty, malicious and oppressive persecution; it serves the invaluable function in our society of standing between the accuser and the accused ... to determine whether a charge is founded upon reason or was dictated by an intimidating power or by malice and personal ill will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">Wood v. Georgia, 370 U.S. 375, 390, 82 S.Ct. 1364, 1373, 8 L.Ed.2d 569, 580 (1962) (footnote omitted). The Supreme Court again recognized the shielding function of the grand jury in Jenkins v. McKeithen, <em>supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-15\">[T]he grand jury is designed to interpose an independent body of citizens between the accused and the prosecuting attorney and the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AG7\">395 U.S. at 430, 89 S.Ct. at 1853, 23 L.Ed.2d at 422. The judges of this court recognized the grand jury\u2019s dual function as investigator-accuser and as protector in the four separate opinions issued in United States v. Cox, 342 F.2d 167 (CA5), cert. denied sub nom. Cox v. Hauberg, 381 U.S. 935, 85 S.Ct. 1767, 14 L.Ed.2d 700 (1965). <em>See </em>342 F.2d at 170, 174-75, 183, 189-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-16\">In this country the grand jury was considered so essential to liberty that the Fifth Amendment precluded federal prosecution for serious crime without a presentment or indictment by a grand jury. United States v. Calandra, supra, 414 U.S. at 343, 94 S.Ct. at 617, 38 L.Ed.2d at 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-17\">Neither the Constitution, federal statutes, nor the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure define the functions or powers of the grand jury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Its powers have been delineated by the courts. In Re Grand Jury Proceedings, 479 F.2d 458, 460 n. 2 (CA5, 1972) (the \u201cEl Paso Case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-18\">An indictment is returned by a grand jury pursuant to its investigatory-accusatory function. It is a specific accusation of crime, having a threefold purpose: notice to the defendant, pleading in litigation, and the basis for the determination of former acquittal or conviction. United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 558, 23 L.Ed. 588 (1876); United States v. Seeger, 303 F.2d 478 (CA2, 1962); 1 Orfield, Criminal Proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>dure Under the Federal Rules \u00a7 7.80 at 665 \u2014 666. None of these functions em compasses public accusations directed at persons not named as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">We have found no reported opinion or scholarly commentary, and the government suggests none, contending that a federal grand jury is empowered to accuse a named private person of crime by means of an indictment which does not make him a defendant. The government, unable to point to supporting authority, states that the practice has long been in effect. In Application of United Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers, 111 F.Supp. 858 (S.D.N.Y., 1953), a similar argument was advanced in an effort to give validity to a grand jury report accusing private persons of crime. The court responded, 111 F.Supp. at 869:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"alr-dedup-1\">That [grand jury reports] have been received without challenge does not import judicial sanction or authority in the Grand Jury to issue them. The most that can be said is that they were not challenged and were permitted to go by default.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Hammond v. Brown, 323 F.Supp. 326 at 345 \u2014 46 (N.D.Ohio), aff\u2019d 450 F.2d 480 (CA6, 1971) (challenging the \u201cKent State\u201d prosecutions), also rejected custom as a basis on which to sanction grand jury reports criticizing or defaming private persons without indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">The offending document in this case is an indictment that accuses appellants but does not make them defendants for trial. No claim is made, indeed none can be made, that it was or purported to be a grand jury \u201creport.\u201d We refer, however, to the body of law concerning reports by federal grand juries because it is consistent with what we here conclude with respect to indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-15\">Common law grand juries at times issued nonindicting reports. Usually these were directed at undesirable community conditions or the conduct of public affairs, and did not purport to charge a criminal offense and to bring an offender to justice but were for the purpose of arousing public and legislative indignation. See the authorities collected in Judge Ainsworth\u2019s opinion in the <em>El Paso </em>case, <em>supra, </em>479 F.2d at 460 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-16\">The authorities are divided upon whether a <em>federal </em>grand jury has authority to issue a report of <em>any kind. </em>Authorities pro and con are reviewed in In re Report and Recommendations of June 5, 1972 Grand Jury, 370 F.Supp. 1219 (D.D.C., 1974) (concerning delivery of \u201cWatergate\u201d grand jury report to House Committee on the Judiciary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This court pretermitted the issue in the <em>El Paso </em>case, 479 F.2d at 460, and it is not presented for decision in this case. Rather, as a tool in analyzing the specific issue of authority that is before us, we examine the outer limits of the historical authority of grand juries to render reports. In jurisdictions that do permit grand jury reports, they usually are limited to public affairs as opposed to public persons, or if permitted to extend to .named public officials they usually may comment upon only their conduct of affairs short of crime.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-17\">In <em>United Electrical, supra, </em>the court expunged a report that did not concern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>matters of a general nature touching on conditions in the community but broadly accused private persons \u2014 labor union officials \u2014 of false swearing in executing noncriminal affidavits. In Hammond v. Brown, <em>supra, </em>the federal district court expunged the report of an Ohio state grand jury which had indicted 25 persons in connection with events occurring in May 1970 at Kent State University. The report charged 28 unindicted faculty members with sharing responsibility for tragic shootings by national guardsmen. It assigned major responsibility to the administration of the university and rendered sweeping moral and social judgments on policies, attitudes and conduct of the administration and of some faculty and students.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Judge Sirica, in the Watergate grand jury case, In re Report and Recommendation of June 5, 1972 Grand Jury, <em>supra, </em>upheld the power of the federal grand jury to render a report which was <em>\u201ca </em>simple and straightforward compilation of information gathered by the <em>J </em>Grand Jury, and no more.\u201d 370 F.Supp. at 1226. He distinguished the report before him from those held to be unauthorized in <em>United Electrical </em>and Hammond v. Brown on the ground it drew no accusatory conclusions and deprived no one of an official forum in which to respond. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The Seventh Circuit, in Application of Johnson, 484 F.2d 791 (CA7, 1973), declined to suppress a grand jury report concerning a confrontation between Chicago police and members of the Black Panther Party in which two party members were killed, and in so doing distinguished <em>Hammond </em>and <em>United Electrical </em>on the ground that the report before it charged no petitioner with illegal activity.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">Despite the variation in views concerning the limits of grand jury power to issue reports, we find no substantial authority permitting a federal grand jury to issue a report accusing named private persons of criminal conduct. We perceive no persuasive reason why the federal grand jury should be permitted to do by indictment what it could not do within the historical outer limits of a grand jury report.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, if a choice of evils were necessary, accusation by indictment, a legal tool more familiar to the public at large and also more precisely targeted, would seem to be the more objectionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">The courts have struck down with strong language efforts by grand juries to accuse persons of crime while affording them no forum in which to vindicate themselves. Thus, <em>United Electrical </em>(with respect to reports):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj4C\">While the courts have given special reasons, varying with the jurisdiction, for expunging reports of a specific nature, the main ground relied upon by all is one of policy. Broadly stated, that ground is that a man should not be subject to a quasi-official accusation of misconduct which he cannot answer in an authoritative forum. The Grand Jury, it is thought, when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>issues such reports, is imposing the punishment of public reprimand \u2014 a punishment based upon ex parte proceedings which have not yielded enough evidence to warrant indictment. When it does this it defeats the very purpose of its existence. While the State courts have, for the most part, countenanced general reports which do not single out individuals, they have uniformly condemned specific censure by the Grand Jury. And the commentators are in accord that such censure should not be permitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeHX\">Ill F.Supp. at 867 \u2014 868. People v. McCabe, 148 Misc. 330, 333, 266 N.Y.S. 363, 367 (1933), with respect to a presentment,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-5\">A presentment is a foul blow. It wins the importance of a judicial document; yet it lacks its principal attributes\u2014 the right to answer and to appeal. It accuses, but furnishes no forum for denial. No one knows upon what evidence the findings are based. An indictment may be challenged \u2014 even defeated. The presentment is immune. It is like the \u201chit and run\u201d motorist. Before application can be made to suppress it, it is the subject of public gossip. The damage is done. The injury it may unjustly inflict may never be healed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">In dismissing a grand jury report that accused state judges and attorneys of wrongdoing either criminal or little short of criminal, the Florida Supreme Court said this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-7\">The medieval practice of subjecting a person suspected of crime to the rack and other forms of torture is universally condemned; and we see little difference in subjecting a person to the torture of public condemnation, loss of reputation, and blacklisting in their chosen profession, in the manner here attempted by the grand jury. The person so condemned is just as defenseless as the medieval prisoner and the victim of the lynch mob .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">State v. Interim Report of Grand Jury, 93 So.2d 99 at 102 (Fla., 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">Public accusation of misconduct through use of a non-indicting indictment is subject to the same comments just quoted (although we recognize the seductive appeal springing from familiarity with the practice of using the device and from absence of prior attack upon it).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">We have referred to the second function of the grand jury, that of serving as a shield for the citizen against baseless charges of crime and from misuse of power by prosecutor and court. The grand jury that returns an indictment naming a person as an unindicted conspirator does not perform its shielding function but does exactly the reverse. If the charges are baseless, the named person should not be subjected to public branding, and if supported by probable cause he should not be denied a forum. Failure of the grand jury to perform its shielding function where, appropriate may be explained by the tendency of the body, with its members not learned in the law, to follow the lead of the prosecutor, who is its legal advisor. We are told that in this instance the origin for the grand jury\u2019s action was the prosecutor.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-13\">[W]e submit that <em>it is within the prosecutor\u2019s discretion to recommend </em>to the grand jury that named co-conspirators should or should not be indicted together with the principal defendants, and that <em>where, as here, the grand jury acquiesces in that recommendation, </em>it cannot be said to have acted illegally. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">Brief for the United States, p. 27.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>Next we turn to constitutional limitations on the grand jury. \u201cThe grand jury . . . need not provide all ... procedural guarantees.\u201d Jenkins v. McKeithen, <em>supra, </em>395 U.S. at 430, 89 S.Ct. at 1853, 23 L.Ed.2d at 422. It does not, however, enjoy blanket exemption from the commands of due process. The absence with respect to the grand jury of procedural safeguards required in other contexts is but an application of the usual rule that due process requirements vary according to particular circumstances. The role the sovereign plays and the nature of the governmental interest are weighed against the harm or loss resulting to the individual. <em>See, e. g., </em>Wisconsin v. Constantineau, <em>supra; </em>Jenkins v. McKeithen, supra; Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers Union v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 895, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230 (1961); Hannah v. Larche, 363 U.S. 420, 80 S.Ct. 1502, 4 L.Ed.2d 1307 (1960); and Greene v. McElroy, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A8Rt\">One indicted by a grand jury has no right to appear before that body, under oath or otherwise. He is not entitled to present evidence or to have particular persons called as witnesses. He has only a limited right to counsel if he appears, and no right to be present in person or by counsel while evidence is being presented. He has no right to confrontation and to cross-examination, and no right to present argument. He is not entitled to know the identity of the witnesses who testified concerning him, and even after the grand jury has completed receiving evidence, its evidence is unavailable to him. He may not demand a statement of reasons supporting the body\u2019s conclusion. The evidence and the witnesses underlying the grand jury\u2019s action surface, if at all, at a criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">The incidents of due process afforded an unindicted conspirator are more limited than those available to one named as a defendant. The unindicted conspirator is not a party to the criminal trial where names and facts come to light, and he has no right under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to intervene. If he is a witness at the trial, which is at least a possibility, he may be excluded from the courtroom except when testifying. And finally, of course, a decision in the trial that the defendants were not guilty of criminal conduct neither vindicates him nor bars his being subsequently indicted and tried as a defendant.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">In part II, <em>supra, </em>we have already discussed the harm to the citizen who is accused but <em>not </em>indicted. To further the necessary process of weighing this private injury against governmental interest we have sought to discern what legitimate interests of the government are served by stigmatizing private citizens as criminals while not naming them as defendants or affording \u2014 in this case, indeed, affirmatively opposing \u2014 access to any forum for vindication. The Department of Justice suggests nothing that rises to the dignity of a substantial interest. The Department does state in conclusory terms that \u201cthe interest of justice may on occasion require that [un-indicted conspirators] be named in the indictment.\u201d These \u201cinterests of justice\u201d are not identified, and the cases cited in support concern naming in the indictment the victim of crime where necessary to protect the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">There is at least an implication that in this instance naming Beverly and Chambers was considered necessary in order to prove, or facilitate the proof, of conspiracy by the persons named as de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>fendants. We are left to speculate as to the precise form such necessity (or convenience) might take. Possibly the government means that its chance of obtaining a conspiracy conviction of persons named as defendants is increased by attributing to the named defendants the acts of a greater number of persons. But the indictment may make such additional persons defendants if there is probable cause to believe that they participated in the alleged conspiracy. We have been tendered no reason why in this case, if there was probable cause, the appellants were not included among those made defendants. Obviously, if there was no probable cause, they should not have been named as conspirators\u2014 indicted or unindicted. Additionally, if the prosecutorial goal is to expose the named defendants to the broadest possible attribution of the acts of others, it can be attained without actually naming non-defendants as unindicted conspirators. The government may introduce evidence at trial of a person\u2019s participation in a conspiracy and thereby ascribe his acts and statements to the co-conspirators even if that person is not named in the indictment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">In the instant ease, Count One charged that the named conspirators conspired \u201cwith divers other persons, <em>some known </em>and <em>others unknown </em>to the grand jury.\u201d We have not been told why the two appellants were named while other persons who were alleged to be conspirators and whose identity was known were left behind the protective cloak of anonymity.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Finally, we know of no reason why, if the indictment wishes to center upon a specific person but not name him as defendant, he cannot be described as \u201cJohn Doe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">An unindicted conspirator anonymously designated as an \u201cother person\u201d or as \u201cJohn Doe\u201d may be unmasked in a bill of particulars or at trial. The bill of particulars is, however, the statement of the prosecutor and does not carry the imprimatur of credibility that official grand jury action does. At least arguably its public impact may be tempered by protective orders entered by the court. When a witness testifies at trial he does so as a private individual and makes no formal adjudication regarding criminality. An indictment, the formal act of an impartial, formally convened quasi-judicial body of historical status and power, carries more impact on the reputation of its subject than does trial testimony. In any event, it must be recognized in the process of balancing private injury and governmental interests that wholly different, and valid, governmental interests apply to naming the private citizen in a bill of particulars or in trial testimony than apply to identifying him in the indictment as an unindicted conspirator.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">If the implied governmental interest of \u201cnecessity to prove the conspiracy\u201d relates to inducing persons to testify as prosecution witnesses, the government has available other and less injurious means than those employed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">Nine of the ten persons named in the indictment were active in the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, an anti-war group. The naming of appellants as unindicted conspirators was not an isolated occurrence in time or context. The same procedure was employed in other cases.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Note, Federal Grand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Jury Investigation of Political Dissidents, 7 Harv.Civ.Rts.-Civ.Lib.L.Rev. 432 (1972). There is at least a strong suspicion that the stigmatization of appellants was part of an overall governmental tactic directed against disfavored persons and groups. Visiting opprobrium on persons by officially charging them with crimes while denying them a forum to vindicate their names, undertaken as extra-judicial punishment<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> or to chill their <em>\\ </em>expressions and associations, is not a \u2019governmental interest that we can ac'cept or consider. It would circumvent the adversary process which is at the heart of our criminal justice system and of the relation between government and citizen under our constitutional system. It would be intolerable to our society.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Having balanced the governmental interest in the grand jury\u2019s functions and the harm caused thereby to individuals, we conclude that so long as the federal grand jury acts within the limits of its powers to investigate, to indict, and possibly to issue limited types of reports, the governmental interest in these important and historical functions tips the balance against requiring the full panoply of due process. Here, with respect to Beverly and Chambers, the grand jury acted beyond its historically authorized role, and we are shown no substantial interest served by its doing so. The balance tips wholly in favor of the adversely affected appellants. The scope of due process afforded them was not sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">The extent to which the grand jury could be constitutionally authorized to act beyond the powers presently conferred upon it by common law and statutes, and the exact contours of procedural due process that then would be required in a balancing process to protect the interests of persons affected, is not for us to decide in this case.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> What we do decide is that this particular grand jury\u2019s actions with regard to these appellants exceeded its powers and violated due process as well.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">\n<em>IV. The power to expunge.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b864-12\">The grand jury has been variously viewed as an arm of the court, as an instrumentality of the people,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and as an adjunct of the judiciary but with the power to act, within certain bounds, independently of the traditional branches of government. We conclude, without the necessity of adopting a particular characterization, that a federal court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>the power to expunge unauthorized grand jury action. In the <em>El Paso </em>case, over insistence by the government that we lacked power, we ordered expunction of parts of a grand jury report relating to non-federal subject matter and serving no federal purpose. In Branzburg v. Hayes, <em>supra, </em>408 U.S. at 688, 92 S.Ct. at 2660, 33 L.Ed.2d at 644, the Court noted that \u201cthe powers of the grand jury are not unlimited and are subject to the supervision of a judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">We have already pointed out in part II the exercise by the district court, over government objection, of the power to protect unindicted conspirators in the Johns-Manville antitrust litigation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Application of American Society for Testing and Materials, 231 F.Supp. 686 (E.D.Pa., 1964), and Application of Turner and Newall, Ltd., 231 F.Supp. 728 (E.D.Pa., 1964). Prior to trial of the first group of defendants American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) filed a \u201cstatement . . . setting forth . . . the predicament in which it was placed by being named in the Indictment without being made a defendant.\u201d 231 F.Supp. at 687. ASTM participated in the trial, though to what extent is not clear. At the conclusion of the government\u2019s case ASTM moved to strike the portions of the indictment referring to it. The court entered a memorandum that the parts in question should be \u201cconsidered as having been deleted,\u201d and later, at the request of ASTM, instructed the jury to ignore those parts because there was no evidence to justify them. All named defendants in trial were acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">During trial ASTM had also filed a separate action requesting expunction and entry of formal findings that it had not committed the violations charged against it. After trial this separate suit was heard. The court rejected the government\u2019s argument of lack of jurisdiction. ASTM offered testimony from the criminal trial plus additional testimony and more than 100 exhibits. The court indicated it would enter appropriate findings of fact protecting ASTM, with a right in the government to come forward with an offer of evidence to the contrary in an upcoming trial of other defendants.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The court directed that there be attached to the particular paragraphs of the indictment a reference to the court\u2019s order \u201cso that the court\u2019s records will not improperly reflect on a corporation which is entitled to the presumption of innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">The other unindicted conspirator, Turner and Newall, filed after trial a motion to expunge, which was treated by the court as a separate suit. 231 F.Supp. 728. The court overruled the government\u2019s jurisdictional objections and granted relief similar to that granted ASTM.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-13\">The government, while contending these two cases were wrongly decided, also attempts to distinguish them on the ground that the motions were made later in the proceedings than in the instant case and that relief was granted after the court had a record on which to determine if there was any basis to support the allegations of the indictment. This misses the mark. <em>ASTM </em>and <em>Turner and Newall </em>represent an ad hoc approach that presumably was reasonably satisfactory to the affected parties since neither appealed from denial of pre-trial relief. At best the remedy they offer is a poor one. If the movant is successful, relief comes only after a trial at which the formal charge of criminal conduct inevitably has been given greater currency. If he is unsuccessful, added dignity is given to his criminal label by judicial refusal to remove it, a decision made after examination of a record to which the victim is not a party. In the final analysis, of course, probable cause on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>basis of which the grand jury might have made the unindicted conspirator a defendant is unrelated to the question of whether the grand jury may accuse him without making him a defendant. Finally, these two cases graphically demonstrate the awkwardness of attempting, at trial and after trial, to protect the interests of the named but unindicted conspirator.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">\n<em>V. Sovereign immunity and grand jury immunity.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Sovereign immunity does not bar appellants from relief. That doctrine precludes private suits against the United States which would result in a drain on the public treasury or would inhibit the necessary and proper functioning of government. <em>See </em>Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731, 67 S.Ct. 1009, 91 L.Ed. 1209, 1216 (1947); Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609, 620, 83 S.Ct. 999, 10 L.Ed.2d 15, 23 (1963). This is not such a proceeding. Beverly and Chambers asked no substantive relief against the government but rather made only a comparatively mild request to strike from the indictment charges that the government was not able to show served any substantial purpose. A request to expunge, in the circumstances here presented, at the request of persons having standing, was no more subject to the defense of sovereign immunity than the filing of a bill of particulars or the raising of an objection to the indictment by the named defendants.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Grand jurors, individually and collectively, enjoy a privilege assert-able in suits for defamation;<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> but that privilege is not applicable to bar the petition of appellants to remove language from the indictment. Neither monetary damages nor an order against the grand jury was sought. Rather appellants sought equitable relief that would not interfere with the jury\u2019s proper functioning. Compare Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288, 294-95 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">\n<em>VI. Grand jury secrecy.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">The conclusions which we reach with respect to the power of the grand jury and the demands of due process make it unnecessary for us to discuss the issue of whether naming a person as an unindict-ed conspirator without making him a defendant violates the requirements of grand jury secrecy.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">\n<em>VII. Appellate jurisdiction.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">In the <em>El Paso </em>case we had no doubt of the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to consider and act upon the order of the District Court nor do we entertain any doubt in this case. Beverly and Chambers filed a notice of appeal, and (as in <em>El Paso) </em>we have referred to them as appellants, but the court may consider the matter as a petition for a writ of mandamus.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-14\">\n<em>VIII.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b866-15\">The decision of the District Court is vacated and the cause is remanded with directions that the District Court order that the Clerk of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida expunge from Count One of the indictment described above all references to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-16\">Vacated and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b854-8\">.
