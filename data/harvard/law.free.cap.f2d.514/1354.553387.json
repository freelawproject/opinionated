Petitioners alleged racial discrimination in WSNT\u2019s operation and ' a failure adequately to serve the entire Sandersville community, which is 60 percent black. In an opinion and order dated 11 March 1971, the FCC designated WSNT\u2019s renewal application for hearing pursuant to section 309(e) of the Communications Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to the scheduled hearing, the petitioners and the licensee reached a settlement and as a result petitioners urged that WSNT\u2019s renewal application be granted. Petitioners also requested that WSNT be required to reimburse the legal expenses incurred in prosecuting the petition to deny. At the same time that it granted WSNT\u2019s renewal application, the Commission denied Turner\u2019s request that WSNT be ordered to reimburse its expenses, on the authority of <em>KCMC, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1413-7\">While Turner\u2019s appeal of the Commission's denial was pending, this court, in Office of Communication of United Church of Christ v. FCC,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> reversed the <em>KCMC </em>decision. Upon the joint request of the parties, Turner\u2019s appeal was remanded to the Commission for further consideration in light of the opinion in <em>United Church of Christ.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1413-12\">On remand the Commission concluded that it was without legal authority to require WSNT to reimburse Turner\u2019s expenses and that reimbursement was not warranted on the facts of this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While conceding that its powers under sections 4(i) and 303(r) of the Communications Act were broad, it was persuaded that the authority to order reimbursement of legal expenses should not be implied \u201cabsent specific statutory authority.\u201d The Commission in its opinion dealt with the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-13\">[T]he shifting of attorney\u2019s fees is not a new concept. The fact is that fee shifting was well known to Congress when the Act was adopted, and Congress did not choose to number it specifically among the Commission\u2019s regulatory tools. Moreover, any attempt to infer such power from general grants of authority has to be considered in the light of the traditional rule in this nation\u2019s courts against awards of attorney\u2019s fees, the strict limitations on the Commission\u2019s powers under the Act to require broadcast li\u2022censees to pay out money, and the fact that Congress has not hesitated in other circumstances to authorize fee awards explicitly when it has determined such authorization to be warranted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1413-14\">18. The federal courts have awarded attorney\u2019s fees in certain classes of cases not covered by statute, and Turner argues by analogy that the Commission has authority to do the same thing. But the \u201cfoundation\u201d for this practice in the courts is \u201cthe original authority of the \u25a0 chancellor to do equity in a particular situation,\u201d Spra-gue v. Ticonic National Bank, 307 U.S. 161, 166, 59 S.Ct. 777, 780, 83 L.Ed. 1184 (1939), and the Commission has no such equitable authority. Instead, the Commission must find its authority in its enabling statutes. Regents v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>Carroll, 338 U.S. 586, 70 S.Ct. 370, 94 L.Ed. 363 (1949); Illinois Citizens Committee v. FCC, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1414-4\">We affirm the Commission\u2019s order. Congress, and not the Commission, can authorize an exception to the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d that litigants bear the expense of their litigation. The reasoning of the Supreme Court in Alyeska Pipeline Co. v. Wilderness Society<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is fully applicable to litigation before the Federal Communications Commission. Congress has no more extended a \u201croving commission\u201d to the FCC than it has to the Judiciary \u201cto allow counsel fees as costs or otherwise whenever the [Commission] might deem them warranted.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Commission in its opinion noted that \u201cCongress has not hesitated in other circumstances to authorize fee awards explicitly when it has determined such authorizations to be warranted.\u201d In fact, two provisions of the Communications Act specifically provide for the award of attorney\u2019s fees in court litigation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1414-11\">In conclusion, we wish clearly to distinguish our prior opinion in <em>United Church of Christ. </em>It is one thing to approve a voluntary agreement in which a litigant has agreed to reimburse his adversary his expenses and attorney\u2019s fees in an appropriate case. It is quite another for an agency to order a litigant to bear his adversary\u2019s expenses. Before an agency may so order, it must be granted clear statutory power by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1413-10\">.
