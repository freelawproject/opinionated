United States, 1973, 475 F.2d 623, 201 Ct.Cl. 77, as well as Moline Properties v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1943, 319 U.S. 436, 63 S.Ct. 1132, 87 L.Ed. 1499, and National Carbide Corp. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1949, 336 U.S. 422, 69 S.Ct. 726, 93 L.Ed. 779, the district judge ruled that the corporate entity could not be ignored in the situation presented and entered judgment for the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1341-7\">The United States was entitled by law to the summary judgment granted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1341-9\">. Collins et al. v. United States of America, S.D.Ga.1974, 386 F.Supp. 17. The decision is also reported unofficially at 35 A.F.T.R. 75-497.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1341-11\"><em>. </em>On the authority of <em>National Carbide, </em>text supra; <em>Harrison Property Management, Inc., </em>text supra; Greer v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir. 1964, 334 F.2d 20, 23-24, and Given v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 8 Cir. 1956, 238 F.2d 579, the district judge correctly rejected an alternative contention that Bencap, Inc. was merely the agent or trustee of the individual plaintiffs in the role performed by it, and that, so regarded, they were entitled to claim the interest and depreciation deductions to which Bencap, Inc. was nominally entitled.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
