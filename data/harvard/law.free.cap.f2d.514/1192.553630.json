JOSEPH SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1251-21\">In the course of serving a term of imprisonment, Francis Bloeth was transferred from New York State\u2019s Adirondack Correctional Treatment and Evaluation Center to its Attica Correctional Facility. On the day following his arrival at Attica, Bloeth was placed in protective confinement in Housing Block Z (HBZ), where his contact with the general inmate population was restricted. The prisoner immediately instituted a <em>pro se </em>civil rights action, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against the superintendent of the prison, attacking the lawfulness of his confinement in HBZ and requesting damages and in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>junctive relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> With affidavits from both parties before him, Chief Judge John T. Curtin of the United States District Court for the Western District of New York on June 7, 1974, dismissed the complaint \u2014 in effect, thereby granting summary judgment against the plaintiff. <em>See </em>United States ex rel. Haymes v. Montanye, 505 F.2d 977, 979 (2d Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">Appropriately citing Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (2d Cir. 1971) (en <em>banc), </em>as the controlling precedent in this case,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the appellant contends that the district court erred in concluding that the process due him under <em>Sostre </em>was in fact afforded him by the prison officials in confining him in HBZ.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Guided by our prior interpretation of <em>Sostre </em>in a protective confinement context in United States ex rel. Walker v. Mancusi, 467 F.2d 51 (2d Cir. 1972), we must disagree and therefore affirm the order below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">In <em>Sostre, supra, </em>442 F.2d 178 at 198, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-6\">If substantial deprivations are to be visited upon a prisoner, it is wise that such action should at least be premised on facts rationally determined. This is not a concept without meaning. In most cases it would probably be difficult to find an inquiry minimally fair and rational unless the prisoner were confronted with the accusation, informed of the evidence against him, and afforded a reasonable opportunity to explain his actions. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1252-13\">Since Bloeth\u2019s confinement was protective as opposed to punitive \u2014 i. e., effected to guard against foreseeable harm rather than to discipline for past infractions \u2014 he suffered under New York law no loss of privileges or good time.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Chief Judge Curtin could reasonably have found, then, that the deprivation experienced by the appellant was relatively insubstantial. And adjusting downward <em>Sostre\u2019s </em>flexible confrontation and hearing requirements to comport with the magnitude of the deprivation, <em>cf. </em>Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970), one may conclude that <em>Sostre </em>was satisfied in these regards by the opportunities given Bloeth to contest the basis for his protective confinement in writing<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and at weekly meetings with the superintendent. <em>Compare </em>United States ex rel. Walker v. Mancusi, <em>supra. </em>Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>the district court also acted well within its discretion in finding that the prison administration\u2019s statement of the evidence against Bloeth<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> satisfied the standards laid down in <em>Sostre.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>For if \u201c[p]rison authorities must of necessity be allowed wide discretion in the use of protective confinement for the purpose of protecting the safety and security of the prison and its general population,\u201d United States ex rel. Walker v. Mancusi, <em>supra, </em>467 F.2d 51 at 53, then those officials must perforce be permitted to justify their decisions to order protective confinement in terms as relatively unspecific as those used in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">Finally, in view of Bloeth\u2019s criminal record,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the several recent incidents of his resisting orders from prison officials <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and his frequent transfers of late between state facilities,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the district court cannot be faulted for giving great weight to the prison officials\u2019 conclusion that Bloeth presented \u201ca clear and imminent danger to the facility, its employees and inmates because of past action and attitude.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And in deferring in large measure to that conclusion, the district court could quite properly have found that Bloeth\u2019s protective custody of 35 days did not constitute an unduly long observation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-7\">The order of the district court in effect granting summary judgment to the defendant is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1251-12\">. \u00a7 1983. Civil action for deprivation of rights</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-13\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-22\">\u00a7 1343.

The plaintiff originally sought to enjoin the superintendent to release him from HBZ and expunge from his prison record any reference to his stay in HBZ. The need for the court to order Bloeth\u2019s release from HBZ expired well before the court\u2019s order in the case with the prisoner\u2019s return, by virtue of institutional decision-making, to the general prison population.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1252-8\">. We have no occasion to consider the import of the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion in Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 925 (1974), which was decided subsequent to the events in this case and held not to be retroactive, id. at 573-74.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1252-9\">. Specifically, Bloeth maintains that this court should reverse the district court\u2019s determination and order judgment entered in his behalf because he was allegedly not provided in the prison with a statement of the evidence requiring, in the prison officials\u2019 view, his confinement in HBZ. Alternatively, he argues that facts critical to an adjudication of his complaint were not decided by the district court\u2014 whether or not he received the prison report detailing the basis for his protective confinement (see note 8 <em>infra </em>) and whether or not he received a hearing (see text <em>infra </em>) \u2014 and that a remand to the district court for an evidentiary hearing is therefore appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1252-15\">. See United States ex rel. Walker v. Mancusi, 338 F.Supp. 316, 317-18 n. 1 (W.D.N.Y.1971) (on motion for reconsideration), aff\u2019d 467 F.2d 51 (2d Cir. 1972) (account of testimony of Walter Dunbar, Executive Deputy Commissioner of the New York State Department of Correctional Services). The regulations pertaining to protective confinement, 7 N.Y.C.R.R. \u00a7\u00a7 304.1(b), 304.2(b), 304.3 (1970), do not state this policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1252-16\">. On the date of his assignment to HBZ, Bloeth was given Form 251-C-l, \u201cInmate Response to Protective Admission and Custody Assignment,\u201d which informed him of his right to communicate \u201cimmediately in writing\u201d with the superintendent as to \u201cany explanation or information which you want to be considered by the Superintendent. . . . \u201d Appendix of Appellant at 12.

In an affidavit of July 20, 1973, submitted to the district court and sent to the plaintiff, Harold Smith, then deputy superintendent of Attica (later superintendent), specifically indicated that Bloeth received a copy of the Elmore report (see note 7 <em>supra </em>). Appendix of Appellant at 9-10. In his two affidavits to the district court, the plaintiff failed to refute this allegation. <em>See id. </em>at 27-33.

Between August 3, 1972, and July 20, 1973, Bloeth moved from the Green Haven Correctional Facility to the Clinton Correctional Facility to the Adirondack facility to Attica and, finally, during the pendency of this suit, to the Auburn Correctional Facility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1253-24\">.

The issues, however, are troublesome.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-11\">Disciplinary proceedings in prisons or jails utilize a matrix with which courts are familiar \u2014 a charge that a specific forbidden act has been committed and limited discretion to \u201cpunish\u201d on a finding of guilt. Administrative segregation in correctional institutions presents less familiar territory \u2014 a judgment that dangers may exist in the future and an undefined discretion to \u201cprotect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-12\">The possibilities of arbitrariness and of abuses in this second category of cases are obvious. Yet, it is equally clear that there are great potential dangers when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>large numbers of criminals, many with demonstrated tendencies towards violence and with severe emotional and intellectual problems, are forced into the close, tension-provoking quarters of our prisons. How to balance the need for fairness and the demand for effective authority in such circumstances is a matter courts have only begun to consider. <em>See, e. g., </em>Newkirk v. Butler, 499 F.2d 1214, 1217 (2d Cir. 1974), cert. granted, 419 U.S. 894, 95 S.Ct. 172, 42 L.Ed.2d 138 (1974); Gomes v.
