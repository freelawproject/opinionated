We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-26\">Briefly, the allegations in the complaint are to the effect that defendants (1) deprived plaintiffs of their property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment by depositing into the Fund interest earned on inmates\u2019 savings accounts held in trust under Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 5008;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) violated plaintiffs\u2019 Four<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>teenth Amendment rights by depositing into the Fund a portion of the proceeds from public sales of their paintings and handicrafts under Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 2877; (3) denied plaintiffs their right to free expression under the First and Fourteenth Amendments by withholding a portion of those sale proceeds under \u00a7 2877; (4) denied plaintiffs their right to equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment by withholding such sale proceeds under \u00a7 2877 while crediting inmate-authors with all the proceeds from sales of their respective writings;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (5) denied plaintiffs equal protection of the laws by employing the Fund under \u00a7\u00a7 2877, 5006, and 5008 so as to impose a significant cost of punishment and incarceration on the inmates rather than on the public generally; and (6) violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments by subjecting plaintiffs to unlawful forfeitures under \u00a7\u00a7 2877, 5006 &amp; 5008.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">These claims, upon which plaintiffs seek to enjoin as unconstitutional the operation of several California statutes of statewide application, are of the species reserved for disposition on the merits by a three-judge district court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2281. <em>See </em>Gilmore v. Lynch, 400 F.2d 228, 229-230 (9th Cir. 1968) (ordering convening of three-judge district court), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1092, 89 S.Ct. 854, 21 L.Ed.2d 783 (1968), on remand, 319 F.Supp. 105 (N.D.Cal.1970) (three-judge court decision), aff\u2019d sub nom., Younger v. Gilmore, 404 U.S. 15, 92 S.Ct. 250, 30 L.Ed.2d 142 (1971). <em>See also </em>Martinez v. Procunier, 354 F.Supp. 1092 (N.D.Cal.1973), aff\u2019d sub nom., Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974). Since a dismissal for failure to state a claim, unlike a dismissal for want of jurisdiction, is a disposition on the merits, the single-judge district court involved here could only have dismissed the action for want of federal jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 542-543, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974); Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682-683, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946); Ex parte Pore-sky, 290 U.S. 30, 31-32, 54 S.Ct. 3, 78 L.Ed. 152 (1933). In so dismissing the action, the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-7\">True enough, federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) would be lacking here, absent a substantial federal constitutional question. However, under the test of Goosby v. Osser, 409 U.S. 512, 518, 93 S.Ct. 854, 35 L.Ed.2d 36 (1973), as further elucidated in Hagans v. Lavine, <em>supra, </em>415 U.S. at 536-543, 94 S.Ct. 1372, it is clear that none of the claims upon which plaintiffs seek injunctive relief is so utterly devoid of merit as to deprive the district court of its jurisdiction under \u00a7 1343. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order dismissing the action and denying plaintiffs\u2019 application to convene a three-judge court must be vacated and the cause remanded for further proceedings before a three-judge district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-8\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1149-17\">. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint also seeks declaratory relief and damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1149-27\">. It is unclear whether plaintiffs are claiming a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or an unconstitutional \u201ctaking\u201d in violation of the Fifth Amendment made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">. Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 '2600 permits an inmate to own all written material which he or she produces during his or her period of imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
