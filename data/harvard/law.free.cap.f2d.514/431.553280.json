There is only one substantial issue presented by their appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>cifically requested that the jury be instructed, in accordance with the authorities in the Second Circuit,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that in order to convict on a conspiracy count the jury must find that the conspirators had specific knowledge of the interstate transportation of the stolen goods which was the predicate for federal jurisdiction. At the time of the trial, in April and May of 1974, this circuit had never adopted Judge Learned Hand\u2019s formula, first announced in United States v. Crimmins, 123 F.2d 271 (2d Cir. 1941), that the government must prove \u201canti-federal\u201d intent in order to prove a conspiracy to commit a substantive offense which did not require such an intent. <em>See </em>United States v. Iannelli, 477 F.2d 999, 1002 (3d Cir. 1973), aff\u2019d on another ground, - U.S. -\u2022, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 43 L.Ed.2d 616 (1975), which involved a conviction both under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 and under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955. When the case was argued on January 24, 1975, we were aware that certiorari had been granted in United States v. Alsondo, 486 F.2d 1339 (2d Cir. 1973), rev\u2019d sub nom. United States v. Feola,-U.S.-, 95 S.Ct. 1255, 43 L.Ed.2d 541 (1975), and that the case had been argued on November 19, 1974. Since the government at oral argument conceded that an af-firmance by the Supreme Court in United States v. Feola would mandate a reversal, this panel concluded that the case should be held until the Supreme Court acted.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">On February 12, 1975 another panel of this court, in United States v. Pepe (DiGiacomo), 512 F.2d 1129 (3d Cir., filed February 12, 1975),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> reversed a conviction in a case where there was a complete absence of proof of the facts giving rise to federal jurisdiction. Dictum in the case suggested for the first time that this circuit would require the so-called <em>Crimmins </em>charge with respect to a conspirator\u2019s knowledge of the federal jurisdictional facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">If the dictum in United States v. Pepe, <em>supra, </em>was the binding circuit precedent we would be required to reverse.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, on March 19, 1975, the Supreme Court in United Sates v. Feola, <em>supra, </em>reversed United States v. Alsondo, <em>supra, </em>rejected the <em>Crimmins </em>line of cases and approved the result in United States v. Iannelli, <em>supra </em>on that point.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus the district court properly declined to charge defendants\u2019 request to charge No. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">The judgment appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-16\">. In addition to the issue discussed in the text, Grandinetti and Cappucci contend (1) that they were entitled to a judgment of acquittal because the government\u2019s evidence was insufficient; (2) that the court should have charged that the mere relationship of buyer and seller of stolen goods did not establish the conspiracy charged in the indictment; (3) that the court should have given requests to charge #16 and #17 dealing with multiple conspiracies; (4) that the charge as to burden of proof and reasonable doubt was misleading and inadequate; and (5) that the questioning and argument by the government attorney went beyond the bounds of proper prosecutorial conduct. We have considered each of these contentions in the light of the record and find them to be without merit. One additional contention deserved separate comment. The government\u2019s chief witnesses were accom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>plices. The court gave the standard accomplice charge but declined to charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">\u201cThe fact that both Coyle and Esposito \u2018turned government\u2019s witness\u2019 affects injuriously the credit to be given to their testimony for it is suggestive at least of a bargain between them and the government\u2019s authority with relation to the disposition of past or pending indictments against them or the punishment to be inflicted upon them in exchange for their testimony offered to bring about the conviction of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">The court did instruct with respect to the effect of prior inconsistent statements and prior criminal convictions on the witnesses\u2019 credibility. Recognizing that the existence of a plea bargain in exchange for testimony may affect credibility we still find no error in declining to give a more elaborate charge on credibility based on speculation about such a bargain. We do not in this case address the question whether defendants are entitled to a specific instruction with respect to credibility of a witness who has formally been granted immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b490-16\">.
