BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">This is a historic case, not because of the intrinsic difficulty of the issues, but because this is our first published opinion utilizing the certification provisions recently adopted by the citizens of Alabama.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have repeatedly been the judicial beneficiaries of similar such procedures permitted by Florida<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and more recently Louisiana<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and now we welcome the opportunity to refer to the Supreme Court of Alabama questions of Alabama law on which it is not only the latest word \u2014 as we might <em>Eiriely </em>be\u2014 but the last word.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-21\">This technique of certification to the highest court of a state under carefully controlled restrictions of important and doubtful questions<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> has just recently been given another boost by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>As is our regular practice, we obtained from counsel their agreed questions and stipulated facts and present them here for the use of the Alabama Supreme Court. As the case comes to us, the sole question for decision is whether pursuant to a (1) binding receipt or (2) policy itself a policy of life insurance was in effect covering appellant/benefieiary\u2019s deceased husband at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">In resolving this question, the District Judge found against the Insured on both the facts and the Alabama law and granted the Insurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. While we do not denigrate the conclusions of the District Judge, we select the certification option because of the uncertainty of the Alabama law governing this case. This uncertainty coupled with the not infrequent result that a Federal Court of Appeals is \u201creversed\u201d by the highest court of the <em>Erie </em>state <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> make this a peculiarly appropriate case for certification. Indeed, it is precisely these ordinary, repetitive contract interpretations which, because of their recurring nature involving literally hundreds of contracts with many public policy factors affecting the welfare of local citizens, call for unequivocal resolution by the final court.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">We are acutely aware of how identical contract language takes on diverse meanings when viewed from opposite sides of that imaginary line separating two adjacent states. Understandably, policy considerations differ in their impact on the jurisprudence of individual states.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When the state law is in doubt especially on the underlying public policy aims, it is in the best administration of justice to afford the litigants a consistent final judicial resolution by utilizing the certification procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">\n<em>Summary Of The Arguments Pro and Con</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">In order to reduce the case to more manageable proportions, we summarize in brief the arguments of the litigants. In seeking to establish coverage under the Binding Receipt, the Insured maintains that Condition 3 (set out in the certificate at page 12, infra) should be construed as allowing the insurer to reject the application within the 30-day period. Absent such rejection, the policy should be deemed in effect as of the date of application. Moreover issuance of the policy on November 5 \u2014 after the 30-day conditional period had elapsed\u2014 amounted to a waiver of Condition 3 and created coverage that reverted to the date of the initial Binder Receipt, September 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">In addition, the Insured theorizes that the policy paragraph controlling the effective date of the policy (as shown in the certificate at page 14, infra) reactivated the binder. This paragraph, the Insured reasons, creates ambiguity in determining whether the provisions of the binder or the policy control where the conditions of the binder are not met and such an ambiguity should be resolved in favor of the Insured. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Torrance, 224 Ala. 614, 141 So. 547 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">Conversely, the Insurer maintains that the Insured\u2019s construction of Condition 3 is in effect an impermissible attempt to create primary liability through waiver. <em>See, </em>Protective Life Insurance Co. v. Cole, 1935, 230 Ala. 450, 161 So. 818 (1935); St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. v. Air Comfort Engineers, Inc., 47 Ala.App. 301, 253 So.2d 525 (1971). <em>Cf. </em>Kaminer v. Franklin Life Insurance Co., 5 Cir., 1973, 472 F.2d 1073.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>As an alternative argument, the Insured contends that even if the policy did not become effective pursuant to the binder, the policy was activated prior to the date of death when it was mailed to the Insurer\u2019s agent on November 6. As support the Insured points to the fact that under Alabama law, the placing of a policy in the mail to the soliciting agent constitutes delivery to the Insured. <em>See, </em>United Insurance Company of America v. Headrick, 275 Ala. 594, 157 So.2d 19 (1963); Life and Casualty Insurance Company of Tennessee v. La-tham, 255 Ala. 160, 50 So.2d 727 (1951). Therefore, delivery within the meaning of the policy provision occurred on November 6 when the assistant secretary of the Insurer placed the policy in the mail to the agent. Under this theory of Insured\u2019s case, the.question then is whether the proposed Insured remained in a state of \u201ccontinued insurability\u201d \u2014 the other prerequisite for the effectuation of the policy \u2014 as of the date of delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">While there is no Alabama precedent precisely on point, the Insurer in response cites some relevant Alabama case law. <em>Cf. </em>Southern States Life Ins. Co. v. Dunckley, 226 Ala. 588, 148 So. 320 (1933); Cherokee Life Ins. Co. v. Brannum, 203 Ala. 145, 82 So. 175 (1919). Additional weight is added to the Insurer\u2019s position by the legion of Alabama cases construing the more common \u201cgood health at the time of delivery\u201d provision as a warranty, the breach of which allows the Insurer to avoid liability where the risk is materially increased. See, e. g., North Carolina Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Coleman, 248 Ala. 32, 26 So.2d 120 (1946); Vredenburgh v. Liberty National Life Ins. Co., 246 Ala. 251, 20 So.2d 207 (1944); Protective Life Ins. Co. v. Fischer, 234 Ala. 436, 175 So. 391 (1937). Moreover, Insured notes the analogous law of other states on this point. See Mathews v. Metropolitan Life Co., 89 So.2d 641 (1956, Fla.); Leach v. Millers Life Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1968, 400 F.2d 179 (Miss.).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">QUESTIONS CERTIFIED</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">CERTIFICATION FROM THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ALABAMA', PURSUANT TO ALABAMA CONSTITUTION ARTICLE 6, SECTION 140(b)(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">To the Supreme Court of Alabama and the Honorable Justices thereof</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">It appears to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that the above-styled case in this Court involves a question or proposition of the law of the state of Alabama which is determinative of the cause, and there appear to be no clear, controlling precedents in the decisions of the Supreme Court of Alabama. This Court certifies the following questions of law to the Supreme Court of Alabama for instructions concerning said questions of law, based on the facts recited therein, pursuant to Alabama Constitution Article 6, Section 140(b)(3); such case being an appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">MATTERS ON WHICH COUNSEL FOR THE PARTIES ARE IN AGREEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">H. M. McClendon, the defendant-ap-pellee\u2019s soliciting agent, first called upon Robert O. Barnes and Margie C. Barnes, husband and wife, in August of 1970 soliciting their application for insurance upon the life of Robert O. Barnes on behalf of the defendant-appellee. Agent McClendon represented to the Barnes that a monthly automatic premium check-off at the Barnes\u2019 bank in Colum-biana, Alabama would be made by the defendant-appellee. H. M. McClendon again called upon Robert O. Barnes, the insured, and Margie C. Barnes, the Beneficiary, husband and wife, on September 8, 1970 at their home in Columbiana, Alabama; and he secured an application for life insurance and an initial premium payment by cash of Twenty-two and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>47/100 Dollars ($22.47) from Robert O. Barnes giving him in return a Binding Receipt. The application was for a policy of life insurance in the amount of $10,000. The premium for a $10,000 policy of life insurance of the type policy applied for by Robert O. Barnes was $21.57 per month. Said printed Binding Receipt reflects in Agent McClendon\u2019s handwriting the receipt of a Twenty-two and 47/100 Dollar ($22.47) initial monthly premium and \u201camount $10,000.00 . . . $20,000.00.\u201d The Binding Receipt stipulates the effective date of the policy will be the later of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjNb\">\u201cdate of application, or date of medical examination, if required, provided that the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">1. proposed insured is determined by the Company at its Home Office in Atlanta, Georgia, in accordance with its rules and practices, to be insurable on such date for the policy exactly as applied for;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-6\">2. first full premium is paid in cash on date of application;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-7\">3. policy is issued exactly as applied for within 30 days from this date;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\">4. total insurance in force with the Company on the life of the proposed insured, including amount now applied for, will not exceed $50,000.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">The application was filled out by Agent McClendon, signed by Robert O. Barnes and provided, <em>inter alia, </em>medical information to the company. There had been discussion between Agent McClen-don and Robert O. Barnes about additional coverage for accidental death. No notation was made on the application concerning any double indemnity coverage for accidental death, except there was a premium notation of payment in advance of $22.47 on the application\u2014 the total amount of premium including accidental death benefits coverage on a policy as applied for by Barnes. The application was referred to in and made a part of the policy. Robert O. Barnes disclosed on the application that he had a lung operation at Prattsburg Air Force Base, New York, while in military service. \u201cA week or two after McClendon took Barnes\u2019 application\u201d he returned to Barnes\u2019 residence and secured Barnes\u2019 signature to a medical authorization form to be used by the defendant-appel-lee\u2019s underwriting department in determining if they were to issue the policy. No further contract was made between McClendon or defendant-appellee with Robert O. Barnes or his beneficiary until after his death on November 13, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">The binding receipt was never sent to defendant by its agent. The application was forwarded to defendant and was processed for a policy of life insurance in the amount of $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">On November 4, 1970 the insured was admitted to the Veterans\u2019 Administration Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama with gunshot wounds to the face and died on November 13, 1970 due to cerebral concussion and hemorrhagic pneumonia.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">On November 6, 1970 defendant prepared a policy of life insurance on the life of Robert O. Barnes in the amount of $10,000 with an effective date of November 5, 1970 and with an initial premium of $21.57. This policy was mailed to defendant\u2019s agent for delivery to Robert O. Barnes along with a letter dated November 5, 1970, addressed to Robert O. Barnes, referring to Policy Number 70K2580, reflecting a carbon copy to \u201cAgent: H. M. McClendon\u201d and enclosed therewith \u201cReceipt for First Premium and Record of First Payment.\u201d Neither defendant nor its agent had any knowledge on November 6, 1970 or prior thereto that Robert O. Barnes had suffered gunshot wounds on November 4, 1970 and was in the hospital on November 6, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-14\">Agent McClendon attempted physical delivery of the policy to the Barnes\u2019 home on November 14, 1970 \u2014 the funeral date of Robert O. Barnes. Defendant\u2019s agent did not know when he attempted to deliver the policy to Robert 0. Barnes on November 14, 1970 that Robert O. Barnes had been shot and had died the day before. When he learned Mr. Barnes was dead, the agent mailed the policy back to defendant\u2019s Home Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-15\">On December 4, 1970 the defendant-appellee mailed its check payable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>plaintiff-appellant for Twenty-two and 47/100 Dollars ($22.47) stating \u201cduring our investigation of the pending application pertaining to his past medical history, we were unable to issue and deliver the insurance policy as he applied for during his good health, insurability and lifetime.\u201d This quoted verbiage is taken from that paragraph of the policy which is styled \u201cEffective Date\u201d except the words \u201cgood health\u201d are added by the writer thereof \u2014 C. Ervin Waller, President of defendant-appellee. The paragraph in the policy entitled \u201cEffective Date\u201d is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-4\">\u201cEffective Date \u2014 This policy will be effective as soon as it has been delivered to the owner and the first premium has been paid during the lifetime and continued insurability of the proposed insured. If the first premium is paid in exchange for a binding receipt on the date of application, then this policy will become effective as provided in the binding receipt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">QUESTIONS FOR ALABAMA SUPREME COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">1. Does the insurer\u2019s failure to issue the policy exactly as applied for within 30 days of the date of application preclude coverage from attaching as of the date of application pursuant to Condition 3 of the binding receipt?</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">2. Was there a waiver of Condition 3 of the binding receipt by the insurer\u2019s issuance of a policy after 30 days from the date of application without knowledge that the insured had become unin-surable before the date the policy was prepared and issued?</p>\n<p id=\"b767-13\">3. Did the policy clause providing that \u201cthis policy will be effective as soon as it has been delivered to the owner and the first premium has been paid during the lifetime and <em>continued insurability </em>of the proposed insured\u201d preclude coverage under the policy from attaching as of November 6, the date in which the insurer placed the policy in the mail to its agent, in view of the fact that the decedent was admitted to a Birmingham hospital on November 4 suffering from a gunshot wound which ultimately resulted in death on November 13 when the evidence shows insurer had no knowledge of the injury to the insured?</p>\n<p id=\"b767-14\">4. Does the insurer\u2019s statement that the policy was issued on the basis of medical furnished with the application estop the insurer to deny coverage from the date of the Binding Receipt although the policy was not issued within 30 days <em>even though insurer was unaware at the time it made the statement that the insured had become uninsurable?</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-15\">5. Is there an ambiguity between the policy and the Binding Receipt concerning the effective date of the policy? If so, which provision controls under the facts of this case?<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-16\">The entire record in this case, the Court\u2019s opinion, together with copies of the briefs of the parties the letter directive, counsels\u2019 memoranda on certification, proposed certification with differences and all of the papers are transmitted herewith.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-11\">..
