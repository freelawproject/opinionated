On December 31, 1973, the appel-lee, Barbera, an Italian citizen who had entered the United States through Canada, was detained by a border patrol agent when he failed to respond to questions regarding his citizenship during a \u201croving patrol\u201d of a bus at the depot in Malone, New York.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was led from the bus in custody, and at the request of the border patrol agent, he produced his passport for examination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It revealed that Barbera did not possess any valid travel documents. He was then formally arrested and charged under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325 with entering the United States by eluding inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Relying principally upon AlmeidaSanchez v. United States, 413 U.S. 266, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973), appellee moved to suppress the evidence seized from him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Simply stated, his claim was that the search in question took place on a regularly scheduled bus which had traveled nonstop within the United States from Massena, New York, to the bus station in Malone, that the bus station could not be regarded as the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a border so as to validate the search as a \u201cborder search,\u201d and that his search and detention could not be otherwise justified. The United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, Edmund Port, Judge, granted appellee\u2019s motion to suppress. The Government appeals under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">The Government\u2019s powers to exclude aliens from the country, Chae Chan Ping v. United States, 130 U.S. 581, 9 S.Ct. 623, 32 L.Ed. 1068 (1889), and to collect duties, U.S.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 8, cl. 1, each carries with it the right to effectuate \u201cborder searches,\u201d under which individuals crossing international borders may have their persons, their luggage or effects, as well as the conveyances in which they cross, searched without warrant or probable cause.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The dual purpose of the search is to ascertain whether an illegal alien is seeking to cross the border or whether contraband or dutiable property is being smuggled. Congress has further legitimatized this power to search by giving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>to an officer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) \u201cunder regulations prescribed by the Attorney General . . . power without warrant\u201d first to arrest any alien who in the officer\u2019s presence or view is entering or attempting to enter the country, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357(a)(2),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, second,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">within a reasonable distance from any external boundary of the United States, to board and search for aliens any vessel within the territorial waters of the United States and any railway car, aircraft, conveyance, or vehicle, and within a distance of twenty-five miles from any such external boundary to have access to private lands, but not dwellings, for the purpose of patrolling the border to prevent the illegal entry of aliens into the United States</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">While the Attorney General\u2019s regulations could have carefully defined or substantially prescribed the border search powers, to date they merely provide for a redelegation of the powers to \u201c[a]ny immigration officer,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.1(c), under standards which defined the term \u201cexternal boundary\u201d to include the coastline up to the \u201cthree-mile limit,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.1(a)(1), and defined \u201creasonable distance\u201d to mean \u201c100 air miles from any external boundary . or any shorter distance which may be fixed by the district director . . ..\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.1(a)(2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Relying on the 100-mile limit specified in the Attorney General\u2019s regulations, and without further standards or refinements spelled out in rules or regulations, the INS through its border patrol<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> conducted three types of surveillance along <em>inland </em>roadways\u2014 permanent checkpoints at certain nodal intersections, temporary checkpoints at various places, and \u201croving patrols.\u201d But Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, <em>supra, </em>held the third type unconstitutional, under the Fourth Amendment, in a case involving the warrantless search of an automobile, without probable cause to believe that the vehicle contained aliens or \u201ceven\u201d had crossed the border. <em>Id. </em>413 U.S. at 268, 93 S.Ct. 2535 (plurality opinion per Stewart, J.). Since <em>Almeida-Sanchez, </em>the Attorney General has not modified his border-search regulations and the INS has still not formally or legally promulgated any of its own.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-18\">The plurality of the Court in <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>said that searches may take place at not only the border but \u201cat its functional equivalents\u201d \u2014 examples of which were (1) \u201cat an established station near the border,\u201d (2) \u201cat a point marking the confluence of two or more roads that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>extend from the border,\u201d and (3) \u201cclearly,\u201d \u201ca search of the passengers and cargo of an airplane arriving at a St. Louis airport after a nonstop flight from Mexico City . . ..\u201d 413 U.S. at 272-73, 93 S.Ct. at 2539. It held, however, that a \u201croving patrol\u201d search of a car \u201con a California road [State Highway 78] that lies at all points at least 20 miles north of the Mexican border,\u201d <em>id., </em>which road at no point reaches the Mexican border and at all points lies north of a major east-west interstate highway entirely within the United- States, <em>id. </em>at 267-68, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 2539, was <em>not </em>at the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of the border. Our case does not fit any of the three examples given by the Court to describe the functional equivalent of the border, and, while the search here was not as far removed from the border as the one in <em>Almeida-Sanchez, </em>that single fact is in no way conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The search<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> here involved an interrogation of the passengers in a bus which had traversed New York State Highway 37 from Massena which is about three miles from the border to the depot in Malone. While the bus made no stops, Highway 37 meanders along the river for 11 miles where an international toll bridge connects it to Canada (Cornwall, Ontario, to Rooseveltown, New York), thence along the border (which runs through the St. Lawrence River) 12 miles to Fort Covington, a border station, thence travels south-southeast 14 miles to Malone. Malone itself, which is at least 10 miles from the Canadian border, is a confluence not only of Highway 37 but of Highway 11 (an east-west highway running essentially parallel to the border) and Highway 30 which runs generally north-south across the middle of the state from Canada to Pennsylvania. The Government argues, therefore, that Malone is the functional equivalent of the border because it is a point \u201cmarking the confluence of two or more roads that extend from the border.\u201d Routes 11 and 37 connect, however, only at assorted points to roads close to the border.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> One searches the post-AImar-<em>da-Sanchez </em>decisions in vain for any precedent which would bind us or even materially help us.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As Judge Port said below, after <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>\u201cThe meaning of the functional equivalent of a Border search or the extended border still remains clouded.\u201d And as the Government brief concedes, or argues, \u201c[i]f no sensible test [of what is the functional equivalent of the border] can be applied then the determination of whether an interior point is the functional equivalent of the border depends on the length of the Judge\u2019s foot\u201d (Brief at 19). We hold that the search here was not at the <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>plurality\u2019s \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d since the existence of a sizeable city, Massena, and the nonstop travel of the bus therefrom, breaks the path from border to checkpoint. Although Malone does mark a confluence of Routes 30, 37 and 11, the fact that each of these roads either traverses the border or meets with other roads traversing the border before reaching Malone, makes it impossible for us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>regard this entire city as the functional equivalent of the border under <em>Almeida-Sanchez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">But in justice to the Government our inquiry cannot stop here for the Government rather elaborately argues that <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>really applies the rationale of Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), to border searches. After conceding that the type of search cannot be justified, as the plurality said, 413 U.S. at 269, 93 S.Ct. 2535, on the automobile \u201cexception\u201d to the warrant requirement, Chambers v. Moroney, 399 U.S. 42, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970); Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925), or as an administrative search under Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967), and See v. City of Seattle, 387 U.S. 541, 87 S.Ct. 1737, 18 L.Ed.2d 943 (1967),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the Government suggests (Brief at 9) that \u201c[t]he test for determining whether a particular point is the functional equivalent of the border is therefore whether the same conditions which justify a detention at the border exist at the interior point.\u201d That is, at least in connection with a search for aliens as opposed to contraband,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the test should be whether there is \u201ca continuing institutionalized reasonable\u201d suspicion that any person or vehicle passing through the point in question may be transporting an alien not entitled to enter, and the need to make the intrusion at that point to prevent illegal border crossings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But as we view this <em>Terry-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>type argument, it is essentially the same (although possibly more limited in scope) <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> as that made by the dissent in <em>Almeida-Sanehez, </em>413 U.S. at 285, 289, 93 S.Ct. 2535,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>viz., </em>that a warrantless search of an automobile for the purpose of apprehending illegal aliens is per se reasonable, at least within a reasonable distance from the border which the dissent evidently considers to be 100 miles. <em>Id. </em>at 287-89, 93 S.Ct. 2535 and n. 4.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Even if we wanted to do so, as an inferi- or court we cannot follow the dissents in the Court above.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">We are, nevertheless, in an extremely nebulous area of the law, as one court put it, an area \u201ccharacterized by extreme instability,\u201d United States v. Baca, 368 F.Supp. 398, 408' (S.D.Cal.1973), but one that has multiple and far-reaching' consequences. The combination of Mr. Justice Powell\u2019s concurrence in <em>Almeida-Sanehez </em>and the implications from as well as the express language<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>dissent would permit area warrants for vehicular searches by the INS under standards not delineated except that they would be \u201cless than probable cause in the traditional sense.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> These searches could take place within 100 air miles of the borders and seacoasts of the continental United States and the perimeters of Alaska and Hawaii. But one can suggest that in drafting the Fourth Amendment it was precisely such indiscriminate searches with which the Forefathers were primarily concerned, remembering that it was <em>general warrants </em>and <em>writs of assistance </em>which infuriated the Otises and Adams\u2019. Amsterdam, Perspectives on the Fourth Amendment, 58 Minn.L.Rev. 349, 366 (1974) (hereinafter Amsterdam); T. Taylor, Two Studies in Constitutional Interpretation 41 (1969). <em>See also </em>United States v. Edwards, 415 U.S. 800, 804 \u2014 05 n. 6, 94 S.Ct. 1234, 39 L.Ed.2d 771 (1974); United States v. Edwards, 498 F.2d 496, 498 n. 6 (majority opinion) and 503 (concurring opinion) (2d Cir. 1974). If general search warrants based on less than probable cause are to become the basis for official searches in such a wide area, it would not be too bold to suggest that we have come a little way from Entick v. Car-rington, 19 Howell St. Tr. 1029, 1063 (1765) (overturning a \u201cridiculous warrant against the whole English nation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-19\">What is at issue here is the balance to be struck between the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection from unreasonable searches and seizures and the Government\u2019s conceded right to protect the integrity of its borders. The problem of illegal immigration is one of national concern. The adverse economic impact caused by illegal aliens is substantial and well documented.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> But to respond to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>this problem by watering down the probable cause requirements of the Fourth Amendment is most surely to take the lowest constitutional road. It would be dangerous precedent indeed for an economic problem, regardless of its magnitude, to provide the basis for the erosion of constitutional principles; much the more so when alternative solutions to the economic problem have been insufficiently explored by the other Branches of Government.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Perhaps, therefore, it would be well to mention to the Government that a constitutional alternative presents itself \u2014 an alternative perhaps best set forth in Professor Amsterdam\u2019s extraordinary reflections, alluded to previously in this opinion. He proposes that we judges take a \u201cregulatory view\u201d of the Fourth Amendment, Amsterdam at 369, drawing a leaf from Professor Kenneth Culp Davis\u2019s notebook,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and that we shy away from the traditional all or nothing approach to that Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 388. He would not adopt what he calls the \u201c <em>Terry-Sehmerber </em>[Schmerber v. Cal., 384 U.S. 757, 86 S.Ct. 1826, 16 L.Ed.2d 908] sliding scald approach\u201d which may find its echo in the suggested area warrants which are to be issued on \u201cless than probable cause,\u201d or in the Government\u2019s brief here;<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> a law enforcement officer he suggests, or a magistrate issuing a warrant we suggest, cannot all be Fourth Amendment scholars, and the law now is a \u201cparagon of simplicity\u201d compared to what it would be under a \u201cgraduated\u201d Fourth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 392, 393 \u2014 95. The positive alternative Professor Amsterdam suggests is that the discretion of police, here we translate to INS officers, be tolerably confined either by legislation or departmental (here Attorney General or INS) rules and regulations subject to judicial review for reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 410 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">Repeating, \u201cthe objectionable feature of general warrants and writs is their indiscriminate character,\u201d in part because they are conducted at the discretion of executive officials who may act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>despotically or capriciously, i. <em>e., </em>arbitrarily. <em>Id. </em>at 411.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Therefore, unless the search is conducted within either reasonable legislative or departmental rules, Professor Amsterdam argues, it should be invalid. <em>Id. </em>at 416.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Rule-making, which could so readily be done here and indeed was so clearly in congressional contemplation in enacting \u00a7 1357 (and indeed which may be informally in effect, note 8 <em>supra), </em>would, Professor Amsterdam continues (and we concur), (1) enhance the quality of INS decisions (a) by focusing attention on the fact that <em>policy </em>is being made, (b) by putting the authority in responsible and capable hands,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and (c) by promoting efficiency; (2) would tend to insure fair and equal treatment of citizens (a) by reducing the influence of bias, (b) by providing uniform standards, and (c) by guiding police behavior; (3) would increase the visibility of the decisions;<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and (4) offers the best hope for consistent obedience to and enforcement of the constitutional norms that guarantee the citizen\u2019s liberty. <em>Id. </em>at 423 \u2014 29. As Chief Judge Bazelon has urged, in another connection, to be sure,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">judicial review alone can correct only the most egregious abuses. When administrators provide a framework for principled decision-making, the result will be to diminish the importance of judicial review by enhancing the integrity of the administrative process, and to improve the quality of judicial review in those cases where judicial review is sought. Environmental Defense Fund v. Ruckelshaus, 142 U.S.App.D.C. 74, 439 F.2d 584, 598 (1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">The alternative of administrative rule-making is open to the new Attorney General and to the INS. Is it not the beginning of a way out of the \u201cextremely unstable\u201d area of the law in which we find ourselves? Only the Supreme Court can answer these questions and perhaps it will answer them in border search cases or show some other way out of the labyrinth of <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>in several cases it now has before it.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Until then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>we can merely suggest a step toward solution of the important, basic issue this case presents. For reasons previously stated, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-6\">.

The Government here does not rely on the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Powell, <em>id., </em>at 275 et seq., 93 S.Ct. 2535, which would permit roving patrol searches of automobiles if a general area warrant was secured. In that opinion Mr. Justice Powell rested his position on the grounds that only a small percentage of apprehended aliens are prosecuted; that the searches would be acceptable only if conducted where there is a high concentration of illegal aliens (Judge Port noted below that \u201cProbably a random search of any bus in New York City would be as profitable on the average in uncovering illegal entrants to the United States as this bus was\u201d); and that these searches are \u201cincidental to the protection of the border.\u201d His approval of such searches emphasized that they are searches of automobiles, not persons or buildings (our case started as a search of the bus, but it ended as. a search and seizure of the person). <em>See </em>413 U.S. at 278-79, 93 S.Ct. 2535. This concurrence has received considerable comment, not all favorable. <em>See </em>Note, Area Search Warrants in Border Zones; Almeida-Sanchez and Camara, 84 Yale L.J. 355, 371 (1974) (hereinafter Yale Note). The problem is that there seems no rational limit to what searches can be ultimately justified on the basis of Camara v.

Perhaps, however, all courts have difficulties stemming from what Professor Amsterdam has aptly termed the \u201catomistic view\u201d of the Fourth Amendment, <em>i. e., </em>the view of that important amendment as \u201ca collection of protections of atomistic spheres of interest of individual citizens\u201d rather than as a \u201cregulatory canon requiring government to order its law enforcement procedures in a fashion that would keep us collectively secure in our persons, houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d Amsterdam, Perspectives on the Fourth Amendment, 58 Minn.L.Rev. 349, 367 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b357-11\">. The distinction is drawn in Roa-Rodriquez v. United States, 410 F.2d 1206 (10th Cir. 1969). Whether the distinction is always a useful one is open to question, since a search for aliens can of course turn into a search for contraband if the investigating officer is alerted to suspicious circumstances. Since border patrol officers serve in a dual capacity both as customs and immigration inspectors, their roles cannot be easily compartmentalized. Yale Note at 366 n. 52.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b357-12\">. The Government, of course, argues that the INS has a reasonable suspicion that <em>anyone </em>present in Malone, N.Y., \u201cmay have made an illegal entry,\u201d that the suspicion is related to the function of detecting (or preventing) illegal entries (as opposed, say, to a search in New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>York City where it would detect only illegal residence), and that the intrusion is necessary because the alien has not had to pass \u201cthrough some more significant point closer to the border\u201d (Gov\u2019t Brief at 23). While we do not need to answer the Government contention on its own grounds, we do point out that appellee did have to pass through such a \u201cmore significant\u201d point, <em>i. e., </em>Massena.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b358-5\">. Initially, the Government\u2019s brief argues only that this \u201cTerry-type\u201d approach be applied to make acceptable the questioning of a person as to nationality; however, the argument is then carried substantially further to allow more generalized searches (although the Government does concede that in any event a search for aliens would not allow the Government to search a suitcase).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b358-6\">. The dissent, in addition to <em>Terry, </em>referred to United States v. Biswell, <em>supra; </em>Colonnade Catering Corp. v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969); and <em>Camara, supra. </em>413 U.S. at 289-90, 93 S.Ct. 2535. The dissent also relies on \u201c[t]he judgment of Congress,\u201d saying that to disagree with that judgment is \u201cto invalidate 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357 in the face of the contrary opinion of Congress that its legislation comported with the standard of reasonableness of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293, 93 S.Ct. at 2549. But with every respect to the author of the dissenting opinion, Congress did not say that all searches within 100 miles of the border were reasonable; it authorized the Attorney General to regulate searches by INS officers \u201cwithin a reasonable distance from any external boundary.\u201d Section 1357(a)(3). The 100-mile figure was the Attorney General\u2019s, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.1(a)(2). Enforcement of this regulation as such would, it . can be argued, establish a 100-mile zone around the borders of the continental United States (including coastlines) or the perimeters of Alaska and Hawaii where the Fourth Amendment in its traditional sense would be nonexistent. <em>But see </em>413 U.S. at 299 n. 11, 93 S.Ct. 2535. Congress may not have had this kind of \u201cregulation\u201d in mind.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b358-8\">. It may be noted that the dissent did not limit this view by suggesting, as it might have, that only evidence pertaining to the illegal entry of an alien uncovered in such a search would be admissible. This at least would narrow the possibilities of abuse. See United States v. Skipwith, 482 F.2d 1272, 1279 (5th Cir. 1973) (Simpson, J., concurring) and 1281 (Aldrich, J., dissenting) (airport search). Professor Amsterdam makes a cogent argument for limiting <em>Terry </em>or stop-and-frisk searches by such an expansion of the exclusionary rule, 58 Minn.L.Rev. at 437-38. In this regard an even stronger argument for limiting the admissibility of the fruits of such searches might be made with respect to \u201croving\u201d border searches were one to adopt the <em>Almeida-Sanehez </em>dissent\u2019s view, since the indiscriminate nature of such searches is highly visible. As stated in Yale Note, <em>supra, </em>84 Yale L.J. at 367 n. 53:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiG\">Some indication is provided by the Brief for Appellee at 25-26, Almeida-Sanches v. United States, 413 U.S. 266 [93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596] (1973). Nearly two million autos were stopped in 1972, and nearly 400,-000 searched thoroughly, to net 39,000 aliens. Thus, approximately 50 cars were stopped, and 10 searched thoroughly, for each alien found. Moreover, many aliens enter in groups, assisted by professional alien smugglers. <em>Id. </em>at 23. Because many of the aliens enter collectively one can only conclude that some multiple of 50 cars are stopped, and many times 10 are searched, for each alien-bearing <em>vehicle </em>found.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">We recognize, of course, that the dual aspect of a border patrol agent\u2019s responsibilities would complicate this view, but conceptually there may be merit in an approach to the Fourth Amendment which focuses upon the purpose of a search and applies the exclusionary rule as to evidence not related to that purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b358-13\">. \u201cI agree with Mr. Justice Powell that such a warrant so issued [i. <em>e., </em>on \u201cless than probable cause in the traditional sense\u201d] would satisfy the Fourth Amendment, and I would expect such warrants would be readily issued.\u201d White, J., dissenting, 413 U.S. at 288, 93 S.Ct. at 2547.

Their use and possible abuse are discussed in Leahy, Border Patrol Checkpoint Operation Under Warrants of Inspection: The Wake of Almei-da-Sanchez v. United States, 5 Calif.West.Int. L.J. 62 (1974). One such warrant issued June 22, 1974, gave the border patrol the right to reopen its checkpoint at San Clemente, California, a checkpoint which had been closed as a result of United States v. Bowen, <em>supra. </em>A border patrol officer reported the following results:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">1.

But the new warrants limit the power of the border patrol to stop vehicles for routine inquiry concerning nationality. Any search of an automobile must be justified by independent evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 69.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-20\">Even accepting the validity of such limited warrants issued in connection with inspections at fixed checkpoints, it should be noted that they represent a substantial narrowing of the positions expressed by the concurrence and the dissent in <em>Almeida-Sanchez.</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b359-21\">. In fairness, the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Powell did suggest that before issuing such warrants judges could in some way consider proximity to the border, geography, likely number of aliens found and relative intrusiveness on innocent persons, with time limitations for roving searches on particular roads. 413 U.S. at 283-84, 93 S.Ct. 2535. <em>See also </em>The Supreme Court, 1972 Term, 87 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 201 n. 34 (1973).

A paramount purpose of the fourth amendment is to prohibit arbitrary searches and seizures as well as unjustified searches and seizures. The warrant requirement was the framers\u2019 chosen instrument to achieve both purposes, and it should continue to be applied to those ends, as the Supreme Court\u2019s present fourth amendment doctrines apply it, so far as it can practicably go. However, the warrant requirement obviously fails to assure against arbitrariness in kinds of searches and seizures that are permitted without warrants, or where police discretion controls the decision to apply for a warrant. The emergence of modern professional police forces and our knowledge of the vast discretion that they exercise demonstrate both the need and the capability to provide an effective safeguard against arbitrariness in these kinds of searches and seizures; and the manifestly serviceable instrument to do it is what Kenneth Culp Davis calls \u201cone of the greatest inventions of modern government,\u201d unavailable to the framers but perfectly commonplace today: administrative rulemaking. Arbitrary searches and seizures are \u201cunreasonable\u201d searches and seizures; ruleless searches and seizures practiced at the varying and unguided discretion of thousands of individual peace officers are arbitrary searches and seizures; therefore, ruleless searches and seizures are \u201cunreasonable\u201d searches and seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">For me, an additional and forceful legal argument in favor of the rulemaking requirement is the way in which it cuts through so many of the problems of fourth amendment doctrine-building.
