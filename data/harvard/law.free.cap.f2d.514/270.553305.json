He was named in six of the eight counts of indictment: Count 1 \u2014 conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (1970); Counts 2 and 3 \u2014 burglary in violation of 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 1801(b) (1973); and Counts 4, 5, and 8 \u2014 illegal interception of oral and wire communications in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 (1970). The trial commenced on January 8, 1973. Several days later Hunt, along with four of his co-defendants,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pleaded guilty to all counts in the indictment under which they were charged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hunt was provisionally sentenced to the maximum term under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208 (1970), and eight months later, along with the four co-defendants who had pleaded guilty with him, Hunt filed a motion to withdraw his plea of guilty and to dismiss the indictment. The denial of this motion provides the basis for this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-17\">The issues raised by appellant have been considered at length in our opinions in the cases involving his co-defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>United States v. Barker, - U.S.App.D.C. -, 514 F.2d 208 (decided today) <em>(en bane); </em>United States v. McCord, 166 U.S.App.D.C. -, 509 F.2d 334 (1974) <em>(en banc); </em>United States v. Liddy, 166 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>App.D.C. 95, 509 F.2d 428 (1974) (en <em>banc). </em>For the reasons stated in those opinions, the issues raised here must also be decided against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Under the circumstances, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed except as to Counts 3, 4, and 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-11\">. The remaining two co-defendants were convicted after a jury trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b329-12\">. Appellant also claims that his guilty plea to Counts 3, 4, and 5 was improperly coerced by the District Judge\u2019s refusal to accept his compromise plea, agreeable to the Government, to Counts 1, 2, and 8. For this contention appellant relies on United States v. Ammidown, 162 U.S.App.D.C. 28, 497 F.2d 615 (1973). As the judge imposed concurrent sentences on all counts, we need not reach this contention. Instead, we hereby vacate appellant\u2019s sentences on Counts 3, 4, and 5. <em>See </em>United States v. \u2022 Greene, 160 U.S.App.D.C. 21, 33-34, 489 F.2d 1145, 1157-1158 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b329-22\">. Hunt\u2019s suggestion that \u201coutrageous conduct\u201d by \u201cGovernment officials\u201d in seizing and destroying his records and \u201cperjuring themselves before the grand jury\u201d requires reversal of his conviction hardly needs to be taken seriously. Since the argument on this appeal Hunt has testified under oath in the trial of United States v. Mitchell et al., D.D.C. Criminal No. 74-110, that he not only participated in the burglary of the DNC offices, but also that he participated in a conspiracy to suppress evidence of that burglary involving perjury and destruction of records.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b330-6\">MacKINNON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AY9\">(concurring specially):</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The foregoing opinion refers to opinions previously issued by this court in <em>Barker, supra, </em>and <em>McCord, supra. </em>I filed a dissent in <em>Barker </em>and a special concurrence in <em>McCord. </em>I concur in the result of the foregoing opinion, subject to such differing views as I expressed in my opinions in <em>Barker </em>and <em>McCord.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b330-8\">WILKEY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AE0\">(concurring specially):</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">The foregoing opinion refers to opinions previously issued by this court in United States v.
