Cannella, <em>Judge, reversing </em>the decision of Bankruptcy Judge Edward J. Ryan, that under the subordination agreement here in question, the senior creditors are not entitled to be paid interest accruing after the date of bankruptcy through the date of payment of principal. Interest stops running against the bankrupt on the date of bankruptcy, \u00a7 63(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a)(1), because any delay thereafter is by law for the preservation of the estate. Van-ston Bondholders Protective Committee v. Green, 329 U.S. 156, 163, 67 S.Ct. 237, 91 L.Ed. 162 (1946). See 3A Collier, Bankruptcy If 63.16.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>City of New York v. Saper, 336 U.S. 328, 330-32, 69 S.Ct. 554, 93 L.Ed. 710 (1949); Sexton v. Dreyfus, 219 U.S. 339, 344-45, 31 S.Ct. 256, 55 L.Ed. 244 (1911).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-16\">Post-petition interest, Judge Cannella rightly held, is, for similar reasons, not recoverable by senior creditors out of dividends due from the estate to junior creditors, at least absent a structure of priorities among creditors by express provision in the subordination contract. In re Kingsboro Mortgage Corporation, 379 F.Supp. 227 (S.D.N.Y.1974).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here the contract does not explicitly refer to post-bankruptcy interest. Judge Cannel-la\u2019s decision requiring unambiguous language in the subordination agreement conforms to the Third Circuit\u2019s in In re Time Sales Finance Corp., 491 F.2d 841 (3d Cir. 1974), and was followed by District Judge Winner in In re King Resources Co., 385 F.Supp. 1269 (D.Colo. 1974). Nor is our In re Credit Industrial Corp., 366 F.2d 402, 408 (2d Cir. 1966), inconsistent. That case did not involve post-petition interest, even while recognizing that subordination agreements are not unenforceable as such in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-17\">We agree, then, that the language in Section 12(b) of the Subordination Agreement, \u201cIn the event of any insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceedings . then all principal and interest on all Senior Debt shall first be paid in full . before any payment on account of principal or interest is made upon the Notes [junior indebtedness],\u201d is insufficiently express to relate to post-bankruptcy interest. This conclusion is reinforced by the language of the final paragraph of Section 12 that \u201cThe provisions of this section 12 are for the purpose of defin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>ing the relative rights of the holders of Senior Debt on the one hand, and the holders of the Notes on the other hand, <em>against the Company </em>[the bankrupt] and its property . . . \u201d (emphasis added); the section in other words relates to priorities among creditors against the bankrupt estate, not <em>inter sese. </em>Appellants argue this final paragraph refers to reorganization under Chapter X and not to bankruptcy or an arrangement under Chapter XI. Not only do we find no such limitation; reference back to Section 12(b) above quoted indicates application specifically to \u201cbankruptcy\u201d as well as \u201creorganization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-14\">. The exceptions to this rule, when the estate later proves solvent or when secured creditors\u2019 collateral produces income during bankruptcy, Sword Line, Inc. v. Industrial Commissioner, 212 F.2d 865, 869 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 830, 75 S.Ct. 53, 99 L.Ed. 654 (1954), are inapplicable here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b459-18\">. We need not pass upon the validity between creditors of an agreement subordinating junior indebtedness to post-bankruptcy interest on the senior debt. Our own In re Credit Industrial Corp., 366 F.2d 402, 408 (2d Cir. 1966), contains language broad enough to permit any such a provision despite Bankruptcy Act policies vis a vis the bankrupt estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
