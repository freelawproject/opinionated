PECK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b822-17\">The district court on April 19, 1974, found \u201cthose members of Local Union No. 1784 who have refused to enter Oak Park Mine No. 7 since 4:00 p. m. April 16, 1974\u201d in contempt for violating the court\u2019s injunction of January 31, 1974, against</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-18\">\u201ccommitting, doing, uttering, writing or communicating any act, word or deed written, spoken or performed, which is intended, designed or calculated to induce, persuade, order, cause or bring about the failure or refusal of any member of defendant Local 1784 to report for work or to work or to cause or bring about a strike at plaintiff\u2019s mine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-19\">Approximately 235 miners were found to be in contempt for missing work shifts between 4 p. m. April 16, 1974, and entry of the contempt order at 3:57 p. m. April 19, 1974, and each was fined five dollars ($5.00) per missed shift. Sixty miners were fined twenty-five dollars ($25.00) each for missing the shift beginning at 4 p. m. April 19, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-20\">On appeal, the miners claim that the district court found them in contempt without according them due process of law and that insufficient evidence underlay the findings of contempt. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-21\">Plaintiff-appellee\u2019s motion to hold hearing in contempt of permanent injunction and the district court\u2019s order to show cause were served only on five officers of Local 1784. Because \u201cwhat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>process is due,\u201d Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972), varies from context to context, the precise nature of the findings of contempt should be determined. Despite appellee\u2019s claim that Local 1784, rather than its members, was found in contempt, the record clearly indicates that the district court found the members in contempt. The contempt order found \u201cthose members [missing shifts] in contempt,\u201d fined \u201csuch member[s],\u201d and directed union officials to collect the fines \u201cfrom each and every member.\u201d We agree, however, with ap-pellee\u2019s characterization of the contempt as \u201ccivil,\u201d rather than \u201ccriminal,\u201d because the \u201ccharacter and purpose\u201d (Shil-litani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364, 369, 86 S.Ct. 1531, 16 L.Ed.2d 622 (1966)) of the fines was to coerce the miners\u2019 return to work rather than to punish the miners for past misconduct. In North American Coal Corp. v. United Mine Workers of America, 512 F.2d 238 (6th Cir. 1975) (contempt characterized as criminal), miners who had already returned to work were \u201cpunished\u201d for participating in no longer active work stoppages. Conversely, the miners found in contempt in the instant appeal had been involved in a work stoppage right up to the finding of contempt; in fact, the work stoppage continued for at least one shift beyond the finding of contempt. That the miners were found in contempt for missing several shifts prior to the finding of contempt does not convert civil into criminal contempt as long as the \u201ccharacter and purpose\u201d of such finding \u201cis to coerce compliance with a court order, usually for the benefit of an injured suitor.\u201d Kutner, Contempt Power: The Black Robe \u2014 A Proposal For Due Process, 39 Tenn.L.Rev. 1, 8 (1971). <em>See </em>Parker v. United States, 153 F.2d 66, 70 (1st Cir. 1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Had the contempt been criminal, such finding obviously would have been invalid in the absence of notice and an opportunity to be heard. <em>North American Coal, supra; </em>Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen &amp; Enginemen v. United States, 411 F.2d 312 (5th Cir. 1969). Unfortunately, what procedures due process requires for a finding of civil, rather than criminal, contempt may be less clear. <em>See </em>Gompers v. Buck\u2019s Stove &amp; Range Co., 221 U.S. 418, 444, 31 S.Ct. 492, 55 L.Ed. 797 (1911); Philippe v. Window Glass Cutters League, 99 F.Supp. 369, 374 (W.D.Ark.1951).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-8\">\u201cLike any civil litigant, a civil contemnor is . clearly entitled to those due process rights, applicable to every judicial proceeding, of proper notice and an impartial hearing with an opportunity to present a defense .. Certainly the history of contempt litigation, especially in regard to labor disputes, prescribes extreme care and insistence on the full indicia of due process in contempt cases . ..\u201d Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen &amp; Enginemen v. Bangor &amp; Aroostook R. R., 127 U.S.App.D.C. 23, 380 F.2d 570, 581-582 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 327, 88 S.Ct. 437, 19 L.Ed.2d 560 (1967).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-11\"><em>Accord, Shillitani, supra, </em>384 U.S. at 371 n. 7, 86 S.Ct. 1531, 16 L.Ed.2d 622; United States v. Boe, 491 F.2d 970 (8th Cir. 1974); Gialde v. Time, Inc., 480 F.2d 1295, 1300 (8th Cir. 1973); Parker v. United States, 153 F.2d 66, 70 (1st Cir. 1946); <em>Philippe, supra, </em>99 F.Supp. at 374; Dobbs, Contempt of Court: A Survey, 56 Cornell L.Rev. 183, 243 (1971). <em>See </em>United States v. Hawkins, 501 F.2d 1029, 1031 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1079, 95 S.Ct. 668, 42 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974). Between the filing at 2:40 p. m. April 17, 1974, of appellee\u2019s motion for a contempt hearing and the hearing itself at 9 a. m. April 19, 1974, appellee neither initiated nor requested service of the motion and show cause order on the miners, and consequently none was made. The miners, in sum, did not receive any notice, much less \u201cnotice reasonably calculated, under the circumstances, to apprise [them] of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u201d Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950). <em>See </em>Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacque-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>lin, 417 U.S. 156, 94 S.Ct. 2140, 2150-2152, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974); Schroeder v. City of New York, 371 U.S. 208, 83 S.Ct. 279, 9 L.Ed.2d 255 (1962). We do not imply, however, that, with a costly and illegal work stoppage in process, the strikers must be personally served; the \u201cunhurried deliberateness\u201d of personal service may well further delay compliance with a no-strike injunction. <em>Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen &amp; Enginemen, supra, </em>411 F.2d at 319. We only hold that the lack of service in any form on the miners violated due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Five union officials, however, were served with the motion to hold hearing and the show cause order. They were served, however, in their capacities as union officials. Had they been found in contempt in such capacities, assuming sufficient evidence supporting those findings, those findings would be sustained. The district court, however, found the officials in contempt for personally missing work shifts rather than for their activities as union officials. Consequently, those findings of contempt must be reversed because the process served on them warned only of contempt for their union, rather than their purely employee, activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">We further conclude that insufficient evidence underlay the findings of contempt. Appellee had the burden of proving a violation of the injunction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-6\">\u201c . . - by more than a mere preponderance of the evidence. Some courts have indicated the petitioner must produce \u2018clear and convincing evidence.\u2019 Other courts have indicated that the violation must be shown by \u2018a clear preponderance of the evidence.\u2019 Some of these courts and still others have indicated that \u2018a degree of certainty is required which leaves no fair ground of doubt\u2019 as to the violation of the court\u2019s order. Whatever the precise language . . . the petitioner in a civil contempt proceeding must overcome a heavy burden of proof.\u201d Schauffler v. Local 1291, International Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, 292 F.2d 182, 189-190 (3rd Cir. 1961), rev\u2019g 189 F.Supp. 737 (E.D.Pa.1960).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-11\"><em>Accord, </em>Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co. v. NLRB, 137 F.2d 77, 79 (8th Cir. 1943). <em>See, e. g., </em>NLRB v. Alamo Express, Inc., 395 F.2d 481, 482 (5th Cir. 1968) (\u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d); Hart Schaff-ner &amp; Marx v. Alexander\u2019s Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc., 341 F.2d 101, 102 (2d Cir. 1965) (\u201cclear and convincing proof\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-12\">On appeal, appellee admits that it had the burden of establishing the contempt \u201cby clear and convincing evidence.\u201d Appellee produced no witnesses at the contempt hearing, though it obtained a concession from the union\u2019s attorney that a work stoppage was in process. The district judge thereupon placed the burden of rebutting an inference of contempt on the purported contemnors. Had the injunction prohibited work stoppages, placing such burden probably would have been proper. Yet the injunction prohibited only the \u201cinducing], persuad[ing], ordering] or bringing] about\u201d work stoppages, rather than the participating in work stoppages in itself. In sum, there was \u201cnot a line of testimony that any one of those found guilty\u201d ever induced, persuaded, ordered or brought about the work stoppage. Compare North American Coal Corp. v. Local 2262, United Mine Workers, 497 F.2d 459 (6th Cir. 1974), and <em>Schauffler, supra, </em>292 F.2d at 189, with <em>Philippe, supra, </em>99 F.Supp. at 375. The only witness at the contempt hearing, the president of Local 1784, in fact, testified uncontradictedly that he had ordered the miners back to work.
