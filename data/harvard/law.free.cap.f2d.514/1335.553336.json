Priority began the conduct of this business in 1967, when the Federal Aviation Agency granted it, simultaneously, an Air Taxi/Commercial Operator\u2019s (ATCO) Certificate under section 604 of the Federal Aviation Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and an exemption that permitted it to vary from certain FAA regulations related to the transportation of hazardous materials.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Substantially all of Priority\u2019s business apparently was carried on by grace of the exemp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>tion, although it theoretically could have engaged in other activities permitted the holders of ATCO certificates, on the sole authority of the certificate. Accordingly, it was a serious blow to Priority\u2019s status when, on August 3, 1973, the FAA terminated Priority\u2019s exemption, effective immediately. Priority had been notified that this action was contemplated, and had been offered the opportunity to present its views, together with any data that it wished to submit, in writing. It was not, however, afforded any type of adversary hearing before the FAA\u2019s action; in particular, the FAA did not hold a proceeding of the description set out in sections 7 and 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The FAA\u2019s order revoking the exemption alleged that Priority had been guilty of \u201cviolations of the terms and conditions of the exemption, violations of the Federal Aviation Regulations, and other incidents of questionable operating practice\u201d. On the same day, August 3, 1973, the FAA entered an order revoking Priority\u2019s. ATCO certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-4\">Priority, believing that it was entitled to notice and hearing before its twin grants of authority to operate its business were revoked pursuant to these charges of misconduct, proceeded to contest the FAA\u2019s actions on two fronts. First, on August 4, 1973, it filed a complaint in United States District Court, setting forth the events above described and' demanding a temporary restraining order to prevent the FAA from enforcing its revocation order, pending a hearing on its motion for a preliminary injunction. The district court granted the temporary restraining order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Second, Priority appealed the FAA\u2019s actions to the National Transportation Safety Board, the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-5\">The NTSB has authority, pursuant to the Department of Transportation Act of 1966, to review \u201cthe suspension, modification, revocation, or denial of any <em>certificate or license </em>issued by the Secretary [of Transportation] or an Administrator [of the Federal Highway Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, or FAA]\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Italics added.) With the action in district court we are not concerned, except to note that the district court merged the temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction on August 14, 1973, pending final hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-12\">In Priority\u2019s appeal before the National Transportation Safety Board, the Administrator of the FAA filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that the NTSB had no jurisdiction over Priority\u2019s appeal from the revocation of its exemption and ATCO certification. In this connection, the Administrator argued that the FAA\u2019s action had been of a \u201cspecial rule-making\u201d nature, and hence no appeal to the NTSB was authorized under the applicable statutes. An Administrative Law Judge of the NTSB denied the motion to dismiss. The five-man Board, however, reversed his decision with respect to the appeal from the revocation of the <em>exemption, </em>holding that it was not a \u201ccertificate or license\u201d, as described by the Department of Transportation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-13\">Priority has applied to this court for relief from the NTSB\u2019s decision, pursuant to statutes granting this court jurisdiction to consider petitions for review of the actions of the NTSB.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our sole concern here is the correctness of the decision of the NTSB that it lacked jurisdiction over Priority\u2019s appeal from the FAA\u2019s revocation of its exemption. The cancellation of the ATCO certificate is not at issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-14\">After a survey of the history of the 1966 Act and its predecessors, as well as the practices of the NTSB in the past, it is our view that the Board\u2019s statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>authority extends to the FAA\u2019s revocation of an airline\u2019s exemption from regulations, if the exemption in question is an essential component of the operating authority of the airline. The legislative history of the language found in the 1966 Act pertaining to \u201ccertificate or license\u201d is murky. Prior to the creation of the National Transportation Safety Board, the Act assigned the review function to the Civil Aeronautics Board.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statute vesting review powers in the CAB provided that the Board could review actions relating to \u201cany type certificate, production certificate, airworthiness certificate, airman certificate, air carrier operating certificate, air navigation facility certificate, or air agency certificate.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Department of Transportation Act of 1966 created the NTSB and transferred to the new agency the review responsibilities formerly exercised by the CAB. It is noted that the 1966 Act used more general language (\u201ccertificate or license\u201d) in describing the subjects of the Board\u2019s review authority<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> than was employed in the Act setting out the review powers of the CAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-4\">The NTSB has taken the position that it was the Congressional intent that the 1966 Act transfer to the NTSB only such aviation-related functions as were formerly exercised by the CAB, neither enlarging nor expanding them. In explaining the inclusion of the term \u201clicenses\u201d in the 1966 Act, the NTSB argues that in addition to the functions previously assigned to the CAB, the NTSB took on the former duties of the Coast Guard in \u201clicensing\u201d vessels and their crews. We accept this explanation. It appears, however, that even before 1966, the FAA and the CAB treated certain privileges not formally denominated as \u201ccertificates\u201d in the same manner that they treated actual certificates. Thus, the regulations formulated by the FAA Administrator pursuant to Title VI of the Federal Aviation Act (which only authorizes the FAA to issue various types of \u201ccertificates\u201d) make provision for the issuance of such documents as \u201cinstrument ratings\u201d,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201ctype ratings\u201d,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201caircraft category ratings\u201d,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cairplane class ratings\u201d,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201crotorcraft class ratings\u201d,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cair traffic control facility ratings\u201d,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cmechanic ratings\u201d,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and \u201cinspection authorizations\u201d.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, prior to 1966, the CAB routinely took jurisdiction over appeals from the revocation or suspension of such privileges.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1395-14\">In Administrator v. Rawdon,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> decided by the CAB in 1960, it was held that a mechanic\u2019s \u201cinspection authorization\u201d was the equivalent of a \u201ccertificate\u201d under the statute conferring review authority on the CAB. Overruling its own hearing examiner, the full Board explained that an \u201cinspection authorization\u201d is \u201crelated to a mechanic\u2019s certificate\u201d; that the CAB, therefore, had review jurisdiction over its revocation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In so ruling, the CAB implicitly rejected the hearing examiner\u2019s reasoning that the \u201cinspection authorization\u201d cannot be a \u201ccertificate\u201d, because it is evidenced by a document separate from the holder\u2019s airman certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-15\">Decisions of the National Transportation Safety Board since the 1966 Act accept without question the NTSB\u2019s jurisdiction over revocations of \u201cratings\u201d and \u201cauthorizations\u201d originally issued by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>FAA Administrator.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Although none of the decisions articulate a reason for the Board\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction, logic suggests the same reason that recommended itself to the CAB in its 1960 decision: \u201cratings\u201d and \u201cauthorizations\u201d are inextricably entwined with the \u201ccertificates\u201d of their holders and together with these certificates afford a variety of privileges that would be altered by revocation of the rating or authorization. It is manifest that a certificate would not be worthless without an associated \u201crating\u201d or \u201cauthorization\u201d. Neither would Priority\u2019s ATCO certificate be valueless in the absence of its \u201crelated\u201d exemption from certain regulations. But the FAA Administrator\u2019s revocation of the exemption had the effect of altering Priority\u2019s operating authority, and both history and reason dictate that the NTSB has statutory jurisdiction to review his decision. In so doing, the NTSB will of course be guided by the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, as well as by its own statutory procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-4\">Reversed and remanded, with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1393-17\">. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1424 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1393-29\">.

More than once we have refused to disturb the agency\u2019s rulings concerning the discretionary denial of an <em>exemption. </em>Viewed <em>solely </em>from that standpoint the action of the National Transportation Safety Board in refusing jurisdiction would have to be sustained. We surely do not mean to open the door to review agency action involving the thousands of exemptions annually granted or denied. As our court has ruled and as the Ninth Circuit has recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1396-10\">We believe it is clearly established that in an exemption proceeding, as compared to a certificate proceeding, a hearing is not always required. (Citations omitted.) Island Airlines, Incorporated v. C.A.B., 363 F.2d 120, 124 (CA9, 1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1396-11\">But, just as circumstances so often alter cases' the exercise of review authority by the Board should follow where there has been aggrievement stemming from the termination of an exemption which is an integral part of a carrier\u2019s operating authority. That is what happened here, a# I will demonstrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-12\">Priority Air Dispatch, Inc., herein Priority, has brought to us its petition for review of an order of the National Transportation Safety Board, herein the Board, which had concluded that the Board lacks jurisdiction \u201cto review \u2014 i. e. \u2014to hold a hearing and adjudicate \u2014 an appeal from the termination of [Priority\u2019s] exemption.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>Board ordered that Priority\u2019s administrative appeal from that termination be dismissed, thus reversing the decision of an administrative law judge who had ruled otherwise under circumstances hereinafter developed. In light of the unique record here presented, I would reverse and remand with directions hereinafter stated, even as I concur in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-4\">Priority in 1967 became and continuously thereafter was the holder of an air taxi/commercial operator <em>certificate </em>(ATCO) and of an <em>exemption </em>which allowed Priority to transport hazardous materials for the Department of Defense. As of August 3, 1973 the operator certificate was revoked and the exemption was terminated. Unless reversed administratively or stayed by court order, those two official actions would effectively put Priority out of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-5\">Priority thereupon initiated administrative review proceedings having sought in vain a specification of charges and a hearing thereon. Priority also proceeded in the District Court where, after a hearing, District Judge Parker granted a preliminary injunction<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> restraining the Government defendants, <em>pendente lite, </em>from attempting to enforce the \u201cTermination of Exemption\u201d and \u201cEmergency Order of Revocation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-7\">The Board assigned Docket No. 2290 to the Termination phase and Docket No. 2291 to the sought-for review of the Revocation of Priority\u2019s operator certificate. Resisting the effort of the Administrative Law Judge to proceed first with No. 2291, counsel for the Administrator pressed a motion to dismiss in No. 2290. He contended that Section 609 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1429, made no mention of authority for Board review of the termination of an exemption although the statute clearly conferred authorization for review of the Administrator\u2019s revocation of the operator certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-12\">The General Counsel, granting that the challenged actions of the FAA had been taken \u201csimultaneously\u201d, nevertheless argued that the FAA Termination constituted merely an exercise of unre-viewable \u201crule-making.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-13\">Unimpressed, the Administrative Law Judge correctly observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1397-14\">From what has been said in argument, it appears that the loss of the exemption would just as effectively terminate the respondent\u2019s business as would the loss of the operating certificate, Counsel having said, as I recall, that his business consists solely of the kind of business permissible under the exemption. It would seem that the imposition of a sanction under the guise of rule-making is a clear lack of due process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1397-15\">The administrative law judge had become fully aware of the claims of the parties and recognized that the operating certificate and the exemption had been so coupled as to comprise Priority\u2019s <em>operating authority. </em>His Order reflects his judgment that Priority was entitled to a hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>It would seem that all of the charges could have been made part of the Order of Revocation issued, (sic) so that they could all be subject to hearing procedure, and give the full appearance of fair play so essential, not only in Court proceedings, but in Administrative proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1398-4\">As the General Counsel had insisted that his attack based on jurisdictional grounds must receive priority consideration, the administrative law judge allowed an interlocutory appeal, to the Board after denying the Administrator\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-6\">So it was that the Administrator\u2019s appeal in Docket No. SE \u2014 2290 reached the Board which specified in its Opinion and Order that \u201cThe sole issue presented herein is whether the Board has jurisdiction of [Priority\u2019s] appeal from the termination of exemption\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Having thus \" limited the scope of its inquiry, the Board chose to disregard other aspects in the substantial background of record before the administrative law judge, and the material in opposition to the Administrator\u2019s motion to dismiss. The Board in its opinion concluded that \u201ctermination of the exemption by the FAA was not tantamount to an order revoking a certificate within the meaning of section \u25a0 609 of the Act.\u201d The Board thus rejected the view of the administrative law judge and Priority\u2019s claim that the ATCO certificate and the Flight Standards Service exemption, <em>taken together, </em>comprised Priority\u2019s operating authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-7\">How the Board could disregard the background and the record of Priority\u2019s operation is not readily understandable. The Flight Standards Service as late as February 28, 1973, had granted Exemption No. 700F in continuation of similar grants over a period of nearly six years. FSS specifically had ruled that the reasons for the grant of such exemptions were still in existence: namely, that Priority\u2019s services were in the national interest and that the continuing authority to carry dangerous articles in a manner responsive to United States agency needs was in the public interest. In short, the 1973 extension of Priority\u2019s exemption stemmed from the recommendation of the Director of the Operations Division of the Military Traffic Management and Terminal Service of the Department of the Army.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-10\">Over the years Priority was the first carrier among some twelve air taxi operators to have been engaged in the transportation of dangerous articles for the Department of Defense. Since 1967, Priority had flown approximately 14,000,000 miles, had transported over 10,000 shipments of hazardous and sensitive items and had never incurred a lost or damaged shipment. Priority as of 1973 was transporting approximately 80 per cent of the hazardous freight offered by the Government to be serviced by carriers in its category.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-11\">I find myself at a loss to understand how Priority\u2019s authority so to operate was derived merely from its exemption and not from its certificate \u2014 but that is what the Board held.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-12\">Mere possession of ATCO status without authorization to transport explosives was not enough for Priority to continue in business. The exemption by itself availed nothing. The conjunction of both constituted Priority\u2019s operating authority. The very order granting the instant exemption recited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1398-13\">No person may operate an aircraft under this exemption unless he holds an ATCO operating certificate and operations specifications issued under Part 135 of the Federal Aviation Regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1398-14\">Yet we find the Board insisting here that it lacked jurisdiction since 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1429 makes no mention of authority to review the termination of an <em>exemption. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>The Board seems to have failed to consider our case law as in comparable situations where an agency has sought to limit review of its actions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1399-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-5\">Our discussion presently may be concluded. What we see here is a speciality, a going business representing substantial skill and large investment, suddenly terminated when the FAA cancelled its operating authority. As our analysis has disclosed, particularly with our precedents in mind, Priority\u2019s efforts to secure a notice of charges and a hearing on those charges have encountered agency barriers \u2014 largely artificial it may seem, in light of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-6\">We need not engage in a war of semantics concerning the precise nature of a letter of registration, a certificate, a license, an exemption or other label for agency permission under circumstances such as this record presents. We perceive here an operation, the scope of which \u2014 from Priority\u2019s inception \u2014 was known to and authorized by the agency, and undertaken at the instigation of the Government. Nor are we here concerned with a distinction between a \u201ctermination\u201d and the grant or denial of an exemption as those terms appear in 14 C.F.R. Section 11.53. It could be conceded that in most situations the grant or denial of an exemption, without more, being discretionary, is not reviewable. There is nothing absolute about such a declaration, however, as we have heretofore realized.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1399-12\">Our inquiry is broader. Consideration must be given to practical aspects in the application of governmental power, for the facts depict the necessities, whether for the exercise of power or for the restraint upon it. So reasoned Judge Pret-tyman as he developed the principle, applicable now, just as we have recognized in some other situations. His discussion, <em>generally, </em>is helpful here, just as he pointed out</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1399-13\">The controlling practicality, in our view, is that the suspension would destroy property, not a licensed property but investment and business property. The Government cannot make a business dependent upon a permit and make an otherwise unconstitutional requirement a condition of the permit <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1399-15\">Ever present in these situations is the concept of due process<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> whether the problem be of constitutional dimension or not. We all are well aware that from time to time issues have been presented to the courts where agencies in disregard of established criteria have exerted power, and then deemed their actions insulated from judicial review. One well might liken the termination of Priority\u2019s business to the \u201cdebarment\u201d analyzed by our former colleague, Judge Burger, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>Gonzalez v. Freeman,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 118 U.S.App.D.C. 180, 184, 185, 334 F.2d 570, 574, 575 (1964). There, 334 F.2d at 578, he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1400-4\">Such debarment cannot be left to administrative improvisation on a case-by-case basis. The governmental power must be exercised in accordance with accepted basic legal norms. Considerations of basic fairness require administrative regulations establishing standards for debarment and procedures which will include notice <em>of </em>specific charges, opportunity to present evidence and to cross-examine adverse witnesses, all culminating in administrative findings and conclusions based upon the record so made. (Footnote references omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1400-5\">Let me revert to the text, <em>supra, </em>where the administrative law judge had summed up the situation, observing that \u201cthe loss of the exemption would just as effectively terminate [Priority\u2019s] business as would the loss of the operating certificate.\u201d We have considered such situations in the past. In Capitol Airways, Inc. v. Civil Aeronautics Board,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Judge Washington put it this way:</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-8\">The inference to be drawn is that if the Board proposed to discriminate between carriers in the same group, characterizing some as law abiders and some as law breakers, it would be required <em>to afford an evidentiary hearing to those whose operating authority was to be suspended or revoked for cause. </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-9\">Under the circumstances, I would conclude that the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s order now before us was entered under a misapprehension as to governing law. Our petitioner, Priority, was entitled to an adjudicatory hearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1400-10\">I am entirely satisfied that Priority was and is entitled, after notice of specific charges, to an evidentiary hearing before its operating authority shall be cancelled. That hearing should encompass simultaneously such factors as may be claimed to predicate the \u201cEmergency Order of Revocation\u201d and the \u201cTermination of Exemption\u201d, which, combined, constitute Priority\u2019s operating authority. Any orders thereafter entered should be subject to review by the National Transportation Safety Board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1396-14\">. The Flights Standards Service in February, 1973, had granted that exemption, finding that Priority\u2019s services were in the national interest and that the Army had recommended renewal of the exemption as in previous years. Yet six months later, FAA terminated the exemption and ruled that the hearing requested by Priority was neither \u201cnecessary or appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Adj\">Later before the court and again before the Administrative Law Judge, Priority reiterated its claim of entitlement to a hearing, e. g.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ado-dedup-1\">The Agency has never specified the grounds for the revocation of the exemption, and we do not know whether they are the same as the grounds for the revocation of the certificate, or not, except that the Order of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>Agency terminating the exemption says that it is based in part on some allegations that were contained in a civil penalty letter, and some of those allegations are also in the Complaint for emergency revocation of the certificate.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1397-9\">. It is clear enough that the district judge regarded the two Revocation and Termination actions as inextricably intertwined, indeed as one of his.conclusions of law, he recited that Priority would suffer immediate and irreparable injury to its business if the Government defendants were not to be restrained from \u201cattempting to enforce their Order of Termination of Exemption and the emergency portion of their Emergency Order of Revocation, both dated August 3, 1973.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1397-17\">. Undoubtedly the administrative law judge took into account Priority\u2019s claim that Section 2(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551 et seq., defined the term \u201clicense\u201d as \u201c. . . including the whole, or any part of any Agency permit . . . any Agency permit or other form of permission\u201d. App. p. 72.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1398-8\">. \u201cThe appeal from the order of revocation, over which the Board\u2019s jurisdiction is undisputed, is currently awaiting a hearing before the administrative law judge\u201d, the Board\u2019s Opinion noted as to Docket SE-2291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1399-7\">. <em>See </em>notes 6, 7, 9 and 10, <em>infra. </em>Moreover the Board\u2019s Opinion reveals no recognition of the concern of the administrative law judge that the definition of \u201clicense\u201d in Section 2(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(8) and (9), may comprehend \u201cany Agency permit\u201d or \u201cother form of permission.\u201d <em>See </em>n.3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1399-8\">. <em>See </em>Cook Cleland Catalina Airways v.

When we affirmed the orders of the Civil Aeronautics Board, we pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1399-10\">In the present case no hearing was required by the Constitution, as no existing business and no existing property was involved. <em>We do not have here any question which might </em>arise <em>if the applicant had developed a business or acquired property by reason of the original registration or the original permissive regulations of the Board. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1399-17\">.

Fundamentally, after all, we are talking about the right to be heard, having in mind such procedural protections as a particular situation may demand. <em>Cf. </em>the Court\u2019s illustrations in Morrissey v.
