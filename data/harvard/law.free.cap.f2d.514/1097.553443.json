United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 391 U.S. 244, 88 S.Ct. 1496, 20 L.Ed.2d 562 (1968). The contention that the injunction was improperly extended to cover devices held by practitioners is also without merit. Such devices, used in the treatment of patients, may properly be considered \u201cheld for sale\u201d within the meaning of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(k). United States v. Device Labeled \u201cCameron Spitler, Etc.\u201d, 261 F. Supp. 243, 246 (D.Neb.1966); United States v. 10 Cartons, Etc., 152 F.Supp. 360, 364-65 (W.D.Pa.1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-8\">Finally, we reject the suggestion that the injunction exceeds the inspectional authority provided by the Act, by extending to all things \u201c(including records, files, papers, processes and facilities) bearing on whether any prohibited devices have been or are being manufactured, assembled, processed, packed, transported, or held in such place.\u201d Aside from the propriety of the provision in light of the history of non-compliance with the 1972 decree, the specification of such authority with respect to prescription drugs, added by the 1962 amendments, Drug Amendments of 1962, Pub.L.No. 87-781, Title II, \u00a7 201(a) (Oct. 10, 1962), 76 Stat. 792, was not intended \u201cto detract from, or imply the absence of, existing authority as to other drugs or articles subject to the act.\u201d 1962 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 2889.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-12\">We find the appellant\u2019s other contentions insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1156-10\">.
