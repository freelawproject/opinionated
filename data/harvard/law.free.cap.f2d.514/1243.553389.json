Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1302-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1302-9\">Comer was injured during the course of a robbery of the gas station where he was employed. The station is located, as Comer admittedly knew before the robbery, in a high-crime area. He argues his employer failed to exercise reasonable care in protecting employees\u2019 safety \u2014 despite Comer\u2019s express request therefor. Appellees respond that Comer knew the risks and assumed them. The District Court granted summary judgment for Employer, and we affirm, on the basis of Pfister v. Phoenix of Hartford Insurance Co., La.App., 4 Cir., 1974, 290 So.2d 362 and Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 1938, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-10\">First, Comer asserts we are not bound by <em>Pfister, </em>because an earlier Louisiana Supreme Court case, Langlois v. Allied Chemical Corp., 1971, 258 La. 1067, 249 So.2d 133, is fatally inconsistent. The short answer, in our <em>Erie </em>-bound Court, is that the same Louisiana Supreme Court refused to review <em>Pfister, </em>1974, La., 293 So.2d 187,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we must conclude that <em>that </em>\u2014 the controlling \u2014 Court did not see any fatal inconsistency. <em>See, </em>Ford Motor Co. v. Mathis, 5 Cir., 1963, 322 F.2d 267, 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-11\">Second, Comer would distinguish <em>Pfister </em>on the ground Comer, because of his physical condition, had a great deal of difficulty finding work. Thus, unlike Pfister, he cannot be held to the same free acceptance of risk that Pfister, an apparently healthy man, was. We do not read <em>Pfister </em>so narrowly. We think the Court\u2019s concern was not availability of other employment, but the basic freedom-to-quit. Comer knew he was working in a high-crime area, <em>was </em>free to quit (whether or not he could have found other work), yet he elected to stay. <em>That, </em>says <em>Pfister, </em>is an assumption of the risk \u2014 and <em>that </em>is the end of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1302-21\">. So did the United States Supreme Court, 1974, 419 U.S. 966, 95 S.Ct. 229, 42 L.Ed.2d 181.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
