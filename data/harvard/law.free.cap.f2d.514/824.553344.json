ROBINSON, III.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">Dissenting Opinion filed by Circuit Judge ROBB.</p>\n<author id=\"b883-12\">SPOTTSWOOD W. ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">The Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act of 1966 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to provide financial and technical assistance enabling cities to plan and execute certain types of programs designed to improve the quality of urban life in the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Among the projects which may qualify for assistance are \u201clocally prepared and scheduled comprehensive city demonstration programs containing new and imaginative proposals to rebuild or revitalize large slum and blighted areas . . . \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A comprehensive city demonstration program is eligible for assistance only if it satisfies specified criteria,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> one of which is that it be \u201cof sufficient magnitude to provide widespread citizen participation in the program . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Secretary is commanded, <em>inter alia, </em>to \u201cemphasize local initiative in the planning, development, and implementation of comprehensive city demonstration programs . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The case before us challenges a demonstration program as viola-tive of these requirements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-24\">On May 1, 1967, the District of Columbia applied for a planning grant in connection with its Model Cities Program. On November 17, 1967, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) advised that the District\u2019s proposal failed to meet performance standards for citizen involvement. Thereafter, on December 18, 1968, the District\u2019s Mayor-Commissioner issued Order 68 \u2014 761 establishing the Model Cities Commission as the citizen participation component in the Model Cities Program.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> By that order, the Commission shared a policy-making role with the District\u2019s Model <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>Cities Administrator, and an impasse procedure for possible disagreements was supplied.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Order 72-44, issued on February 29, 1972, however, eliminated the impasse mechanism, relegated the Commission to an advisory function, and merged the staffs of the Commission and the City Demonstration Agency, which was controlled by the District Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Appellants<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> then filed this class action challenging the validity of Order 72-44 on both substantive and procedural grounds. Discussions were held between appellants and appellees<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> ostensibly to work out a new plan to replace Order 72-44. Order 72-273, promulgated on November 24, 1972, instituted a significantly modified impasse procedure <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and continued to deny the Commission a separate staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Appellants then amended their complaint to charge the invalidity of the new scheme and the litigation came on for hearing on appellants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction and cross-motions for summary judgment. The District Court rejected appellants\u2019 claims that the revised administrative structure disregarded the Act\u2019s specifications of \u201cwidespread citizen participation\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and \u201clocal initiative,\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and granted summary judgment in appellees\u2019 favor.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Appellants now assert their contentions in this court but we find them soundly answered by the District Court\u2019s opinion<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> on all points save one. We reverse and remand for a limited trial on that point alone, and in all other respects affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">In implementation of the statutory mandate of \u201cwidespread citizen participation,\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> regulations promulgated by HUD provide that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-12\">[t]he citizen participation component must be actively and continuously involved in planning, monitoring, evaluating and influencing the Model Cities program. It ,is the city\u2019s responsibility, <em>in good faith deliberation with its citizen participation component, </em>to define clearly and set forth the responsibilities and authority of the citizen participation component in these areas.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-13\">In granting summary judgment for ap-pellees, the District Court concluded that the District Government engaged in good faith deliberations with appellants prior to adoption of Order 72 \u2014 273.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We agree with appellants, however, that the record disclosed an issue of fact as to whether this requirement of good faith deliberation was met.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>summary judgment awarded appellees was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The ground rules governing motions for summary judgment are well settled. The motion can be granted only if the record makes clear \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The movant \u2014 appellees in this case \u2014 must carry the burden of demonstrating the absence of any genuine issue as to any material fact<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and the party opposing the motion is entitled to all favorable inferences deducible from the parties\u2019 evidentiary representations.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The court\u2019s function is not to resolve any such issue, but only to ascertain whether any exists,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and all doubts in that regard must be resolved against summary judgment.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The record unmistakably reveals an issue of good faith deliberation with the District\u2019s citizen participation component in the formulation of Order 72-44. In an affidavit executed by appellant Bouchard <footnotemark>26</footnotemark> serious allegations of lack of citizen involvement are made. These allegations are substantiated in an affidavit <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> by Charles Richardson, chairman of the Model Cities Commission.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The alleged unwillingness of governmental officials to discuss reorganization of the citizen component of the Model Cities Program with representatives of affected citizens raises inferentially the possibility of the same defect in Order 72-<em>273.</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>If appellants can prove a lack of good faith deliberation as to Order 72-44, they are entitled to an opportunity to persuade the trier of fact that the same intransigence pervaded the District Government\u2019s formulation of a quite similar scheme of reorganization in Order 72-273. Moreover, the record also discloses an issue as to whether the District Government afforded appellants enough time to consider Order 72-273.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> If not, the trier of fact might with equal facility infer an absence of good faith deliberation.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">There is, then, a highly important factual issue which, if resolved in appellants\u2019 favor, could lead to a declaration that Order 72-273 is procedurally defective. If appellants succeed in proving an absence of good faith, it would appear that the federal appellees might also fail on the merits. Although HUD approval of Order 72-273 may not have been arbitrary or capricious <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> \u2014 there are indica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>tions both of good faith and its absence \u2014 it might have been in derogation of appellants\u2019 procedural rights.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Accordingly, we reverse the summary judgment for appellees and remand the case for a trial limited to the issue of good faith deliberation regarding Order 72-273. In all other respects, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-15\">. Pub.L.

Washington, 356 F.Supp. 223 (D.D.C. 1972). I find nothing in the record, including the affidavits of Bouchard and Richardson, that would justify a trial on the issue of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">Order No. 72-273 was the one before the district judge, not Order No. 72-44, which had been rescinded. The allegations concerning the defendants\u2019 attitude during the discussions preceding Order No. 72-44 are too thin a reed to support an inference of bad faith in the discussions of Order No. 72-273.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">The record discloses without contradiction that the plaintiffs participated in extensive discussions concerning Order No. 72-273. Thus in his opinion the district judge noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-10\">It should be remembered that this Court granted a 90-day stay of' the proceedings in this litigation in order to allow the plaintiffs and defendants an opportunity to meet and discuss possible revisions in the administrative structure of the Model Cities Program. The record reveals that the defendants did, in fact, utilize this period of time to conduct negotiations and exchange information with the Model Cities Commission concerning the proposed draft of Order 72-273. This ongoing dialogue with the citizens participation component complied with the Model Cities Act and constituted \u201cgood faith deliberation\u201d within the meaning of CDA Letter 10B. Therefore, this Court finds that there existed no procedural defects in the formulation and adoption of Order 72 \u2014 273.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-13\">356 F.Supp. at 229-230.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-14\">Moreover on November 28, 1972, four days after Order 72-273 was promulgated, the plaintiff Richardson, Chairman of the Model Cities Commission, wrote to HUD:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-15\">I am pleased to submit to you the Third Year Action Plan for the Washington, D. C., Model Cities Program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-16\">The D. C. Model Cities Commission, working closely with the staff of the City Demonstration Agency, has contributed many weeks of work in developing this plan. We believe it provides the basis for a significant improvement in the income level and the overall quality of life in the Model Neighborhood in the coming year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-17\">I therefore urge that the Department of Housing and Urban Development consider the plan without delay so that our third year program can be initiated promptly in the coming year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A29\">This letter is attached to the Federal Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment as Exhibit 13. The Director of the staff of the City Demonstration Agency, referred to by Richardson as \u201cworking closely\u201d with Richardson\u2019s Commission in developing the Plan, is one of the defendants. In his affidavit Richardson says his letter</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-18\">in no way indicates substantial participation by the Commission in any facet of the Model Cities. Program other than in the development of the Third Action Year Plan, [sic] and that it in no way implies that the reorganization scheme presently exemplified by Order 72-273, included in the Third Action Year Plan [sic] was ever acquiesced in or agreed to in any way by me or by the Model Cities Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>However this may be, the letter illustrates the extensive and fruitful participation of the plaintiffs in the program. That the plaintiffs\u2019 views did not prevail in every instance does not mean that the defendants acted in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">In my opinion a trial of this action will be useless, for the trial judge will be bound to find for the defendants on the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b886-19\">.
