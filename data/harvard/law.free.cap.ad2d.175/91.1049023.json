Other members of the Santos family who were present at the scene of the accident also sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>personal injuries. This declaratory judgment action was subsequently brought by Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company (hereinafter Aetna) and Porter to seek a determination as to whether Davis had permission to use Porter\u2019s vehicle at the time of the accident. Following a nonjury trial, the Supreme Court found that Davis did not have permissive use of Porter\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The defendants contend that the plaintiffs failed to present substantial evidence to rebut the presumption of permissive use created by Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388. The plaintiffs do not dispute the applicability of Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388, which section gives rise to the \"presumption that the vehicle is being operated with the owner\u2019s consent\u201d <em>(Walls v Zuvic, </em>113 AD2d 936; <em>see, Albouyeh v County of Suffolk, </em>96 AD2d 543, <em>affd </em>62 NY2d 681; <em>Leotta v Plessinger, </em>8 NY2d 449, 461). The presumption that an owner of a vehicle has consented to its use is \" Very strong\u2019 and continues until there is 'substantial evidence to the contrary\u2019 \u201d <em>(Bruno v Privilegi, </em>148 AD2d 652, 653, <em>quoting Albouyeh v County of Suffolk, supra, </em>at 544).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The record reveals that the plaintiff Sallie Mae Porter testified that Davis did not have permission to use her vehicle on the day of the accident. Davis was a tenant in Porter\u2019s house and was generally not permitted to use Porter\u2019s car. Ms. Porter\u2019s daughter also corroborated her testimony. Moreover, Davis testified, through his deposition testimony read at trial, that he was not permitted to use the car unless an emergency existed. We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Davis\u2019s use of the car to attend an appointment at the Department of Social Services was not an emergency under the circumstances of this case. Therefore, the trial court did not err in concluding that the plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of permissive use under Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">We have considered the defendants\u2019 remaining contention and find that it is without merit. Thompson, J. P., Kunzeman, Harwood and Balletta, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
