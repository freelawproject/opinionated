B. Bowman\u2019s answer, and so folded up that nobody could see it. But we insist that this was no answer at all. The answer being a separate one, and put in long after Bowman\u2019s answer, ought to have been a separate sheet of paper, ought to have been independent of the other answer, ought to have answered the allegations of the bill severally and especially, as prescribed by the statutes, Sec. 23, Chap. 22, R. S., Chancery.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-5\" pgmap=\"420\">Now, a paper which merely states that some defendants adopt an answer heretofore made, is not an answer, and need not be noticed at all. The default was only taken at the hearing when the papers were examined, and no answer of Bowman\u2019s legal representatives was visible. The case had been set for hearing, and the legal representatives, if they considered they had answered, ought to have been present (in fact, Frank B. Bowman, the administrator and one of the heirs and their attorney, was present on the first day of the trial, and also participated in the argument when the case was argued, without any objection, on the part of the complainants), and they had the whole balance of the term to set aside the default if they had chosen to do so. But no suggestion was made by either counsel that they had put in an answer.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-6\" pgmap=\"420\">But suppose the indorsement of John B. Bowman\u2019s answer could be considered as an answer, then his answer was theirs, and the case was tried on his and on Griswold\u2019s answer, so that they could have suffered no ..injury whatever. They had set up nothing different from J. B. Bowman\u2019s ansrver. We had to prove everything, just the same as if they had filed a separate answer, Adopting the answer of John B. Bowman, their interest was amply protected. Objection was made to the testimony of witnesses because they testified to facts occurring before the death of John B. Bowman, which, of course, was made in their interest, because that did not concern the co-defendant, Griswold. As the default was taken on the hearing only, they could have had whatever witnesses they wanted present; but none were there. They considered, and very properly so, that the counsel who did appear was fully able to do them justice; they did not need to employ additional counsel.</p> <opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b421-3\" pgmap=\"421\">Reeves, J.</author> <p id=\"AWB\" pgmap=\"421\">The appellees filed a bill in chancery against the appellants.

Bowman died, and his administrator, heirs and widow were made parties to the bill and brought into court. On the 29th day of November, 1886, the administrator, heirs and widow of JohnB.
