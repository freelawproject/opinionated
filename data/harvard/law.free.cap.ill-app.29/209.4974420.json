Tipton &amp; Beaver, for appellants.</attorneys><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-16\" pgmap=\"205(44) 206(33)\">It is a well settled rule of law that a party can not occupy inconsistent positions, and where one has an election between several inconsistent courses, he will be confined to that which he first adopts. Any decisive act of the party done with knowledge of his rights and of the fact, determines his election and works an estoppel. Bigelow on Estoppel, 578; Herrington v. Hubbard, 1 Scam. 569; Derrickson v. Krause, 4 Ill. App. 508.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-5\" pgmap=\"206\">Appellee had two remedies: one to proceed by bill in chancery for specific performance, and the other by action at law for damages; and in this event he held the chattel mortgage as collateral security, unless it shall be determined that appellee simply took the mortgage to enable appellants to get their goods out of the State.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-6\" pgmap=\"206\">It is not claimed that appellee gave any consideration for the chattel mortgage other than as it formed apart of the contract of September 7, 1886, and the court clearly erred in refusing to allow defendants to prove this fact, that if the mortgage was given for the purpose claimed by appellants then appellee could not recover as it was in fraud of creditors of the appellants.

To secure performance on the part of appellants, they at the time executed to appellee a chattel mor\u00edgage on certain property, to secure their note of $500, given to appellee.</p> <p id=\"b208-5\" pgmap=\"208\">Appellants refusing to comply with their agreement to convey the twenty acres, a bill in chancery was filed, and a decree rendered requiring them to convey, and upon default that the master should. The decree also found that the chattel mortgage was given as collateral security to secure the performance of the agreement to convey.</p> <p id=\"b208-6\" pgmap=\"208\">Afterward appellee brought an action of replevin for the goods and chattels included in the chattel mortgage, recovered them below, and appellants bring the record of that replevin suit for review.</p> <p id=\"b208-7\" pgmap=\"208\">We see no grounds for complaint upon the part of appellants. The validity, good faith and purpose of the chattel mortgage were adjudicated and determined in the chancery proceedings, and no more.</p> <p id=\"b208-8\" pgmap=\"208\">How much appellee might he entitled to recover under his chattel mortgage was not before that court, and could not have been determined at that time. That court did determine that it was given to secure the performance by appellants of their part of the written agreement, and it follows that the mortgage is a valid one, and that the possession of the property described in it would rightfully pass to appellee as under any other chattel mortgage. When appellee has been repaid for all such things as the mortgage contemplated he should be secured in, then it will be time for appellants to demand a settlement and repayment of the balance, if there be any.</p> <p id=\"b208-9\" pgmap=\"208\">The judgment of the Circuit Court will he affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b208-10\" pgmap=\"208\">Judgment affw'med.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
