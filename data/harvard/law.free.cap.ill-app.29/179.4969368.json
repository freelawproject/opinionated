This was brought to the attention of the County Court in a motion by defendant to dismiss the cause for want of jurisdiction of the subject-matter, which motion the court overruled and thereby, as we claim, exceeded its jurisdiction and rendered an unlawful judgment, which, on this point alone, should be reversed.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-12\" pgmap=\"175\">A judgment of a court having no jurisdiction of the subject-matter is a nullity.
