Judgment was entered June 4,1975 and defendant promptly filed a notice of appeal and a request to have counsel assigned. Although he had specifically requested that his trial counsel be assigned to handle the appeal, the Appellate Division appointed, over the next three and a half years, several different attorneys to pursue defendant\u2019s case on appeal, before the attorney who would develop and argue defendant\u2019s appeal was appointed. These changes in counsel were precipitated by <em>pro se </em>motions to expedite the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">When the appeal was argued, defendant raised errors allegedly committed during the trial and contended that the excessive delay between the time of conviction and when his appeal was heard violated his right to a speedy trial, to due process and to equal protection of the law. In March, 1980, the Appellate Division reversed his conviction on the ground that defendant\u2019s right to a public trial had been violated when, without any hearing, the courtroom was ordered cleared and closed prior to the testimony of the undercover police officer to whom defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>allegedly sold drugs. The Appellate Division did not address defendant\u2019s other contentions, including his claims based on the excessive delay. The memorandum opinion states only that those claims did not require summary reversal. (74 AD2d 877, 878.)</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Upon remand, defendant, by omnibus motion, again raised the claim that his constitutional rights had been violated by the unreasonable delay and sought to have the indictment dismissed. Special Term denied the motion on the basis of the papers submitted. Prior to trial, defendant pleaded guilty to one count of the indictment in full satisfaction of the charges against him. The judgment of conviction entered on the basis of that plea was unanimously affirmed, without opinion, by the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Leave to appeal to this court was granted to determine whether the five-year delay in the appellate process had deprived the defendant of a protected right. Although we now affirm defendant\u2019s conviction, we do so on an analysis which does not in any respect condone such excessive delays in the appellate process.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Defendant seeks to equate the right to appeal a conviction with the right to a speedy trial. In his brief to this court, he argues that this constitutional right to a speedy trial has been violated because it was over five years before he would have received his \u201cfirst \u2018fair trial\u2019 \u201d. The underlying rationale of this argument is that because the Appellate Division found that his constitutional right to a public trial had been violated at his first trial, he had not yet received the trial guaranteed him by the Constitution. Thus, he concludes that a new trial scheduled some five years after the initiation of criminal proceedings against him cannot constitute a speedy trial within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The error in defendant\u2019s analysis is twofold. Defendant\u2019s argument misperceives both the intent and the scope of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee that everyone accused of a crime shall \u201cenjoy the right to a speedy and public trial\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">The right to a speedy trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution is, of course, a fundamental right applicable in State prosecutions as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>well as Federal prosecutions. <em>(Klopfer v North Carolina, </em>386 US 213.) In determining the proper scope of this right, both this court and the Supreme Court have held that \u201cexcessive delay between institution of the prosecution \u2014 whether by felony information or complaint, detainer warrant or indictment \u2014 and the trial\u201d constitutes a violation of an accused person\u2019s right to a speedy trial. <em>(People v White, </em>32 NY2d 393, 397, citing <em>United States v Marion, </em>404 US 307, 320; <em>People v Minicone, </em>28 NY2d 279, 281, cert den 404 US 853; <em>People v Winfrey, </em>20 NY2d 138, 143-144; <em>People u Prosser, </em>309 NY 353, 361.)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The Supreme Court has stated that \u201cthe purposes of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s speedy trial provision [are] \u2018to prevent undue and oppressive incarceration prior to trial, to minimize anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation and to limit the possibilities that long delay will impair the ability of an accused to defend himself.\u2019 \u201d <em>(United States v Marion, </em>404 US 307, 320, <em>supra, </em>quoting <em>United States v Ewell, </em>383 US 116, 120.) While recognizing that undue delay may impair the defendant\u2019s ability to present an effective defense, the court noted that \u201cthe major evils protected against by the speedy trial guarantee exist quite apart from actual or possible prejudice to an accused\u2019s defense.\u201d <em>(United States v Marion, supra, </em>at p 320.) Rather, the court concluded that the interference with a defendant\u2019s liberty interests \u2014 his freedom of movement, the potential disruption of his family life and employment, and the public ridicule and anxiety occasioned by the filing of criminal charges against a person constitute the foundation for the accused\u2019s right to a speedy trial. Thus, the right comes into existence at the time the initial accusatory instrument is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">But, here, we are asked to decide at what point in a criminal proceeding it can be said that a defendant has received all the guarantees associated with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to a speedy trial. We conclude that the underlying rationale of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to a speedy trial extends that fight only until the accused is brought to trial.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The fact that, on appeal, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>may successfully challenge the propriety of that trial does not extend the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of a speedy trial throughout the appellate process. When the accused is found guilty and incarcerated even as a result of a procedurally flawed trial, he can no longer be said to be in the \u201clegal limbo\u201d the Sixth Amendment is designed to protect against. The accusations raised against him have been supported and the anxiety of an unknown fate has been resolved. The fact that a State has chosen statutorily to provide the accused with additional protection in the form of appellate review does not serve to expand the scope of an accused\u2019s speedy trial right. Nor does it mean that the purposes behind the speedy trial right will not be served properly. The accused will have been afforded the protections envisioned in assuring that he be promptly brought to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Turning then to the case before us, we conclude that there was no violation of defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. He was accorded a prompt trial which resulted in his conviction. At that point, the concerns addressed by the Sixth Amendment were served.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Similarly, we see no reason to expand the scope of New York\u2019s statutory speedy trial right (CPL 30.20, 30.30) into the appellate process. The purposes behind the speedy trial right, codified in CPL 30.20 and 30.30, are fundamentally the same as those embodied in the Sixth Amendment. Thus, no additional reason for expanding this right to the appellate process is presented by the existence of a statutory speedy trial right.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">It is more significant, we believe, that the Legislature, in establishing by statute both the right to an appeal (CPL 460.10 <em>et seq.) </em>and the right to a speedy trial has chosen to correlate those two rights only to the extent that any reasonable delay resulting from an appeal is not to be included when computing the time within which the People must be ready for trial. (CPL 30.30, subd 4, par [a].) Since the right to have an appellate court review one\u2019s conviction derives not from the common law, but solely from a State\u2019s statutory scheme <em>(McKane v Durston, </em>153 US 684, 687), it would be within the province of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Legislature to infuse the right to a speedy trial into the statutory right to pursue an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Of course, once a State grants the right to appellate review, it must insure that the appellate process affords all the protections guaranteed by the right to due process of law. <em>(Griffin v Illinois, </em>351 US 12,18; <em>Matter of Mitchell, </em>40 NY2d 153, 157.) Although we have never \u201cdrawn a fine distinction between due process and speedy trial standards\u201d, we have held that \u201cthe State due process requirement of a prompt prosecution is broader than the right to a speedy trial guaranteed by statute (see CPL 30.20; see, also, CPL 30.30) and the Sixth Amendment (see <em>United States v Marion, </em>404 US 307, <em>supra; Klopfer v North Carolina, </em>386 US 213).\u201d <em>(People v Singer, </em>44 NY2d 241, 253.) The extent of those due process rights, however, cannot be ascertained by the application of an \u201cabsolute, simple or single standard.\u201d <em>(People v Staley, </em>41 NY2d 789, 792, <em>supra.) </em>Delays do not automatically mandate dismissals; rather, particularly in a postconviction proceeding, it is necessary that the defendant show that he has been prejudiced by the delay. <em>(United States v Lovasco, </em>431 US 783, 789, reh den 434 US 881; <em>People v Staley, supra.) </em>In the past, in considering the due process ramifications of pretrial delay, we stated: \u201cAs with the right to speedy trial, the due process right to prompt prosecution must be tested on a balancing analysis, with seriousness of the crime and length of the delay being significant factors, among others\u201d. (P<em>eople v Staley, supra, </em>at p 792.) Similarly, we hold now that in evaluating claims that a defendant\u2019s due process rights have been violated by an unreasonable delay in the appellate process, the court must weigh factors similar to those considered in determining whether a defendant\u2019s speedy trial rights were violated. <em>(People v Taranovich, </em>37 NY2d 442; <em>Doescher v Estelle, </em>454 F Supp 943, app dsmd 597 F2d 281.) Although a five-year delay prior to trial raises a presumption of prejudice <em>(People v Singer, supra, </em>at p 254), such a presumption need not be indulged with respect to delay in prosecuting an appeal, for the principle effects of prejudice \u2014 loss of memory by or disappearance of a witness or witnesses \u2014 will to a large extent be ameliorated by the availability of the record of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>the trial which may be used to refresh the recollection of a witness who remains available or read as the prior testimony of a witness who cannot be found. Thus, a hearing will normally be required to determine whether or not in an individual case there has been a violation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights resulting in prejudice which requires dismissal of the charges. At that hearing, it will be the defendant\u2019s burden to show that he has been prejudiced by the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">In this case, the defendant\u2019s success when his appeal was heard by the Appellate Division indicates that he suffered no prejudice in pursuing his case on appeal as a result of the delay between his conviction and the hearing of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The defendant does argue that he was prejudiced in regard to his retrial because several witnesses disappeared during the five-year period his appeal was pending. Had he properly raised this claim to the trial court by asserting a violation of his due process rights, rather than his speedy trial rights, a hearing could have been held to determine the validity of this claim and whether the prejudice was attributable to the delay in the appellate process. In this case, defendant raised only claims that the indictment should be dismissed because his speedy trial right had been violated and that the interests of justice required dismissal of the indictment. This did not properly alert the court to claims of due process violations, or that a hearing might be required. Indeed, the only reference to due process in the motion are as it would relate to the defendant\u2019s speedy trial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Had the defendant properly alerted the court to potential due process violations, a hearing could have evaluated the claimed prejudice. This court cannot assume, without the benefit of a record compiled at such a hearing or at the retrial, that any prejudice did result. While the disappearance of key witnesses may well amount to prejudice, such cannot be assumed in this case where all those witnesses had testified at the first trial and their testimony would be available at the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">We have considered the other contentions raised by defendant and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler, Fuchsberg and Meyer concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b122-7\"> Our ruling today would not, of course, preclude a defendant from making a new motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that delays in the period between the reversal and retrial violated his speedy trial rights at retrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
