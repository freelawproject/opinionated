The order of the Appellate Division should, therefore, be reversed and the matter remitted to the Supreme Court for entry of judgment in favor of the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Petitioner, Joseph Klonowski, was employed as a fireman for the City of Auburn Department of Fire from December 12, 1947 until May 11, 1978. On February 17, 1977, he injured his left toe, foot and leg while \u201cpulling hose\u201d in the course of his employment and never thereafter returned to active duty as a fireman. On February 28,1978 he submitted a notice for voluntary retirement; on May 8, 1978 he submitted to the New York State Policemen\u2019s and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System his application for accidental disability retirement as a result of the February, 1977 injury, and on May 10, 1978 he was voluntarily retired by the Department of Fire. On September 6,1978 petitioner\u2019s application for accidental disability benefits was granted by the State Comptroller. Petitioner then requested payment pursuant to section 207-a of the General Municipal Law of the difference between his regular salary and the disability allowance, and respondents granted that request retroactive to May, 1978. In January, 1979, however, respondents terminated the section 207-a payments on the ground that \u201cif, at the time you were granted accidental retirement benefits, you were not on 207-A [sic] benefits, you are not entitled to the wage supplement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Klonowski then began this CPLR article 78 proceeding to require payment to him of the difference between his salary and the accidental disability retirement benefit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Respondents\u2019 answer alleged that \u201cpetitioner\u2019s attending physician indicated that the petitioner could return to full duties effective November 1, 1977,\u201d that \u201cas of January 1, 1978, the petitioner was not disabled,\u201d and that \u201ceffective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>May 10, 1978, the petitioner voluntarily retired from the employment with the City of Auburn as a fire fighter.\u201d Petitioner served no reply.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The parties requested that the court determine petitioner\u2019s right to the wage supplement alone, based on the uncontroverted facts in the pleadings, and the court, treating the request as one for severance and partial summary judgment, severed and dismissed as to that issue. It found that Klonowski\u2019s right to section 207-a benefits vested at the time his disability commenced and that he had in fact received such benefits from the time of his injury through May 10, 1978. It, nevertheless; held him not entitled to wage supplement payments because he had voluntarily retired. The Appellate Division affirmed in a memorandum stating that by voluntarily retiring, petitioner waived any benefits to which he might have been entitled under section 207-a (citing <em>Matter of Weber v Department of Fire of City of Syracuse, </em>54 AD2d 164). We granted leave to appeal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\"><em>Matter of Weber </em>was decided in November, 1976. By chapter 965 of the Laws of 1977, section 207-a of the General Municipal Law was extensively revised, effective January 1, 1978. To understand the effect of the revisions on the question now before us requires review of the legislative history of the 1977 act and the case law that had construed the predecessor provisions of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Section 65 of the Civil Service Law (later renum, \u00a7 79), as enacted in 1920 and amended in 1924, allowed a member of the New York State Employees Retirement System who as a natural and proximate result of an accident sustained in service was permanently incapacitated, physically or mentally, from performance of his duties to obtain a pension of three quarters of his final average salary (L 1920, ch 741, \u00a7 1, as amd by L 1924, ch 619, \u00a7 4; see <em>King v City of Newburgh, </em>84 AD2d 388, 395). Because membership in the State system was open to certain municipal employees, firemen employed by such municipalities were eligible for such a pension (Retirement and Social Security Law, \u00a7 30). In 1938, however, the Legislature adopted the original version of what is now section 207-a of the General Municipal Law (L 1938, ch 562), which gave a paid fireman disabled in the performance of his duties the alternative of collecting from \u201cthe municipality or fire district by which he is employed the full amount of his regular salary or wages until his disability arising therefrom has ceased\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The conflicting interests of the firemen and their employers with respect to these statutes created a number of problems. Although the fireman quite naturally opted to remain on the payroll at full salary from the municipality, it was in the interest of the municipality that a disabled fireman retire, because that not only shifted the financial burden entirely to the State Retirement System but also permitted the municipality to replace a disabled nonworking employee with an active able-bodied one. The tensions thus created were exacerbated by the fact that the full pay provision of section 207-a is \u201c <em>\u2018a </em>remedial statute enacted for the benefit of firemen [which] should be liberally construed in their favor\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Mashnouk v Miles, </em>55 NY2d 80, 88, quoting <em>Pease v Colucci, </em>59 AD2d 233, 235). As a result the municipality was required to pay a disabled fireman not only the salary he had been receiving at the time he was disabled but also any increase granted to his not disabled brothers <em>(Matter of Barber v Lupton, </em>282 App Div 1008, affd 307 NY 770) and to continue paying the disabled fireman until he died even though section 65 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the Civil Service Law permitted his accidental disability retirement \u201cupon the application of the head of the department in which said member is employed\u201d <em>(Matter of Birmingham v Mirrington, </em>284 App Div 721).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Unsuccessful at ridding themselves of the burden of full-paid nonworking disabled firemen by involuntarily retiring them, the employing municipalities sought to use both a carrot and a stick to the same end. The carrot \u2014 an agreement that the municipality would, if the disabled fireman voluntarily retired, supplement his retirement pay by the difference between it and his salary \u2014 was, however, held illegal <em>(Matter of Robida v Mirrington, </em>1 Misc 2d 968), and the stick \u2014 termination of employment on the theory that the words \u201cin which he <em>is </em>employed\u201d (emphasis supplied) required that to receive section 207-a benefits the fireman had to be employed at the time of payment \u2014 foundered on holdings that those words \u201crelate to the time when the injuries were received\u201d <em>(Matter of Tyler v Gadwood, </em>195 Misc 674, 678, revd on other grounds 279 App Div 1138) and vested the right to section 207-a benefits at the time of the accident <em>(Pease v Colucci, </em>59 AD2d 233, 236, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The only exceptions to the latter holding came in cases ruling that a disabled fireman was not entitled to both full pay under section 207-a from the municipality and accidental disability retirement benefits from the State <em>(Matter of Robinson v Cole, </em>193 Misc 717; see <em>Matter of Geremski v Department of Fire of City of Syracuse, </em>78 Misc 2d 555, 558, affd 49 AD2d 1013). Although the <em>Robinson </em>holding could properly have been predicated upon the concept that such double payment was not contemplated by the Legislature, the court, though it emphasized the policy against double payment, also held, contrary to the <em>Tyler </em>vesting concept, that Robinson was not entitled to section 207-a benefits because \u201cHe is no longer a \u2018fireman\u2019 \u201d (193 Misc, at p 720). It was the latter concept of <em>Robinson </em>that was emphasized in the <em>Weber </em>holding that a fireman who had voluntarily retired was not entitled to section 207-a benefits (54 AD2d, at p 168).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">It was against this background that, as we have previously noted in <em>Matter of Mashnouk v Miles </em>(55 NY2d 80, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>supra) and <em>Cook v City of Binghamton </em>(48 NY2d 323), chapter 965 of the Laws of 1977 was enacted, \u201cthe primary aim of the new statute [being] to shift a large portion of the financial burden generated by disabled fire fighters from the municipal payrolls to the appropriate retirement system or pension fund * * * Aside from partially shifting the <em>source </em>of the payments made to disabled fire fighters, there is no indication that the Legislature also intended to reduce the <em>amount </em>of such payments\u201d <em>(Mashnouk, supra, </em>at p 87 [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">To former section 207-a the 1977 act added provisions permitting the municipality to require a disabled fireman not eligible for accidental disability benefits to perform appropriate work, to terminate section 207-a benefits of such a fireman when he reached normal retirement age,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to prohibit a disabled fireman receiving payments or benefits from engaging in outside employment, and to permit the involuntary retirement of a fireman eligible for accidental disability retirement, with the municipality paying the difference between regular salary and the benefit received (Governor\u2019s Memorandum on Approving L 1977, ch 965, NY Legis Ann, 1977, pp 336-337). Thus, the carrot, held illegal in <em>Robida (supra), </em>was legalized, and the municipality was provided with a partial stick \u2014 the power involuntarily to retire for accidental disability though not to terminate entirely \u2014 sufficient to obviate any possibility of double payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">That the Legislature, having authorized the involuntary retirement of a fireman eligible for an accidental disability retirement allowance or pension, intended to place in like position those who had relieved the municipality of three quarters of its burden by voluntarily applying for such an allowance or pension is evident from the second sentence of the newly enacted subdivision 4. That sentence reads: \u201cWhere such a fireman retires or is retired under any procedure applicable to him, including but not limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>circumstances described in subdivision two of this section or in this subdivision, he shall thereafter, in addition to any portion of regular wages or salary and/or any retirement allowance or pension to which he is then entitled, continue to be entitled to medical treatment and hospital care necessitated by reason of such injury or illness.\u201d \u201c[Sjuch a fireman\u201d is defined by subdivision 1 as a paid fireman disabled in the course of employment. The quoted sentence, therefore, requires payment to a disabled fireman, whether he voluntarily retires or is involuntarily retired, of the \u201cregular wages or salary\u201d to which he was \u201cthen\u201d \u2014 that is, at the time of retirement \u2014 entitled, except as reduced pursuant to subdivision 2 by the disability allowance or pension. Moreover, by the use of the word \u201cthereafter\u201d, it makes clear that such entitlement runs from the time of retirement, subject only to it being thereafter found that the disabled fireman was in fact eligible for the accidental disability allowance or pension. In light of that provision, <em>Matter of Weber v Department of Fire of City of Syracuse </em>(54 AD2d 164, supra) is no longer good law; the salary differential is due a disabled fireman receiving an accidental disability allowance or pension even though he voluntarily retired.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">It follows that petitioner Klonowski is entitled to the payments he seeks. Though his disability occurred in 1977, he continued to receive full pay until his voluntary retirement in 1978, after the effective date of the statute. That he was not receiving accidental disability benefits at the time he retired is immaterial, for as the later award of such benefits shows, he was then eligible for such benefits. And when he retired he was \u201cthen entitled\u201d to regular wages or salary, less the disability benefit ultimately awarded to him retroactive to the time he retired, as a result of the accidental disability retirement application he had previously submitted. Klonowski, who was 52 years of age when the Supreme Court decision and judgment were rendered, therefore remains entitled, despite his voluntary retirement, to the section 207-a differential allowance until he reaches age 70 (or if he elected section 384 of the Retire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>ment and Social Security Law benefits, until he reaches age 62).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">The order of the Appellate Division should, therefore, be reversed, with costs, and the matter remitted to Supreme Court for determination of petitioner\u2019s request for medical expenses and for the entry of judgment in favor of the petitioner in accordance with the foregoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler and Fuchsberg concur; Judge Simons taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Order reversed, with costs, and matter remitted to Supreme Court, Cayuga County, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-10\">. The petition also sought reimbursement for past and future disability-related medical expenses as provided for by section 207-a of the General Municipal Law, but pursuant to agreement of the parties that issue was held in abeyance pending determination of petitioner\u2019s right to the wage supplement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b458-8\">. By failing to reply petitioner admitted that his retirement on May 10, 1978 was voluntary, for that clearly was \u201cnew matter,\u201d the petition having carefully avoided any mention of the retirement (CPLR 7804, subd fd]). The other allegations quoted above were not new matter, however; they simply controverted petitioner\u2019s allegation and the Comptroller\u2019s determination (annexed as an exhibit to the petition) that he was permanently incapacitated from performance of his duties, and thus are not admitted by failure to reply. Moreover, the first quoted allegation as to what petitioner\u2019s physician \u201cindicated\u201d is irrelevant, subdivision 1 of section 207-a of the General Municipal Law requiring rather for the department to be relieved of its wage supplement obligation that a \u201cphysician appointed * * * by the municipality * * * certify that such injured * * * fireman * * * is physically able to perform his regular duties\u201d (see <em>King v City of Newburgh, </em>84 AD2d 388, 393).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b458-9\">. By reason of the severance, the judgment is final notwithstanding that the medical expense question remains to be litigated (see Cohen and Karger, Powers of the New York Court of Appeals [rev ed], \u00a7 21).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b461-7\"><em>. </em>Normal retirement age for involuntary retirement is 70 (Retirement and Social Security Law, \u00a7\u00a7 70, 370) except as to those who by voluntarily electing the additional benefits provided by section 384 of the Retirement and Social Security Law subject themselves to involuntary separation from service at age 62 (Cook <em>v City of Binghamton, </em>48 NY2d 323, 333, <em>supra).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
