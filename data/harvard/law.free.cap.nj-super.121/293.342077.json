The pertinent facts are set forth in the reported opinion of the trial judge (115 <em>N. J. Super. </em>555 (Law Div. 1971)), who denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for new trial. Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">We perceive no reversible error in the trial judge\u2019s action in recessing the jury\u2019s deliberations overnight. - He took this action about 5 p.m. when the jury had returned for further instructions after three hours deliberation. We consider that he acted intelligently and practically in view of the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>stances confronting him after considering the applicable legal principles. We note that he carefully admonished the jury as to its responsibilities. His action was well within the discretion imposed upon him. We affirm essentially for the reasons expressed in Judge Kimmelman\u2019s written opinion. We observe also that after the trial court\u2019s decision was rendered the rules of court were amended to adopt the procedure followed in this case. <em>R. </em>1:8-6 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 additional argument that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence also lacks merit. Clearly a fact issue was presented which required resolution by a jury. The evidence in the record justified the jury\u2019s determination and the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">We have examined the other points urged for reversal and find them to be without substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
