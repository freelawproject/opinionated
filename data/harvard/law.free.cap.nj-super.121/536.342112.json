J. Super. </em>136 (Ch. Div. 1972), that the application for intervention was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"> The application for intervention was made not only after final judgment was entered following a lengthy trial, but also after the time to appeal from the judgment had expired. Intervention after final judgment, let alone after the time to appeal therefrom has expired, is unusual and not often granted. 3B <em>Moore\u2019s Federal </em>Practice, \u00b6 24.13 [1] at 526 (1969). \u201cOne seeking to intervene after final judgment must meet an especially heavy burden.\u201d 59 <em>Am.

There is no justification for authorizing, at this late date, relitigation of a case which has already been tried and decided and whose only effect, as against whatever rights appellants may have, would be by way of <em>stare decisis </em>rather than by way of <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
