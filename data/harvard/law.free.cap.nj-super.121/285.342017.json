J. S. A. </em>2A:34-2(d). Defendant did not contest the divorce but counterclaimed for an equitable distribution of real property owned by plaintiff. The court granted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>divorce but denied relief sought by the counterclaim with the exception of $161.79 paid by defendant for taxes on plaintiffs property during 1947 and 1948. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The parties were married on September 12, 1926. They have been separated since Eebruary 1947 when plaintiff brought an unsuccessful suit for divorce on the ground of extreme cruelty. The only issue of substance raised on this appeal is whether the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s claim for an equitable distribution of plaintiff\u2019s property pursuant to the provisions of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:34-23. The property consists of a two-family house in which plaintiff resides and an adjoining tract of land located in Berkeley Heights.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The evidence presented in this case shows that plaintiff\u2019s mother purchased the two-family house in 1941 for $2,400 and gave it to plaintiff as a gift. The court disbelieved defendant\u2019s testimony that he gave plaintiff $2,000 to pay for the house. The property having been secured by plaintiff as a gift was not property <em>acquired </em>during marriage which would be subject to equitable distribution as a marital asset following a divorce within contemplation of the statute. <em>Painter v. Painter, </em>118 <em>N. J. Super. </em>332, 336 (Ch. Div. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The adjoining tract of land was purchased by plaintiff in 1945, over defendant\u2019s objections, for $1,000 which she borrowed from her mother and subsequently repaid from her earnings. Plaintiff has lived alone in the house since about 1950. She has supported herself and paid all expenses for the upkeep and taxes on both properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">We are in full accord with the trial court\u2019s decision that defendant is not equitably entitled to any interest in either of plaintiff\u2019s properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
