J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A5y\">Plaintiffs Lynn Cieswiek <em>et al., </em>proposed intervenors (herein intervenors), appeal from an order of the Law Division dated June 13, 1972 denying their motion to intervene in the matter of the <em>Allan-Deane Corporation v. Bedminster, Tp. et al., </em>an in lieu of prerogative writ proceeding commenced August 23, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Plaintiffs on June 1, 1972 instituted a separate action against the Township of Bedminster <em>ei al. </em>A motion to consolidate that proceeding with the Allan-Deane suit was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">On the same day (June 29, 1972) that the intervenors filed with this court a notice of appeal on the theory that their intervention should be deemed a matter of right, they also filed a motion for leave to appeal from the trial court\u2019s denials of intervention and consolidation to the <em>extent </em>that such orders might be considered interlocutory.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">The application for leave to appeal was denied by a summer panel of the Appellate Division on August 11, 1972 and its determination has not been disturbed. The trial court thereupon scheduled the <em>Allan-Deane v. Bedminster </em>case for trial on November 6, 1972. At this juncture we note that trial was originally scheduled to commence June 21, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">On October 25, 1972 there was submitted to this court a motion by intervenors for a stay of the November 6 trial pending disposition of their outstanding notice of appeal which was filed allegedly as of right. By order of October 27, 1972 we elected to consider the merits of the appeal and to decide it simultaneously with the motion for stay; the trial was stayed temporarily pending further order of this court. We accelerated the appeal and required the record and briefs to be filed by October 30, 1972 (which under the rules were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>due by that date) and scheduled oral argument for November 6, 1972. The trial court thereupon rescheduled the trial for November 27, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The record reveals that the trial judge, in the exercise of his judicial discretion, determined in essence that the interests of the intervenors would not be impeded or adversely affected by the outcome of the <em>Allan-Deane v. Bedminster </em>litigation; that permitting the intervention and consolidation sought by intervenors would unduly delay, interfere with and prejudice the rights of the parties in the original controversy, and that the issues in the two separate actions were not so parallel as to warrant intervention and consolidation. This court, as previously noted, denied leave to appeal from those determinations to the extent that they were interlocutory.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The single issue now before us is whether intervenors may as a matter of right intervene in the <em>Allan-Deane v. Bedminster </em>suit. It is conceded by intervenors that if such right exists, a further delay of the trial would be necessary in order to permit their anticipated pretrial discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">It appears that there are approximately 13,000 undeveloped acres in the Township of Bedminster and that the Allan-Deane Corporation is the owner of 467 acres, most of which are zoned for single-family homes on five-acre plots. The developer proposed to construct on its lands single-family homes on one-acre parcels of land, town houses, multifamily dwellings, an office-research complex, a motel and a golf course. By its complaint certain provisions of the township zoning ordinance are challenged as unreasonable and exclusionary, and the landowner sought to compel the municipal defendants to consider zoning changes that would permit the use of its property for the purposes proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Over nine months after the commencement of that suit the intervenors\u2019 complaint for injunctive relief was filed by several individuals, who are nonresidents of Bedminster Township, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated. The first paragraph of their complaint states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>The Township of Bedminster, New Jersey (hereinafter \u201cBedminster\u201d or \u201cthe Township\u201d) is an exclusive, virtually all-white community of predominantly middle and upper-income persons in Somerset County. Through its zoning laws and related Master Plan, housing policies and practices (hereinafter sometimes referred to as \u201cexclusionary zoning\u201d), Bedminster excludes black and Spanish-speaking people, blue-collar workers, young married couples, other young adults, the elderly and other persons of low and moderate income (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the \u201cexcluded class\u201d) from living therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">they further alleged that their suit was instituted as a class action, for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">(a) a declaratory judgment that Bedminster\u2019s exclusionary zoning is in violation of the Constitutions and certain statutes of the United States and the State of New Jersey; (b) an injunction prohibiting the Township from enforcing such exclusionary zoning, requiring it to enact inclusionary zoning laws and Master Plan, and requiring it to adopt and implement an affirmative-action program to rectify past discrimination and exclusion; and (c) an injunction requiring AllanDeane, as part of its intended housing development project, to construct a significant amount of low and moderate-income housing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Intervention as of right must be made upon timely application by an applicant who claims \u201can interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action,\u201d and the claimant must be so situated \u201cthat the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede\u201d the ability of claimant to protect that interest. <em>R. </em>4:33-1. See <em>State v. Lanza, </em>39 <em>N. J. </em>595, 600 (1963), app. dism. 375 <em>U. S. </em>451, 84 S. Ct. 525, 11 L. Ed. 2d 477 (1964); <em>Grober v. Kahn, </em>88 <em>N. J. Super. </em>343, 361 (App. Div. 1965), mod. on other grounds 47 <em>N. J. </em>135 (1966); <em>Government Security Co. v. Waire, </em>94 <em>N. J. Super. </em>586, 588-589 (App. Div.), certif. den. 50 <em>N. J. </em>84 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Plaintiff Allan-Deane\u2019s attack upon the local zoning ordinance is directed toward remedial relief to permit the use of its property for specific purposes. It is entitled to an expeditious disposition of the issues raised without the attendant delays and foreseeable complexities that would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>superimposed upon its controversy by intervenors\u2019 broad challenges against the zoning policies of the municipality with respect to all of the undeveloped lands within its boundary. Moreover, the outcome of the Allan-Deane litigation with respect to its relatively small acreage would not have a substantially adverse effect upon the broader issues and the objectives projected by intervenors\u2019 belated action.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">There is considerable doubt as to whether intervenors have an interest in \u201cthe property or transaction which is the subject of the action,\u201d or that they acted with timeliness, as contemplated by <em>R. </em>4:33-1. That aside, however, the findings and conclusions of the trial judge are supported by the record. We are satisfied that intervenors have not demonstrated that they are entitled to intervention as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Accordingly, the instant appeal is dismissed without prejudice, however, to intervenors making a timely application to the trial court to appear <em>amicus curiae </em>in the AllanDeane suit for the purpose of filing a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">By order of this court on November 8, 1972 we vacated our temporary stay of the trial to the end that the trial may proceed as presently scheduled on November 27, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
