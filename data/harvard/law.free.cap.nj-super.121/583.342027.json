J. Super. </em>39 (Ch. Div. 1971), we affirm his judgment denying Belford\u2019s motion to set aside service of process and to dismiss plaintiff's declaratory judgment suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">We are left with the sole issue as to whether plaintiff Carolina Casualty Insurance Company, or defendant Belford Trucking Company, Inc., should be required to pay for the injuries sustained by Clarence P. Young and Carl Heilman, and the expenses incurred by plaintiff in defending defendants James T. Neighbors and James G. Mitchell. The reasonableness of the settlement made by plaintiff with Young and Heilman for $4,000, and the expenses it incurred in connection with defending the suit in the sum of $1,580.30, have not been questioned by Belford.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">We are in accord with the views expressed by Judge Wick that under the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 315, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, Belford, a certificated interstate carrier, became the primary insurer of the tractor and trailer leased to it by Neighbors, and that plaintiff's policy qualified as excess coverage only. <em>Hagans v. Glens Falls Ins. Co., </em>465 <em>F. </em>2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>1249 (10 Cir. 1972); <em>Cox v. Bond Transportation, Inc., </em>53 <em>N.

This is particularly true where, as here, Belford is self-insured and no policy of insurance is before us for construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
