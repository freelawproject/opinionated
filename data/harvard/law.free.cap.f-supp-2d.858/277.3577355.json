SCHEINDLIN, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b318-16\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b318-17\">This putative class action, alleging federal securities claims, is part of a larger multi-district litigation. It arises out of a number of transactions through which Gerova Financial Group, Ltd., (\u201cGerova\u201d) acquired Allied Provident Insurance Company, Ltd. (\u201cAllied Provident\u201d), the funds managed by Stillwater Capital Partners, LLC and Stillwater Capital Partners, Inc. (\u201cSCP\u201d or the \u201cStillwater funds\u201d), and the Wimbledon Funds. Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint alleges, inter alia, violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder (Counts I and III); and violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act (Counts II and TV). Defendants now move to dismiss all claims. For the following reasons: (1) Counts I and II as they pertain to Bianco are dismissed; (2) Counts III and IV are dismissed; and (3) Counts I and II as to Gerova, Hirst, Hlavsa, van Roon, and Laslop may proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>II. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">A. Plaintiffs</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The proposed class consists of \u201call persons who purchased or otherwise acquired Gerova securities from January 8, 2010 through and including February 23, 2011.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">B. Defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">There are ten named defendants in this action. Gerova was incorporated and had its principal executive offices in Bermuda as of August 30, 2010.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Gary Hirst was a founding sponsor of Gerova and was appointed its president in October 2007.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He was Chairman of Gerova\u2019s Board of Directors from April 13, 2010 until he resigned in February 2011 and owned Gerova shares both directly and through Allius, Ltd. \u2014 one of the initial sponsors of Gerova.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Arie Jan van Roon was a founding member of Gerova\u2019s board until February 2011 and allegedly \u201cowns or owned Gerova shares both directly and through Allius, Noble Investment Fund Limited, and Ho Capital Management LLC.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Michael Hlavsa served as Chief Financial Officer (\u201cCFO\u201d) of Gerova since the company\u2019s inception until at least February 2011.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Joseph J. Bianco was Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of Gerova from June 2010 until he resigned in February 2011.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Keith Laslop was a Gerova director from May 2008 until his resignation on February 10, 2011. He also served as Gerova\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (\u201cCOO\u201d) from June 2010 until at least February 2011.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege Count I (violation of Section ' 10(b)) against each of these defendants and Count II (violation of Section 20(a)) against the individual Gerova defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-19\">SCP, Inc. is a New York corporation that acts as investment manager for the Stillwater Funds.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> SCP, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company that manages the business affairs of the Stillwater Funds.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Jack Doueck was a principal of SCP, a Gerova director, and served on a three-person committee managing the Stillwater Funds after they were acquired by Gerova.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Richard Rudy is a principal of SCP and sits on the same committee as Doueck.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege Count III (violation of Section 10(b)) against each of these defendants and Count IV (violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>of Section 20(a)) against the individual SCP defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">C. Gerova\u2019s Formation and the January 2010 Transactions</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Gerova was formed as a blank check company in March 2007 under the name Asia Special Situation Acquisition Corp.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Noble Investment Fund Ltd. and Allius Ltd., which were both owned and controlled by van Roon and Hirst, were Gerova\u2019s sponsors.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Through its January 2008 IPO Gerova raised $155 million, and under the terms of its governing documents it was to use the IPO proceeds to acquire an operating entity within two years or it would face liquidation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">As of November 2009 Gerova had not succeeded in acquiring an operating entity,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> but in December 2009 it began merger negotiations with SCP, \u201ca family of hedge funds\u201d that held illiquid assets.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Gerova negotiated a deal in which it acquired the Stillwater funds; an 81.5% interest in Amalphis Group Inc. (\u201cAmalphis\u201d) the parent company of Allied Provident; and the assets and investments held by the Wimbledon Funds.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Plaintiffs claim that the counterparties to the Amalphis and Wimbledon transactions \u2014 Rineon Group, Inc. (\u201cRineon\u201d) and Weston respectively \u2014 were managed by Gerova insiders and that the related-party nature of these transactions was not disclosed in the proxy statement issued in conjunction with the January 2010 transactions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In exchange for the interest in and assets of SCP, Amalphis, and Wimbledon, Gerova issued \u201crestricted, preferred stock that [Gerova] anticipated later converting into ordinary shares.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-15\">D. Allegedly False and Misleading Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b320-16\">Plaintiffs allege that the SCP assets were overvalued \u201cpremised on highly questionable assumptions\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and that \u201cthe $541.25 million valuation assigned to the Stillwater assets contradicted a substantially lower valuation by Stillwater ... just weeks earlier.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also allege that the proxy statement did not disclose the distressed nature of the SCP Funds or that SCP was unable \u201cto honor its investors\u2019 redemption requests.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> However, Gerova notes that the proxy statement did state that SCP\u2019s assets were \u201cdistressed and illiquid.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Plaintiffs argue that the extent of the company\u2019s distress, including the amount owed in redemption requests was not properly disclosed.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Although the proxy statement mentioned the Amalphis and Wimbledon acquisitions, plaintiffs claim that they were \u201crelated party transaction^] with an entity secretly controlled by Gerova insiders\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and that the related-party nature of the transactions was not disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Plaintiffs claim that the Amalphis transaction was a related-party transaction because the party from which Gerova acquired Amalphis was Rineon, \u201can inactive publicly traded Delaware corporation.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege that Gerova director de Waal and Gerova CFO Hlavsa were two of Rineon\u2019s five directors, and that, after the January 2010 transactions, Hlavsa was Rineon\u2019s sole director until late 2010.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Additionally, Rineon was acquired by the investment fund Intigy Absolute Return (\u201cIntigy\u201d),<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> which was managed by Axiat, Inc. of which Hirst is president and CEO.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also allege that Hirst made a profit of twenty-one million dollars by selling Amalphis to Gerova just six months after he, through Intigy, had purchased it.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> None of these relationships were disclosed in the proxy statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Plaintiffs claim that the Wimbledon transaction was a related-party transaction because Gerova acquired it from Weston, which was owned by Fund.com.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Gerova director van Roon held 59.34% of Fund. corn\u2019s voting shares through his ownership of Equities Media Acquisition Corp.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Furthermore, Hlavsa, Gerova\u2019s CFO, was a director and CFO of Fund.com at the time of the January 2010 transactions.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also claim that Bianco was both CEO of Gerova and Chairman of Fund.com\u2019s Board of Directors, and that Laslop was a director of both companies as well.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> As part of the Wimbledon acquisition, Gerova agreed to pay Weston a fee to manage the Wimbledon funds, but the amount of that fee was not disclosed<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">Since the January 2010 transactions, Rineon has ceased all operations and terminated its obligation to report.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Between June and December 2010, Fund.com lost 98% of its market capitalization and announced that its financial statements for fiscal years 2007-2009 were unreliable.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">E. Gerova\u2019s Collapse</p>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">The January 2010 transactions triggered the original Gerova IPO investors\u2019 right to demand return of the capital they had invested, which approximately 97.4% of them did.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> This resulted in the \u201creturn of $112.4 million of the $115 million raised in the IPO.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Gerova claims that \u201cthe loss of nearly all of its investment capital placed [it] in a more difficult liquidity position immediately following [the January 2010 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>transactions] than it could have anticipated.\u201d <footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Following the January 2010 transactions, Gerova\u2019s \u201cpublic float\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> consisted of 300,000 IPO shares and Gerova received a de-listing notice from the New York Stock Exchange-Amex Exchange for failure to comply with the minimum shareholder requirement.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In April 2010, Gerova shareholders approved conversion of the preferred shares issued as part of the January 2010 transactions into ordinary shares.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Gerova\u2019s share price increased from $7.42 on May 3 to $15.96 on May 18 and share trading volume increased from 3,231 shares per day in April to 167, 132 shares per day in June.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege that this trading volume \u201cfar exceeded] the plausible volume based on the outstanding float of 300,000 shares.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Gerova\u2019s SEC filings confirmed that approximately 11.5 million additional shares had entered the market since January 2010.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Because the ordinary shares created through the conversion were unregistered, and Gerova made no additional public offering, plaintiffs assert that the increase in share volume can only be explained as \u201cprivate stock issuanees authorized by Company insiders, or the removal of restrictions on previously\u2014 issued insider shares.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AH7\">Gerova\u2019s January 2010 income statement represented that it had approximately $1.5 billion in assets, \u201cincluding cash and equivalents of $104 million,\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> even though plaintiffs allege that Gerova was \u201ccash flow insolvent\u201d from the time of the January 2010 transactions<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> and was unable to meet its operating expenses.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> However, Gerova contends that it did not experience illiquidity until after the January 2010 transactions, when the redeeming investors were paid out in cash.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Gerova made investor presentations in both January 2010 and May 2010, which \u201cmade nearly identical representations\u201d regarding the acquisitions, except the valuation of the Stillwater funds was adjusted from $541 million to $535 million,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Doueck testified in a separate action that \u201cGerova ... did not have cash available to pay the [insurance] premiums\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> and on June 7, 2011 a Bermuda newspaper reported that Gerova was \u201cserved notice for the termination of its lease after failing to pay $49,083.40 in rent and service charges.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Additionally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Gerova \u201cdisclosed that it was suffering from capital constraints\u201d in its June 2010 Form 20-F/A.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">On May 26, 2010, Gerova transferred its real estate assets to Net Five in exchange for a minority interest in the venture.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Plaintiffs claim that two of the Net Five managers had prior involvement in investment frauds: Robert Willison \u201chandled investor relations for Westmoore Capital ... a Ponzi scheme halted ... by the SEC,\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> and Jason Galanis was the subject of an enforcement action by the SEC.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">After the publication of the \u201cDalrymple Report\u201d by a short-seller firm on January 10, 2011, which \u201cdetailed an array of related party transactions, ... insiders\u2019 relationships ..., and questioned the valuation of Gerova\u2019s assets,\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> the price of Gerova shares fell from $28.04/share to a low of $5.28/share on February 23, 2011.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> On February 23, 2011, the New York Stock Exchange ceased trading of Gerova stock, and Gerova securities were de-listed on April 18, 2011.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Gerova terminated its stock registration on June 15, 2011,<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> As of October 25, 2011, Gerova\u2019s share price was $0.08 and Gerova shares were traded \u201cover-the-counter.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-15\">Between January 2010 and February 15, 2011, Gerova experienced high management turnover, including various CEOs, managing directors, and presidents during that time.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Plaintiffs claim that they were induced to purchase and retain Gerova shares due to the foregoing misstatements and omissions in the proxy statement and investor presentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-16\">III. LEGAL STANDARD \u2014 MOTION TO DISMISS</p>\n<p id=\"b323-18\">In deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the court \u201caccept[s] all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and draw[s] all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The court evaluates the sufficiency of the complaint under the \u201ctwo-pronged approach\u201d advocated by the Supreme Court in <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal.</em><footnotemark><em>68</em></footnotemark><em> First, </em>\u201c[a] court \u2018can choose to begin by identifying pleadings that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> \u201cThreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice\u201d to withstand a motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> <em>Second, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u201c[w]hen there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement for relief.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the allegations in the complaint must meet a standard of \u201cplausibility.\u201d <footnotemark>72</footnotemark> A claim is facially plausible \u201cwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Plausibility \u201cis not akin to a probability requirement;\u201d rather, plausibility requires \u201cmore than a sheer possibility that a' defendant has acted unlawfully.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u201cIn considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a district court may consider the facts alleged in the complaint, documents attached to the complaint as exhibits, and documents incorporated by reference in the complaint.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> However, the court may also consider a document that is not incorporated by reference, \u201cwhere the complaint \u2018relies heavily upon its terms and effect,\u2019 thereby rendering the document \u2018integral\u2019 to the complaint.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> The court may also consider \u201clegally required public disclosure documents filed with the SEC.\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">IV. APPLICABLE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">A. Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act</p>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 makes it illegal to \u201cuse or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security ... any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe....\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> Under Rule 10b-5 one may not \u201cmake any untrue statement of a material fact or [] omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading ... in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> \u201cTo sustain a private claim for securities fraud under Section 10(b), \u2018a plaintiff must prove (1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>1. Misstatements or Omissions of Material Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">In order to satisfactorily allege misstatements or omissions of material fact, a complaint must \u201cstate with particularity the specific facts in support of [plaintiffs\u2019] belief that [defendants\u2019] statements were false when made.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> \u201cFor the purposes of Rule 10b-5, the maker of a statement is the person or entity with ultimate authority over the statement, including its content and whether and how to communicate it.\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> \u201c[Attribution within a statement or implicit from surrounding circumstances is strong evidence\u201d of who made the statement.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u201c \u2018[A] fact is to be considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable person would consider it important in deciding whether to buy or sell shares [of stock].\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> In situations \u201c[w]here plaintiffs contend defendants had access to contrary facts, they must specifically identify the reports or statements containing this information.\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> Mere, \u201callegations that defendants should have anticipated future events and made certain disclosures earlier than they actually did[,] do not suffice to make out a claim of securities fraud.\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> \u201c[A]n omission is actionable when the failure to disclose renders a statement misleading.\u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-18\">2. Scienter</p>\n<p id=\"b325-19\">A plaintiff may plead scienter by \u201calleging facts (1) showing that the defendants had both motive and opportunity to commit the fraud or (2) constituting strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> \u201cSufficient motive allegations \u2018entail concrete benefits that could be realized by one or more of the false statements and wrongful nondisclosures alleged.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> \u201cMotives that are generally possessed by most corporate directors and officers do not suffice; instead, plaintiffs must assert a concrete and personal benefit to the individual defendants resulting from the fraud.\u201d<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-20\">\u2018\u201cWhere motive is not apparent, it is still possible to plead scienter by identifying circumstances indicating conscious behavior by the defendant, though the strength of the circumstantial allegations must be correspondingly greater.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>der this theory of scienter, a plaintiff must show that the defendant\u2019s conduct is \u201cat the least ... highly unreasonable and [ ] represents an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.\u201d<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> \u201cTo state a claim based on recklessness, plaintiffs may either specifically allege defendants\u2019 knowledge of facts or access to information contradicting defendants\u2019 public statements, or allege that defendants failed to check information they had a duty to monitor.\u201d <footnotemark>93</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">3. Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">A securities fraud plaintiff is required to \u201cprove both transaction causation (also known as reliance) and loss causation,\u201d <footnotemark>94</footnotemark> Loss causation is \u201cthe proximate causal link between the alleged misconduct and the plaintiffs economic harm.\u201d<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> \u201cA misrepresentation is \u2018the proximate cause of an investment loss if the risk that caused the loss was within the zone of risk <em>concealed </em>by the misrepresentations ....\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> Therefore, \u201cto plead loss causation, the complaint [] must allege facts that support an inference that [defendant\u2019s] misstatements and omissions concealed the circumstances that bear upon the loss suffered such that plaintiffs would have been spared all or an ascertainable portion of that loss absent the fraud.\u201d<footnotemark>97</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">B. Control Person Liability Under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act</p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">\u201cTo establish a prima facie case of control person liability, a plaintiff must show (1) a primary violation by the controlled person, (2) control of the primary violator by the defendant, and (3) that the defendant was, in some meaningful sense, a culpable participant in the controlled person\u2019s fraud.\u201d<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> \u201cAllegations of control are not averments of fraud and therefore need not be pleaded with particularity.\u201d<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> \u201cThus, \u2018[a]t the pleading stage, the extent to which the control must be alleged will be governed by Rule 8\u2019s pleading standard \u201d\u2019<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> \u201cwhile a party cannot be held liable for both a primary violation and as a control person, alternative theories of liability are permissible at the pleading stage.\u201d <footnotemark>101</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>y. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">A. Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act</p>\n<p id=\"ABP\">1. Gerova and Gerova Officers\u2019 Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The proxy statement at issue was sent by Gerova to the plaintiffs in order to obtain their approval of the January 2010 transactions and was signed by Hirst.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege that the proxy statement failed to disclose the related-party nature of the Amalphis and Wimbledon transactions,<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> which were part of the January 2010 transactions. Plaintiffs also claim that Gerova misstated its own financial health and that of SCP in the proxy statement and in various financial statements.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Gerova and Hirst contend that some of the complained of omissions had already been disclosed in Gerova\u2019s various public disclosures.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> However this in and of itself \u201cwould not preclude a finding by a trier of fact that [the information was] disclosed to investors in a materially misleading way.\u201d <footnotemark>106</footnotemark> Such \u201cscattered disclosures\u201d are not sufficient for defendants to prevail at the motion to dismiss stage.<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> \u201cThe mere fact that a company has filed with a regulatory agency documents containing factual information material to a proposal as to which proxies are sought plainly does not mean that the company has made adequate disclosure to shareholders.\u201d <footnotemark>108</footnotemark> The allegations of incomplete disclosures \u2014 such as Gerova\u2019s failure to disclose the potential exit of the IPO investors \u2014 satisfy the pleading requirements for material omissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-16\">Gerova also argues that certain omissions were not material, including the related-party nature of the transactions. However, these omissions may have mislead investors regarding the actual demand for Gerova shares as well as the risk involved in the January 2010 transactions and the potential liabilities, thus misstating Gerova\u2019s \u201ctrue financial picture.\u201d<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> These omissions are not so obviously unimportant that their materiality can be successfully challenged at the pleading stage.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-17\">Gerova officers Hirst, Hlavsa, and Bianco argue that they are not liable under Section 10(b) because none of the alleged misstatements or omissions were attributed to them.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> However, Hirst signed \u201ceach of the key SEC filings implicated in the Complaint\u201d<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> and the proxy statement itself.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> <em>Janus, </em>which involved two separate entities and whether state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>ments of one could be attributed to the other,<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> cannot be used to shield Hirst, who signed the documents at issue and thereby \u201cmade\u201d the alleged misstatements. In response to an earlier motion in a related case, I decided the issue of attribution on the grounds that Gerova was a special purpose acquisition company, with \u201cno operations and only a few employees\u201d and that its sole business purpose was the acquisition of other companies.<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> Construing the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs and resolving all doubt in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, these are \u201cadequate surrounding circumstances\u201d from which a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the statements in the proxy statement were \u201cmade\u201d by officers Hirst and Hlavsa.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> Bianco, though, did not become a Gerova officer until June 2010, six months after the proxy statement was sent to shareholders;<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> this fact precludes a finding that the statements in the proxy statement and the January and May 2010 financial statements were made by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Gerova contends that plaintiffs failed to plead scienter sufficiently. Plaintiffs, in turn, point to Gerova\u2019s strong desire to effectuate the January 2010 transactions because it needed to acquire a company or it would be forced to liquidate. Additionally, plaintiffs claim that Gerova was in a dire financial situation, even though Gerova contends that this did not occur until after the January 2010 transactions, when the majority of IPO investors redeemed their investments for cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">The desire to avoid impending liquidation was also a motivating factor for the Gerova officers. The Amended Complaint pleads these additional facts as the basis for plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of the Gerova officers\u2019 scienter: (1) the resignations and deferred appointments of seven officers and directors and the replacement of Gerova\u2019s entire board of directors except Hirst;<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> (2) the alleged personal profits by Gerova insiders from the related-party transactions;<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> and (3) Gerova\u2019s transfer of all real estate assets to Net Five in exchange for a minority interest in the joint venture.<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, taken as true, sufficiently plead that the conduct of the Gerova\u2019s officers was \u201chighly unreasonable\u201d and \u201can extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care....\u201d<footnotemark>121</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">Because Gerova does not argue a lack of reliance, the only element left for plaintiffs to establish is loss causation. Plaintiffs assert that loss causation is shown by the fact that once the Dalrymple Report was released \u2014 which contained allegations of the same relatedness and management fees that plaintiffs complain of as having been omitted from the proxy statement<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> \u2014Gerova\u2019s ordinary shares fell 6.4%.<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> The shares dropped an additional \u201c19.4% ... after Gerova announced it hired a firm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>to respond to the Dalrymple report,\u201d \u201c40.8% after announcements regarding executive resignations,\u201d and 31.3% after a prospective president and chairman of the Board of Directors withdrew his name from consideration.<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> These allegations satisfy the Second Circuit\u2019s rule for pleading loss causation \u2014 plaintiffs can show loss causation by showing \u201c \u2018that the defendants\u2019 misrepresentations induced a disparity between the transaction price and the true investment quality of the securities at the time of the transaction.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>125</footnotemark> For the foregoing reasons, the motions by Gerova, Hirst, and Hlavsa to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 Section 10(b) claims are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">2. SCP and SCP Principals\u2019 Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim against SCP hinges on the fact that the $541.25 million valuation attributed to the Stillwater Funds was provided by the Stillwater Defendants to Gerova.<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> Even assuming, arguendo, that the unaudited pro forma financial statements including the $541.25 million valuation were \u201cmade\u201d by SCP, they do not violate Section 10(b). The valuation is surrounded by warnings that the amount was \u201csubject to a post closing adjustment\u201d and was \u201csubject to further management review and may change materially between the preliminary valuation date and the closing date\u201d of the January 2010 transactions.<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> Taken in context, these warnings, which occurred throughout the proxy statement and in close proximity to the SCP asset valuation, would not have misled a reasonable investor.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> Because the plaintiffs do not, and cannot, argue that SCP was responsible for the remaining alleged omissions and misstatements in the Gerova proxy statement and financial statements, Count III must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">B. Control Person Liability Under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">Plaintiffs assert control person liability claims under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the individual defendants: Hirst, van Roon, Hlavsa, Bianco, and Laslop (Count II), and Doueck and Rudy (Count IV). \u201cWhile a party cannot be held liable for both a primary violation and as a control person, alternative theories of liability are permissible at the pleading stage.\u201d<footnotemark>129</footnotemark> Because a primary Section 10(b) violation has not been established against SCP, the Section 20(a) claim against Doueck and Rudy necessarily fails. However, as demonstrated above, a primary Section 10(b) violation has been pled against Gerova, which satisfies the first prong of Section 20(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">The parties agree that Bianco did not assume the role of Gerova CEO until June 2010, after the alleged misstatements and omissions.<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> Without more, the 20(a) control person liability claim against him must fail. All other Gerova defendants merely contend that the 20(a) claims against them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>must be dismissed based on plaintiffs\u2019 failure to sufficiently allege a primary violation. Because the 10(b) claim survives against Hirst, Hlavsa, van Roon, and Laslop, the 20(a) claim against them also survives.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">For the foregoing reasons, Counts I and II as they relate to Bianco, Count III, and Count IV are dismissed. All other counts remain. The Clerk of the Court is directed to close these motions [Docket Nos. 54, 57, 60],</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-8\">.
