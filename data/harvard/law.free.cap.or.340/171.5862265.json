The proposed measure, if adopted, would require Oregon corporations to include in their calculation of Oregon taxable income certain income that can be excluded when calculating federal taxable income and would disallow certain deductions that are permitted when calculating federal taxable income. Petitioners are electors who timely submitted written comments to the Secretary of State concerning the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title and who are entitled, therefore, to seek review of the resulting certified ballot title in this court. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(2) (stating that requirement). We review the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title to determine whether it substantially complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2). ORS 250.085(5). For the reasons that follow, we conclude that it does not, and we refer the ballot title to the Attorney General for modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The proposed measure is set out in its entirety in the Appendix, and we briefly describe its substantive provisions here. The proposed measure would require a corporation to include in its calculation of Oregon taxable income certain income that federal law authorizes to be excluded when calculating federal taxable income. Current Oregon corporate taxation mirrors federal corporate income taxation, because the legislature has chosen to adopt by reference \u201c[t]hose portions of the Internal Revenue Code, and any other laws of the United States pertaining to the determination of taxable income of corporate taxpayers[.]\u201d ORS 317.013(1). In doing so, the legislature intended \u201c[t]o make the Oregon corporate excise tax law, insofar as it relates to the measurement of taxable income, identical to the provisions of the federal Internal Revenue Code * * * to the end that taxable income of a corporation for Oregon purposes is the same as it is for federal income tax\u2019purposes, * * * subject to the additions, subtractions, adjustments and modifications contained in * * * [ORS] chapter [317].\u201d ORS 317.018(1). The proposed measure would add further modifications to those already listed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>chapter 317, such that certain deductions or exclusions allowed in the Internal Revenue Code could not be permitted when calculating Oregon corporate taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The Attorney General certified the following ballot title:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">\u201cSTATE INCOME CALCULATION MUST INCLUDE CERTAIN INCOME THAT WAS EXCLUDED AND DEDUCTED UNDER FEDERAL LAW</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">\u201cRESULT OF YES\u2019 VOTE: Yes\u2019 vote increases Oregon taxable income by adding back amount of certain deductions or exclusions from federal gross income allowed under the Internal Revenue Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">\u201cRESULT OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 vote rejects increasing Oregon taxable income by adding back amounts of certain deductions or exclusions from federal gross income under the Internal Revenue Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-9\">\u201cSUMMARY: Under current law, Oregon taxable income for individuals and corporations is the federal taxable income, subject to additions, subtractions, and adjustments as provided in Oregon law. Measure increases Oregon taxable income by adding back the amount of certain deductions from federal gross income allowed under the Internal Revenue Code, including amounts deducted from foreign based company income and from income sourced within and without the United States. Measure requires adding back the amount earned as foreign company income subject to high foreign tax, earned as certain financing and banking income as defined in the Internal Revenue Code section 954, and earned on income sourced within and without the United States. Measure is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2007. Other provisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">Petitioners challenge each part of the certified ballot title.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">Petitioner Mathews argues that the Attorney General erred by drafting a caption that \u201cis dependent on [an] inference [,]\u201d by using confusing words and phrases in the result statements, and by failing to list all the deductions that the proposed measure would eliminate in the summary. We have considered those arguments, but do not deem them to require discussion. None is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Petitioners Burgin and Coughlin argue primarily that the Attorney General erred by failing to specify in the caption that the proposed measure concerned taxes and that the Attorney General erred by stating that the proposed measure would affect the calculation of some individuals\u2019 taxable incomes. For the reasons that follow, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">ORS 250.035(2)(a) requires that the caption of a ballot title contain a statement of not more than 15 words \u201cthat reasonably identifies the subject matter of the state measure.\u201d The caption is the \u201ccornerstone for the other portions of the ballot title\u201d and must identify the subject matter of the proposed measure in terms that will not \u201cconfuse or mislead potential petition signers and voters.\u201d <em>Mabon v. Myers, </em>332 Or 633, 637, 33 P3d 988 (2001). Additionally, the caption must not \u201cunderstate or overstate the scope of the legal changes that the proposed measure would enact.\u201d <em>Kain/Waller v. Myers, </em>337 Or 36, 40, 93 P3d 62 (2004).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">\u201cTo determine the subject matter of a proposed measure, we first examine its words and the changes, if any, that the proposed measure would enact in the context of existing law. We then examine the words of the caption to determine whether they reasonably identify the proposed measure\u2019s subject matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 41. If a proposed measure contains more than one subject, \u201cthe caption must identify each subject or, alternatively, use other terms that more accurately convey the scope of the proposed measure.\u201d <em>Greenberg v. Myers, </em>340 Or 65, 69, 127 P3d 1192 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Petitioners Burgin and Coughlin argue that the caption fails to \u201creasonably identiffy] the subject matter\u201d of the proposed measure both because the caption makes no mention of taxes at all and, more specifically, because it fails to state that the proposed measure would alter only corporate tax calculations. The Attorney General responds that the proposed measure, in generally referring to five sections of the Internal Revenue Code, was drafted broadly enough that it might affect some individual taxpayers; thus, it would not be accurate to state that the proposed measure alters only corporate tax calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>The proposed measure seeks to eliminate certain tax deductions and exclusions; therefore, the general subject of the proposed measure is taxes. Failure to mention the general subject of the proposed measure shows that the caption does not \u201creasonably identifly] the subject matter\u201d of the proposed measure as required under ORS 250.035(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Furthermore, the proposed measure would amend only ORS chapter 317, which is known as \u201cthe Corporation Excise Tax Law of 1929.\u201d ORS 317.005. This court previously has stated that \u201cit is abundantly clear that the Excise Tax [imposed by chapter 317] is a franchise tax that taxes <em>corporations </em>for the privilege of pursuing business activities in the pursuit of gain within the state.\u201d <em>Pacific First Federal v. Dept. of Rev., </em>308 Or 332, 336, 779 P2d 1033 (1989) (emphasis added). Therefore, the proposed measure will not, as the Attorney General asserts, affect personal income taxpayers. Failure to specify that the proposed measure will alter only corporate tax calculations thus overstates the scope of the legal changes that the proposed measure would enact and could \u201cconfuse or mislead potential petition signers and voters.\u201d <em>Mabon, </em>332 Or at 637. In short, the caption does not \u201creasonably identiffy] the subject matter\u201d of the proposed measure as required under ORS 250.035(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">ORS 250.035(2)(b) and (c) provide that the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d vote result statements of a ballot title must describe, in \u201csimple and understandable\u201d terms, the \u201cresult\u201d if the proposed measure is accepted or rejected. The Attorney General\u2019s \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d vote result statements, like the Attorney General\u2019s caption, fail to specify that the proposed measure would alter only corporate tax calculations and suffer from the same defects that we identified in the caption. Furthermore, as petitioners note, the \u201cno\u201d vote result statement simply attaches the word \u201crejects\u201d to the same summary of the proposed measure that appears in the \u201cyes\u201d vote result statement. Merely amending the \u201cyes\u201d vote result statement in this case with the word \u201crejects\u201d to create the \u201cno\u201d result statement does not \u201cadvance any voter\u2019s understanding of the choice that [the] proposed measure <em>represents.\u201d Nesbitt v. Myers, 335 Or 424, 432, </em>71 P3d 530 (2003). Such a practice is acceptable, however, if the Attorney General is \u201creasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>satisfied that he cannot compose other possible formulations of the \u2018no\u2019 vote result statement that will provide the voter with a greater amount of information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Attorney General asserts that such is the case here, but we are of the view that something further needs to be said, perhaps focusing on the nature of the present legal regime that a \u201cno\u201d vote would retain, to meet the minimal requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(c). Something should be said about corporations continuing to be liable for taxes in a manner consistent with present federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"> ORS 250.035(2)(d) requires that a ballot title summary be a \u201cconcise and impartial statement of not more than 125 words summarizing the state measure and its major effect.\u201d The purpose of the summary is to \u201chelp voters understand what will happen if the measure is approved.\u201d <em>Fred Meyer, Inc. v. Roberts, </em>308 Or 169, 175, 777 P2d 406 (1989). Petitioners Burgin and Coughlin argue that the Attorney General\u2019s summary fails to summarize the proposed measure and its major effects because it does not specify that the proposed measure concerns only corporate taxable income and because \u201cthe description of how the measure works is * * * unnecessarily complex!.]\u201d We agree that the Attorney General\u2019s summary fails to specify that the proposed measure would alter only corporate tax calculations; it therefore suffers from the same defects that we identified in the caption and in the result statements. However, we do not agree with petitioners argument that the summary is unnecessarily complex. The proposed measure deals with amendments to Oregon tax law, a subject that, by its very nature, is complex. The summary gives several examples of how the proposed measure would operate, if approved; those examples, although somewhat complex, \u201chelp voters understand what will happen if the measure is approved.\u201d <em>Fred Meyer, Inc., </em>308 Or at 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">In conclusion, we hold that the caption, the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d vote result statements, and the summary of the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title do not substantially comply with the requirements set out in ORS 250.035(2)(a), (b), (c), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>and (d). The ballot title must be referred to the Attorney General for modification. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(8) (authorizing that disposition).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Ballot title referred to Attorney General for modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">SECTION 1.
