Initiative Petition 150, if adopted, would amend the Oregon Constitution to impose certain restrictions on political campaign contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Petitioners are electors who timely submitted written comments to the Secretary of State concerning the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title and who therefore are entitled to seek review in this court of the resulting certified ballot title. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(2) (stating that requirement). We review the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title to determine whether it substantially complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(a) to (d). ORS 250.085(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">We have considered the various challenges to the certified ballot title that each petitioner advances. In our view, only one has merit. Petitioner Martin and petitioner Bendl both point out that the \u201cno\u201d vote result statement contains a typographical error. As certified by the Attorney General, that statement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">\u201cRESULT OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 vote retains Oregon constitutional prohibition on laws imposing <em>involuntarily </em>limitations on contributions to support or oppose candidates by any person or by any entity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Both petitioners assert that the emphasized word is erroneous, and that the correct word is \u201cinvoluntary.\u201d The Attorney General acknowledges the error and agrees that the word \u201cinvoluntary\u201d should be substituted for the incorrect word \u201cinvoluntarily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\"> We agree that, because of the use of the word \u201cinvoluntarily,\u201d the \u201cno\u201d vote result statement does not substantially comply with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(c). We therefore turn to the appropriate disposition of this proceeding. As this court recently explained in Straube/<em>McEvilly v. Myers, </em>340 Or 395, 399, 133 P3d 897 (2006), ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>250.085(8) gives this court statutory authority either to refer a ballot title that does not substantially comply with ORS 250.035 to the Attorney General for modification or \u201cto correct an errant ballot title and to certify the resulting ballot title to the Secretary of State * * *.\u201d As in <em>Straube, </em>the ballot title error that we have identified in this proceeding is only typographical. And, as in <em>Straube, </em>we conclude that this court should correct the error and certify the corrected ballot title to the Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">For those reasons, we certify the following ballot title for Initiative Petition 150 (2006) to the Secretary of State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">AMENDS CONSTITUTION: PROHIBITS CORPORATIONS, UNIONS FROM CONTRIBUTING \u201cTREASURY FUNDS\u201d (UNDEFINED) TO CANDIDATE CAMPAIGNS; CAPS INDIVIDUAL\u2019S YEARLY CONTRIBUTIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">RESULT OF \u2018YES\u201d VOTE: \u2018Yes\u201d vote amends constitution to prohibit corporate, union \u201ctreasury fund\u201d (undefined) contributions to political candidate campaigns; caps individual\u2019s yearly candidate committee contributions at $15,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote retains Oregon constitutional prohibition on laws imposing involuntary limitations on contributions to support or oppose candidates by any person or by any entity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">SUMMARY: Amends Constitution. Oregon Constitution currently prohibits laws that impose involuntary limitations on political campaign contributions by any person or by any entity. Measure prohibits corporations and labor organizations from contributing \u201ctreasury funds\u201d (undefined) to any candidate for nomination/election to a state or local public office or to any political committee supporting or opposing a candidate for state or local public office. Measure caps an individual\u2019s total contributions to all candidates and political committees supporting or opposing candidates for nomination/election for all state and local public offices to $15,000 per calendar year; cap does not apply to candidate\u2019s contributions to his or her own campaign. Measure requires Secretary of State to adjust individual contribution cap annually for changes in consumer prices. Other provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">Ballot title certified as modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
