L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15, that a zoning board of appeals file its decision \u201cwithin fourteen days.\u201d A judge of the Superior Court concluded that the provision requires that the board\u2019s decision be filed within fourteen days after the decision is made, but held that the board\u2019s failure to observe the requirement does not result in a constructive grant of the relief sought. Instead, the judge entered summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>for the board, on the ground that the applicant for the building permit failed to appeal to the Superior Court within twenty days after the board\u2019s filing of its decision, as required by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion, and now affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The case was submitted to the trial judge on a \u201cStipulation of Agreed Facts,\u201d which is summarized as follows. On June 7, 1982, Brian A. Zuckerman (applicant), the holder of a franchise for a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Greenfield, applied to the building inspector of Greenfield for a permit to erect a playground beside the restaurant. The equipment which would constitute the proposed playground was modeled after \u201cMc-Donaldland\u201d characters, and included an eleven foot tall \u201cBig Mac Climber.\u201d The inspector denied the application, reasoning that the playground equipment would constitute a sign, and would thus violate certain provisions of the Greenfield zoning by-law. On September 20, 1982, the applicant appealed to the zoning board of appeals of Greenfield (board). A public hearing was held on November 18, 1982, and, on the same evening, the board voted to overrule the building inspector, and to allow construction of the playground if certain conditions were met. On December 3, 1982, fifteen days after the board had made its decision, written copies of the decision were filed with the town clerk, and mailed to the applicant. According to the stipulation filed by the parties, the applicant \u201cwould testify\u201d that he never received the copy addressed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The applicant\u2019s attorney first learned of the board\u2019s action on December 20, 1982. Certain of the conditions imposed on the construction of the playground were unacceptable to his client. In particular, the board had decided that the playground could be erected only if it were surrounded by a six foot high wrought iron fence, as well as dense evergreen shrubbery of the same height. The applicant was willing to construct such a barrier, but he objected to the height requirement. Accordingly, he filed an appeal in the Superior Court on January 10, 1983, thirty-eight days after the decision of the board was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>\n<em>l.G.L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>1</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">We first confront the applicant\u2019s claim that the board\u2019s failure to file its decision in the requisite period of time resulted in a constructive grant of the relief sought. General Laws c. 40A, \u00a715, provides that a decision of the board of appeals \u201cshall be filed within fourteen days.\u201d The statute does not specify, however, when this fourteen-day period begins to run. See <em>Capone </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Fitchburg, </em>389 Mass. 617, 622 n.7 (1983). The applicant contends that G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15, requires that the decision be filed \u201cwithin fourteen days\u201d from the time the decision is made. In this case, the decision was not filed until fifteen days after the day of the hearing when the board voted to overrule the building inspector. Thus, if we accept the applicant\u2019s interpretation of the fourteen-day requirement, the board failed to file its decision in a timely fashion. On the other hand, if the statute merely requires that the decision be filed within fourteen days of the last day of the period within which board action is required (which is within seventy-five days from the day on which the appeal is filed), then the board\u2019s actions have fulfilled the statutory timing requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">We need not, at this point, choose between these contrary interpretations of the statute. Instead, even if we assume, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>out deciding, that a decision must be filed within fourteen days after it is made, the applicant is not entitled to a constructive grant of his permit. We conclude that, at least in those circumstances where the board has filed its decision within seventy-five days after the applicant appeals, any additional requirement, to the effect that the board file its decision within fourteen days after the decision is made, would be directory only. Cf. <em>Capone </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Fitchburg, supra at 619, 622 </em>(constructive relief granted where decision made fifty-seven days after appeal, but not filed until 110 days after appeal). Because the board filed its decision on the applicant\u2019s playground seventy-four days after the appeal was filed, there was no constructive grant of the relief sought.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 15, expressly provides a remedy for the failure of a board to act \u201cwithin seventy-five days\u201d after an appeal is filed. <em>Rinaudo </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Plymouth, </em>383 Mass. 885 (1981). In contrast, no remedy is specified for failure to file a decision \u201cwithin fourteen days.\u201d The omission is significant. Even if the Legislature did intend to require that a decision be filed within fourteen days after it is made, we conclude that it did not intend to remedy the type of violation committed by the board in the case before us. See <em>Vokes </em>v. <em>Avery W. Lovell, Inc., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 471, 478 (1984). See also <em>School Comm. of Brockton </em>v. <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd., </em>393 Mass. 256, 263 (1984) (where the Legislature has used certain language in one section of a statute, but not in another, the language should not be implied where it is not present). <em>Capone </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Fitchburg, supra, </em>is not to the contrary. In <em>Capone, </em>we held that the applicant was entitled to a constructive grant where the board had acted within seventy-five days, but had neglected to file its decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>until 110 days after the applicant had appealed. In that case, the board\u2019s failure to file its decision within fourteen days after the expiration of the seventy-five day period within which board action was permitted, created the prospect of a perpetual \u201ccloud [on] the rights of a landowner to use his land.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623, quoting <em>Noe </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Hingham, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 103, 111 (1982) (Dreben, J., dissenting). There is no such prospect here, where the board filed its decision within seventy-five days after the applicant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">We note that this result is consistent with our interpretation of similar statutes where no remedy is specified. \u201cAs to a statute imperative in phrase, it has often been held that where it relates only to the time of performance of a duty by a public officer and does not go to the essence of the thing to be done, it is only a regulation for the orderly and convenient conduct of public business and not a condition precedent to the validity of the act done.\u201d <em>Cheney </em>v. <em>Coughlin, </em>201 Mass. 204, 211 (1909). <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of N. Attleborough, </em>353 Mass. 671, 679 (1968) (interpreting predecessor to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15). See also <em>Casasanta </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Milford, </em>377 Mass. 67, 69-70 (1979). At least where the decision is filed within seventy-five days after the applicant appeals, any additional requirement that a decision be filed within fourteen days after it is made does \u201cnot go to the essence of the thing to be done.\u201d <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of N. Attleborough, supra </em>at 679-680 (quoting <em>Cheney </em>v. <em>Coughlin, supra). </em>Cf. <em>Capone </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Fitchburg, supra </em>at 623-624; <em>Hashimi </em>v. <em>Kalil, </em>388 Mass. 607, 610 (1983) (time limit on hearing involving civil commitment \u201cgoes to the essence of the public duty\u201d). Thus we agree with the judge that the board did not constructively grant the relief sought by the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">2. <em>G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">We turn now to the applicant\u2019s second contention, that the judge erred in dismissing the case because the applicant failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>to fulfil the requirement of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, that he file his appeal within twenty days after the board\u2019s decision was filed with the town clerk. The \u201cStipulation of Agreed Facts\u201d shows that the clerk who works for the building inspector \u201cwould testify\u201d that the decision was mailed to the applicant on December 3, 1982, the same day the decision was filed. The applicant stipulated that he \u201cwould testify\u201d that he never received it, and that his attorney was not informed of the decision until December 20.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The appeal was filed on January 10, 1983. Thus the applicant did not appeal until thirty-eight days after the board\u2019s decision was filed. Nonetheless, he contends that his failure to appeal in a timely fashion should be excused on the ground that he never received the board\u2019s decision in the mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 17, provides that an appeal must be filed within twenty days \u201cnotwithstanding any defect of procedure or of notice <em>other than notice by publication, mailing or posting\u2019'\u2019 </em>(emphasis added). The applicant argues that his failure to receive the notice of decision mailed to him consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>tutes a defect of notice by mailing, and that in such cases, the statute provides him with the opportunity to challenge the board\u2019s action \u201cwithin ninety days after the decision has been filed in the office of the city or town clerk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">We disagree. General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 15, requires that notice of the decision of the board of appeals \u201cshall be <em>mailed </em>forthwith to the petitioner, applicant or appellant, to the parties in interest designated in section eleven, and to every person present at the hearing who requested that notice be sent to him and stated the address to which such notice was to be sent\u201d (emphasis added). According to the stipulation filed by the parties, \u201c [t]he clerk who works for the Building Inspector would testify that her records show that a copy of the decision was sent postage prepaid to the applicant on December 3, 1982.\u201d There is no suggestion in the stipulation that the notice of the decision was improperly addressed, or that the clerk attached insufficient postage, or that the contents of the notice were defective. Accordingly, the requirements with respect to mailing the notice of the decision were completely satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 15, requires only that the notice of decision \u201cbe mailed.\u201d The board does not, as the applicant urges, also have a duty to ensure that the notice is received. See <em>Survey &amp; Research Serv. Inc. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>352 Mass. 475, 476 (1967) (statute requiring notice to \u201cbe served ... by registered mail\u201d within seven days requires mailing, not receipt, within seven days); see also <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lexington, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 441, 444 (1975). If the Legislature had intended that the board ensure receipt, it could have so provided. For instance, use of the word \u201cgiven\u201d instead of \u201cmailed\u201d has been interpreted to require proof of receipt. <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Lexington, supra. </em>See, e.g., G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17 (notice of appeal from board\u2019s decision <em>\u201cshall be given </em>to such city or town clerk\u201d [emphasis added]). Accordingly, we conclude that the statute at issue here does not require that the notice of decision be received. Moreover, because the board fully complied with the requirement that notice \u201cbe mailed,\u201d there was no defect of notice by mailing which could extend the time to appeal under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, beyond twenty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>We further reject the applicant\u2019s argument that there was a defect of notice by mailing because the board failed to mail notice of its decision to the applicant\u2019s attorney of record. The applicant\u2019s attorney is not one of those individuals enumerated in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 15, to whom notice \u201cshall be mailed.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor do we see any reason to engraft the requirements of Mass. R. Civ. P. 5 (b), 365 Mass. 745 (1974), which provides for service to be made on a party\u2019s attorney of record, onto proceedings before zoning boards of appeals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In summary, we conclude (1) that the board\u2019s failure to file its decision within fourteen days after the decision was made did not result in a constructive grant of the application; and (2) that summary judgment in favor of the board was appropriate because the applicant failed to appeal until thirty-eight days after the board\u2019s decision was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-7\"> General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 15, inserted by St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3, provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]he decision of the board shall be made within seventy-five days after the date of the filing of an appeal, application or petition except in regard to special permits, as provided for in section nine of this chapter.
