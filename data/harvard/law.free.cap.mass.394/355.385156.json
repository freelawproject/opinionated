He was convicted of murder in the second degree and sentenced to life imprisonment at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole. After considerable delay, the defendant\u2019s appeal was entered in the Appeals Court. That court summarily affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction. 15 Mass. App. Ct. 1102 (1983). A single justice of this court, treating the defendant\u2019s petition to docket his appeal as an application for further appellate review filed late, referred the case to the full court in order that the defendant receive the review to which he is entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We now reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The evidence presented at trial was substantially as follows. On the night of April 11, 1974, the defendant and a companion met at a bar in Lawrence owned and operated by the victim, John Mikinnis. There were approximately eight other people in the bar, one of whom was Betty Merrick, Mikinnis\u2019s girlfriend. Sometime after midnight, the defendant approached Merrick and began to bother her. Mikinnis told the defendant that he would have to leave, and the two men walked toward the door. Merrick testified that she saw a gun in the defendant\u2019s hand as he walked toward the door. There was conflicting testimony as to whether Mikinnis, who was much larger than the defendant, shoved or threw the defendant out the door, or merely walked with him toward the door. Various witnesses testified that they heard two loud noises which sounded like firecrackers, \u201cpops,\u201d or gunshots as the two men stood in the doorway. Mikinnis then walked back behind the bar, sat down, and stated that he had been shot. He died later that day from gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Because the defendant alleges error in the judge\u2019s charge to the jury on the issue of burden of proof, we summarize the relevant portions of the charge and set forth the challenged language in full. The judge began by instructing the jury that the defendant is presumed to be innocent, and that the Commonwealth has the burden of proving every essential element of the crime charged. He discussed the concept of reasonable doubt, and repeated that the Commonwealth is obligated \u201cto prove the essential elements of the crime as charged. . . . And each and every essential element must be proved to you to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>point beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d He instructed the jury to draw no inference from the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify, and again charged, \u201cIt is the government\u2019s burden to prove its case against the defendant. The defendant does not have the burden of proving himself innocent. And that burden is always upon the government and never shifts to the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The judge then turned to the crimes of murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree, and manslaughter. He defined murder in the first degree as \u201ca killing which is deliberately premeditated with malice aforethought,\u201d and murder in the second degree as \u201can intentional killing with malice aforethought.\u201d On the required element of malice, the judge charged, \u201cAny intentional killing of a human being without legal justification or excuse, with no extenuating circumstances sufficient to reduce the crime to manslaughter, is malicious within the meaning of that expression . ...\u201d He further charged, \u201cIf a man intentionally and without legal justification, excuse or extenuation uses upon the body of another a force, for example, a bullet from a revolver, and that as used would probably do grievous bodily harm to that other and will create a plain and strong likelihood that the other will die as a result, the act implies malice within the meaning of the law .... And our law says, when the killing is caused by the intentional use of a deadly weapon, there arises a presumption of malice aforethought.... Hence in this case, if you find that on April 12, 1974, the Defendant Nieves took out a gun and fired it at John Mikinnis and killed him without justification or excuse or any extenuating circumstances to reduce it to manslaughter, then that is murder with malice aforethought, murder in the second degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">After defining the term \u201cdeliberate premeditation,\u201d and explaining the difference between first and second degree murder, the judge discussed voluntary manslaughter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge told the jury that the difference between murder and manslaughter was the absence of malice. He defined manslaughter as \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>unlawful killing of a human being by another without malice but in sudden passion or heat of blood caused by reasonable provocation or upon sudden combat.\u201d The judge explained what is meant by \u201creasonable provocation,\u201d and by \u201csudden passion or heat of blood.\u201d He then stated that the passion \u201cmust have existed at the time of the killing and must have been the moving cause of the killing in order to reduce the crime to manslaughter. . . . [Y]ou must find the provocation. And you must find from all the evidence a state of mind in the Defendant which shows sudden passion and anger. ... In other words, in order for you the jury to find sufficient facts to reduce in your mind this killing from murder to manslaughter, you would have to find that John Mikinnis provoked the Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The judge then reiterated that the Commonwealth has the burden of proving the essential elements of the crime. He stated: \u201cIf the government has proven all essential elements of second-degree murder to a point beyond a reasonable doubt, then the government is entitled to a guilty finding of second-degrec murder. If there is reasonable doubt in your mind, that reasonable doubt must be resolved in favor of the Defendant, and you must return a verdict of not guilty as to second-degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u201cThen you would go on, if you reach that point, to the question of manslaughter. If you found sufficient provocation, as I have given you the law on that issue, and sufficient anger and passion on the part of the Defendant to reduce this killing from murder to manslaughter, and the government has sustained the burden of proof as I have given it to you on each and every element of voluntary manslaughter, the government would be entitled to a guilty finding of voluntary manslaughter, if it has proven its case in that regard to a point beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">On appeal, the defendant alleges that the judge\u2019s charge unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to the defendant on the issue of malice, thus depriving him of due process of law. The defendant did not object at trial to those portions of the judge\u2019s charge that he now challenges on appeal. Ordinarily, when we review a conviction pursuant to G. L. c. 278, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>\u00a7 33E, if there was no objection at trial, our task is limited to determining whether there is a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. However, we will excuse the failure to raise a constitutional issue at trial if the theory on which the defendant has relied was not sufficiently developed at the time of trial to afford the defendant a genuine opportunity to raise his claim at that time. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rembiszewski, </em>391 Mass. 123, 126 (1984); <em>DeJoinville </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 246, 248, 251 (1980). In such a case, \u201c[i]f constitutional error has occurred, we reverse the conviction unless the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Rembiszewski, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">The defendant bases his challenge to the judge\u2019s charge on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Mullaney </em>v. <em>Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684 (1975), and <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510 (1979). The defendant\u2019s trial occurred in February ,1975, prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mullaney. </em>In <em>Hankerson </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>432 U.S. 233 (1977), the Supreme Court held that <em>Mullaney </em>was fully retroactive. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>374 Mass. 583, 588-590 (1978), we held that with respect to trials occurring before <em>Mullaney, </em>we would not require a specific objection to the judge\u2019s instructions on burden of proof in order to secure appellate review. Therefore, we review the judge\u2019s charge to determine whether it comports with principles set forth in <em>Mullaney.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u201c[T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>370 Mass. 684, 689 (1976). A presumption which shifts to the defendant the burden of disproving any element of the crime charged thus violates the due process clause. In <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, supra </em>at 513-514, the Supreme Court held that an instruction that \u201c[t]he law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts,\u201d might have been interpreted as relieving the State of its burden of proof on the crucial issue of the defendant\u2019s state of mind, and was therefore unconstitutional. The requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt also extends to the existence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>facts or circumstances which would mitigate the degree of the defendant\u2019s culpability. <em>Mullaney </em>v. <em>Wilbur, supra </em>at 697-698. Thus, when the issue is properly raised, in order to obtain a murder conviction the Commonwealth must prove the absence of the heat of passion on sudden provocation beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, supra </em>at 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The defendant alleges that the judge\u2019s charge to the jury was deficient on both <em>Sandstrom </em>and <em>Mullaney </em>grounds. He alleges that the charge created a presumption of malice, see <em>Sandstrom, supra </em>at 524, and that it placed on the defendant the burden of proving that he acted in the heat of passion on sudden provocation. <em>Mullaney, supra </em>at 703-704. In assessing the sufficiency of the jury instructions, we consider the charge in its entirety, to determine the \u201cprobable impact, appraised realistically . . . upon the jury\u2019s fact-finding function.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>384 Mass. 396, 399-400 (1981), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wharton, </em>433 F.2d 451, 457 (D.C. Cir. 1970). \u201c[W]hether a defendant has been accorded his constitutional rights depends upon the way in which a reasonable juror could have interpreted the instruction[s].\u201d <em>Sandstrom, supra </em>at 514. A jury charge will be upheld if it \u201cclearly placed the burden of proving malice beyond a reasonable doubt on the Commonwealth and contained other discussion which, although not referring to the burden of proof as to . . . reasonable provocation, adequately defined [that factor] and established [it] as negating a finding of malice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, supra </em>at 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Reviewing the charge in its entirety, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have interpreted the charge as establishing a presumption of malice and as shifting to the defendant the burden of proving that he acted in the heat of passion on sudden provocation. The judge charged that when a killing is caused by the use of a deadly weapon, \u201cthe act implies malice within the meaning of the law,\u201d and \u201cour law says . . . there arises a presumption of malice aforethought.\u201d A jury might easily have interpreted that language as creating a mandatory presumption; in other words, \u201can irrebuttable direction by the court to find [malice] once convinced of the facts triggering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>the presumption.\u201d <em>Sandstrom, supra </em>at 517. Alternatively, the jury might have interpreted the charge as establishing a rebut-table presumption. Relating the instructions to the facts of the case, the judge charged \u201cif you find that ... the Defendant . . . took out a gun and fired it at John Mikinnis and killed him without justification or excuse or any extenuating circumstances to reduce it to manslaughter, then that is murder with malice aforethought.\u201d A jury might have inferred from those instructions that if the Commonwealth proved the use of a deadly weapon, malice was to be presumed, unless the defendant rebutted that presumption with evidence of extenuating circumstances. This case thus differs from other cases in which we have concluded that despite the use of \u201cpresumption\u201d language, the charge as a whole made it clear that a finding of malice was not required. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>391 Mass. 443, 451-452 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Festa, </em>388 Mass. 513, 514-515 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The judge also erred in his repeated use of \u201cfinding\u201d language in connection with the issue whether the defendant acted in the heat of passion or sudden provocation. For example, the judge charged that \u201cyou must find the provocation. And you must find from all the evidence . . . sudden passion and anger.\u201d He later charged that \u201cto find sufficient facts to reduce in your mind this killing from murder to manslaughter, <em>you would have to find that John Mikinnis provoked the Defendant.\u2019\u2019'\u2019 </em>This language is similar to the language which required reversal of the defendants\u2019 convictions in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, supra </em>at 404-405, <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>377 Mass. 527, 534 (1979), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra </em>at 690. Such language suggests that the jury must find, by at least a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant acted in the heat of passion on sudden provocation. However, it is sufficient for acquittal on the murder charge that there be reasonable doubt whether the defendant acted in heat of passion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, supra </em>at 405; <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The Commonwealth argues that the judge\u2019s repeated instruction that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>a reasonable doubt the essential elements of the crime was sufficient to mitigate any error in other portions of the charge. However, the judge\u2019s instructions \u201ctreated the issue of burden of proof only in general terms .... At no time did he discuss the burden of proof as to malice . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, supra </em>at 591. Moreover, the fact that some of the instructions were correct is not determinative because \u201cwe cannot know whether the jury were guided by the correct or the incorrect portion of the instruction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, supra </em>at 403, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Green, </em>405 F.2d 1368, 1370 (D.C. Cir. 1968), aff\u2019d, 424 F.2d 912 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 997 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Because the jury might have interpreted the instructions as establishing a mandatory presumption of malice or as placing on the defendant the burden of proving heat of passion, either of which would violate the due process clause, the instructions were unconstitutional. <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, supra </em>at 524. <em>Mullaney </em>v. <em>Wilbur, supra </em>at 703-704. Unless the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we must reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction. We have previously noted that the \u201cissue of burden of proof goes to the very heart of the truthfinding function of the criminal trial and, as such, raises \u2018serious questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, supra </em>at 589, quoting <em>Hankerson </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>432 U.S. 233, 241 (1977). Therefore, although the Commonwealth\u2019s case against the defendant was strong, we cannot say that the errors in the charge were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Because the remaining issues raised by the defendant are unlikely to arise at a new trial, we do not address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Prior to its amendment in 1979 (St. 1979, c. 346, \u00a7 2), G.
