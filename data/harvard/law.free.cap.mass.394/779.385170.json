Bill, a chiropractor, appeals from a decision of a single justice of this court, holding that certain conclusions of the Board of Registration of Chiropractors (board) which underlay the board\u2019s decision to suspend the plaintiff\u2019s license to practice chiropractic were supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>See G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64. The plaintiff argues that the single justice erred, and that the board\u2019s decision to suspend him for eighteen months and to prohibit the operation of his office under his name during that time was unreasonable and excessive. We hold that the board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and thus that the single justice did not err. We conclude further that the sanctions imposed by the board were neither unreasonable nor excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">1. <em>Substantial evidence. </em>The board made the following findings: Edward Howard visited the plaintiff\u2019s office in response to an advertisement for a \u201cLaser\u201d face-lift. Howard received a laser treatment with a wand-like instrument. He did not sign any patient consent forms, and he was not given protective eyewear. Counsel for the plaintiff stipulated that the laser instrument was on the plaintiff\u2019s premises and was not registered at that time. The board found that the plaintiff attempted to use a procedure which he thought was \u201csupportive to the chiropractic adjustment\u201d without following usual and customary history and examination procedures to indicate the propriety of chiropractic therapy; that the use of laser instruments is not recognized as a usual and customary supportive procedure in chiropractic; and that the plaintiff attempted to treat for a condition not within the scope of chiropractic care. The board concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s use of the laser device was beyond the scope of chiropractic as defined in G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 89;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>that such use violated G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 61 ;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the plaintiff\u2019s advertisement of the laser device was misleading and deceptive because use of the laser device was outside the scope of his practice; that his use of the laser device without apparent approval of Federal and State authorities constituted negligence; and that he violated 233 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 4.05<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 4.09<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">An examination of the record discloses substantial evidence \u2014 \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d \u2014 to support the board\u2019s Endings and conclusions. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6), as amended through St. 1979, c. 795, \u00a7 3. See <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>383 Mass. 299, 304 (1981). Howard\u2019s testimony reveals that he responded to the plaintiff\u2019s advertise<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>ment for a laser face-lift and that at the plaintiff\u2019s office he received treatment \u2014 albeit two minutes\u2019 worth \u2014 with the laser device. An unidentified woman employee in the plaintiff\u2019s office administered the treatment. She took a \u201cwand-like\u201d instrument connected by a cord to a machine and pressed the tip of it against a wrinkle on Howard\u2019s face. Alexander C. Politis, a chiropractor called as an expert witness by the prosecution, testified that this laser face-lift technique \u201chad nothing to do with chiropractic.\u201d Stuart L. Neivert, a chiropractor called by the plaintiff, testified that he did not use the laser face-lift technique, and that he did not know any chiropractor in Massachusetts (other than the plaintiff) who uses the procedure. Considerable oral testimony and documentary evidence established that the laser face-lift procedure is not offered as a course at chiropractic colleges. An official from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (department) testified that the plaintiff\u2019s laser machine was not registered when an inspection occurred, and that the plaintiff\u2019s facilities were not in compliance with other requirements of the department. A Federal official from the Food and Drug Administration testified that the plaintiff\u2019s laser device was not labeled \u201cfor investigational use only,\u201d as Federal law required. Shortly after the State investigation, the plaintiff came into compliance with State requirements; shortly after the Federal investigation, the plaintiff stopped using the device. From the foregoing evidence and other evidence in the record, we conclude that the board\u2019s findings and conclusions are supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">2. <em>Sanctions. </em>The plaintiff has not persuaded us that the sanctions imposed by the board are \u201cunreasonable and excessive\u201d as he alleges. He has not indicated to us the existence of \u201cthe most extraordinary of circumstances\u201d; without such a showing we do not interfere with the board\u2019s \u201cexercise of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>sound discretion.\u201d <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Medicine, </em>378 Mass. 519, 528-529 (1979). We note that, on remand, the board reduced the length of the suspension by one-half, even though it stated, on remand, that \u201cthe major weight of infraction laid with the Howard complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The single justice made no error. See <em>Gurry v. Board of Pub. Accountancy, ante </em>118, 129 (1985). Furthermore, the board\u2019s sanctions are not unreasonable or excessive. The case is remanded to the single justice for entry of a judgment affirming the board\u2019s revised sanction of a suspension from practice for eighteen months and a prohibition of the operation of the plaintiff\u2019s office under his name during the suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-15\">The board originally based its decision on two incidents, one involving a patient named Lyn D. Clapprood and the other involving a patient named Edward J. Howard. The single justice held that there was insufficient evidence concerning the Clapprood incident to support the board\u2019s findings and conclusions, but that there was sufficient evidence to support the board\u2019s findings and conclusions regarding the Howard matter. The single justice remanded the matter to the board for reconsideration of sanctions, in light of her decision. In response, the board reduced the length of the suspension from three years, with a five-year probationary period to follow, to eighteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>months, and ordered that the plaintiff\u2019s chiropractic office not be operated under his name during those eighteen months. An additional sanction of participation in eighty hours of continuing education in a course approved by the board was also eliminated on remand. The plaintiff appealed the single justice\u2019s decision \u201cto the extent that [it] was adverse to Frank R. Bill, D.C.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b796-7\">General Laws c. 112, \u00a7 89, as amended through St. 1982, c. 154, defines \u201cchiropractic\u201d as: \u201c[T]he science of locating, and removing interference with the transmission or expression of nerve force in the human body, by the correction of misalignments or subluxations of the bony articulation and adjacent structures, more especially those of the vertebra column and pelvis, for the purpose of restoring and maintaining health.

The board\u2019s finding that Howard did not sign a patient consent form and its statement that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel stipulated to the nonregistration of the laser device are insufficiently supported by the record. However, neither the finding nor the statement bears significantly on the board\u2019s ultimate decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
