This companion case concerns the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the department\u2019s decision on a reapplication for medical assistance (MA) benefits. Both cases concern the denial of retroactive MA benefits for the same time frame. We resolve these cases on the applicability of a resource spend down. We, therefore, need not decide the merits of the various other issues raised in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b495-15\">Nolan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWp1\">The plaintiffs, Catherine and Patrick Mathews, request that we vacate the Superior Court\u2019s judgments and order the Department of Public Welfare (department) to award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>appropriate medical assistance (MA) benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On November 30, 1981, Cambridge Hospital (hospital) filed an application with the department for MA benefits on behalf of Mrs. Mathews. See G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 8. The hospital requested coverage retroactive to November 9, 1981, the date of Mrs. Mathews\u2019s admission. The department denied this application based on its determination that the plaintiffs owned excess resources. A family of two may retain $3,000 in resources. SeeG. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 10 (3); 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 505.110 (1983). The plaintiffs had combined personal resources of $4,045.99 ($2,131 in a joint account and the remaining as cash surrender value on two life insurance policies).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the time of the department\u2019s determination, the plaintiffs had incurred $21,000 in medical expenses. The department did not utilize a \u201cresource spend down\u201d in determining eligibility. See <em>Haley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Welfare, ante </em>466 (1985). A department appeals referee affirmed the denial of MA benefits. The plaintiff sought judicial review pursuant to G. L. c. 30A and G. L. c. 18, \u00a7 16. The Superior Court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint on a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">A resource spend down would require the department to offset the plaintiffs\u2019 excess resources against incurred medical expenses. In <em>Haley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, supra </em>at 467-468, we examined the propriety of the department\u2019s determination of MA benefits eligibility absent a resource spend down. We held that, where Title XIX, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396-1396p (1982), does not preclude utilization of a resource spend down and G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 10 (3), requires the department, in determining eligibility, to exempt a certain amount of an applicant\u2019s resources and neither take into consideration nor apply such resources to the payment or part payment available under G. L. c. 118E, the department is required to use a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>source spend down. This appeal is governed entirely by our decision in <em>Haley, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The judgments are reversed and the cases remanded to the Superior Court for action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b496-6\"> See <em>Haley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, ante </em>466, 467-468 (1985), for a description of the MA benefits program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\"> We note that the department violated its regulations when it failed to advise the plaintiffs of the possibility of adjusting the face value of the life insurance so as to become eligible. See 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 505.160(E)(1) (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
