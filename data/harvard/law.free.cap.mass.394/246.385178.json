We conclude that, under Rule 3:07 of the Rules of the Supreme Judicial Court (1981) and G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 48,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he may do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>The case is submitted on a statement of agreed facts. The plaintiffs are general partners of the Nantucket Collaborative, a limited partnership owning a forty-five acre parcel of land in Nantucket. In December, 1981, the plaintiffs applied to the Nantucket planning board (board) for issuance of a special permit for construction of a commercial development on the land. The application was denied on May 3,1982, and a motion to reconsider was subsequently denied. On May 26, 1982, the plaintiffs brought an action in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, alleging that denial of their application was outside the scope of the board\u2019s authority and that the board\u2019s deliberations and decision were arbitrary and prejudicial. The plaintiffs sought an annulment of the board\u2019s decision, and compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Sidney Gorovitz, a named plaintiff, had been a general partner in the Nantucket Collaborative, as well as its legal counsel, since its inception. Furthermore, as \u201cthe only one of the Plaintiffs who participated in the Nantucket Planning Board meetings which led to the events surrounding Plaintiffs\u2019 claims [Gorovitz was] clearly the Plaintiffs\u2019 key material witness, and intended] to testify at trial.\u201d On March 9, 1983, the board filed a motion for an order preventing plaintiffs\u2019 counsel from testifying as a witness at trial, contending that DR 5-101(B) and DR 5-102(A),* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cspecifically prohibit an attorney from acting in the dual role of counsel and witness on behalf of his clients.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>allowed the motion, finding \u201cno showing of any exceptional circumstance which would operate to permit the dual role of witness-advocate herein sought.\u201d The judge allowed Sidney Gorovitz to \u201cwithdraw as counsel for plaintiffs in or within 30 days ... if successor counsel file an appearance herein, in which event nothing would prevent [Gorovitz\u2019s] testimony as a witness thereafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In response to the plaintiffs\u2019 request for clarification, the judge instructed the parties on March 28, 1983, that his order pertained equally \u201cto any law partner or associate of Sidney Gorovitz\u201d; that Mr. Gorovitz could not testify at trial unless he and his law firm withdrew as counsel prior to April 25, 1983; and that the disqualification of Mr. Gorovitz applied not only to his representation of the other named plaintiffs, but to his appearance pro se as well. The order was stayed by a single justice of the Appeals Court, pending review by the full bench. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We vacate the disqualification order.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Mr. Gorovitz convincingly argues that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. 775 (1979), establishes his right to represent the Nantucket Collaborative despite the constraints of DR 5-101 and DR 5-102. We agree. \u201cTo apply DR 5-102 when the testifying advocate is a litigant in the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>miscomprehends the thrust of the rule. Disciplinary Rule 5-102 regulates lawyers who would serve as counsel and witness for a party litigant. It does not address that situation in which the lawyer <em>is </em>the party litigant. Any perception by the public or determination by a jury that a lawyer litigant has twisted the truth surely would be due to his role as a litigant and not, we would hope, to his occupation as a lawyer. ... As a party litigant, moreover, a lawyer could represent himself if he so chose. G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 48. Implicit in the right of self-representation is the right of representation by retained counsel of one\u2019s choosing. A party litigant does not lose this right merely because he is a lawyer and therefore subject to DR 5-102\u201d (emphasis in original) (citations omitted). <em>Borman, supra </em>at 788-789. Mr. Gorovitz is a party litigant, and his right to appear pro se is thus established.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The board, however, attempts to evade the ineluctable implication of <em>Borman </em>by arguing that Mr. Gorovitz is not, in fact, acting pro se. They contend that he is a litigant in this action in name only and is thus not appearing pro se. They maintain that he is representing not himself but the other named partners, and that, in this posture, the <em>Borman </em>rule ought not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">This argument misapprehends the role of a general partner in a limited partnership as well as the nature of this cause of action. It is true that, as a matter of pleading, \u201c[wjith certain exceptions ... all partners must be parties to a suit involving partnership rights.\u201d <em>Shapira </em>v. <em>Budish, </em>275 Mass. 120, 126 (1931). See <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>331 Mass. 119, 124 (1954). But that rule does not signify that Mr. Gorovitz\u2019s interest in the instant action is based only on a formality. A general partner of a limited partnership possesses \u201cthe rights and powers ... of a partner in a partnership without limited partners.\u201d G. L. c. 109, \u00a7 24, as appearing in St. 1982, c. 202, \u00a7 1. Mr. Gorovitz\u2019s interest, moreover, does not perceptibly differ from the interests of the other named partners in this action. The limited partnership here owns land in the name of the partnership. See G. L. c. 109, \u00a7 6; G. L. c. 108A, \u00a7 8 (3). The other named plaintiffs and Mr. Gorovitz have an identical interest in maximizing the profitability of the partnership\u2019s investment in that land.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The high costs of attorney disqualification on litigants<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and on the court system<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> militate against the indiscriminate allowance of disqualification motions. Thus, \u201c[w]hen a lawyer, exercising his best judgment, determines that his employment will not bring him into conflict with the code, disqualification may occur only if the trial court determines that his continued participation as counsel taints the legal system or the trial of the cause before it.\u201d <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, supra </em>at 788. There is no basis here on which to conclude that Mr. Gorovitz\u2019s representation of the Nantucket Collaborative threatens either the integrity of the legal system or the vigorous prosecution of the partnership\u2019s cause of action. This is clearly an instance in which \u201ca long or extensive professional relationship with a client may have afforded a lawyer, or a firm, such an extraordinary familiarity with the client\u2019s affairs that the value to the client of representation by that lawyer or firm in a trial involving those matters would clearly outweigh the disadvantages of having the lawyer, or a lawyer in the firm, testify to some disputed and significant issue.\u201d ABA Comm. on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Formal Op. 339 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">We vacate the judge\u2019s disqualification order and remand to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b262-16\"> General Laws c. 221, \u00a7 48, provides: \u201cParties may manage, prosecute or defend their own suits personally, or by such attorneys as they may engage; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>but not more than two persons for each party shall, without permission of the court, be allowed to manage any case therein.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\"> See S.J.C.

We note, however, that the only assets of the Nantucket Collaborative evident on the record are its real estate holdings in Nantucket. Insisting that the plaintiffs encumber that realty to procure a new lawyer to litigate their claim imposes a significant burden on them, if not a \u201csubstantial hardship.\u201d See Brown &amp; Brown, Disqualification of the Testifying Advocate \u2014 a Firm Rule?, 57 N.C.
