L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>c. 152, \u00a7 35.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appeals Court held that the Industrial Accident Board (board) and the Superior Court correctly concluded that the employee was not so precluded. <em>Sjoberg\u2019s Case, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (1984). We agree that there is no error in the board\u2019s determination and we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court except for the matter of the award of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">We summarize the facts as found by the single member of the board. On August 22, 1977, the employee first suffered pain in his back and stomach while performing work as a pressman and molder. He received weekly compensation benefits from that date until his return to work on September 22, 1977. On June 12, 1978, in similar circumstances, he felt a snapping sensation in his back. He was out of work from June 13 through June 16, 1978, and from July 12 through July 30, 1978, during which periods he received weekly workers\u2019 compensation benefits. On returning to work, the employee\u2019s back remained stiff and sore. When he learned that he did not get a less strenuous job for which he had put in a bid, he submitted his resignation effective October 20, 1978. The employee filed a claim for compensation on November 24, 1978, for partial incapacity from October 20, 1978, and continuing.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The employee\u2019s average weekly wage at the time of the June 12, 1978, industrial injury was $302.31. The employee obtained various jobs after his resignation and in 1981, \u201c[wjorking over 50 hours a week ... his average weekly wage was $317.48.\u201d The single member noted that \u201c[njone of the jobs which the employee . . . performed since leaving the employer have been as physically demanding as his work for the employer.\u201d The single member stated that \u201c[wjhile average weekly wage before and after an industrial injury are important pieces of evidence, this evidence is not conclusive on the issue of loss of earning capacity.\u201d He awarded the employee $40 a week for his diminished earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The board affirmed and adopted the findings and decision of the single member on September 16, 1982. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (insurer) filed a complaint in the Superior Court denying any liability for compensation claimed by the employee after July 30, 1978. A judge of the Superior Court dismissed the insurer\u2019s complaint and the insurer appealed. The Appeals Court saw \u201cno reason to deny compensation because the diminution of earning capacity [was] concealed by the longer hours worked.\u201d <em>Sjoberg\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 3-4. The Appeals Court held that \u201cthe award for impaired earning capacity under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, was not \u2018tainted by error of law.\u2019 <em>Haley\u2019s Case, </em>356 Mass. 678, 680 (1970).\u201d <em>Sjoberg\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The insurer raises three issues on appeal: first, that the award to the employee of $40 per week in partial compensation was excessive; second, that there was no medical evidence before the board to warrant a finding that the employee was disabled after May 7, 1979; and, third, that the trial court erred in its computation of interest due the employee on the judgment. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The insurer contends that an award of partial compensation is controlled by the actual postinjury earnings of the employee and cannot exceed the difference between the prior average weekly wage and the amount he earns. According to the insurer, the Massachusetts Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is \u201cbased on the wage-loss-replacement principle.\u201d Thus, the insurer concludes that the language of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, must be strictly construed to mean that \u201cearnings by the employee exceeding his average weekly wage preclude partial compensation benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">We reject this reasoning. The Legislature has not specified a method for computing \u201cthe average weekly wage [the employee] is able to earn thereafter.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35. In deciding whether the board erred, we must be \u201cmindful of the deference due the [board\u2019s] specialized knowledge, technical competence, and experience, regarding issues within the scope of [its] statutorily delegated authority.\u201d <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Rating &amp; Inspection Bureau of Mass. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>391 Mass. 238, 246 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>When the employee resigned in October, 1978, he was earning in excess of eight dollars an hour and worked some thirty-seven hours a week for an average weekly wage of $302.31. In 1981, he was earning $4.50 an hour and worked over fifty hours a week for an average weekly wage of $317.48. The board interpreted the language of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, as necessitating the exclusion of the overtime hours worked by the employee after his injury in determining his capacity for work. \u201c[Ujnder the statute, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, it is not the wages actually earned after the injury that are the basis of deciding the earning capacity. . . . [The employee] is to be paid for the loss of earnings caused by the injury . . . .\u201d <em>Korobchuk\u2019s Case, </em>277 Mass. 534, 536 (1931). See <em>Nowak's Case, 2 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 498, 500 (1974). The board properly could find that the employee had \u201ca significant impairment of earning capacity concealed within an income equal to his former wage\u201d by virtue of his \u201cworking long hours at a lower hourly rate . . . .\u201d L. Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 343, at 402 (1981). Thus, it was not error for the board to conclude that overtime payments, income from special projects, or income derived from nonemployment sources should not be included in the employee\u2019s postinjury \u201caverage weekly wage.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ABa\">This result was prefigured in earlier decisions of this court in which we acknowledged several instances in which postinjury earnings were artificially inflated so as to mask the claimant\u2019s true impairment of earning capacity. In <em>Shaw\u2019s Case, </em>247 Mass. 157 (1923), the employee\u2019s postinjury earnings were supplemented by a gratuity from his employer; in <em>Sensk's Case, </em>247 Mass. 232 (1924), the employee raised his post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>injury earnings by begging in the streets; in <em>Federico\u2019s Case, </em>283 Mass. 430 (1933), the claimant, a partner in a contracting firm, received income in part from invested capital. In each case, we held the claimant entitled to partial compensation despite the seemingly undiminished earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The result reached by the board is consistent with case law from other jurisdictions interpreting statutory provisions which are substantially similar to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35. \u201cIt is uniformly held . . . without regard to statutory variations in the phrasing of the test, that a finding of disability may stand even when there is evidence of some actual post-injury earnings equaling or exceeding those received before the accident. The position may be best summarized by saying that actual post-injury earnings will create a presumption of earning capacity commensurate with them, but the presumption may be rebutted by evidence independently showing incapacity or explaining away the post-injury earnings as an unreliable basis for estimating capacity. Unreliability of post-injury earnings may be due to a number of things; increase in general wage levels since the time of accident; claimant\u2019s own greater maturity or training; <em>longer hours worked by claimant after the </em>accident; payment of wages disproportionate to capacity out of sympathy to claimant; and the temporary and unpredictable character of post-injury earnings.\u201d 2 A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 57.21, at 10-79 -10-100 (1983) (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Several courts have interpreted the applicable workers\u2019 compensation statutes to require the exclusion of extraneous factors in determining partial compensation for impaired earning capacity. See, e.g., <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Downey, 266 </em>Ala. 344 (1957); <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Corfman, </em>424 So. 2d 1326 (Ala. Civ. App. 1982); <em>Hewing </em>v. <em>Peter Kiewit &amp; Sons, </em>586 P.2d 182 (Alaska 1978); <em>Arizona Pub. Serv. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Comm\u2019n, </em>16 Ariz. App. 274 (1972); <em>Ruddy </em>v. <em>I.D. Griffith &amp; Co., </em>237 A.2d 700 (Del. 1968); <em>Maxey </em>v. <em>Major Mechanical Contractors, </em>330 A.2d 156 (Del. Super. 1974); <em>Fermo </em>v. <em>Superline Prods., </em>175 Mont. 345 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Other courts specifically have held that postinjury earnings must be adjusted appropriately to reflect overtime hours worked. See, e.g., <em>Arizona Pub. Serv. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Comm\u2019n, </em>16 Ariz. App. at 278; <em>Devlin </em>v. <em>Iron Works Creek Constr. Corp., </em>164 Pa. Super. 481, 485-486 (1949). See also <em>Reukauf </em>v. <em>Mobil Oil Corp., </em>44 A.D.2d 856 (N.Y. 1974) (where claimant\u2019s pre- and post-injury weekly earnings fluctuated due to overtime, board must select \u201creasonable period\u201d and average earnings); <em>Franklin County Coal Corp. </em>v. <em>Industrial Comm\u2019n, </em>398 Ill. 528 (1947) (overtime earnings excluded from computation by statute). Cf. <em>Texas Employers\u2019 Ins. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>563 S.W.2d 685 (Tex. Ct. App. 1978) (finding of total and permanent incapacity not precluded by fact of employee\u2019s working substantial overtime hours after injury due to economic necessity). Contra <em>Reeves </em>v. <em>Echota Cotton Mills, </em>123 Ga. App. 649 (1971) (claimant not entitled to partial compensation under statute because postinjury earnings exceeded pre-injury wages, despite his working longer hours at lower rate).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The language of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35, permits a construction that \u201cit is only by the elimination of all variables except the injury itself that a reasonably accurate estimate can be made of the impairment of earning capacity attributable to the injury.\u201d <em>Arizona Pub. Serv. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Comm\u2019n, </em>16 Ariz. App. 274, 277 (1972) (interpreting a provision similar to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35). We conclude that the board was correct in its view that it was not required \u201cto offset loss due to physical impairment by earnings attributable solely to claimant\u2019s having worked more hours per week\u201d and that \u201c[ojvertime worked after the injury should be omitted from consideration if overtime was not included in the calculation of the preinjury wage basis.\u201d 2 A. Larson, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 57.33, at 10-152 - 10-153. A determination to the contrary would \u201creward the idle and punish the ambitious.\u201d <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 351, 353 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The insurer next urges that there was no medical evidence to establish the employee\u2019s disability after May 7, 1979. We disagree. The record included several medical reports. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>May 18, 1979, the employee was diagnosed as suffering a \u201c[c]hronic sprain, right sacra iliac joint.\u201d Prior to May, 1979, a physician had diagnosed a \u201cprevious prolapse of lumbar disc\u201d with a \u201cguarded\u201d prognosis. Further, the employee testified before the single member that he engaged in an exercise program for his back one-half hour a day as prescribed, that his back remained sore, and that he continued to be bothered by protracted sitting. \u201cIt is well settled that the decision of the board is \u2018to be accepted as final if . . . supported by the evidence, including all rational inferences which could be drawn therefrom, and if not tainted by error of law.\u2019 <em>Foley\u2019s Case, </em>358 Mass. 230, 232 (1970). See <em>Frennier\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 635, 638-639 (1945). \u2018It is the exclusive function of the board to consider and weigh the evidence and to ascertain and settle the facts. Any contention that the board ought to have made contrary findings is unavailing if the findings made are not without sufficient evidentiary support,\u2019 <em>Chapman\u2019s Case, </em>321 Mass. 705, 707 (1947).\u201d <em>McEwen\u2019s Case, </em>369 Mass. 851, 853 (1976). We conclude that there was such evidence to support the board\u2019s finding of partial disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Last, the insurer argues that the judge erred in awarding interest on the entire amount due at the issuance of the judgment for the period from the date the employee filed his claim to the date of judgment. We agree. \u201cWhenever [sums due the employee or his dependents as compensation] include weekly payments, interest shall be computed on each unpaid weekly payment.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 50, as amended by St. 1982, c. 183, \u00a7 1. We, therefore, remand this case to the Superior Court for computation of interest at six percent<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on \u201ceach unpaid weekly payment\u201d from the time it became due. The judgment entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>by the judge of the Superior Court is otherwise affirmed. Costs and reasonable expenses under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11 A, inserted by St. 1945, c. 444, as amended, shall be allowed by the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\"> General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 35, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 978, \u00a7 6, provides in relevant part: \u201cWhile the incapacity for work resulting from the injury is partial, the insurer shall pay the injured employee a weekly compensation equal to the entire difference between his average weekly wage before the injury and the average weekly wage he is able to earn thereafter . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b477-5\"> One commentator has stated the principle as follows: The test is \u201cone of capacity. If the legislature had spoken of the wages \u2018he has earned thereafter,\u2019 or even the wages \u2018he has been able to earn thereafter,\u2019 the comparison of actual wage with actual wage would be indicated. But the concept of wages he \u2018is able\u2019 to earn cannot mean definite actual wages alone, especially in the absence of a fixed period of time within which post-injury wages are to be taken as controlling.\u201d 2 A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 57.21 (1983). See <em>Whyte </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm\u2019n, </em>71 Ariz. 338, 343 (1951); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>C.F. Braun &amp; Co., </em>170 Kan. 177, 181-182 (1950); <em>Batte </em>v. <em>Stanley\u2019s, </em>70 N.M. 364, 369 (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b480-6\"> The interest rate to be applied under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 50, is that in effect at the time the employee files his claim. In this case, the effective rate on November 24, 1978 \u2014 the filing date \u2014 was six percent per annum. The Legislature has twice increased the interest rate under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 50, since 1978, but has stated that the increased rates are prospective only. Thus, the figure to be used here is six percent. See St. 1980, c. 322, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3; St. 1982, c. 183, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
