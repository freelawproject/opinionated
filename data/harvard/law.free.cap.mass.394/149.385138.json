L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9. The defendant filed a counterclaim for unpaid rent. The case was tried to a judge in the District Court, who found for the plaintiff in the amount of $2,300, and for the defendant, on his counterclaim, in the amount of $400. The defendant claimed a report to the Appellate Division. The Appellate Division dismissed the report, and the defendant appealed here. We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 109, as amended by St. 1975, c. 377, \u00a7\u00a7 108, 108A, provides in part: \u201cAn appeal to the supreme judicial court shall lie from the final decision of the appellate division of any district court.\u201d \u201cA decision of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Appellate Division is not final and immediate appeal to this court is not available if trial in the Superior Court is available to the party seeking the appeal.\u201d <em>Greenhouse, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc., ante </em>60, 61 (1985), quoting <em>Locke </em>v. <em>Slater, </em>387 Mass. 682, 684 (1982). See <em>Orasz </em>v. <em>Colonial Tavern, Inc., </em>365 Mass. 131, 139 (1974). Thus, if the defendant could have claimed a Superior Court trial after the decision of the Appellate Division, his appeal is not properly here.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s complaint sought actual damages of $5,000, an amount below the $7,500 threshold established by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 104, for removal to the Superior Court. Although the complaint also included a count seeking treble damages under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, that section provides that \u201c[t]he provisions of sections ninety-five to one hundred and ten, inclusive, of chapter two hundred and thirty-one, where applicable, shall apply to a claim under this section, except that the provisions for remand, removal and transfer shall be controlled by the amount of single damages claimed hereunder.\u201d G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (3A), inserted by St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 46. Thus, the defendant could have caused the case to be transferred to the Superior Court for a new trial within ten days after receiving notice of the Appellate Division\u2019s decision. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 104. The decision of the Appellate Division was therefore not a final decision, and an immediate appeal to this court is not available. <em>Greenhouse, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc., supra </em>at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b166-7\">Abrams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVj\">(concurring). I adhere to my dissenting views as expressed in <em>Greenhouse, Inc. </em>v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc., ante </em>60, 63 (1985), but accept the court\u2019s decision. Further, in this case the defendant challenges the factual findings of the judge but has failed to indicate whether the evidence before us is all the evidence bearing on the issues raised. Thus, the questions of law raised by the defendant cannot be resolved by us. See <em>Comfort Air Syss. </em>v. <em>Cacopardo, </em>370 Mass. 255, 259 (1976); <em>Irving </em>v. <em>Bonjorno, </em>327 Mass. 516, 518 (1951).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
