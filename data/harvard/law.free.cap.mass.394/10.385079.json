L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>c. 265, \u00a7 24B, on an indictment charging rape of a child under sixteen years of age (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23). The defendant appealed his conviction, and we allowed his application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The defendant argues that three errors of law warrant the reversal of his conviction. First, he contends that the refusal of the motion judge to allow a continuance to enable him to retain private counsel violated his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution to be represented by counsel of his choice. Second, the defendant claims prejudicial error in the exclusion of certain hospital records concerning the psychological evaluation of the victim after the incident. Third, the defendant argues that conviction of assault with intent to commit statutory rape requires proof of his knowledge of the victim\u2019s age, an element not charged in the indictment or proven at trial. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">There was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found the following facts. The victim was approximately fifteen years and four months old on April 19, 1982. That evening, she met several friends at Prospect Hill Park in Somerville. Sometime later, the victim and one friend met the defendant at Perry Park.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The victim accepted the defendant\u2019s invitation to accompany him to a place where drugs could be purchased. While traveling down some railroad tracks in a nonresidential area of the city, the defendant pulled the victim off the railroad tracks and forced her to the ground, where he forcibly removed her clothing below the waist and attempted to have sexual intercourse with her. The defendant admitted to consensual sexual activity, but denied having intercourse with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">After returning to a friend\u2019s house, the victim reported to police that she had been raped. The victim was then taken by police to Cambridge Hospital (hospital) where she was examined by a doctor. The doctor found abrasions and dried blood on the victim\u2019s labia. The physical examination of the victim revealed no evidence of semen in her vagina. Clothing tests, however, showed evidence of seminal fluid in the crotch of the victim\u2019s pants and on the defendant\u2019s underwear. Later, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>she and her mother were referred to a hospital psychiatrist or social worker for a psychological interview.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The defendant was arrested on the night the incident took place. On June 16, 1982, a grand jury returned an indictment charging the defendant with statutory rape under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant was found to be indigent and counsel was appointed for him on July 1. On July 21, the defendant\u2019s case was scheduled for trial on September 28, 1982, but it was continued three or four times.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On November 18, the Commonwealth and defense counsel answered ready for trial, which was then scheduled for the following Monday, November 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">1. <em>Continuance. </em>On the morning of November 22, the day that empanelment was to commence, the defendant\u2019s appointed counsel, Mr. Krashin, received a telephone call from a private attorney, Mr. Atkins, informing him that the defendant\u2019s family was interested in retaining Mr. Atkins as private counsel. Mr. Krashin requested the trial judge\u2019s permission to withdraw and sought a one-month continuance to provide Mr. Atkins with time to prepare the case. Mr. Krashin informed the trial judge that the defendant\u2019s family wanted to retain private counsel, but could not do so until the defendant\u2019s bail was revoked and the bail money returned to them. Mr. Atkins had not filed an appearance and initially was not present in court. The trial judge referred the matter to the motion judge who had heard the defendant\u2019s earlier request for new counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">Both attorneys appeared before the motion judge. Mr. Atkins indicated that he had not yet been retained by the defendant, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>that he was not yet ready to enter an appearance on the defendant\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Commonwealth opposed the continuance, since the prosecutor handling the case would have been unavailable on the new trial date. The prosecutor stated that he had established a \u201crapport\u201d with the victim, and contended that the request for substitution of counsel \u201chad more to do with the strength of the case than anything else.\u201d Nevertheless, the prosecutor expressed his willingness to agree to a shorter continuance and to provide Mr. Atkins immediately with all the discovery the prosecutor had at the time, as well as the substance of the prosecution witnesses\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Finding that Mr. Krashin was \u201cfully prepared\u201d and noting the lateness of the defendant\u2019s request, the motion judge refused Mr. Krashin\u2019s request to withdraw.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the motion judge invited Mr. Atkins to act as cocounsel, if he and the defendant\u2019s family so desired. The trial judge subsequently revoked the defendant\u2019s bail so that the bail money would be available to the family. Neither Mr. Atkins nor other private counsel was retained by the family to act as cocounsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The defendant argues that the motion judge\u2019s refusal to allow Mr. Krashin to withdraw and to grant a continuance enabling Mr. Atkins to appear as substitute counsel violated his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution to employ counsel of his own choice. We disagree, and decide that the motion judge acted within his discretion in denying these requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">As a general rule, \u201ca defendant should be afforded a fair opportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.\u201d <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 53 (1932). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>360 Mass. 695, 701 (1971). This right, however, \u201cis not abso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>lute, and may, in some circumstances, be subordinate to the proper administration of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>381 Mass. 500, 503 (1980). See, e.g., <em>Linton </em>v. <em>Perini, </em>656 F.2d 207, 211 (6th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1162 (1982); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>584 F.2d 485, 488-489 (D.C. Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1069 (1979); <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>545 F.2d 273, 278 (1st Cir. 1976). When the defendant seeks a continuance to substitute counsel at or near the time of trial, the judge must balance the defendant\u2019s right to choose his counsel with the interests of the court, the public, the victim, and the witnesses. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, supra </em>at 699-701. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilchrest, </em>364 Mass. 272, 276-277 (1973). There is no easy, mechanical test that the judge can apply in balancing these interests. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>371 Mass. 46, 51 (1976). <em>Ungar v. Sarafite, </em>376 U.S. 575, 589 (1964). Nor is there an all-inclusive list of factors for the judge to consider.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Instead, the judge must blend \u201can appreciation of the inevitable difficulties of trial administration with a concern for constitutional protections.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Poulack, </em>556 F.2d 83, 86 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 986 (1977). For these reasons, it is within the judge\u2019s discretion to determine whether, in the particular circumstances presented by each case, a continuance for change in counsel is warranted. <em>Lamoureux </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>353 Mass. 556, 560 (1968). <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>308 U.S. 444, 446 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">In this case, the defendant\u2019s request was made on the day that empanelment was scheduled to commence. This court has repeatedly stated that \u201ca defendant\u2019s freedom to change his counsel is restricted on the commencement of trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miskel, </em>364 Mass. 783, 791 (1974) (during jury empanelment). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diatchenko, </em>387 Mass. 718, 727 (1982) (during jury empanelment); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, supra </em>at 698 (day of trial); <em>Lamoureux </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>(second day of trial). The defendant has alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>no irreconcilable breakdown in communications with Mr. Krashin. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miskel, supra </em>at 790. No question was raised as to the experience, skill, or competence of Mr. Krashin, or to the manner in which he represented the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, supra </em>at 699. There was no showing that Mr. Krashin was unprepared to try the case or that the defendant would suffer prejudice by going to trial as scheduled. <em>See Lindsey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>331 Mass. 1, 4 (1954). The defendant had ample time (five months) to retain private counsel before the day of trial, and his failure to do so was the result of his own lack of diligence rather than of any error by the motion judge.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bettencourt, </em>361 Mass. 515, 517 (1972) (one month was adequate time to retain counsel); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>510 F.2d 507, 510-511 (2d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 426U.S. 923 (1976) (six months was \u201cgenerous\u201d time to retain counsel); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bragan, </em>499 F.2d 1376, 1379 (4th Cir. 1974) (two months sufficient). While the Commonwealth demonstrated some prejudice to its case as well as inconvenience to the victim and witnesses, \u201c[t]he defendant was asking for a change in counsel without stating any reasons therefor apart from claiming the right to counsel of his choice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, supra </em>at 699. In sum, the defendant has made no showing that the reliability of the trial process or the integrity of the adversary system was undermined. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 657-666 (1984); <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, 466 </em>U.S. 668, 691-695 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">We agree with the reasoning expressed in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bragan, supra, </em>that \u201cthe Constitution does not afford an accused, who has ample time to obtain counsel, the \u2018unbridled right\u2019 to insist that his trial be held in abeyance while he replaces one competent attorney with another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1379. In these circumstances, therefore, we hold that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>has shown no abuse of discretion in the denial of his request for a continuance to engage new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">2. <em>Hospital record. </em>At trial, the Commonwealth introduced in evidence, without objection, a portion of the victim\u2019s hospital record, identifying the physical tests performed by the hospital, their results, and the extent of the victim\u2019s injuries. The defendant sought to have admitted the remainder of the hospital record, which consisted of written notes taken during a psychological interview with the victim and her mother.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The judge excluded this portion of the hospital record. He found that either the psychotherapist-patient privilege, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, or social worker-client privilege, G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135, as amended, St. 1981, c. 91, \u00a7 1, applied,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that in any event the evidence was not exculpatory. The defendant objected to the exclusion, and claims that the evidence was exculpatory and that the Commonwealth failed to sustain its burden of showing that a privilege applied. We hold that the psychological evaluation portion of the hospital record was properly excluded.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The general rule is that \u201cwhen a part of a document is introduced by one party, the other is entitled to put in the remainder of it.\u201d <em>Noble v. Fagnant, </em>162 Mass. 275,286 (1894). <em>Nonni </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>356 Mass. 264, 267 (1969). <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Mason, 4 </em>Pick. 156, 158 (1826). The defendant in this case is not aided by that rule. In the case of a hospital record, the offering party must show that the evidence comports with the requirements of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>385 Mass. 639, 641-642 (1982); <em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>376 Mass. 524, 531 (1978). Therefore, it was the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>task to show that the psychological evaluation was admissible under the statute. The defendant has failed in this effort.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">In <em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, supra, </em>this court set forth a four-part analysis to determine whether material contained in a hospital record is admissible under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant has failed to show at least two of the required elements. Under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79, hospital records \u201cmay be admitted by the court, in its discretion, as evidence ... so far as such records relate to the treatment and medical history of such cases.\u201d The defendant made no attempt to demonstrate that psychological evaluation of an alleged rape victim taken to a hospital for a physical examination fits within the meaning of \u201ctreatment and medical history,\u201d as intended by the Legislature. Furthermore, in <em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, supra, </em>this court held that \u201cvoluntary statements of third persons appearing in the record are not admissible\u201d unless the statements have sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness or are not offered for the truth contained in them. <em>Id. </em>at 531. Since the victim\u2019s mother was also present at the psychological interview and the excluded statements were offered for their truth, the defendant must identify what information was attributable to the victim or to her mother, and if to her mother, whether the statements were supported by sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness to render them admissible under the <em>Bouchie </em>test. The defendant has made no such showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>3. <em>Knowledge of victim\u2019s age. </em>The defendant was convicted of assault on a child under sixteen with intent to commit a rape. G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 24B.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> He argues, however, that for the conviction to stand, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was aware that the victim was younger than sixteen. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>390 Mass. 480, 486 (1983), we stated that assault with intent to commit a rape on an underaged child is attempted statutory rape. The defendant does not dispute this determination. As Chief Justice Holmes stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peaslee, </em>177 Mass. 267, 271 (1901), an attempt is \u201can act which is intended to bring about the substantive crime and which sets in motion natural forces that would bring it about in the expected course of events.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDonald, 5 </em>Cush. 365, 367 (1850). Thus, \u201c[a]n assault with intent to rape includes every element of the crime of rape except penetration.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Stagg, </em>29 Ill. 2d 415, 417 (1963). <em>State </em>v. <em>Crofutt, </em>76 S.D. 77, 78 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The Commonwealth need only prove two elements to support a conviction under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, for statutory rape: \u201c(1) sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse, with (2) a child under sixteen years of age.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>385 Mass. 521, 522 (1982). In that case, we held that in a prosecution for statutory rape \u201cit is immaterial that the defendant reasonably believed that the victim was sixteen years of age or older.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>359 Mass. 509, 514-515 (1971). This is the rule in most jurisdictions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, supra </em>at 522-523, and cases cited. Similarly, in a prosecution for an assault with intent to commit statutory rape, this court has held that whether or not the defendant is aware of the victim\u2019s age is irrelevant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>165 Mass. 66, 70 (1895).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Toliver </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number><em>State, </em>267 Ind. 575, 576 (1978). As the Supreme Court of New Hampshire has held, \u201c[t]he fact that the defendant was ignorant of the age of [the victim] or that he did not intend the intercourse to be with a [person] of nonage would not prevent his act from constituting rape if completed, or an attempt, if it failed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>108 N.H. 158, 160-161 (1967). This result is entirely consistent within the framework of our laws pertaining to rape, and is not an infringement of any of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, supra. Nelson </em>v. <em>Moriarty, </em>484 F.2d 1034, 1035-1036 (1st Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Indeed, it would be incongruous for us to posit one rule for the completed act and another for the attempt. For this reason, we have held that the consent of the victim is no more a defense to an assault with intent to commit statutory rape than it is for the completed act. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roosnell, </em>143 Mass. 32, 36 (1886). In that case, this court held that \u201c[i]f, as all agree, it is immaterial upon a charge of committing the completed act, which includes an assault, no reason but an extremely technical one can be urged why it should not be so upon a charge of assault with intent to commit the completed act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41. This is simply a matter of common sense, for the policies underlying the rules in both cases are identical.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Legislature\u2019s intention was \u201cto put upon every one the burden of finding out whether his contemplated act is prohibited, and of refraining from it if it is.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number><em>supra </em>at 70. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>104 Ariz. 440, 442 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">We see no reason to depart from the logic of these cases. \u201cThe defendant in a statutory rape case does not lack the ability to comply with the law; he must simply abstain from sexual intercourse when there is even the remotest possibility that his partner is below the statutory age. . . . [The person] who contemplates intercourse with a partner of indeterminate age can resolve doubts in favor of compliance with the law without sacrificing behavior that society considers desirable.\u201d 78 Harv. L. Rev. 1257, 1258-1259 (1965).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Legislature has had ample opportunity to change the law if it disagreed with our interpretations of the statutory rape statutes. The reenactments and amendments of these statutes have not attempted to alter our decisions <em>(Nichols </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>217 Mass. 548, 551 [1914]), and this legislative silence shows \u201cthat the Legislature intended to exclude mistaken belief as to the age of the victim as a defense to the crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>385 Mass. 521, 524 (1982). The Commonwealth was not required to prove the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the victim\u2019s age, and the indictment therefore properly omitted any reference to that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b27-8\"> On April 19,1982, the defendant was twenty-three or twenty-four years old.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b28-8\"> The record establishes neither the identity of the person conducting the interview nor that person\u2019s professional qualifications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b28-9\"> General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 23, as amended by St. 1974, c. 474, \u00a7 3, states: \u201cWhoever unlawfully has sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse, and abuses a child under sixteen years of age shall... be punished</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b28-10\"> The record does not indicate at whose request the continuances were made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b28-11\"> On November 5, 1982, the defendant had appeared before the motion judge and requested that new counsel be appointed for him.

Fourth, voluntary statements of third persons appearing in the record are not admissible unless they are offered for reasons other than to prove the truth of the matter contained therein or, if offered for their truth, come within another exception to the hearsay rule or the general principles discussed supra.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>376 Mass. 524, 531 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b34-7\"> General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 24B, as amended through St. 1978, c. 379, \u00a7 2, provides: \u201cWhoever assaults a child under sixteen with intent to commit a rape, as defined in section thirty-nine of chapter two hundred and seventy-seven, shall be punished . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">General Laws c. 277, \u00a7 39, as amended by St. 1980, c. 459, \u00a7 8, defines \u201crape\u201d in part as \u201csexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse with a child under sixteen years of age.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b34-9\"> The defendant seeks to distinguish <em>Murphy </em>on the ground that the facts in that case dealt with an actual physical attempt to penetrate, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>a technical assault. This case involves an attempt to penetrate, not a technical assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b35-7\"> In order to convict a defendant of statutory rape, the Commonwealth need not prove the victim\u2019s lack of consent. The law conclusively presumes that those under sixteen years of age are not sufficiently mature to understand fully the physical, mental, and emotional consequences of sexual intercourse, and are therefore incapable of making a rational decision about whether to consent to such conduct. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>373 Mass. 577, 582-583 (1977); <em>Glover </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>299 Mass. 55, 58-59 (1937). Even if the victim had so convincingly misrepresented her age as to give rise to a reasonable belief that she was older than sixteen, a consideration of the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s belief would circumvent the rule that consent is no defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b35-8\"> Since this policy remains appropriate, we need not consider whether other reasons advanced by the <em>Murphy </em>court continue to be justified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\"> The judge instructed that the defendant must have had \u201cthe specific intent of having intercourse\u201d to be found guilty of assault on a child under sixteen with intent to commit a rape. Thus, there is no support for the defendant\u2019s contention that a tap on the shoulder or a wink, if made with a state of mind merely desirous of intercourse, would be criminal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
