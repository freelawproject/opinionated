Rule 1:03, as appearing in 382 Mass. 700 (1981), the following question of State law: \u201cDoes Chapter 93A of the Massachusetts General Laws apply to conduct alleged to violate Section 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder?\" We answer the question: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-15\">The certified question arises in an action by the plaintiff, a publicly held corporation, against the defendants Baddour and Rosen, the chairman of the board of directors and the former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>president of Energy Resources Co., Inc. (ERCO), respectively. The plaintiff contends that it was fraudulently induced to purchase ERCO stock by the defendants\u2019 misrepresentations and material omissions regarding the company\u2019s financial condition. Shortly after the purchase, ERCO filed for bankruptcy. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that the defendants\u2019 actions violated \u00a7 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) (1982), andRule 10b-5,17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5 (1984), promulgated thereunder; constituted fraud, deceit, and negligent misrepresentation; and violated G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 11. The plaintiff seeks actual damages of $1,400,000 or triple that amount, as provided in G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, if the court should find that the defendants knowingly and wilfully committed unfair or deceptive trade practices in violation of c. 93A, \u00a7 2. The defendants moved to dismiss the c. 93A count, arguing that the statute does not apply to securities transactions. No action has been taken on their motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The defendant Baddour requested certification of the question now before this court. He contends that the Federal securities laws preempt application of c. 93A to the transaction at issue; that application of c. 93A to securities sales would violate the commerce clause of the United States Constitution, Article 1, \u00a7 8, cl. 3, by impermissibly burdening interstate commerce; and that the Legislature did not intend c. 93A to apply to securities transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Although Baddour has devoted considerable attention, in both his brief and argument, to the preemption issue, this court is not the proper forum to decide the matter. We see nothing in the certification request to suggest that we have been asked to consider preemption, which is a Federal question over which the Federal courts have original jurisdiction. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Delta Air Lines, </em>463 U.S. 85, 96 n.14 (1983). Our role is necessarily limited to answering certified \u201cquestions of [the] law of this State.\u201d S.J.C. Rule 1:03, as appearing in 382 Mass. 700 (1981). Therefore we restrict our inquiry to whether, as a matter of State law, c. 93A was intended to cover securities transactions of the type involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">On this issue, the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts are divided. Their differences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>focus upon the implications of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 <em>(b), </em>as amended by St. 1978, c. 459, \u00a7 2, which states that, in determining what constitutes \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce,\u201d courts are to be \u201cguided by the interpretations given by the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Courts to section 5 (a) (1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act.\u201d Finding that the Federal Trade Commission Act has never been applied to securities transactions, which are regulated by the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78a-d (1982), two of the Federal judges have concluded that this court would similarly limit the scope of c. 93A. See <em>Conkling </em>v. <em>Moseley, Hallgarten, Estabrook &amp; Weeden, Inc., </em>575 F. Supp. 760 (D. Mass. 1983); <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Keystone Provident Life Ins. Co., </em>578 F. Supp. 31 (D. Mass. 1983). Relying upon <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>373 Mass. 72, 75 (1977), and <em>Raymer v. Bay State Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>384 Mass. 310, 319 (1981), in which we held c. 93A applicable to the insurance and banking industries, respectively, four Federal judges have held that we would similarly expand the scope of c. 93A to encompass securities transactions, despite the guidelines set out in c. 93A, \u00a7 2 <em>(b). Hickey </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>598 F. Supp. 1105 (D. Mass. 1984). <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>No. 82-3300, slip op. at 8-9 (D. Mass. June 9, <em>1983).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> Mitchelson </em>v. <em>Aviation Simulation Technology, Inc., </em>582 F. Supp. 1 (D. Mass. 1983). <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Josephthal &amp; Co., </em>No. 82-913, slip op. at 8-11 (D. Mass. June 29, 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">We do not agree that <em>Dodd </em>and <em>Raymer </em>provide precedent for extending the reach of c. 93A to the securities field. While insurance and banking are \u201careas in which the states have long played a primary role in regulation . . . [a]t least since 1933, federal law has largely superseded state regulation of securities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>transactions.\u201d <em>Conkling, supra </em>at 761. Thus, although we have applied c. 93A to industries not subject to the Federal Trade Commission Act, such industries have been primarily regulated by the State. See <em>Dodd, supra </em>at 79 n.6 (\u201cFTCA \u00a7 5 (a) (1) does not cover Massachusetts insurance practices <em>because </em>these practices are subject to Massachusetts regulation\u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">In the case of securities transactions, there is additional evidence that the Legislature did not intend c. 93 A to regulate the field. On July 9, 1972, by St. 1972, c. 614, \u00a7 2, the Legislature enacted c. 93A, \u00a711, which provides for injunctive relief, damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs to any person who engages in the conduct of any trade or commerce and suffers injury as a result of \u201can unfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act or practice.\u201d Section 11 further states that \u201crecovery shall be in the amount of actual damages; or up to three, but not less than two, times such amount if the court finds that the use or employment of the method of competition or the act or practice was . . . willful or knowing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Just four days later, on July 13, 1972, the Legislature, by St. 1972, c. 694, \u00a7 1, enacted G. L. c. 110A, the Uniform Securities Act, which is derived from and is to be coordinated with the Federal securities laws. G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 415. General Laws c. 110A provides a comprehensive regulatory scheme for the registration and sale of securities. Section 101 prohibits fraud in connection with the sale or purchase of any security in language substantially the same as that employed in the Federal Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7q (a) (1982). Section 102 prohibits fraudulent practices on the part of investment advisors. The sanctions for violations of these sections include injunctive proceedings initiated by the Secretary of the Commonwealth (\u00a7 408), and criminal prosecution for wilful violations (\u00a7 409).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In \u00a7 410, the Legislature established a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>private right of action<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for persons induced to purchase securities \u201cby means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to state a material fact.\u201d The defrauded purchaser \u201cmay sue either at law or in equity to recover the consideration paid for the security, together with interest at six per cent per year from the date of payment, costs, and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, less the amount of any income received on the security, upon the tender of the security . . . .\u201d If he has disposed of the security, the purchaser is entitled to sue for damages in the amount he would have recovered upon a tender less the value he received upon disposition. Unlike G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 11, there is no provision in c. 110A for the recovery of punitive or multiple damages. Nor may an aggrieved individual seek injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">In <em>Reiter Oldsmobile, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>378 Mass. 707 (1979), we considered whether a plaintiff was entitled to injunctive relief under c. 93A, \u00a7 11, where the action complained of, unfair competition in the automotive industry, was specifically prohibited by G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 3. Assuming that the defendant\u2019s conduct violated both the general provisions of c. 93A, \u00a72 <em>(a), </em>and the more specific provisions of c. 93B, \u00a7 3 <em>(a), </em>we held that the latter statute prescribed the plaintiff\u2019s remedies. We noted that c. 93B, like c. 110A, \u201cwas enacted after c. 93A and applies specifically to unfairness in one industry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 711. At the time the plaintiff in <em>Reiter </em>commenced its action, c. 93B, \u00a7 12, did not provide for injunctive relief. <em>Reiter, supra </em>at 709.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cThe two statutes may overlap <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>in their coverage, but in the case of a conflict, the provisions of the specific statute must govern. ... To hold otherwise would be to overlook the careful limitation on private remedies in c. 93B and render much of the statute surplusage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 711. We distinguished the result in <em>Reiter </em>from that reached in <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>373 Mass. 72, 76-78 (1977), reasoning that \u201c[ujnlike c. 93B, c. 176D made no provision for private actions,\u201d and therefore the latter did not comprehensively regulate unfair or deceptive insurance practices. <em>Reiter, supra </em>at 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">It is clear that the Uniform Securities Act was intended to provide comprehensive regulation of the securities field. See <em>Giordano </em>v. <em>Auditore, </em>355 Mass. 254, 257 (1969) (Sale of Securities Act, predecessor to the Uniform Securities Act, was intended as a comprehensive regulatory scheme). It differs from c. 93A in several critical respects,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> including its limitation on private rights of action and the nature and scope of relief provided. Having enacted c. 93A, \u00a7 11 \u2014 which allows an unlimited private right of action, injunctive relief, and multiple damages for wilful statutory violations \u2014 only four days before enacting the carefully crafted remedial provisions of c. 110A, the Legislature was presumably aware of the import of such differences. It is unlikely that the Legislature intended to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>a defrauded purchaser of securities to claim remedies under c. 93 A which are provided neither in c. 110A, nor in its Federal counterpart, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j (b) (1982). See <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Amherst, </em>372 Mass. 46, 51 (1977) (court must assume Legislature was aware of preexisting statute, and subsequent statute is to be interpreted in harmony with prior enactments). While G. L. c. 110A, \u00a7 410 <em>(h), </em>includes a saving clause preserving \u201crights and remedies . . . that may exist at law or in equity,\u201d other jurisdictions have interpreted this language as simply preserving a purchaser\u2019s right to pursue his common law remedies for fraud. See <em>Ging </em>v. <em>Parker-Hunter Inc., </em>544 F. Supp. 49, 52 (W.D. Pa. 1982); <em>Interlox Punch &amp; Die Corp. </em>v. <em>Insilco Corp., </em>174 N.J. Super. 175, 177 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">For these reasons we conclude that the Legislature did not intend c. 93A to apply to securities transactions of the type involved here, and, consequently, we answer \u201cNo\u201d to the question that has been certified to us.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Although <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., supra, </em>dealt with commodities trading, the judge in that case stated that \u201c[tjhere is nothing in the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s interpretations of ch. 93A that would justify varying treatment of commodities trading and securities violations. Accordingly, I conclude that the Massachusetts courts would allow a 93A action for commodities trading violations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b739-7\">General Laws c. 110A, \u00a7 410 <em>(h), </em>states in part that \u201cthis chapter does not create any cause of action not specified in this section.\u201d The intent of this proviso was evidently to preclude the creation of an implied private right of action in \u00a7\u00a7 101 and 102. See Uniform Securities Act, \u00a7 101, Commissioners\u2019 Note, 7A U.L.A. 568-569 (1956) (amended 1958); <em>Mar</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number><em>garet Hall Found., Inc. </em>v. <em>Atlantic Fin. Management, </em>572 F. Supp. 1475, 1483 (D. Mass. 1983) (c. 110A, \u00a7 410 [a], does not specifically provide for a private right of action under either \u00a7 101 or \u00a7 102).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b740-9\"> Other jurisdictions which have adopted the Uniform Securities Act recognize a private right of action under the sections analogous to c. 110A, \u00a7 410. See, e.g., <em>Noland </em>v. <em>Gurley, </em>566 F. Supp. 210, 215 (D. Colo. 1983); <em>Colonial Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>American Bankshares Corp., </em>478 F. Supp. 1186, 1190 (E.D. Wis. 1979), aff\u2019d sub nom. <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst, </em>625 F.2d 151 (7th Cir. 1980); <em>Held </em>v. <em>Product Mfg. Co., </em>286 Or. 67 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b740-10\"> Before the appeal in <em>Reiter, supra, </em>reached this court, the Legislature, by St. 1977, c. 717, \u00a7 5, amended c. 93B, \u00a7 12, and in anew \u00a7 12A, provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>for injunctive relief while at the same time eliminating the right to receive multiple damages for wilful statutory violations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b741-10\"> We note the existence of additional differences between G. L. c. 93A and the Federal securities laws, after which c. 110A is patterned, with regard to disclosure duties and standards of fault. Compare <em>Lowell Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>377 Mass. 37, 51 (1979) (under c. 93A, nondisclosure is deceptive \u201cif it could reasonably be found to have caused a person to act differently from the way he otherwise would have acted\u201d), with <em>Chiarella </em>v. <em>United States, </em>445 U.S. 222, 227-230 (1980) (duty to disclose under \u00a7 10 [b] arises from existence of fiduciary relationship between corporate insiders and stockholders). Compare <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., </em>366 Mass. 688, 703-704 (1975) (for liability under c. 93A \u201cit is not necessary to establish that the defendant knew that the representation was false\u201d), with <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst </em>v. <em>Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 201 (1976) (proof of scienter is required for liability under \u00a7 10 [b] and rule 10b-5). However, we regard these differences as more germane to a consideration of the Federal preemption issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
