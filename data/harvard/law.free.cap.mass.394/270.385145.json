L. c. 93A action may not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>awarded by a trial judge unless the appellate court indicates that such an award may be made by the trial court; (2) interest should not be allowed on an award of G. L. c. 93A counsel fees for services at the trial court level; and (3) interest on G. L. c. 93A damages is payable under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B, in this case at the rate applicable at the time the damages were assessed in the trial court and not at the rate applicable under \u00a7 6B, as amended, at the time of the final appellate action affirming the judgment below. <em>Patry </em>v. <em>Liberty Mobilehome Sales, Inc., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 1102 (1984). We agree with the conclusions of the Appeals Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">We describe the procedural background that gives rise to the issues on appeal. The plaintiffs were initially unsuccessful in this action under G. L. c. 93A, and judgment was entered for the defendant in October, 1978. The plaintiffs appealed, and in June, 1980, the Appeals Court ordered the judgment for the defendant to be reversed and remanded the case for the determination of damages and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Patry </em>v. <em>Harmony Homes, Inc., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 1 (1980). On October 7, 1981, a judge determined the plaintiffs\u2019 damages and allowed attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The defendant then appealed. On April 27, 1983, the Appeals Court affirmed the judgment. <em>Patry </em>v. <em>Liberty Mobilhome Sales, Inc., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 701 (1983). The Appeals Court made no reference to an allowance of attorney\u2019s fees on appeal, nor did the plaintiffs request any such allowance by that court. This court denied the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review. <em>Patry </em>v. <em>Liberty Mobilhome Sales, Inc., </em>389 Mass. 1104 (1983). Thereafter, on August 1, 1983, a trial judge awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiffs with respect to the defendant\u2019s appeal. On September 9, 1983, that judge entered a further order that the plaintiffs were entitled to interest at 8% on their G. L. c. 93A damages from the date of the commencement of the action. He also ruled that the plaintiffs were entitled to interest on the award of attorney\u2019s fees from the date of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The defendant\u2019s appeal challenges (1) the allowance of appellate attorney\u2019s fees and (2) the allowance of interest on the amount of trial attorney\u2019s fees awarded. The plaintiffs\u2019 appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>seeks a determination that interest should have been allowed at the rate of 12% instead of 8%. The summary orders of the Appeals Court correctly decided each of these issues in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">1. Where the Appeals Court gave no directive concerning the allowance by the trial court of appellate attorney\u2019s fees, the trial court had no authority to award such fees under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (4). See <em>Mellor </em>v. <em>Berman, </em>390 Mass. 275, 284 (1983) (construing G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B [7]). We have treated as discretionary in the appellate court the award of attorney\u2019s fees on appeal where a statute provides for the payment of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. See <em>Mellor </em>v. <em>Berman, supra', Torres </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>391 Mass. 1, 16 (1984) (considering G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3B, and a violation of G. L. c. 66A, the Fair Information Practices Act); <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. 381, 389 (1979) (considering G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11 <em>); Darmetko </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>378 Mass. 758, 765 (1979) (considering G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14). In these cases in our discretion we either rejected the award of attorney\u2019s fees in the appeal before us, as in the <em>Mellor </em>case, or, as in the other cases, directed that the trial judge could consider the award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees on the appeal. Where, however, the appellate court has not directed otherwise, the award of attorney\u2019s fees under a statute must be limited to trial proceedings. The award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees in this case was not authorized by the Appeals Court, and thus the trial court judge had no authority to allow them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We decline the plaintiffs\u2019 invitation to reopen the question at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">2. No interest should have been allowed on the amount of trial court attorney\u2019s fees. Attorney\u2019s fees are not part of the damages suffered in a G. L. c. 93A action. See G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 9 (4) and 11. On the question of allowing interest they are more analogous to costs. Of course, if attorney\u2019s fees are part of a plaintiff\u2019s damages, as they may be, for example, in a civil contempt action (see <em>Coyne Indus. Laundry of Schenec</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number><em>tady, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>359 Mass. 269, 277 [1971]), interest should be awarded on the attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">3. The judge correctly concluded that interest was payable at the rate of 8% on the plaintiffs\u2019 G. L. c. 93A damages found by the trial court on October 7, 1981. The plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to interest at the rate of 12% as provided by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B, as amended by St. 1982, c. 183, \u00a7 2. The 12% rate stated in G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B, applies to all actions in which damages are assessed on or after the effective date of the act. St. 1982, c. 183, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs contend that damages were not assessed until 1983, when the Appeals Court affirmed the judgment awarding them damages and this court denied the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The damages were assessed by the trial court in 1981. The appellate process did not alter the judgment based on that assessment. Affirmation of a judgment does not involve the assessment of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">4.

L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B (St. 1980, c. 322, \u00a7 2), increasing the interest rate to 10%, applied only to actions commenced on or after its effective date.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
