L. c. 127, \u00a7 97.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, the commissioner asks us to overrule that portion of <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>8 Gray 329 (1857), which holds that a person may not be sentenced to the State prison unless that person has been indicted by a grand jury. The commissioner urges us to hold that he may transfer any sentenced prisoner to the State prison pursuant to G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 97, even if the prisoner\u2019s conviction is based on a complaint. We decline to depart from the rule of <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Robbins, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">There is no dispute as to the material facts. On July 23, 1981, after pleading guilty in the District Court to four complaints of breaking and entering, larceny, and possessiop of burglarious instruments, the plaintiff was sentenced to four concurrent indefinite terms at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Concord. See G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 31. The plaintiff was never indicted for those offenses. He remained at MCI Concord for about three months, whereupon he was transferred to MCI Walpole as a \u201cserious safety and security threat.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 97. Except for a brief transfer to the Southeastern Correctional Center at Bridgewater in early 1982, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>tiff was housed at MCI Walpole until his release on parole on October 31, 1983.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The plaintiff began the instant action seeking monetary and injunctive relief in the Superior Court on November 12, 1982. He claimed that his physical confinement at 'MCI Walpole violated his right, guaranteed by art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, to be free of \u201cinfamous punishment\u201d except on an indictment. A judge denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order, and the plaintiff\u2019s subsequent motion for a preliminary injunction was denied on December 22, 1982. A single justice of the Appeals Court denied the plaintiff\u2019s petition for relief (G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118), on February 14, 1983. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment, and on September 19, 1983, a judge of the Superior Court granted partial summary judgment for the plaintiff. The judge ruled that G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 97, \u201cinsofar as it authorizes the defendant [commissioner] administratively to transfer an inmate serving a Concord sentence to Walpole, is unconstitutional if the inmate was not indicted and did not waive indictment.\u201d The plaintiff amended his complaint, on December 22, 1983, striking his demands for injunctive and monetary relief and substituting a prayer for declaratory relief. Final judgment was entered on January 12,1984.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The commissioner appealed. Both parties filed applications for direct appellate review. We granted their applications. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The plaintiff appropriately relies on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>8 Gray 329 (1857), for his proposition that \u201cit has been black-letter law since 1857 that article 12 prohibits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>punishment in the state prison of a person who has not been afforded the right to indictment or presentment by a grand jury.\u201d Indeed, the <em>Jones </em>court\u2019s explication of art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights led it \u201cto a strong conclusion of the general understanding of the legislators and jurists of Massachusetts, that punishment in the state prison is an infamous punishment, and cannot be imposed without both indictment and trial by jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349. That conclusion has been reaffirmed in recent years. See <em>Lataille </em>v. <em>District Court of E. Hampden, </em>366 Mass. 525, 531-532 (1974). See also Wilkins, Judicial Treatment of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights in Relation to Cognate Provisions of the United States Constitution, 14 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 887, 924 n.220 (1980). The plaintiff argues syllogistically that, if punishment in the State prison cannot be imposed without indictment under <em>Jones, </em>and if MCI Walpole is the \u201cstate prison,\u201d G. L. c. 125, \u00a7 1 (o),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>388 Mass. 115, 123 (1983), then his confinement without indictment at MCI Walpole was in violation of art. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The commissioner contends that the <em>Jones </em>rule should be confined \u201cto the rights and protections of an accused criminal defendant.\u201d He argues that such rights do not include that of \u201ca state sentenced inmate not to be transferred to MCI Walpole at any time . . . unless the criminal procedure which initiated the state custody included an indictment, or waiver of same.\u201d The commissioner maintains that such a right would impede, without justification, \u201cthe unfettered authority [of the executive branch] to transfer a state inmate to the state prison, once that inmate has been sentenced and delivered into the custody of the defendant Commissioner of Correction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">We reject this reasoning. Article 12 prohibits the sentencing of a criminal defendant to State prison without indictment. The exercise by the executive branch of \u201cunfettered authority,\u201d under G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 97, to transfer a criminal defendant to MCI Walpole at a date subsequent to sentencing would seriously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>undermine the protection afforded by art. 12. We recognize the legitimate penological purposes of G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 97, as well as the commissioner\u2019s broader duty to \u201cmaintain security, safety and order at all state correctional facilities . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 1 <em>(b). </em>In the instant circumstances, however, art. 12 demands that the Commonwealth anticipate the security risks presented by the criminal defendant. In the event that such risks indicate the advisability of confinement in the State prison, the Commonwealth may confront the defendant at the outset with the full gravity of his potential punishment and proceed against him by indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">A criminal defendant may, of course, waive indictment. See <em>DeGolyer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>314 Mass. 626, 632-633 (1943); G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 4A, as appearing in St. 1934, c. 358, later amended by St. 1979, c. 344, \u00a7 18. The commissioner here maintains that that, in fact, was what the plaintiff did: \u201cBy pleading guilty in District Court plaintiff Brown acknowledged that the state had probable cause and a proper foundation upon which to proceed.\u201d But the plaintiff could not waive a right which he did not possess. \u201cBecause the defendant tried in District Court is not subject to a sentence to state prison, there is no right to be proceeded against by indictment.\u201d Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Crim. P. 3 (b), Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Criminal Procedure at 23 (1979). See G. L. c. 218, \u00a7\u00a7 27, 27A <em>(d), </em>as amended through St. 1979, c. 344, \u00a7 3 (District Court may not impose sentence to State prison).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The commissioner contends, nonetheless, that the plaintiff\u2019s guilty pleas were an \u201caffirmative act of making the request\u201d that the District Court retain jurisdiction, see G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 4, and, as such, constituted \u00e1 waiver of the right to indictment. The decision to retain jurisdiction, however, is entirely that of the judge. <em>Corey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>364 Mass. 137, 143 n.9 (1973). That decision must be made before the criminal defendant may enter a guilty plea. Once the decision to retain jurisdiction is made by the judge, there is nothing a defendant may do. Thus, the commissioner\u2019s claim of waiver has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Finally, the commissioner argues that the <em>Jones </em>rule is an anachronism. The <em>Jones </em>court described confinement in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>State prison as follows: \u201cThe convict is placed in a public place of punishment, common to the whole state, subject to solitary imprisonment, to have his hair cropped, to be clothed in conspicuous prison dress, subjected to hard labor without pay, to hard fare, coarse and meagre food, and to severe discipline.\u201d <em>Jones, supra </em>at 349. Much has changed since 1857. Nevertheless we agree with the Superior Court judge that \u201calthough the differences between confinement at Walpole and at other correctional institutions may have diminished, Walpole, as a practical matter is the maximum security prison in the state which houses the most serious and dangerous criminals.\u201d Thus, the State prison retains the \u201ccharacter of infamy\u201d and the <em>Jones </em>rule remains viable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b105-17\"> Massachusetts Constitution, Part I, art. 12, provides in part that \u201cthe legislature shall not make any law, that shall subject any person to a capital or infamous punishment, excepting for the government of the army and navy, without trial by jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b106-6\"> General Laws c. 127, \u00a7 97, as appearing in St. 1968, c. 627, provides: \u201cThe commissioner may transfer any sentenced prisoner from one correctional institution of the commonwealth to another, and with the approval of the sheriff of the county from any such institution except a prisoner serving a life sentence to any jail or house of correction, or a sentenced prisoner from any jail or house of correction to any such institution except the state prison, or from any jail or house of correction to any other jail or house of correction.

See generally 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 421.06(4), 421.07 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b107-8\"> The commissioner argues that \u201c[d]espite the fact that inmate Brown has been discharged from the custody of the defendants, this appeal should not be deemed moot.... [T]he issues presented remain live as to the Commissioner\u2019 rights and authority.\u201d We agree. Because indeterminate sentences are typically short, see Mass. R. Crim. P. 3 (i&gt;)(l), Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Crim. P. 3 (b), Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Criminal Procedure at 23 (1979), the issue may evade review. See <em>Karchmar </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>364 Mass. 124, 136 (1973). The parties have asked us to reach the merits of this appeal and we believe we should do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\"> We note that by virtue of St. 1984, c. 357, the state prison has been renamed M.C.I.
