Jorgensen filed an application for unemployment benefits with the Division of Employment Security (division). Her application was denied pursuant to G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>appealed from this denial. A hearing was held before a review examiner on April 7, 1983, and May 20, 1983. The review examiner concluded that she had been properly disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation benefits under G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2). Jorgensen appealed to the board of review (board), which denied her application for review, thereby making the decision of the director the final decision of the board. See. G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 41 (c). Jorgensen then sought judicial review in the Northampton District Court in accordance with G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 42. The District Court judge set aside the decision of the director, holding, without specific findings, that the director\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. The MMEP appeals the judgment of the District Court judge to this court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">MMEP argues that the District Court judge erred in holding that the review examiner\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. See G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 42; G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7); G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6), as amended through St. 1979, c. 795, \u00a7 3 (\u201c \u2018Substantial evidence\u2019 means such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d). See also <em>Rioni </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>392 Mass. 436, 438 (1984), and <em>New Boston Garden Corp. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 456, 465-467 (1981). We hold that the review examiner\u2019s findings and conclusion are supported by substantial evidence, and we reverse the judgment of the District Court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">We summarize the findings of the review examiner. Janice Jorgensen worked for several years as project coordinator for the western regional office of MMEP, a federally-funded educational program for the children of migrant workers. In meetings on September 2 and 3, 1982, Jorgensen and her assistant, Mollie Babize, among others, were informed by their superiors of a \u201cmajor policy initiative\u201d for fiscal year 1983, to be effective October 1, 1982 (the start of the 1983 fiscal year). Under that initiative, no one was to commit program funds without the written consent of the State director or the State program <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>coordinator. Funds committed without prior approval would have to be reimbursed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On September 9 and 10, 1982, other staff meetings were held at which a $2,000,000 reduction in the budget for fiscal year 1983 was announced.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This reduction represented a large share of the over-all budget and necessitated a substantial reduction in services for migrant children. Furthermore, inasmuch as fiscal year 1983 was to start three weeks later on October 1, 1982, the announcement of the budget cut threw the program into a \u201cstate of turmoil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Jorgensen and Babize devised a plan to offset the immediate effects of the budget reduction. Jorgensen authorized Babize to instruct eight employees of the western region to indicate on their September 22, 1982, payroll sheets seventy hours of work not actually performed. Jorgensen further instructed Babize to approve these falsified payroll sheets, thus enabling the teachers to be paid for work not yet performed. The plan was for the teachers to perform the prepaid seventy hours of work after the end of the 1982 fiscal year, i.e., after their contracts would have terminated. The plan called for them to keep records of their work. As of the time of Jorgensen\u2019s discharge, most of these employees were off the payroll, and none of them had performed the full seventy hours of work. Jorgensen had no authorization for her plan. In addition, she approved the payment of promotional wages without authorization. Jorgensen left for a prepaid vacation shortly after this scheme was devised, and Babize carried out the plan in Jorgensen\u2019s absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">Jorgensen was discharged on November 24, 1982, \u201cfor falsification of payroll records by requesting and approving preimbursement |&gt;zc] of work to be performed by subordinates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>at a later date.\u201d Shortly after Jorgensen\u2019s superiors became aware of the falsification of the payroll sheets, they reported the wrongdoing to the Inspector General<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in accordance with a directive from the United States Office of Management and Budget. The Inspector General\u2019s office conducted an audit of the MMEP, which was still pending at the time of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The review examiner found that Jorgensen\u2019s discharge \u201cwas due solely to deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of employing unit interests within the meaning of Section 25 (e) (2).\u201d The review examiner stated that, while Jorgensen contended that \u201cher only motivation was to circumvent budgetary restrictions and keep the program going,\u201d she, as \u201ca member of senior management. . . was aware of employer procedures, [and] . . . had only shortly been told that no one had the right to commit program funds for wages[,] equipment[,] or [proposals] without the express [] permission of upper management.\u201d He found that as \u201ca member of senior management .. . she was aware of the employing unit\u2019s method of operations and its goals.\u201d He also found that \u201con her own the claimant deliberately violated these instructions for her own convenience,\u201d and stated that \u201c[s]he could give no reason for her failure to submit a proposal to have the services placed on the master budget other than [that] she was about to go on a prepaid vacation and did not have the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">We are of the opinion that the review examiner\u2019s findings and conclusion are supported by substantial evidence in the record. The record indicates that Jorgensen held the position of project coordinator for six and one-half years and that, as such, she was a member of \u201csenior management.\u201d It was her responsibility to verify the accuracy of the payroll register. In her testimony, Jorgensen admitted that she had authorized Babize to approve the payment of wages for work not yet performed, and she did not dispute that this involved a falsification of payroll records. The State director of MMEP, in the discharge letter which he sent to Jorgensen, stated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>reason for her discharge was the \u201cact of authorizing and approving the falsification of payroll documentation so as to permit the claiming of credit and receipt of wages for work not done.\u201d The MMEP program coordinator testified that Jorgensen was terminated because she \u201chad broken a basic Fiscal rule that is a well-known principle that. . . public documents . . . dealing with public funds have to be accurate and correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">\u201cThe apparent purpose of \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2). . . is to deny benefits to a claimant who has brought about [her] own unemployment through intentional disregard of standards of behavior which [her] employer has a right to expect.\u201d <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>377 Mass. 94, 97 (1979). For a claimant to be denied benefits under G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2), he or she must have perpetrated an act of \u201cdeliberate misconduct,\u201d <em>and </em>this act must have been in \u201cwilful disregard\u201d of the employing unit\u2019s interest. <em>DiNatale </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 655, 657 (1985). <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>387 Mass. 776, 779 (1982). <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment </em>Sec., 375 Mass. 434,436 (1978). As we frequently have stated, \u201cthe critical issue in determining whether disqualification is warranted is the claimant\u2019s state of mind in performing the acts that cause [her] discharge.\u201d <em>Garfield, supra. </em>See, e.g., <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec. </em>v. <em>Mattapoisett, 392 </em>Mass. 858, 863 (1984); <em>DiNatale, supra; </em>and <em>Torres, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">There is no question that in directing the falsification of payroll records Jorgensen perpetrated an act of deliberate misconduct. She claims, however, that she did not do so in \u201cwilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest.\u201d Jorgensen testified that her only motivation was to \u201cget the educational plans in motion for the children we were serving.\u201d Assuming this motivation to save the program from the possibly drastic effects of the large budget cut to be commendable, the review examiner\u2019s finding that she acted in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest remains legally correct. As he found, she was an experienced senior manager of the program, and she was aware of the program\u2019s procedures, methods, and goals. Thus, the review examiner could infer that she knew the jeopardy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>into which she threw the federally-funded program by directing the falsification of payroll records. Clearly, MMEP has a reasonable interest in maintaining accurate payroll records to comply with Federal law, if for no other reason than to ensure its survival as a federally-funded program. See <em>Garfield, supra </em>(discussing the factor of the reasonableness of the employer\u2019s expectation). The seniority of her position, her years of experience, her demonstrated competence, and the obviousness of the potential danger into which she placed the program by her act of deliberate misconduct \u2014 provide substantial evidence for the review examiner\u2019s finding that her state of mind was such that she acted in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is no basis for her claim that, at worst, she suffered \u201ca good faith lapse in judgment.\u201d <em>Garfield, supra. </em>Rather, the evidence supports the finding that hers was an act of deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest. She was properly disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation benefits under G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 (e) (2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed. Judgment is to be entered in favor of the director of the Division of Employment Security.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b816-15\">General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 25, as amended through St. 1982, c. 489, \u00a7 5, provides, in part: \u201c[N]o benefits shall be paid to an individual under this chapter ... .(e) For the period of unemployment next ensuing and until the individual has had at least four weeks of work and in each of said weeks has earned an amount equivalent to or in excess of his weekly benefit amount after he has left his work ...

This discrepancy is of no significance to the over-all outcome of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b819-7\">MMEP is a Federal grant recipient. Its records are subject to audit by the Office of the Inspector General of the United States Department of Education.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b821-7\">In essence, the review examiner found that she was aware of the prohibition against falsification of records. He also found that she violated the edict given at the meetings on September 9 and 10, 1982, prohibiting the commitment of fiscal year 1983 funds without prior approval. We consider it unnecessary to address his findings regarding her not having sought approval for the additional commitment because to do so was inconvenient in light of her prepaid vacation plans.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b821-8\">Jorgensen argues that the judgment of the District Court judge should be upheld even if the decision of the review examiner is supported by substantial evidence, on the basis that the examiner failed to make findings on two issues of material fact: the issue of Jorgensen\u2019s state of mind and the issue of gender discrimination. See <em>Manias </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>388 Mass. 201, 204-206 (1983). As discussed in the text, the findings with respect to her state of mind were adequate. No finding was required on the issue of gender discrimination because, although the issue was raised at the hearing through questions by Jorgensen\u2019s counsel, no evidence was submitted to support the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
