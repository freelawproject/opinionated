The victim was shot and killed on December 3, 1978, in a motor vehicle in Somerville.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">In the spring of 1981, one Francis X. Holmes, Jr., who had been arrested for another crime, told the police that he had been an accomplice of the defendant in committing the crimes in 1978. Holmes ultimately testified as an immunized witness at the trial. After the defendant had been arrested for the murder, he was held in the Middlesex County house of correction in Billerica (Billerica). While there, according to the testimony of a fellow prisoner, one David Nagle, the defendant admitted to the murder of the victim and described the circumstances of the crime. Nagle informed the police of what the defendant had told him.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Substantially all the defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal concern the admissibility of Nagle\u2019s testimony and alleged improper limitations on the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Nagle. We affirm the convictions and, under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, find no reason to alter the verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Because the circumstances of Nagle\u2019s trial testimony are important to an understanding of issues argued on appeal, we summarize the relevant portions of Nagle\u2019s trial testimony and the rulings of the judge concerning that testimony. On November 20, 1981, Nagle testified for the Commonwealth on direct examination. He admitted that he had been convicted of numerous crimes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nagle testified that he was being held in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>the Franklin County house of correction in Greenfield (Greenfield,) having been transferred there from Billerica the previous July. He admitted that he had criminal charges pending against him in Middlesex and Suffolk counties. Nagle then testified that he met the defendant at Billerica in the latter part of May, 1981. They often discussed the defendant\u2019s pending murder case. Nagle said he had not then communicated with any police officer concerning the defendant\u2019s case. In these conversations, the defendant told Nagle, reciting details, that the defendant, Holmes, and another man had killed the victim during a drug \u201crip off.\u201d Nagle also testified that the defendant discussed means of assuring that Holmes would not testify against him. Nagle said that he first spoke to a law enforcement official about the murder on July 9, 1981, when he gave statements to Lieutenant Spartichino of the State police. Nagle testified that the lieutenant made no promises but, because of the pending charges against Nagle, said he would speak on Nagle\u2019s behalf and would write a letter explaining Nagle\u2019s cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">On cross-examination, Nagle testified that he had four armed robbery charges pending against him in Suffolk County and two armed robbery charges and a kidnapping charge pending against him in Middlesex County. Nagle said he had been cooperating with the police on the Suffolk County cases, admitting his involvement and implicating others. Defense counsel then sought to inquire of Nagle concerning a specific instance of Nagle\u2019s cooperation with the police. On the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, there was a bench conference at which defense counsel said that he wanted to show Nagle was a government agent. Defense counsel made no reference to admission of evidence of Nagle\u2019s cooperation with the police to show Nagle\u2019s bias. The judge said that such an argument should have been presented by a pretrial motion, that \u201c[tjhis does not go to the merits of the case,\u201d and that the defendant had made an insufficient showing that Nagle was a government agent. Nagle then testified that, prior to his July meeting with Lieutenant Spartichino, he had unsuccessfully requested that he be moved from Billerica to Greenfield to be near his child and her mother. Shortly after speaking to the lieutenant and requesting a trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>fer, Nagle was transferred to Greenfield. Nagle further testified that he told Lieutenant Spartichino that \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The only substantial issues the defendant raises on appeal concern his attempts to show that the trial judge improperly excluded evidence tending to show that the witness Nagle had previously cooperated with the Commonwealth in the conviction of other persons in exchange for favorable dispositions of criminal charges pending against him. In one aspect, the defendant relies on this evidence to claim that Nagle was a government agent and that, therefore, the defendant\u2019s admissions to Nagle, while the defendant was being held on the charges in this case, were inadmissible on the theory that the defendant was denied his Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel. This question was unsuccessfully presented on a pretrial motion to suppress and renewed at trial. This aspect of the defendant\u2019s argument is plainly before us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The second aspect of the defendant\u2019s argument concerning Nagle\u2019s alleged, mutually beneficial past cooperation with the Commonwealth concerns a claim that the record of Nagle\u2019s cooperation and resulting favorable treatment was relevant to show Nagle\u2019s bias. Here the record does not show that the defendant offered that evidence on the issue of bias. He did not bring to the judge\u2019s attention a claim that this evidence was relevant to Nagle\u2019s bias, although he argues the point before us. Where the purpose of the offer of evidence on cross-examination is or should be apparent to a trial judge, we have not required a party to make specific reference to the purpose for which the evidence is offered. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>384 Mass. 377, 380 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ahearn, </em>370 Mass. 283, 286 (1976). Where, however, the reason for the question is unclear or where the judge by his comments shows that the purpose is not apparent to him, we have required the proponent of evidence to be specific concerning the purpose for which evidence is offered. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cheek, </em>374 Mass. 613, 615 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, 369 </em>Mass. 943, 951, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 833 (1976). In this case, the record demonstrates that the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>did not perceive at trial the possible relevance of Nagle\u2019s past cooperation to the question of Nagle\u2019s bias, and it is clear that trial counsel\u2019s representations in support of the admission of that evidence only on the ground of Nagle\u2019s status as a government agent obscured the bias question. The bias aspect of the defendant\u2019s argument is thus here only for consideration on higher standards of appellate review<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and on the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, in which he asserts the ineffective assistance of counsel in developing the bias point.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">1. We consider first the defendant\u2019s argument that Nagle was acting as an agent of the Commonwealth so that Nagle\u2019s testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s statements to Nagle should have been suppressed. The defendant relies on cases involving persons acting as government agents, such as <em>United States </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>447 U.S. 264, 272-273 (1980) (fellowinmate); <em>Massiah </em>v. <em>United States, </em>377 U.S. 201, 205-206 (1964) (confederate, not incarcerated); and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sampol, 636 </em>F.2d 621, 637-638 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (fellow inmate). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Walther, </em>652 F.2d 788 (9th Cir. 1981) (Fourth Amendment case, search of luggage).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The trial judge dealt with the pretrial motion to suppress without conducting an evidentiary hearing, ruling that the affidavit accompanying the motion did not warrant such a hearing. The affidavit presented no significant facts in support of the claim that Nagle was a government agent. It only recited that Nagle had received the benefit of being transferred to Greenfield. That fact has little, if any, relevance to the question whether Nagle was a government agent at the times he and the defendant spoke at Billerica. Where there is no police connection with the private citizen to whom a defendant makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>an admission, there is no Sixth Amendment barrier to the introduction of that evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahnke, </em>368 Mass. 662, 676-678 (1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 959 (1976). The judge acted within his discretion in deciding the motion to suppress without an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The judge was correct in concluding at trial that the question of Nagle\u2019s status as a government agent was one that should have been raised by a proper pretrial motion rather than before the jury. Thus, although Nagle\u2019s prior cooperation with the Commonwealth may have been relevant on the issue of Nagle\u2019s bias, a question we consider subsequently, Nagle\u2019s status as a government informer or agent allegedly warranting suppression of his testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s statements to him was not a jury question.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">2. There was no error warranting reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions on the ground that the judge excluded evidence relevant to Nagle\u2019s bias.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>The defendant argues that barring inquiry into past favors denied him his rights to confront Nagle under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and under art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. The defendant\u2019s claim is that Nagle was biased in favor of the Commonwealth and his prior cooperation with the Commonwealth tends to show that bias. The Commonwealth argues that evidence of Nagle\u2019s previous mutually beneficial cooperation was not relevant to the bias question. The fact that Nagle\u2019s past beneficial cooperation with the authorities may have involved criminal charges pending in counties other than the county in which the defendant was tried does not make irrelevant his understanding that by cooperation he could obtain favorable treatment from the Commonwealth. A prosecution witness\u2019s past cooperation with the Commonwealth, which has led to the apprehension and conviction of others and to favorable treatment of the witness, is relevant to the question of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>witness\u2019s bias, an issue that is never collateral. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marcellino, </em>271 Mass. 325, 327 (1930). We have suggested that bias because of gratitude for past benefits from the Commonwealth might be relevant, but, at the same time, we indicated that the pendency of criminal charges is a much stronger source of human motivation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>392 Mass. 838, 841 (1984). Here, of course, the pendency of seven serious criminal charges against Nagle was fully disclosed to the jury. Beyond showing gratitude for past favors is the defendant\u2019s desired demonstration that Nagle knew from experience that cooperation with a prosecutor can produce favorable treatment. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leja, </em>568 F.2d 493, 498-499 (6th Cir. 1977) (\u201cEvidence of past rewards shows what an informant can expect by making a case\u201d). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salsedo, </em>607 F.2d 318, 321 (9th Cir. 1979) (particulars of witness\u2019s previous work for Drug Enforcement Administration were cumulative where the jury had sufficient other evidence of the witness\u2019s potential bias); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Elorduy, </em>612 F.2d 986, 989 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 910 (1980) (exclusion of evidence of prior payments to informer within judge\u2019s discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">If a witness\u2019s potential bias is already apparent to the jury from other evidence, a trial judge has discretion to exclude further evidence tending to show bias, not because it is irrelevant but because it is cumulative. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>381 Mass. 90, 116 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dougan, </em>377 Mass. 303, 310 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>370 Mass. 548, 572, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 943 (1976). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>369 Mass. 943, 951 (1976). Here the jury were well advised of Nagle\u2019s possible bias in favor of the Commonwealth. Indeed, Nagle in effect admitted it. If the question of bias had been presented to the judge and, in the exercise of his discretion, the judge had excluded the evidence of prior cooperation, there would have been no error. Applying the standard of review appropriate for this issue (see n.2 above), we conclude that the exclusion of evidence of Nagle\u2019s past cooperation with the Commonwealth presents no ground for reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>3. In his motion for a new trial the defendant asserted that trial counsel was ineffective, in a constitutional sense, because he did not investigate Nagle\u2019s background. We construe the claim as asserting that such an investigation would have shown Nagle had been a government agent over a long time prior to the defendant\u2019s trial and, in any event, would have shown Nagle\u2019s bias. The trial judge decided this issue without conducting an evidentiary hearing. It was within his discretion to do so because the motion, and affidavits accompanying it, raised no substantial issue. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>383 Mass. 253, 257 (1981). The affidavits accompanying the motion for a new trial state that various persons had been convicted or apprehended as a result of Nagle\u2019s past cooperation with the police, but they do not provide any basis for concluding that Nagle worked for the government by express or implied agreement at the time the defendant made admissions to him or at any other time. The trial judge properly characterized the affidavits as conclusory. <em>Id. </em>at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The defendant has made no showing that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel under the appropriate constitutional standards. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, ante </em>251, 255-256 &amp; n.3 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bolduc, </em>375 Mass. 530, 540 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">4. The defendant challenges the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument to the jury as an improper personal comment on the defendant\u2019s guilt. The defendant made no objection to that closing argument. On the standard of review appropriate in such a situation (see note 2 above), there is no basis for granting the defendant relief. Indeed, we find nothing improper in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument that would require reversal, if the issue were here for review in the normal course.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">5. There is no basis under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, for granting the defendant relief from his conviction of murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-10\"> These crimes were larceny to which he pleaded guilty in 1972; assault by means of a dangerous weapon and larceny to which he pleaded guilty in 1972; larceny from the person to which he pleaded guilty in 1972; armed robbery, uttering, and larceny for which he was sentenced in 1972; larceny from a person to which he pleaded guilty in 1974; larceny from a person to which he pleaded guilty in 1975; larceny from a person in 1975 to which he pleaded guilty; larceny to which he pleaded guilty in 1976; and being present where heroin was found to which he pleaded guilty in 1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b714-7\"> Where there is no objection below and thus the opportunity for appellate review in the normal course has not been preserved, we consider such an issue in review of a conviction of murder in the first degree under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and in review of convictions of other crimes under a standard that is similar but arguably stricter and less broad than that applied under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chasson, </em>383 Mass. 183, 189 n.2 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>380 Mass. 30, 38-39 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>379 Mass. 557, 562 n.4 (1980). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>390 Mass. 308, 319 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b715-7\"> We have already noted that the question whether evidence of Nagle\u2019s prior cooperation with the police was improperly excluded is not before us for appellate review in the traditional manner.
