We now answer that question \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">The plaintiff, The Greenhouse, Inc. (Greenhouse), brought suit against the defendant, Trans World Airlines, Inc. (TWA), in the Boston Municipal Court, which is a District Court. See G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 1. Greenhouse alleged that TWA had violated its contract with Greenhouse and had acted negligently when TWA delivered to Greenhouse decayed, dehydrated, and, thus, unsaleable flowers. The complaint sought $5,000, an amount below the threshold of $7,500 established by G. L. c. 231, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>\u00a7 104, as amended through St. 1980, c. 539, \u00a7 4, for prompt removal by TWA to the Superior Court. After trial, judgment in the amount of $1,440.01 was entered for Greenhouse. TWA claimed a report to the Appellate Division of the Boston Municipal Court. On April 24,1984, the Appellate Division dismissed the report. Within ten days of notice of that decision, TWA could have caused the case to be transferred to the Superior Court for a new trial. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 104. See <em>Orasz </em>v. <em>Colonial Tavern, Inc., </em>365 Mass. 131, 134-140 (1974); <em>McGloin </em>v. <em>Nilson, </em>348 Mass. 716, 718-719 (1965). However, TWA chose not to do so and instead appealed here. We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 109, as amended through St. 1975, c. 377, \u00a7 108A, provides that \u201c[a]n appeal to the supreme judicial court shall lie from the final decision of the appellate division of any district court.\u201d In <em>Locke </em>v. <em>Slater, </em>387 Mass. 682, 684 (1982), we wrote that \u201c[a] decision of an Appellate Division is not final and immediate appeal to this court is not available if trial in the Superior Court is available to the party seeking the appeal.\u201d That language controls this case. As we have said above, when TWA received notice of the Appellate Division\u2019s decision dismissing its report, TWA had ten days in which to claim a trial in the Superior Court. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 104. But TWA chose not to claim its Superior Court trial. \u201c[Ijnstead,\u201d as TWA states in its brief, it \u201cintentionally allowed the ten day removal period to expire and then brought its appeal to this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Of course, after the ten-day removal period expired, TWA could no longer remove the case to the Superior Court, and the Appellate Division decision became final. However, over ten years ago, in <em>Orasz </em>v. <em>Colonial Tavern, Inc., supra, </em>this court announced a rule prohibiting an appeal in precisely that situation. We stated that a party who, after a decision by an Appellate Division, has the right to remove his case to the Superior Court <em>\u201cdoes not have the right to appeal to this court from a decision of the Appellate Division before the retrial of the case in the Superior </em>Court\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 139. In the past ten years we have many times affirmed the <em>\u201cOrasz </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>rule.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Third Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co., </em>387 Mass. 1001, <em>1002(1982); Kingsley v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>383 Mass. 874 (1981); <em>Pupillo </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>381 Mass. 714, 715 (1980); <em>Fusco </em>v. <em>Springfield Republican Co., 361 </em>Mass. 904, 906 (1975). Today, we affirm it again.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">In support of its position, TWA points to <em>Parrell </em>v. <em>Keenan, </em>389 Mass. 809, 811 n.4 (1983), and <em>Pilotte </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., </em>384 Mass. 805, 805 n.1 (1981). We agree that those decisions give support to TWA\u2019s position. However, in neither of those cases did the parties brief or argue the propriety of the appeal, and in neither of them did we expressly or intentionally abandon the rule that we articulated in <em>Orasz </em>and applied in Orasz\u2019s progeny. In <em>Pilotte, supra, </em>we entertained the appeal in the exercise of our discretion, but the concern we expressed in <em>Orasz, supra </em>at 140, that \u201ca good deal of confusion has apparently resulted from the discretionary entertainment of premature appeals by this court,\u201d prompts us now to adhere closely to the <em>Orasz </em>rule. See <em>Weil </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>216 Mass. 545, 549 (1914) (\u201cThe rule of practice as to when [appeals] may be presented for argument in this court ought to be simple, capable of being easily understood and not likely to be open to doubt in application. ... It is more important to preserve it than to break in upon it for the purpose of doing what may appear to be desirable in a single case and thereby work confusion in many other cases\u201d). Surely, <em>Orasz </em>and subsequent cases that applied the <em>Orasz </em>rule, none of which have ever been expressly overruled, placed TWA on notice that it could not safely assume that it had the right to appeal directly to this court from the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">In <em>Parrell </em>v. <em>Keenan, supra, </em>we relied on <em>Joseph Freedman Co. </em>v. <em>North Penn Transfer, Inc., </em>388 Mass. 551, 551 n.1 (1983), and <em>Third Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co., </em>388 Mass. 240, 241-242 (1983), but our reliance was inappropriate. In <em>Joseph Freedman Co., supra, </em>before trial in the District Court the defendant-appellant could have removed the case for trial in the Superior Court, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 104, but it did not. Therefore, before the Appellate Division filed its decision, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>defendant-appellant had waived its right to a Superior Court trial. See <em>Conroy </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>392 Mass. 216, 216 n.1 (1984). In <em>Third Nat\u2019l Bank, supra, </em>although the plaintiff-appellant could have filed its suit in the Superior Court, it chose to sue in the District Court. Again, as in <em>Joseph Freedman Co., supra, </em>before the Appellate Division filed its decision, the plaintiff-appellant had waived its right to a Superior Court trial. See <em>Locke </em>v. <em>Slater, supra. </em>So, in both of the cases that we relied on in <em>Parrell </em>v. <em>Keenan, supra, </em>when the Appellate Division made its decision that decision was final. Therefore, appeal to this court was appropriate. That was not the situation in <em>Parrell </em>v. <em>Keenan, supra, </em>nor is it the situation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Considerations of judicial economy justify our decision to retain the <em>Orasz </em>rule. A contrary rule \u2014 one that would permit the direct appeal to this court of cases that the Legislature has required to be tried in the first instance in the District Court \u2014 would not advance the efficient disposition of judicial business. By their very nature, those cases have a much greater potential for prompt termination in the Superior Court \u2014 by trial or by settlement \u2014 than they have in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b79-8\">Abrams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AU\">(dissenting). Delay in civil trials in the trial court is the most serious problem in the administration of justice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Despite knowledge of that fact, the court today refuses to adopt a simple housekeeping measure which would end litigation in a small group of cases and instead adds to the delay and congestion in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 109, as amended through St. 1975, c. 377, \u00a7 108A, provides that a party may appeal to this court from \u201cthe final decision of the appellate division of any district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>court.\u201d Contrary to the court\u2019s decision today, the Appellate Division\u2019s dismissal of the report, combined with the defendant\u2019s failure to move for transfer of the case to the Superior Court, makes the Appellate Division\u2019s decision final and therefore appealable to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Where, as here, the only remaining question for the court is one of law, there is no justification for requiring Superior Court action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Pilotte </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., </em>384 Mass. 805, 805 n.1 (1981). The resolution of factual disputes is what the trial court does best. The resolution of legal issues is our function.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">If the plaintiff had lost the Appellate Division decision, it could have brought an appeal before this court. See <em>Third Nat\u2019l Bank v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>388 Mass. 240, 241-242 (1983). Or, if the defendant had waived its right to jury trial in the Superior Court before the Appellate Division\u2019s decision, it also could have appealed to this court without first retrying the case in the Superior Court. See <em>Joseph Freedman Co. </em>v. <em>North Penn Transfer, Inc., </em>388 Mass. 551, 551-552 n.1 (1983). I think that once the defendant allowed the ten-day period to remove the case to pass, the Appellate Division\u2019s decision became final and appealable. The fact that the defendant elected to waive its right to a jury trial in the Superior Court after the Appellate Division decision, rather than before, should not determine the case\u2019s procedural status. This court\u2019s decision merely prolongs litigation, increases the costs to litigants, and makes it more difficult for citizens to enforce small claims even though such claims are valid, or makes it economically disadvantageous to defend against invalid claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u201cThe controlling ideas [of court reorganization, see St. 1978, c. 478, are] unification, flexibility, conservation of judicial power, and responsibility.\u201d R. Pound, Organization of Courts 275 (1940). Today\u2019s decision neither conserves judicial power nor is it responsible. Adherence to old procedures does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>serve the purposes of reorganization, but merely continues the strangulation of the trial courts by adding another layer of decisionmaking before appellate review. Such a procedure merely adds to spiraling litigation costs and increases delay between entry and final disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[considerations of judicial economy\u201d justify its decision not to decide an issue of law is unfair.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The courts are not created for the convenience of judges and lawyers but are created to serve litigants and the public interest in securing \u201cthe just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action.\u201d See Mass. R. Civ. P. 1, as appearing in 385 Mass. 1213 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The court today departs from its recent holding that even if appellate review \u201cincreases [appellate] judicial business, that result must be accepted. Courts exist to vindicate important rights. We cannot withhold from [litigants] important protections merely because granting them may place some additional burden on the courts.\u201d <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>393 Mass. 793, 799 (1985). Today\u2019s decision does not improve the administration of justice for litigants, the public, or for the court system as a whole.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-10\"> From June, 1983, to June, 1984, the number of civil cases pending in the Superior Court increased from 72,854 to 79,603.

Rather, most cases involve issues of law and fact or just factual disputes and would go to the Superior Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
