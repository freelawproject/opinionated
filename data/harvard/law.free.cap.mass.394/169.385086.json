L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) <em>(a) </em>(1), as appearing in St. 1982, c. 373, \u00a7 2, the law that prohibits operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or other substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">Robert Connolly was charged with operating a motor vehicle \u201cwhile under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\u201d When arrested, he refused to take a breathalyzer test. After he was convicted at a bench trial, he claimed a de nova jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>The police officer who arrested Connolly testified at the jury trial as follows. He stopped a car driven by Connolly for going through a red light. When he spoke to Connolly, he observed that Connolly\u2019s eyes were glassy and that his speech was slurred. The police officer asked Connolly to walk a straight line and to pick up a coin from the ground. When Connolly performed those tests, he observed that Connolly was unsteady on his feet, so he arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Connolly testified that in the eight hours before his arrest he had consumed three or four \u201cbeers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The jury returned a guilty verdict, and the judge sentenced Connolly to serve thirty-two days in a house of correction on consecutive weekends. Connolly filed an appeal from the judgment and a motion to stay the sentence pending appeal. The judge denied Connolly\u2019s motion, and Connolly petitioned a single justice of the Appeals Court to stay the execution of his sentence pending appeal. The single justice stayed the execution of sentence, and the appeal was docketed in the Appeals Court. On our own motion, we transferred the case to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Connolly argues that in his jury instructions the judge incorrectly explained the meaning of the words \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor,\u201d as used in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (a) (1). We agree, so we reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Substantially following Instruction 5.10 of the Model Jury Instructions for Criminal Offenses Tried in the District Court Department (1980), the judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">\u201cA person to be under the influence of intoxicating liquor does not have to be drunk. . . . Being under the influence . . . means that a person . . . was influenced in some perceptible degree by the intake of alcoholic beverages, no matter how great or how small the potion may be. And that\u2019s all it does mean. It does not mean that a person cannot drive an automobile and drive it skillfully and carefully, observing every rule of the road. A person driving an automobile on a public way while under the influence of intoxicating liquor violates, offends against the statutes, even though he drives so carefully, so skillfully so that the public is not annoyed or endangered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>The judge illustrated his instruction with an example:</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u201cVisualize, if you will, last night when you went home, somebody made dinner or you made dinner for yourself. You had one, two or three drinks, whatever is your pleasure, if you do drink. And then someone announced, \u2018We don\u2019t have any milk in the house; would you go to the supermarket to get some milk. \u2019 The supermarket is eight blocks away in a small shopping center. You get into your car and after you\u2019ve had the three or four drinks, or how many, or maybe one, it really doesn\u2019t matter, and you drive. And would you believe you stop at eight blocks at eight red lights? In fact, at one point you stop where there isn\u2019t even an intersection, there is a boy scout leading six little old ladies across the street whether they want to go or not. You drive into the parking lot of the shopping center and skillfully park your automobile between two cars in a very narrow space. You walk in, you buy a half gallon of milk, you pay with the proper change, you come out, skillfully back your car out of the parking space and go back whence you came, again stopping at all eight lights and again stopping for the boy scout who changed his mind and wants to take the women across the other way. Suddenly, suddenly as a result of the intake of the alcoholic beverage, you feel slightly lightheaded. Hypothetically you may feel slightly depressed; hypothetically you may feel slightly happier than is your norm at that time of the evening. If you feel any abnormality as a result of the intake of the alcoholic beverage, you are violating the statutes of the Commonwealth, by virtue of the fact that you\u2019re operating a motor vehicle, carefiilly, skillfully, observing every rule of the road, except you are presently feeling the ingestion of that alcohol, no matter how it may manifest itself. it</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\u201cThe violation of this statute does not require proof that the liquor adversely affected the operation of the vehicle. . . . The statute says that the intake of alcohol must adversely affect the person, and it is the person who should not be driving the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>The original statute providing for punishment for operating a motor vehicle \u201cwhile under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d was enacted in 1906. St. 1906, c. 412, \u00a7 4. That language survives in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (a) (1). \u201cThe statute was passed for the protection of travellers upon highways . . . <em>Commonwealth v. Clarke, 254 Mass. 566, 568 (1926). </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyseth, </em>250 Mass. 555, 558 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyseth, supra, </em>the defendant appealed from his conviction for operating while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24. He contended that the trial judge erroneously had refused to give a requested jury instruction that the defendant could not be found guilty unless he was actually driving in a manner different from the way he would have driven if he had not drunk liquor. This court rejected that contention, stating that \u201c[t]he Commonwealth was not required to prove that the defendant was drunk,\u201d and that \u201c[i]t was wholly immaterial whether the defendant exercised due care to avoid injury to other travellers.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyseth, supra </em>at 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Those principles retain their validity today. Therefore, in the present case the judge correctly instructed the jury that to be driving while under the influence of liquor a person need not be drunk. The judge also correctly stated that to obtain a conviction under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, the Commonwealth need not prove the defendant actually drove unskillfully or carelessly, and that \u201c[t]he statute says that the intake of alcohol must adversely affect the person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">However, the judge went too far when, following Model Instruction 5.10, he charged the jury that \u201c[bjeing under the influence . . . means that a person . . . was influenced in some perceptible degree by the intake of alcoholic beverages,\u201d and he exacerbated that error when he explained his statement by hypothesizing a case in which a person drinks liquor, drives, and as a result of the liquor suddenly feels \u201cslightly lightheaded,\u201d \u201cslightly depressed,\u201d or \u201cslightly happier\u201d than that person would feel in the absence of liquor. Although the statutory language, read literally, would allow that interpretation, we must read it in light of the legislative purpose to protect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>public from drivers whose judgment, alertness, and ability to respond promptly and effectively to unexpected emergencies are diminished because of the consumption of alcohol. Interpreting the statute in that light, we conclude that, in a prosecution for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s consumption of alcohol diminished the defendant\u2019s <em>ability </em>to operate a motor vehicle safely. The Commonwealth need not prove that the defendant <em>actually drove </em>in an unsafe or erratic manner, but it must prove a diminished <em>capacity </em>to operate safely.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The legislative enactment of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) <em>(e), </em>inserted by St. 1961, c. 340, supports our definition. That section originally provided, in part: \u201cIn any prosecution for a violation of paragraph (1) <em>(a) </em>of this section, evidence of the percentage, by weight, of alcohol in the defendant\u2019s blood at the time of the alleged offense, as shown by chemical test or analysis of his blood or as indicated by chemical test or analysis of his breath, shall be admissible and deemed relevant to the determination of the question of whether such defendant was at such time under the influence of intoxicating liquor .... If such evidence is that such percentage was five one hundredths or less, there shall be a presumption that such defendant was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor; . . . and if such evidence is that such percentage was fifteen one hundredths or more, there shall be a presumption that such defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\u201d In 1972, the Legislature changed the word \u201cfifteen\u201d to \u201cten.\u201d St. 1972, c. 488, \u00a7 1. The presumptions contained in \u00a7 24 (1) <em>(e) </em>originated in 1939 reports published by the National Safety Council and the American Medical Association concerning the effect of alcohol on driving. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>366 Mass. 423, 427 (1974). The legislative adoption of those presumptions, therefore, strengthens our conclusion that in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, the Legislature has focused on impaired drivers, not on \u201cslightly happier\u201d or \u201cslightly depressed\u201d drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">The rule of strict construction of criminal statutes, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>391 Mass. 157, 159 (1984), also leads us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>to conclude that the trial judge erroneously explained the words \u201cwhile under the influence\u201d to the jury. As we have stated above, the statute, construed literally, permits the interpretation given it by the judge. However, another fair interpretation of the statute would prohibit driving only if alcohol has affected the driver to such a degree that the driver threatens the public welfare. We must resolve in favor of criminal defendants any reasonable doubt as to the statute\u2019s meaning. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>387 Mass. 567, 569, modified on other grounds, 387 Mass. 768 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Case law from other States lends overwhelming support to our definition. In construing statutes similar to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, courts in thirty-two States have defined the words \u201cunder the influence.\u201d In thirty of those States the courts have related their definitions to the impairment of senses, judgment, and motor skills that makes driving after drinking alcohol dangerous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Only in Vermont and Virginia have the courts refused to make that link.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Because we hold that the harmful error in the judge\u2019s charge entitles Connolly to a new trial, we need not review the other issues that he raises. We briefly discuss one such issue, however, because it may recur at retrial. Connolly sought to introduce in evidence a \u201cforensic chemist\u2019s\u201d opinion of the \u201cblood alcohol level\u201d that a person Connolly\u2019s size would have after consuming three or four \u201cbeers\u201d in five or six hours, and his opinion as to the effect of that amount of alcohol on the person. The judge excluded the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">It may be that Connolly can present a qualified expert to testify, in response to an appropriate hypothetical question, about the probable effect that the consumption of a specified amount of alcohol in a specified time period would have on Connolly\u2019s ability to operate a motor vehicle safely. We note only that opinion evidence as to Connolly\u2019s blood alcohol level, without further admissible evidence that explains the significance of that measurement, would be irrelevant. A defendant cannot withhold his consent to chemical tests or analyses of his blood or breath and then at trial reap a benefit from the presumptions of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) <em>(e). </em>The statutory presumptions apply to chemical tests or analyses, not to the opinions of expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The judgment on the complaint charging the defendant with driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor is reversed, the verdict is set aside, and the case is remanded to the jury-of-six session of the District Court for a new trial consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-6\"> Arizona, <em>Hasten </em>v. <em>State, </em>35 Ariz. 427, 431 (1929); California, <em>People </em>v. <em>Haeussler, </em>41 Cal.2d 252, 261-263 (1953); Colorado, <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Denver, </em>123 Colo. 222, 226 (1951); Connecticut, <em>Infeld </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>151 Conn. 506, 509 (1964); Georgia, <em>Cargile </em>v. <em>State, </em>244 Ga. 871, 873-874 (1979); Illinois, <em>People </em>v. <em>Seefeldt, </em>112 Ill.App.3d 106, 108 (1983); Iowa, <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>196 N.W.2d 885, 890 (1972); Kansas, <em>State </em>v. <em>Reeves, </em>233 Kan. 702, 704 (1983); Louisiana, <em>State </em>v. <em>Hightower, </em>238 La. 876, 886 (1959); Maine, <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryce, </em>243 A.2d 726, 730 (1968); Maryland, <em>Alston </em>v. <em>Forsythe, </em>226 Md. 121, 132 (1960); Michigan, <em>People </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>395 Mich. 296, 305 (1975); Minnesota, <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>176 Minn. 164, 169 (1929); Nebraska, <em>State </em>v. <em>Tripple, </em>190 Neb. 713, 715 (1973); New Hampshire, <em>State </em>v. <em>Slater, </em>109 N.H. 279, 280 (1969); New Jersey, <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>42 N.J. 146, 165 (1964); New Mexico, <em>State </em>v. <em>Deming, </em>66 N.M. 175, 180 (1959); North Carolina, <em>State </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>226 N.C. 237, 239-240 (1946); North Dakota, <em>State </em>v. <em>Salhus, </em>220 N.W.2d 852, 856 (1974); Ohio, <em>State </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>28 Ohio St. 2d 89, 90-91 (1971); Oklahoma, <em>Stanfield </em>v.
