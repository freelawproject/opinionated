In this case we are asked to apply <em>Tristram\u2019s Landing </em>to a situation where the sale to the broker\u2019s client falls through because of the seller\u2019s decision to convey the property to a third party. We conclude, in the circumstances presented here, that the prerequisites to the recovery of a commission were not satisfied, and thus that the judge correctly granted the seller\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>This action was brought by the plaintiff broker, John G. Capezzuto, to recover a brokerage fee from the defendant seller, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company (John Hancock). The uncontroverted facts as established by the depositions submitted by the parties are as follows. On January 22, 1981, Stephen Kelly, the broker\u2019s agent, met with George Rowland, who managed John Hancock\u2019s wholly-owned properties, to inquire whether John Hancock owned any property that it wanted to sell. Rowland told Kelly that John Hancock was interested in selling a certain improved commercial lot on Route 128 in Dedham. Rowland further stated that John Hancock wanted to net $450,000 cash from the sale, and that any buyer had to be willing to close the transaction within sixty days. Kelly responded that Capezzuto would list the property at $550,000, and that, after Capezzuto took his commission, John Hancock would net in excess of $450,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Capezzuto then called his client Paul Hurlbert, who expressed an interest in the Dedham property. On January 23, Hurlbert signed a written offer to purchase the property, subject to financing, for $550,000, and he gave Capezzuto a $10,000 deposit. On the same day, Capezzuto gave the offer and the deposit to his agent Kelly, who in turn presented the offer and the deposit to Rowland at John Hancock. When Kelly presented the offer, Rowland indicated that he could not submit it to John Hancock\u2019s review committees because of the presence of the finance contingency clause. At this same meeting, Rowland also informed Kelly that he would be in communication with another broker, William Zielinski, and that he would give a client of Zielinski\u2019s a chance to make an offer for the property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>On January 26, 1981, Capezzuto met with Hurlbert, who agreed to execute a new offer without the finance contingency. Kelly then telephoned Rowland and told him that he \u201chad an offer coming in,\u201d which \u201cwould meet all [John Hancock\u2019s] criteria.\u201d Rowland again indicated that he would be discussing Hurlbert\u2019s offer with Zielinski. On January 27, Kelly telephoned Rowland again to tell him that Hurlbert\u2019s offer was signed, but that Hurlbert\u2019s attorney had wanted to review it before it was submitted. Rowland told Kelly to call him when Kelly was ready to deliver the offer, and, for the third time, Rowland informed Kelly that he was going to discuss the proposed sale of the property with Zielinski.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">On January 28, Kelly made four attempts to telephone Rowland. Kelly was informed each time by Rowland\u2019s secretary that Rowland was unavailable. Kelly told Rowland\u2019s secretary that he had a written offer that he wanted to deliver, and he read the terms of the offer over the telephone. At some point on January 28, Rowland\u2019s secretary passed this information on to Rowland. On January 29, Capezzuto and Kelly met with Rowland in Rowland\u2019s office and presented Hurlbert\u2019s written offer. Rowland refused to accept it, on the ground that he had already accepted an oral offer from Zielinski\u2019s client, Uniroyal. On four separate occasions between February and July, 1981, Capezzuto submitted offers on behalf of Hurlbert, all of which were rejected by John Hancock.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">On May 18,1981, Capezzuto brought an action against John Hancock to recover the $55,000 broker\u2019s commission which he was allegedly owed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant moved for summary judgment, and on April 29, 1983, the motion was granted. The judge ruled that Capezzuto had not met the conditions set forth in <em>Tristram\u2019s Landing, supra, </em>for a broker\u2019s recovery of its commission. The Appeals Court reversed, holding that the rules set forth in <em>Tristram\u2019s Landing </em>did not apply to a case where the broker \u201cproduces a customer ready, willing, and able <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>to buy on the precise terms set by the seller but the seller has a change of heart or otherwise defeats the transaction.\u201d <em>Capezzuto </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 46, 48-49 (1984). We granted John Hancock\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">In <em>Tristram\u2019s Landing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wait, </em>367 Mass. 622 (1975), we adopted the following rule governing a broker\u2019s right to a commission. \u201cWhen a broker is engaged by an owner of property to find a purchaser for it, the broker earns his commission when (a) he produces a purchaser ready, willing and able to buy on the terms fixed by the owner, (b) the purchaser enters into a binding contract with the owner to do so, and (c) the purchaser completes the transaction by closing the title in accordance with the provisions of the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 629, quoting <em>Ellsworth Dobbs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>50 N.J. 528, 551 (1967). There is no dispute, in this case, that these three prerequisites were not all met. There was no binding contract between the seller and the broker\u2019s client.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\"><em>Tristram\u2019s Landing </em>does, however, recognize an exception to these requirements. In circumstances where \u201cthe failure of completion of the contract results from the wrongful act or interference of the seller, the broker\u2019s claim is valid and must be paid.\u201d <em>Tristram\u2019s Landing, supra </em>at 629, quoting <em>Ellsworth Dobbs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra. </em>In <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>391 Mass. 517 (1984), we applied this exception to uphold a broker\u2019s right to her commission. In that case, the broker had produced a buyer who was ready, willing and able to buy, and who had entered into a purchase and sale agreement with the seller, but the closing was prevented by the seller\u2019s default. <em>Id. </em>at 525. Capezzuto contends that this exception is also applicable here because the seller, John Hancock, thwarted the sale of the property to Hurlbert by conveying to a third party, Uniroyal. We disagree, and hold that for the broker to take advantage of this exception, the seller must have agreed to sell the property to the broker\u2019s client. Because John Hancock and Hurlbert never entered into a contract of sale, Capezutto is not entitled to his commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Capezzuto contends that a jury could have found that John Hancock did, in fact, orally accept Hurlbert as a buyer of the property. Even if it could be shown that there was such an oral acceptance, it would avail the plaintiff nothing. In order for Capezzuto to prevail, proof of a binding contract of sale between Hurlbert and John Hancock is necessary. See <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Emerson, supra </em>at 524; <em>Tristram\u2019s Landing, supra </em>at 629. We add here that the uncontroverted record before us makes it clear that John Hancock did not even manifest an informal acceptance of Hurlbert. The deposition testimony of both Kelly and Rowland shows that, on January 23, John Hancock unambiguously rejected Hurlbert\u2019s offer because of the finance contingency. More importantly, on three occasions during the week that followed, Capezzuto\u2019s agent was informed by John Hancock that simultaneous negotiations were being conducted with another potential buyer. This testimony is completely inconsistent with any kind of acceptance of Hurlbert by John Hancock.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The rule we establish today, with respect to cases where the seller is responsible for \u201cthe failure of completion of the contract,\u201d <em>Tristram\u2019s Landing, supra, </em>is justified by the same considerations which motivated our holding in <em>Tristram\u2019s Landing. </em>\u201c[Ojrdinarily when an owner of property lists it with a broker for sale, his expectation is that the money for the payment of commission will come out of the proceeds of the sale.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 628, quoting <em>Ellsworth Dobbs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 547. Furthermore, a seller ordinarily expects that he is free to sell to whomever he chooses, until he has signed a purchase and sale agreement. In particular, even where a seller engages more than one broker, the seller expects to pay only a single commission, since only one broker will be successful in procuring the ultimate buyer. To protect these expectations, we conclude that, in situtations where the seller is responsible for the failure to complete the transaction, no commission is owing unless the seller has signed a binding agreement with the broker\u2019s client.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">We acknowledge that brokers also have legitimate expectations, and that \u201cif the broker brings the parties together on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>mutually acceptable terms he expects a commission for his labor. \u201d <em>Stanchak </em>v. <em>Cliffside Park Lodge No. 1527 Loyal Order of Moose, Inc., </em>116 N.J. Super. 471, 479 (1971). Nonetheless, we conclude that the broker is in a better position than the seller to protect these expectations by including, in the brokerage contract,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a provision that the broker is entitled to its commission when it produces a ready, willing and able buyer whom the seller, for whatever reason, refuses to accept.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the absence of such a provision the burden is rightfully placed on the broker, in light of the fact that \u201cmany sellers, unlike brokers, are involved in real estate transactions infrequently, perhaps only once in a lifetime, and are thus unfamiliar with their legal rights.\u201d <em>Tristram\u2019s Landing, supra </em>at 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">We recognize that the rule we set forth today may not be applicable where the seller has engaged in bad faith dealing, or some other misconduct which prevents an agreement between the broker\u2019s client and the seller, see <em>Tristram\u2019s Landing, supra </em>at 629, or which suggests \u201ca purpose on the part of the [seller] to obtain without payment a profit from the [broker\u2019s] exertions.\u201d <em>Bonin </em>v. <em>Chestnut Hill Towers Realty Corp. </em>392 Mass. 58, 70 (1984), quoting <em>Kacavas </em>v. <em>Diamond, </em>303 Mass. 88, 93 (1939). See generally <em>Gram </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>384 Mass. 659, 665-667 (1981). In this case, John Hancock accepted an offer which was, in fact, lower than that which was made by Hurlbert. The property was sold to Uniroyal only because of John Hancock\u2019s desire to give another broker, who had recently lost a commission when a sale of the same property had fallen through, a second opportunity to arrange a sale of the property. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>In short, on this record there could be no inference of bad faith. The defendant\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>summary judgment was properly allowed. The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In 1980, Zielinski had arranged for his client Uniroyal, Inc. (Uniroyal), to purchase the Dedham property for $400,000. A purchase and sale agreement was signed, and Uniroyal paid John Hancock a $20,000 deposit. The transaction was never completed because Uniroyal\u2019s plans to resell the property fell through. Zielinski lost his commission and Uniroyal lost its deposit. At the January 23 meeting, Rowland told Kelly that, in light of Zielinski\u2019s past efforts, Zielinski would be given another opportunity to arrange a sale of the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b417-7\"> The plaintiff set forth claims based on G.
