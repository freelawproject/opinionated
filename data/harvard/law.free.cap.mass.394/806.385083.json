Babize was discharged from her position as a project supervisor with the Massachusetts Migrant Education Program (MMEP). Babize filed an application for unemployment benefits with the Division of Employment Security (division). Her application was denied pursuant to G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She appealed from this denial. A hearing was held before a review examiner on March 3, 1983. The review examiner concluded that she properly had been disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation benefits under G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25 <em>(e) </em>(2). Babize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>appealed to the board of review (board), which denied her application for review, thereby making the decision of the director the final decision of the board. See. G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 41 (c). Babize then sought judicial review in the Northampton District Court in accordance with G. L. c. 151A, \u00a742. The District Court judge set aside the decision of the director, holding, without specific findings, that the director\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. The MMEP appeals the judgment of the District Court judge to this court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">This action arises from the same occurrence which precipitated the case of <em>Jorgensen </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., ante </em>800 (1985). See <em>Jorgensen, supra </em>at 801-803, for a recitation of the basic facts of the present case. The review examiner in the present case<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> made substantially the same findings and conclusion of law regarding Babize as he made regarding Jorgensen in <em>Jorgensen, supra. </em>We conclude, as we did in <em>Jorgensen, </em>and for the same reasons, that the review examiner\u2019s findings and conclusion were supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Babize worked as a project supervisor for two years and reported directly to Jorgensen, the project coordinator. As a project supervisor, Babize was, as the review examiner found, a member of \u201cmiddle management.\u201d Her responsibilities at the time in issue included the task of certifying payroll records. She certified employee time sheets and payroll records which were false. Although she testified that she did not know of a prohibition against falsification of payroll records, the review examiner was not required to believe her on that point. See <em>Starks </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>391 Mass. 640, 643 (1984). She admitted her participation in the falsification scheme, and when asked whether she was in full agreement with Jorgensen in the carrying out of their plan she responded, \u201cIt seemed to be the most logical thing to do.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Although she submitted evidence of falsification of payroll records on other occasions, this evidence was irrelevant to the issue of her wrongdoing in this instance. Prior instances of falsification do not exonerate this act of falsification. Likewise, her argument that she simply was following Jorgensen\u2019s instructions, even if supported by the record, would not undermine the review examiner\u2019s conclusion that she had engaged in an act of deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest. Like Jorgensen, she was an experienced employee in a responsible position. The review examiner could infer that she knew the danger to the employing unit\u2019s interests of her deliberate misconduct. See <em>Jorgensen, supra </em>at 804-805.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed.
