L. c. 152, \u00a7 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>This is the insurer\u2019s appeal from a judgment entered in the Superior Court, and affirmed by the Appeals Court, 17 Mass. App. Ct. 727 (1984), awarding compensation under G. L. c. 152 to Helen J. Kelly, the employee. The judgment reversed a decision of the Industrial Accident Board\u2019s reviewing board which had affirmed a single member\u2019s decision denying Kelly compensation. We granted the insurer\u2019s application for further appellate review. We affirm the judgment entered in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The findings of the single member were adopted by the reviewing board and, because they have evidential support and are not tainted by error of law, they are final. <em>Haley\u2019s Case, </em>356 Mass. 678, 679-680 (1970), and cases cited. We summarize the findings as follows. Kelly was employed by Raytheon Corporation for twenty-two years prior to August, 1977. At the time of the events giving rise to this case, she worked as an associate training specialist and was responsible for running Raytheon\u2019s training center. She was happily married, had two grown children, and got along well with her supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">On Friday, August 19, 1977, Kelly\u2019s supervisor called her aside and told her that the company was cutting back in her department and that she would be laid off. Kelly began to cry, was unable to compose herself, and went home early. She remained upset over the weekend. When she returned to work on Monday, August 22, she was told that she could transfer to the cable department and work there as a foreperson. Kelly was not pleased to work in the cable department, and on that same day she became depressed, developed chest pains, and was taken to a hospital where she was put on medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Kelly remained out of work for six weeks. She returned to work in the cable department on October 5, 1977, but on October 14 she again developed chest pains and was taken to the hospital. Thereafter, she underwent psychiatric treatment for depression, she lost weight, and she experienced difficulty in sleeping. Based on the testimony of her psychiatrist, the single member found that Kelly \u201chas been totally disabled from August 22, 1977 to date\u201d and that \u201cher depression was caused by her hearing that she was to be laid off from one department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>and transferred to another.\u201d The single member concluded, however, that Kelly had not suffered an injury arising out of and in the course of her employment and therefore was not entitled to compensation. The reviewing board agreed. That conclusion is not to be reversed unless a different conclusion is required as a matter of law. <em>Corraro\u2019s Case, </em>380 Mass. 357, 359 (1980). We believe that the law does require a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">The findings of the single member clearly establish that Kelly suffered a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d within the meaning of the act. We have held in several cases that emotional disability, if caused by employment, is a compensable personal injury under G. L. c. 152. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., post </em>1007 (1985). <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>381 Mass. 545, 550 (1980). <em>Albanese\u2019s Case, </em>378 Mass. 14, 17 (1979). <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, </em>374 Mass. 633, 637-638 (1978). In none of those cases did we suggest that entitlement to workers\u2019 compensation for emotional disability requires proof of facts in addition to those required when the disability is only physical, and we discern no basis in G. L. c. 152 for such a requirement. Nor can it properly be contested that Kelly\u2019s injury was caused by her hearing that she would lose her position as a training specialist. Regardless of whether Kelly\u2019s experience is viewed as a forced transfer from one position to another or as a layoff, the single member has determined with finality that Kelly\u2019s disability is attributable to that event. The only new question presented by this case, then, is whether disability that results from an employee\u2019s learning that she will be laid off from one department and assigned to another may be said to arise out of and in the course of employment, as is required for entitlement to workers\u2019 compensation under G. L. c. 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">A disability arises out of and in the course of employment if it is \u201cattributable to the \u2018nature, conditions, obligations or incidents of the employment; in other words, [to] employment looked at in any of its aspects.\u2019\u201d <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. 590, 592 (1982), quoting <em>Caswell\u2019s Case, </em>305 Mass. 500, 502 (1940). Thus, the question is whether the event that caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Kelly\u2019s disability was an incident of employment \u201cin any of its aspects.\u201d We have no doubt that that event was such an incident, particularly in view of the long-standing principle that the workers\u2019 compensation statute should be construed, whenever possible, in favor of the employee so as \u201cto promote the accomplishment of its beneficent design.\u201d <em>Young </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>218 Mass. 346, 349 (1914). Kelly, then, is within the class of persons the Legislature sought to protect by G. L. c. 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">We reject any contention that Kelly is not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation unless her emotional disability resulted from an unusual and objectively stressful or traumatic event. \u201cOur decisions place injuries attributable to specific events at work within the business risks covered by the act, even when employment does not expose employees to an unusual risk greater than that experienced by the general public. <em>Caswell\u2019s Case, </em>305 Mass. 500, 502 (1940) (injury at work during hurricane). See <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, </em>374 Mass. 633, 638 (1978).\u201d <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 595 n.2. Furthermore, it is settled law that an employer takes his employee \u201cas is,\u201d that is, with whatever peculiar vulnerabilities to injury the employee may have, and that \u201can identifiable incident or strain need not be unusual or severe to support compensation if the particular employee succumbs to it. See, e.g., <em>McManus\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 171 (1951) (bending over caused hernia).\u201d <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Nothing in <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., supra, Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, supra, Albanese\u2019s Case, supra, </em>or <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., supra, </em>is at variance with the above stated principles. Although the work-related events in those cases were unusually stressful, we attached no significance to the unusualness of the stress in arriving at our holdings. The unusualness of the stress in each case simply served to identify specific work-related events as causes of the employees\u2019 emotional disabilities. In the instant case, despite the absence of an unusual, objectively stressful, event, the single member\u2019s finding has nevertheless established that a specific work-related event caused the employee\u2019s emotional disability. Nothing more is needed to satisfy G. L. c. 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Cases involving injuries due to gradual deterioration, or bodily wear and tear, are inapposite. When disability results, not from a single work-related event or series of events, but from gradual deterioration, a causal relationship between employment and the disability can only be established by showing that the employment exposed the employee to \u201can identifiable condition [of the employment] that is not common and necessary to all or a great many occupations.\u201d <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 595. Compare <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 596 (\u201cProlonged standing and walking are simply too common among necessary human activities to constitute identifiable conditions of employment\u201d), with <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487, 496 (1916) (\u201cWhen a pre-existing heart disease of the employee is accelerated to the point of disablement by the exertion and strain of the employment, not due to the character of the disease acting alone or progressing as is would in any rational work,\u201d the injury is compensable under the act). However, when an injury is attributable to a specific work-related event, as here, or a series of such events, rather than to gradual wear and tear, the employee need not show that the employment exposed him or her to an unusual risk greater than that experienced by the general public. \u201cTo be compensable, the harm must arise <em>either </em>from a specific incident or series of incidents at work, <em>or </em>from an identifiable condition that is not common and necessary to all or a great many occupations\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 594-595.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">We agree with the Appeals Court that Kelly is entitled to compensation, and that <em>Korsun\u2019s Case, </em>354 Mass. 124 (1968), does not require a different result. \u201cAs the court noted in <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 639, \u2018there was a lack of evidence [in <em>Korsun\u2019s Case] </em>with which to connect the alleged precipitating event to Korsun\u2019s employment. \u2019 There is no such failure to prove causation in the present case. And as further noted in <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. at 594, the language in <em>Korsun\u2019s Case </em>(at 128) concerning apprehension about losing one\u2019s job [as not arising out of the nature, conditions, obligations, or incidents of the employment] refers to injuries caused by the general stress of work which are rendered noncompensable by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>the \u2018wear and tear\u2019 doctrine. We consider <em>Korsun\u2019s Case </em>to have been limited by later opinions and to be inapplicable to the facts here.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) 17 Mass. App. Ct. 727, 730-731 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Our reasoning essentially tracks that of the Appeals Court. But that court found \u201cthe result troubling and one which may involve a larger extension of liabililty than the <em>[Albanese </em>and <em>Fitzgibbons] </em>cases contemplated.\u201d 17 Mass. App. Ct. at 733. We recognize that layoffs and job transfers are frequent events, and that emotional injuries are more prone to fabrication and less susceptible to substantiation than are physical injuries. Nevertheless, it is within the Legislature\u2019s prerogative to determine, as a matter of public policy, whether one of the costs of doing business in this Commonwealth shall be the compensation of those few employees who do suffer emotional disability as a result of being laid off or transferred, and it is also the Legislature\u2019s prerogative to say whether determination of the existence of such a disability is appropriately left to the expertise of the Industrial Accident Board. We construe G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26, as providing that an employee who suffers emotional disability as a result of layoff or transfer is entitled to workers\u2019 compensation, and as vesting in the Industrial Accident Board the responsibility to make the relevant factual determination. Because the single member found that Kelly suffered such a disability, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b705-7\">Hennessey, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aty\">(dissenting, with whom Wilkins and Lynch, JJ., join). Today the court has held that an employee is entitled to workers\u2019 compensation for an emotional injury caused by news of her economically-motivated work transfer. By reversing the board\u2019s finding that Kelly did not suffer a work-related injury within the meaning of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26, the court has expanded the scope of our workers\u2019 compensation law far beyond what the Legislature ever intended. As a result, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>the critical distinction between workers\u2019 compensation and unemployment insurance is disappearing. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">An employee is entitled to compensation under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26, where his or her injury \u2014 whether physical or emotional \u2014 arose \u201cout of and in the course of\u201d employment. <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, </em>385 Mass. 590, 592 (1982), quoting <em>Caswell\u2019s Case, </em>305 Mass. 500, 502 (1940). In the past, we have recognized that \u201c[m]uch of the responsibility for separating injuries that are sufficiently work-related from those that are not rests with the Industrial Accident Board, which must determine as a matter of fact whether a causal connection exists between employment and injury.\u201d <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 594. See <em>Mahoney\u2019s Case, </em>337 Mass. 629, 632 (1958) (\u201cA decision upon the question of causation was . . . within the province of the board to determine\u201d). On judicial review the findings of the reviewing board must be accepted as final unless they are wholly lacking in evidential support or tainted by error of law. <em>Korsun\u2019s Case, </em>354 Mass. 124, 125 (1968), and cases cited. We have given particular deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its governing statute where \u201cthe statute itself vests broad powers in the agency to fill in the details of the legislative scheme.\u201d <em>Amherst-Pelham Regional School Comm. </em>v. <em>Department of Educ., </em>376 Mass. 480, 492 (1978). I think the court here has failed to accord appropriate deference to the board\u2019s construction of the controlling statute as applied to the facts of this case. This is emphatically evident in light of the fact that the board\u2019s decision is consistent with our prior relevant decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Where employees have received compensation for mental or emotional disorders caused by nonphysical work-related trauma, we have previously relied on findings by the board that the injury resulted from a \u201csingle traumatic event ... a stress greater than the ordinary stresses of everyday work,\u201d <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, </em>374 Mass. 633, 638 (1978), or a series of \u201cspecific, stressful work-related incidents,\u201d <em>Albanese\u2019s Case, </em>378 Mass. 14, 18 n.4 (1979). See <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>381 Mass 545, 550 (1981). We have said that what is critical in determining causation is not the subjective feelings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>of the employee but the objective event \u201ctriggering the . . . feelings.\u201d <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">In this case, the testimony before the single member indicated that the employee suffered disabling depression when faced with the loss of a satisfying job and a transfer to a less desirable assignment. There was no evidence that the layoff was motivated by other than economic reasons or that the information was given to the employee in a particularly stressful manner. Nor did the board accept evidence that the employee\u2019s treatment in her new assignment aggravated her emotional condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Thus, in the circumstances of this case, the single member and the review board were fully warranted in concluding that the event triggering the employee\u2019s depression \u2014 the termination of her position and her transfer within the company \u2014 did not constitute the type of \u201cmentally traumatic [event]\u201d which would be sufficient to identify employment as the cause of her disability. <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 638. Rather the type of decision made here is \u201ccommon and necessary to . . . a great many occupations,\u201d <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 595, and while such decisions may understandably cause stress among some affected employees it is no \u201cgreater than the ordinary stresses of everyday work,\u201d and is therefore noncompensable. <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">When we compare the events causing the employees\u2019 mental injuries in the <em>Fitzgibbons, Albanese, </em>and <em>Foley </em>cases, it becomes apparent that we are not presented with a similarly identifiable stressful work-related incident here. In <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, supra, </em>the employee suffered an emotional breakdown and subsequently committed suicide after learning that a subordinate had died while performing an assigned duty. In <em>Albanese\u2019s Case, supra, </em>the claimant was a \u201cworking foreman,\u201d caught between the conflicting demands of labor and management, who became incapacitated after a series of workplace confrontations in which management attempted to undermine his authority. In <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., supra, </em>the employee\u2019s emotional injury resulted from his employer\u2019s conduct in response to charges of rape and assault brought against the employee by a coworker. The employer carried out a private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>investigation of the complaint resulting in the filing of criminal charges, compelled the employee to take a leave of absence pending trial, discouraged other employees from testifying on his behalf, and subsequently transferred the employee, after he was acquitted of the charges, to a new work location where he received no assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">In all three prior cases the events causing the employees\u2019 injuries were unusually stressful by any objective criteria. Here, however, the employee\u2019s depression was precipitated by notice of an ordinary employment decision. The extraordinary nature of her emotional response reflected her admitted apprehension over the prospect of unemployment. In these circumstances, \u201c[ajpprehension over the prospect of losing one\u2019s job does not arise \u2018out of the nature, condition, obligations or incidents of the employment. \u2019 . . . Rather it is a state of mind which arises from the common necessity of working for a living. Social legislation designed to relieve the consequences of losing one\u2019s job is found elsewhere.\u201d <em>Korsun\u2019s Case, </em>354 Mass. 124, 128 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The court\u2019s opinion incorrectly states that we have never before suggested that a stricter standard of proof is required under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26, for establishing the causal nexus between employment and emotional injury. In fact, we have never before allowed compensation for emotional injuries without proof that the injuries resulted from particularly stressful work-related incidents. See <em>Albanese\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 18 n.4; <em>Zerofski\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 595 n.3. We have emphasized <em>(Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 639) the nature of the objective event which triggered the emotional reaction of the employee to determine whether an emotional injury is sufficiently work-related, and this is the reasoning which has been followed by several other jurisdictions. See <em>Seitz </em>v. <em>L &amp; R Indus., </em>437 A.2d 1345 (R.I. 1981) (psychic injury due to routine transfer to new work location was not compensable); <em>School Dist. No. 1, Village of Brown Deer </em>v. <em>Department of Indus., Labor &amp; Human Relations, </em>62 Wisc. 2d 370 (1974) (teacher\u2019s depression on learning student council recommended her dismissal was not compensable). Cf. <em>Elwood </em>v. <em>State Accident Ins. Fund </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number><em>Corp., </em>67 Or. App. 134 (1984) (stressful, work-related events, including termination, contributed to compensable mental disorder); <em>Rega </em>v. <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp., </em>475 A.2d 213 (R.I. 1984) (injury compensable due to excessively stressful firing, rehiring, and deprivation of pension benefits). See Note, Determining the Compensability of Mental Disabilities and Workers\u2019 Compensation, 55 S. Cal. L. Rev. 193, 194-199 (1981); Joseph, The Causation Issue in Workers\u2019 Compensation Mental Disability Cases: An Analysis, Solutions, and a Perspective, 36 Vand. L. Rev. 263, 304-305 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In our previous cases we have required a showing of one or more specific stressful, traumatic events as the cause of the emotional jury. By departing from those limits, the court has opened workers\u2019 compensation to distressed claimants who have simply experienced economically inevitable terminations and transfers. I think the court has departed from the legislative intent, and I also think that this judicial venture will invite claims in such numbers as to have a substantial economic impact upon employers.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
