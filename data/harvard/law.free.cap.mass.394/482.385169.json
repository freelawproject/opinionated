In that action the plaintiff alleged that he was the subject of a defamatory article, written by Ayik and published in the union\u2019s newspaper. The article, which appears in the margin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleged that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>tiff, who was employed as a foreman for General Motors Corporation (G.M.), was engaging in \u201cbargaining unit\u201d work, i.e., union work, contrary to the provisions of the union\u2019s contract with the company. Specifically, the article accused the plaintiff of punching vehicle repair tickets without performing the requisite repair work.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The newspaper was distributed to union and management personnel on June 15, 1971. The plaintiff was suspended on the morning following the distribution, after being called to the plant manager\u2019s office, where mention of the article was made. On June 18, 1971, G.M. discharged the plaintiff for allegedly punching the vehicle repair tickets of unrepaired vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In 1973, the plaintiff brought an action against several representative officers and members of the union for libel and tortious interference with an employment relationship.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jury returned verdicts against the union and against two of the individual defendants, Henry Ayik and Baheege Ayik.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendants appealed and this court reversed the judgments and ordered a new trial. <em>Tosti </em>v. <em>Ayik, </em>386 Mass. 721 (1982) <em>(Tosti I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Upon retrial, the jury found for all defendants on the plaintiff\u2019s claim of tortious interference with an employment relationship. It further found for the defendant Baheege Ayik on the libel claim. However, the jury returned verdicts for libel against Henry Ayik in the amount of $5,000, and against the union in the amount of $495,000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Ayik and the union unsuccessfully moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdicts and for a new trial on the libel counts. Both defendants appealed and we granted their application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">On appeal, the defendants argue that (1) the subject matter jurisdiction of the State court was preempted by Federal labor law; (2) the judge erred in failing to require \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d of the union\u2019s liability for Ayik\u2019s actions; (3) various evidentiary rulings constituted reversible errors; (4) the plaintiff failed to prove Ayik\u2019s malice by clear and convincing evidence and therefore the defendants were entitled to directed verdicts; (5) the judge erred in denying their motions for judgments notwithstanding the verdicts or, alternatively, for a new trial; (6) the damage awards were inconsistent and the award against the union was excessive; (7) interest on the awards was erroneously computed due to the judge\u2019s misinterpretation of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B. We affirm the judge\u2019s rulings on all issues, except as regards the excessive damages awarded against the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">1. <em>Preemption.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The defendants contend that State courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff\u2019s libel claim as a result of the recent United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Local 926, Int\u2019l Union of Operating Eng\u2019rs v. Jones, </em>460 U.S. 669 (1983). We disagree. In previously considering the defendants\u2019 preemption claim, we stated that \u201cFederal labor law preempts State libel law to the extent that defamatory statements made in the context of a labor dispute are actionable only if made with knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>truth. <em>Old Dominion Branch No. 496, Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>418 U.S. 264, 273 (1974). <em>Linn </em>v. <em>United Plant Guard Workers Local 114, </em>383 U.S. 53, 61 (1966). In other words, State courts may grant relief in such defamation actions only if the defamatory statements were made with actual malice, as defined in <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 279-280 (1964).\u201d <em>Tosti I, supra </em>at 723.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Local 926, Int\u2019l Union of Operating Eng\u2019rs, supra, </em>did not change, but rather reaffirmed, this rule. There the Court held that a cause of action against a union for tortious interference with an employment relationship was preempted because the claim was not \u201cso deeply rooted in local law\u201d as to outweigh \u201cthe interference with the federal labor law that prosecution of the state action would entail.\u201d 460 U.S. 669, 683 (1983). At the same time, however, the Court distinguished and reaffirmed its earlier holding in <em>Linn </em>v. <em>United Plant Guard Workers Local 114, supra, </em>\u201cthat an action for a malicious and injurious libel in the course of a labor dispute . . . was not pre-empted since it was unprotected conduct and since remedying injury to reputation was of only slight concern to the national labor policy and was a matter deeply rooted in state law <em>.\u2019\u2019Local 926, Int\u2019l Union of Operating Eng\u2019rs, supra </em>at 681 n.11. We therefore see no reason to reconsider the defendants\u2019 preemption claim and conclude that our decision in <em>Tosti I, supra </em>at 723, remains controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">2. <em>Union Liability.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The defendants claim that the judge erred in instructing the jury that, in order to hold the union liable for Ayik\u2019s article, \u201cthe plaintiff must prove by the greater weight of the believable evidence that either or both defendants were acting on behalf of the local and within the scope of their responsibilities for the local when the material in question was published.\u201d They contend that G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 20B, which is modeled after \u00a7 6 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 106 (1982), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>requires proof of a union\u2019s vicarious tort liability by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 20B, inserted by St. 1935, c. 407, \u00a7 1, states: \u201cNo officer or member of any association or organization, and no association or organization, participating or interested in a labor dispute . . . shall be held responsible or liable in any court for the unlawful acts of individual officers, members or agents, except upon clear proof of actual participation in, or actual authorization of, such acts, or of ratification of such acts after actual knowledge thereof.\u201d In <em>Tosti I, supra </em>at 723-724, we noted that the article in question was \u201cpublished in the context of a labor dispute\u201d because \u201c[a] dispute over supervisory personnel doing bargaining unit work is a controversy concerning terms and conditions of employment.\u201d See G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 20C (c). We stated that \u201c[w]e cannot separate the allegedly defamatory statement from the protected activity concerning the terms and conditions of employment.\u201d <em>Tosti I, supra </em>at 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 20B, however, was intended to govern union liability in actions arising from violent labor disputes, such as injunction and contempt proceedings. The statute was originally enacted as \u00a7 1 of St. 1935, c. 407, \u201cAn Act relative to injunction and contempt procedure in labor disputes.\u201d \u201cWhile the title to an act cannot control the provisions of the statute, the title may be used for the purpose of ascertaining its proper limitation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>388 Mass. 115, 120 (1983), and cases cited. We have noted in the past that the enactment of c. 407 \u201cfollowed a recommendation of the Governor that the laws relating to injunctions in labor disputes \u2018should be liberalized and strengthened,\u2019 and . . . that the Norris-LaGuardia Act should be adopted \u2018as a basis for the drafting of the required state legislation. \u2019 \u201d <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Schwachman, </em>301 Mass. 573, 581 (1938), quoting 1935 Senate Doc. No. 1. See <em>Fashioncraft, Inc. </em>v. <em>Halpern, </em>313 Mass. 385, 389 (1943); <em>Mengel </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>313 Mass. 238, 245 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Our interpretation of the scope of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 20B, is bolstered by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>the purpose of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. \u201c[T]he simple concern of Congress was that unions had been found liable for violence and other illegal acts occurring in labor disputes which they had never authorized or ratified and for which they should not be held responsible. . . . The straightforward answer was \u00a7 6, with its requirement that when illegal acts of any individual are charged against one of the major antagonists in a labor dispute \u2014 whether employer or union \u2014 the evidence must clearly prove that the individual\u2019s acts were authorized or ratified.\u201d <em>Ramsey </em>v. <em>UMW, </em>401 U.S. 302, 310 (1971). See <em>United Bhd. of Carpenters </em>v. <em>United States, </em>330 U.S. 395, 403 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Other jurisdictions which have enacted legislation patterned after the Norris-LaGuardia Act have held that their analogous statutes do not apply to cases charging unions with tort liability. See, e.g., <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>232 Ind. 314, 318 (1953); <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>International Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>94 Wash. 2d 508, 511 (1980). While the Connecticut cases relied upon by the defendants do involve union tort liability, there too the alleged torts arose in the context of a violent labor dispute. In <em>Benoit </em>v. <em>Amalgamated Local 299 United Elec. Radio &amp; Mach. Workers, </em>150 Conn. 266, 274-275 (1963) and <em>United Aircraft Corp. </em>v. <em>International Ass\u2019n of Machinists, </em>161 Conn. 79, 87-88 (1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1016 (1972), the court applied the analogous Connecticut statute where the injuries suffered resulted from assaults and batteries associated with union picketing.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">For these reasons, we conclude that the labor dispute encompassing the libel alleged here is beyond the intended scope of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 20B. We therefore affirm the judge\u2019s ruling regarding the standard of proof required to impose liability on the union for publication of Ayik\u2019s article.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">3. <em>The Judge\u2019s Evidentiary Rulings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The defendants challenge three of the judge\u2019s evidentiary rulings and claim each error provides ground for reversal. First, they contend that the judge erred in refusing to admit purported business records of G.M. regarding the plaintiff\u2019s termination. The defendants sought to introduce as business records, pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>suant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78, four memoranda from G.M.\u2019s personnel files which were prepared in connection with the company\u2019s investigation of the plaintiff\u2019s conduct. The documents contained information from secondary sources as well as from the personal knowledge of their authors.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Although the judge failed to disclose the basis for his exclusion of the documents, we infer from his ruling that he was not satisfied that the statutory prerequisites had been met. <em>Omansky </em>v. <em>Shain, </em>313 Mass. 129, 132 (1943). Because the defendants failed to show that it was the business duty of each of the authors to prepare such memoranda in the regular course of business, they failed to comply with at least one of the prerequisites to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78. See <em>Wingate </em>v. <em>Emery Air Freight Corp., </em>385 Mass. 402, 406 (1982) (\u201cThe preparer\u2019s hearsay sources must carry the same indicia of reliability, arising from regularity and business motives, that bring his own act of recording the information within the statutory exception\u201d); <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 313, 316 (1973) (second level of hearsay inadmissible under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The defendants argue that even if G.M.\u2019s records were inadmissible under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78, the judge should have ruled them admissible as past recollections recorded. However, since nothing in the record suggests that the defendants offered the documents for this purpose, they may not rely on this ground for the first time on appeal. <em>National Granite Bank </em>v. <em>Tyndale, </em>179 Mass. 390, 393-394 (1901).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The defendants also contend that the judge erred in admitting a statement allegedly made by the defendant Baheege Ayik in 1968, to the effect that he intended to \u201cget\u201d the plaintiff for the latter\u2019s opposition to a union strike that year. The defendants moved in limine to exclude the statement as irrelevant and prejudicial. The plaintiff argued that the statement was relevant to establish a possible union motive for the alleged libel.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">We have stated that, \u201c[i]n determining whether the evidence offered serves any valid purpose we apply the rule that it must merely render the desired inference more probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em>369 Mass. 47, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>59 (1975). In \u201cthe great majority of instances,\u201d the offering party is entitled to the evidence. <em>Id. </em>If it is possible that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect, the question of admissibility is \u201cdetermined in the sound discretion of the judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">We cannot say the judge abused his discretion in admitting the challenged statement. While the fact that the statement was made three years prior to the publication of the article in question may affect the weight it should be given, remoteness in time does not render the statement irrelevant. <em>Sherburne </em>v. <em>Meade, </em>303 Mass. 356, 360 (1939). See <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>343 Mass. 655, 657 (1962) (whether evidence is too remote in time for purpose offered is decision squarely within the discretion of trial judge).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Finally, the defendants charge that the judge abused his discretion in denying their motion for a mistrial. The defendants moved for a mistrial after the plaintiff referred, during his direct examination, to a separate suit he had brought against G.M. which he subsequently settled for $6,048 in severance pay. The defendants objected to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as irrelevant and prejudicial since the jury could incorrectly infer that the settlement referred to represented an acknowledgment by G.M. that the plaintiff was wrongfully discharged. In response to their objection, the judge instructed the jury to disregard any references to other lawsuits and, pursuant to a stipulation of the parties, the jury were also informed that the sum received by the plaintiff represented accrued benefits in the form of severance pay. The judge reasonably concluded that these curative steps defused the prejudicial effect of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony. We are satisfied that there was no abuse of discretion in his denial of the defendants\u2019 motion for a mistrial. See <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Davison Constr. Co., </em>381 Mass. 432, 444-446 (1980) (motion for mistrial properly denied where judge\u2019s clarifying instructions cured juror confusion); <em>Shea </em>v. <em>D. &amp; N. Motor Transp. Co., </em>316 Mass. 553, 555 (1944) (judge \u201cnot obliged to declare a mistrial, provided he adequately guarded against all improper effect\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>4. <em>Evidence of Malice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The defendants next claim error in the judge\u2019s denial of their motions for directed verdicts. They contend that the plaintiff failed to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that the article in question was published with actual malice and therefore the jury should not have been allowed to decide the libel issue. We disagree. As a general rule, in considering a motion for a directed verdict, \u201c[t]he question is whether the evidence, construed most favorably to the plaintiff, could not support a verdict for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 212 (1978). In defamation cases governed by the <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan </em>standard, we are under a constitutional obligation to determine \u201cwhether the jury would be warranted in concluding that malice was proved by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 849, 870 (1975). On appeal \u201cthose portions of the record which relate to the actual-malice determination must be independently assessed.\u201d <em>Bose Corp. </em>v. <em>Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., </em>466 U.S. 485, 514 n.31 (1984). If the facts, considered in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, were sufficient for the jury to find clear and convincing evidence<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the defendants\u2019 malice, then the judge properly denied the directed verdict motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Before reviewing the facts before the jury, we reiterate that \u201c[ajctual malice is not necessarily proved in terms of ill will or hatred, but is proved rather by a showing that the defamatory falsehood was published with knowledge that it was false or reckless disregard of whether it was false.\u201d <em>Stone, supra </em>at 867. For the jury to find that a publication was made in reckless disregard of the truth, \u201c[tjhere must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number><em>St. Amant </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>390 U.S. 727, 731 (1968). \u201c[T]he test is entirely a subjective one. . . . [T]he jury must find that such doubts were in fact entertained by the defendant, or by the defendant\u2019s servant or agent acting within the scope of his employment.\u201d <em>Stone, supra </em>at 868. In order to determine the defendant\u2019s state of mind, the jury are entitled to draw inferences from the objective evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Based upon the evidence presented, the jury could have found the following facts relevant to their determination of the defendants\u2019 malice. On June 7, 1971, the night in which the defendant Ayik claimed to make the observations contained in his article, he was \u201cchasing stock\u201d for as many as forty repairmen. Consequently, he was away from the electrical hole area, where both he and the plaintiff were stationed, for substantial periods of time, including the fifteen minute period prior to making the observations alleged in his article. Ayik testified that after returning to his work area, he watched the plaintiff go down a line of six cars, take repair tickets off the windshields, and punch the repair tickets. He then confronted the plaintiff, wrote down the job numbers of the cars, and informed the plaintiff that he intended to file a grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Despite the fact that his article refers to cars leaving the electrical hole with defective horns and brakes, potential safety hazards, Ayik conceded that he did not know how to read the repair tickets and therefore had no idea what repairs were actually designated on the tickets. Nor did he claim to know whether any of the cars with tickets punched by the plaintiff had safety problems or improper repairs. When Ayik was asked why the plaintiff could not have made the designated repairs while the defendant was out of the area, he replied, \u201cBecause I watched [the plaintiff] in a three-month period, and he was out in that repair yard punching tickets and flagging them. . . . And they were never repaired.\u201d Ayik testified that during April and May of 1971, he observed the plaintiff two or three nights a week punching tickets on cars in the repair yard without ever making repairs. He further testified that in writing the article, he \u201cwasn\u2019t complaining about the repair,\u201d but \u201conly complaining about the punch. That\u2019s all I wanted taken away was the punch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Contrary to Ayik\u2019s testimony, the plaintiff stated that he did not work the night shift during April and May of 1971, the time in which the defendant claimed to have observed him punching tickets of unrepaired vehicles. Although he acknowledged that he had performed minor repairs and punched repair tickets in violation of the union contract, including the night of June 7, 1971, the plaintiff testified that he never punched an item on an unrepaired vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">This evidence, if believed by the jury, was sufficient to provide clear and convincing proof<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that Ayik either published his article based on fabricated observations of the plaintiff or, at the least, entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his allegations. The defendant conceded that he did not particularly care whether the plaintiff failed to repair the vehicles. Instead, he testified that he was motivated to write the article because the plaintiff was performing bargaining unit work, i.e., punching repair tickets. The jury could therefore have found that this motive led the defendant to either fabricate the other charges or to make his accusations based on suspicions and not facts. This conclusion would have been particularly warranted if the jury found that the defendant could not have observed the plaintiff on the job during April and May. The defendant testified that his prior observations of the plaintiff during these months formed the \u201csole\u201d basis for his allegation that the plaintiff performed no repairs on the night of June 7, 1971. Because the jury found that the defendant Ayik was acting within the scope of his union responsibilities when he wrote the article and submitted it for publication, they were justified in imputing his state of mind to the union for the purpose of establishing the union\u2019s vicarious liability. <em>Cantrell </em>v. <em>Forest City Publishing Co., </em>419 U.S. 245, 253-254 n.6 (1974). <em>Stone, supra </em>at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>For these reasons, we conclude that the jury would have been warranted in finding that the defendants\u2019 malice was proved by clear and convincing evidence. Therefore the judge properly denied the defendants\u2019 motions for directed verdicts. This is true regardless of whether he or we would personally have been convinced by the same evidence. <em>Stone, supra </em>at 870 n.11. <em>Id. </em>at 873 (Quirico, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">5. <em>Motion for a New Trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The defendants contend that their motions for judgments notwithstanding the verdicts or, in the alternative, for a new trial should have been granted. When acting on a defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the judge\u2019s task, \u201ctaking into account all the evidence in its aspect most favorable to the plaintiff, [is] to determine whether, without weighing the credibility of the witnesses or otherwise considering the weight of the evidence, the jury reasonably could return a verdict for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Rubel </em>v. <em>Hayden, Harding &amp; Buchanan, Inc., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 252, 254 (1983). Conflicting evidence alone does not justify judgment notwithstanding the verdict. <em>O\u2019Shaughnessy </em>v. <em>Besse, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 727, 729 (1979). \u201c[I]t is of no avail for the defendant to argue that there was some or even much evidence which would have warranted a contrary finding by the jury. \u201d <em>Curtiss-Wright Corp. </em>v. <em>Edel-Brown Tool &amp; Die Co., </em>381 Mass. 1, 4 (1980), quoting <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>363 Mass. 402, 407 (1973). The court may not substitute its judgment of the facts for that of the jury. <em>O\u2019 Shaughnessy, supra </em>at 728. These well-settled rules regarding the respective roles of judge and jury do not change in defamation cases. It remains the case that \u201c[w]hen the testimony of a witness is not believed, the trier of fact may simply disregard it.\u201d <em>Bose Corp. </em>v. <em>Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., </em>466 U.S. 485, 512 (1984). Even if conflicting evidence was introduced from which the jury could have found that the charges against the plaintiff were either true or not made with actual malice, the jury were free to believe or disbelieve the evidence presented. We have already concluded that the jury, crediting the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>have been warranted in reaching their verdicts. Consequently, there was no error in the judge\u2019s denial of the defendants\u2019 motions for judgments notwithstanding the verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">As to the defendants\u2019 alternative motions for a new trial, it is clear from our summary of the evidence, above, that these motions (except as to the amount of damages; see discussion, <em>infra) </em>rested in the sound discretion of the judge, and consequently there was no error in his denial of the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">6. <em>Damages.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The defendants further assert that the libel verdicts are inconsistent, in light of: (1) the verdicts for them on the plaintiff\u2019s count for intentional interference with an employment relationship and (2) the disparity in the $5,000 verdict against Ayik and the $495,000 verdict against the union. By failing to raise this objection prior to the dismissal of the jury, the defendants deprived the judge of the opportunity to correct any possible errors in the jury\u2019s deliberations. Consequently, they waived their right to attack the verdicts as inconsistent on appeal. <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Fessenden, </em>349 Mass. 429,429-430 (1965). <em>Feaver </em>v. <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>324 Mass. 165, 169 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">There is merit, however, in the defendants\u2019 contention that the verdict against the union is excessive. We agree that the $495,000 award is clearly excessive and \u201cmay impermissibly chill the exercise of First Amendment rights by promoting apprehensive self-censorship.\u201d <em>Stone, supra </em>at 860. In defamation cases, \u201c[bjecause of constitutional considerations, and the potential difficulties in assessing fair compensation . . . both trial and appellate judges have a special duty of vigilance in charging juries and reviewing verdicts to see that damages are no more than compensatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 861. Our Federal labor policy similarly demands heightened scrutiny in reviewing libel awards against unions. \u201c[I]n view of the propensity of juries to award excessive damages for defamation, the availability of libel actions may pose a threat to the stability of labor unions.\u201d Linn v. <em>United Plant Guard Workers Local, 114, </em>383 U.S. 53, 64 (1966). See <em>Old Dominion Branch No. 496, Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>418 U.S. 264, 291 (1974) (Douglas, J., concurring) (\u201ccommunity attitudes toward unionization\u201d influence libel awards against unions).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Both the Legislature and this court have prohibited awards of punitive damages in libel actions, even upon proof of actual malice. <em>Stone, supra </em>at 860-861. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 93. The plaintiff is entitled only to fair compensation for his actual damages, including his mental suffering and harm to his reputation, and for any special damages he has suffered which have been pleaded and proved. <em>Stone, supra </em>at 860. Because First Amendment rights are at stake, we are not slow to pronounce a verdict excessive in defamation cases, <em>Stone, supra </em>at 861, even though by doing so we must necessarily substitute our assessment of reasonable damages for that of the jury. See <em>Curtis Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Butts, </em>388 U.S. 130, 160 (1967) (plurality opinion) (constitutional. guarantee of freedom of speech and press is served by judicial control over excessive verdicts).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In this case, the judge instructed the jury that if they decided the plaintiff lost his employment as a result of the defamation, they could hold the defendants \u201cresponsible for any damages resulting from the loss.\u201d We assume from the size of the verdict that the jury probably found that the defendants caused the plaintiff\u2019s discharge by their libellous publication. However, we are not convinced that the evidence presented by the plaintiff regarding the consequences of his discharge was sufficient to justify a $495,000 award.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The testimony regarding the plaintiff\u2019s employment with G.M. established the following facts. In 1971, as a foreman of drivers of unlicensed cars, he earned approximately $11,800 a year in base pay. From late August through late December of each year, the period in which production began on new automobile models, the plaintiff commonly worked substantial overtime hours and earned up to double or triple his base pay. However, overtime was not guaranteed and the plaintiff did not know how his overtime pay was calculated. At G.M. the plaintiff also received pension, stock, and medical benefits although he did not present any evidence as to their value. After the plaintiff was discharged, at the age of forty-four, he received $6,000 in severance pay. There was additional testimony by G.M. personnel that, by 1980, an employee in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s former position was earning some $27,600 a year in base pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The plaintiff also testified as to his yearly earnings from the time of his discharge in 1971 until the second trial in 1983. During those years he was employed on temporary jobs as a laborer, construction worker, and carpenter with yearly earnings ranging from a low of $2,300 to a high of $18,700. His total earnings during this period were approximately $124,000 compared to the estimated $224,000<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> he would have earned in base pay as a G.M. foreman.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">There was evidence that the plaintiff and his family suffered financial hardship in the years after his discharge. However, where substantial damages are awarded as compensation for earnings allegedly lost as a result of defamation, courts will seek proof that a plaintiff\u2019s inability to find comparable work was actually caused by a defendant\u2019s tortious act. For example, in <em>Lawlor </em>v. <em>Gallagher Presidents\u2019 Report, Inc., </em>394 F. Supp. 721 (S.D.N.Y. 1975), the plaintiff, a former corporate officer, claimed that he was unable to obtain employment in his field as a result of defamatory statements concerning the circumstances of his resignation. In his mid-forties at the time of the libel, he sought damages of $95,000 per year until he reached retirement age. New York law, like our own, limits a plaintiff\u2019s recovery in defamation actions to compensatory damages that are proved by competent evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 733. The court denied the plaintiff\u2019s claim for lost earnings because he failed to prove that \u201cthe publication of the falsehood was a material element or substantial cause of his inability to get a job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 735. Similarly, in <em>Benassi </em>v. <em>Georgia-Pacific, </em>62 Or. App. 698 (1983), modified, 63 Or. App. 672(1983), the plaintiff alleged that as a result of his employer\u2019s slanderous remarks regarding his discharge, he was prevented from securing other employment and ultimately was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>forced to accept a position at a lower rate of pay. The court held there was insufficient proof of special damages because the plaintiff failed to show that he \u201cwould have obtained [employment] but for the currency of the slander.\u201d 62 Or. App. at 705. Because the plaintiff did not claim that any potential employers were aware of the defamatory statements, the court concluded that \u201cit would be mere speculation to permit the jury to infer that the plaintiff was unable to obtain a new job . . . because of the defamation.\u201d 62 Or. App. at 709. In <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Jewell Cos., </em>53 Wis. 2d 656 (1972), the plaintiff also contended that he was unable to find steady employment as a result of defamatory statements made by his former employer. Noting that \u201c[t]he record is devoid of any direct evidence that a slanderous statement was made to a prospective employer,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 660, that court concluded that the jury\u2019s compensatory award of $25,000 was excessive and reduced it to $12,000. <em>Id. </em>at 661-662.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">While in this case the jury could conclude from the evidence that the plaintiff lost employment due to the defendants\u2019 article, that finding does not necessarily entitle the plaintiff to all future wages he would have otherwise earned from G.M. In <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>211 Mass. 301 (1912), we considered the damages due a foreman who had been discharged as a result of union demands. There we held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover his lost wages \u201cpast and future,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 306, because he produced evidence showing that his discharge and his inability to obtain other work were caused by the unlawful acts of the defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 305. In this case, the record presents no comparable proof that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to obtain full-time employment from 1971 through 1982 was due to the defendants\u2019 tortious acts. Cf. <em>Faulk </em>v. <em>Aware, Inc., </em>19 A.D.2d 464, 470 (N.Y. 1963) (potential employers testified they would not hire plaintiff as result of defamation).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In defamation cases, other causally related consequences, such as harm to reputation and mental suffering, are compensable where the awards are supported by competent evidence. <em>Stone, supra </em>at 860-861. Here, however, the evidence establishing such damages is sparse indeed. The record contains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>testimony by the plaintiff\u2019s wife that the plaintiff was \u201cshook up\u201d on the day of his discharge and lay down when he returned home, which was very unusual for him to do. There was no suggestion that the plaintiff received any medical or psychiatric treatment as a result of the libel.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Given the evidence the plaintiff submitted as to proof of his damages, we conclude that the jury\u2019s award of $495,000 against the union was clearly excessive and impermissibly reflected prejudicial or punitive considerations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we shall remand the case to the Superior Court where, upon a motion for a new trial under Mass. R. Civ. P. 59 (a), 365 Mass. 827 (1974), filed by the defendant union within a reasonable time after the rescript herein, the trial judge shall reconsider solely the issue of the excessive damages. Before a new trial is granted<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the plaintiff shall, of course, under rule 59 (a), be given an opportunity to remit such sum as the judge considers excessive. <em>D\u2019Annolfo </em>v. <em>Stoneham Hous. Auth., </em>375 Mass. 650, 661 (1978). Because First Amendment rights are at stake, the court must in this proceeding, and any subsequent proceedings which may follow in this case, bring close scrutiny to the damages assessed. See <em>Stone, supra </em>at 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">7. <em>Interest.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Finally, the defendants challenge the judge\u2019s computation of interest on the verdicts at a rate of 12% per annum from June 13, 1973, the date of the commencement of the action, to March 23, 1983, the date the judgments were entered. The judge awarded interest retroactively pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B, which applies a 12% rate of interest \u201cto all actions in which damages are assessed on or after the effective date of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>this act.\u201d St. 1982,c. 183, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The 1982 act became effective on July 1, 1982; damages were assessed against the defendants on March 23, 1983. Cf. <em>Patry </em>v. <em>Liberty Mobilehome Sales, Inc., ante 270, </em>273 (1985) (where trial judge assessed plaintiff\u2019s damages in 1981, 12% interest rate did not apply).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Relying upon <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Clerk of the Superior Court, </em>368 Mass. 116, 116 (1975), the defendants contend that G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B, was not intended to be fully retroactive in application. However, in the <em>Porter </em>case, the issue was whether St. 1974, c. 224, \u00a7 1, amending G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B, was to be given retroactive effect. The 1974 amendment \u201ccontained no provision comparable to \u00a7 4 of St. 1982, c. 183\u201d and therefore <em>Porter </em>\u201cis inapposite\u201d when interpreting the statute as most recently amended. <em>Mirageas </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>391 Mass. 815, 821 n.9 (1984). We therefore see no error in the judge\u2019s retroactive application of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">8. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">In sum, we conclude that (1) State court subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff\u2019s libel claim was not preempted by Federal law; (2) the jury were properly instructed as to the standard of proof to apply in determining the union\u2019s potential liability for its agent\u2019s actions; (3) the judge properly refused to admit G.M. documents as business records under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78, and properly denied the defendants\u2019 motion in limine and motion for a mistrial; (4) the defendants\u2019 malice was established by clear and convincing evidence; (5) the judge made no error in denying the defendants\u2019 motions for judgments notwithstanding the verdicts or (aside from the excessive damages) for a new trial; and (6) the judge correctly awarded interest pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>The judgment against the individual defendant is affirmed. However, because the jury\u2019s damage award against the union was excessive, we remand the case to the Superior Court where, upon an appropriate motion by the defendant union, an order for remittitur is to be entered in an amount to be determined by the trial judge. If the opportunity for remittitur is declined by the plaintiff, a new trial is to be ordered in the case against the union, confined to the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-14\"> \u201cOn Monday, June 7th [1971,] at 11:34 p.m. Gus Tosti foreman in the electrical hole, was working on job # 603677, a green 4 door Pontiac, T37.
