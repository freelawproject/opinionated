L. c. 266, \u00a7 1. The Appeals Court sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>marily reversed the judgment of conviction based on the improper admission in evidence of a witness\u2019s hearsay statement. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cancel, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 1114 (1984). We allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Citing three errors of law, the defendant argues that his conviction must be reversed. He contends that the first error was made when a witness was allowed to testify, over objection, that \u201ca lot of people told me that you\u2019re responsible for [the fire].\u201d He argues that it was improper to allow, over objection, impeachment of a defense witness by reference to his membership in a street gang. Finally, the defendant argues that the prosecutor in his closing argument improperly made reference to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify or to call alibi witnesses. The Commonwealth contends that, in each of these cases, the defendant failed to preserve his rights by proper objection under Mass. R. Crim. P. 22, 378 Mass. 892 (1979).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree that, in each specific instance, the defendant either failed to preserve his rights by a proper objection or the error was not sufficiently prejudicial to require reversal. Nevertheless, we decide that in combination these circumstances present a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. The defendant\u2019s conviction is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">On the evening of May 21, 1982, a fire broke out in a closet of the defendant\u2019s apartment. Two witnesses testified that they saw the defendant set the fire, and that he did so because he was upset with the woman with whom he shared the apartment. Both witnesses admitted to bias against the defendant, and their description of events differed on a variety of details. The owner of the building testified that, while he was on a back porch of the building shortly after the fire, he observed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>defendant for a \u201ccouple of seconds\u201d standing with a group of people on a street comer approximately 150 feet from the building. The defendant later asserted to the owner that he was out of town on the day of the fire. A member of the Springfield fire department\u2019s arson squad testified that he believed the fire had been set.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">1. <em>Hearsay. </em>The owner testified that, while assessing damage to the apartment a day or two after the fire, he saw the defendant and a conversation ensued. According to the owner\u2019s testimony, the defendant volunteered that he had nothing to do with the fire, to which the owner responded that \u201ca lot of people told me that you\u2019re responsible for it.\u201d When the latter statement was made at trial, the defendant objected, without stating any grounds. Presuming the objection to be based on hearsay, the judge ruled that the statement was admissible to show what the conversation was, not for its truth. As such, it would not be considered hearsay. See P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 263 (5th ed. 1981). The defendant did not object to this ruling, nor did he move at any time to strike the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The defendant now urges that the statement was hearsay and not admissible for any purpose, because it was relevant only for its truth and no exception to the hearsay mie applies. The Commonwealth contends that the statement was useful in placing other, unobjectionable testimony into context. Further, the Commonwealth argues that under mie 22 the defendant failed to preserve his right to dispute that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">We do not agree that the hearsay statement was necessary to place other \u201cconsciousness of guilt\u201d evidence into context. It is clear from the transcript that \u201cthe two statements are entirely separable, the one being admissible and the other inadmissible hearsay prejudicial to the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Pleasant, </em>366 Mass. 100, 103 (1974). Indeed, the Commonwealth concedes that the hearsay statement could have been left out without materially affecting the later evidence. Moreover, a review of all the evidence leaves us with the inescapable conclusion that the statement was relevant only for its truth. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Errington, </em>390 Mass. 875, 881 (1984). As such, it was hearsay to which no exception applied, and therefore inadmissible for any reason. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pleasant, supra </em>at 102-103. A timely objection, even a general one, would have been sufficient to exclude the evidence under these circumstances. See, e.g., 1 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 18, at 824 (Tillers rev. ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">It is equally clear, however, that the defendant\u2019s general objection was insufficient under rule 22. When the objection was interposed, it was not yet clear whether the statement would be relevant other than for its truth. When \u201can accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>responds to incriminating accusations made of him in an equivocal, evasive or irresponsive way inconsistent with his innocence, both the accusations and his answer are admissible. \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Machado, </em>339 Mass. 713, 715-716 (1959), and cases cited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>341 Mass. 50, 54 (1960); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Madeiros, </em>255 Mass. 304, 313 (1926). See also K.B. Hughes, Evidence \u00a7 528, at 737-738 (1961). On the other hand, if the accusation is met with an unequivocal denial by the defendant, the hearsay statement is not an admission, and is inadmissible unless some other exception applies. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pleasant, supra </em>at 102; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>319 Mass. 464, 465 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">At the time of the objection, the witness had not yet testified as to the defendant\u2019s response to the accusatory statement. Thus, the judge could not have then known whether the defendant\u2019s alleged response would be an unequivocal denial, and therefore inadmissible, or an evasive answer or incriminating silence, and therefore admissible. Once it became clear that the defendant had unequivocally denied the statement, it was incumbent on the defendant to renew his objection or move to strike the earlier testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Moreover, it is not apparent that the defendant was dissatisfied with the judge\u2019s ruling. Unlike the situation in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>392 Mass. 558, 562 (1984), the judge\u2019s ruling was not unequivocally adverse. Instead, the defendant received a limiting instruction and took no further action.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">In these circumstances, the initial, general objection was simply insufficient. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Houghtlin, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 691, 694-695 (1983).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The purposes underlying our conclusion were well stated by Chief Justice Shaw: \u201c[I]f the [objection] is intended to be relied on, and is seasonably taken, the omission may be supplied, or the error corrected, and the rights of all parties saved. . . . [I]t is not consistent with the purposes of justice, for a party knowing of a secret defect, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>proceed and take his chance for a favorable verdict, with the power and intent to annul it, as erroneous and void, if it should be against him.\u201d <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>14 Pick. 236, 237 (1833).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">2. <em>Impeachment of defense witness. </em>The defendant called one witness at trial, who testified that an unknown woman approached him in the courthouse, offered to \u201cstop the case\u201d against the defendant for $300, and then walked away laughing. The Commonwealth chose not to move to strike the witness\u2019s testimony,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>but to impeach it instead. On cross-examination, the Commonwealth impeached the witness by introducing in evidence several prior convictions. The Commonwealth then sought to elicit that the defendant was a member of a Springfield street gang.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The rule is \u201csettled in this Commonwealth that in the introduction of evidence affecting generally the credibility of a witness, the inquiry is limited to his reputation for truth and veracity.\u201d <em>Eastman </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Ry., </em>200 Mass. 412, 413 (1909). <em>F. </em>W. <em>Stock &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Dellapenna, </em>217 Mass. 503, 506 (1914). P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 146-147 (5th ed. 1981). Evidence irrelevant to the issue at trial or to the witness\u2019s reputation for truth and veracity is inadmissible to impeach a witness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Binkiewicz, </em>342 Mass. 740, 755 (1961). See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Mass. 222, 227 (1981) (evidence of engaging in sex for hire irrelevant to issue of credibility). The witness\u2019s past membership in a street gang was clearly a collateral issue irrelevant to his veracity, and thus should not have been admitted. It could only tend to appeal to the jury\u2019s prejudice against street gangs. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, </em>374 Mass. 466, 470 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graziano, </em>368 Mass. 325, 332 (1975). The Commonwealth argues, however, that the defendant\u2019s general objection was insufficient under rule 22 to preserve the issue for review, and that, even if an error was made, it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Unlike the situation involving the hearsay statement discussed earlier, the defendant\u2019s general objection to this line of questioning was interposed at the proper time, and the judge unequivocally overruled it. Since we conclude that \u201cthe ground for exclusion should have been obvious to the judge and opposing counsel without stating it, . . . want of specification of the ground is immaterial for purposes of complaining on appeal of the judge\u2019s action in overruling the general objection.\u201d McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 52, at 115 (2d ed. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Therefore, we decide that the judge erred in admitting this impeachment evidence and that the defendant\u2019s objection was sufficient to preserve the issue under the circumstances of this case. However, the witness\u2019s credibility had already been impeached with several prior convictions, and the evidence he provided was not particularly relevant to the defendant\u2019s guilt. Thus, we agree with the Commonwealth that this error alone was not sufficiently prejudicial to the defendant to require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">3. <em>Comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to call alibi witnesses. </em>The defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly made reference in his closing argument to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, or at least to his failure to call any alibi witnesses. The Commonwealth contends that, taken in context, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks merely responded to the defense counsel\u2019s suggestions that several witnesses were lying.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>also argues that the defendant did not preserve this issue for review under rule 22 because neither a mistrial nor a curative instruction was sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The Commonwealth points out that the defendant did not object to the remarks until after the prosecutor\u2019s argument had concluded. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, 31A </em>Mass. 453, 458 (1978), this court held that an attorney need not \u201cimmediately interrupt the argument of opposing counsel with an objection and a request for a curative instruction on each occasion when he believes that the argument is improper. It is usually sufficient, depending on the circumstances of the particular situation, if the matter is called to the judge\u2019s attention at the end of the attorney\u2019s argument.\u201d In the circumstances of this case, we hold that the defendant\u2019s objection occurring at the end of the prosecutor\u2019s argument was timely. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gouveia, </em>371 Mass. 566, 571 (1976) (better practice forjudge to intervene sua sponte). We also conclude that, while the objection was hardly a model of clarity either in expressing the problem or in suggesting a remedy, it sufficiently apprised the judge of the grounds on which it was based, and was therefore sufficient to preserve the question for review.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Addressing the merits of the question, we do not agree that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks can reasonably be construed as referring to the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify. Any danger that the jury might make such an unlikely inference was firmly dissipated by the judge\u2019s strong instruction on the defendant\u2019s right not to testify.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smallwood, </em>379 Mass. 878, 891-893 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">However, we agree that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks might be construed as an impermissible comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to call any alibi witnesses. Generally, a defendant\u2019s failure to call witnesses to support his explanation of events is a \u201cfair matter for comment, and is not within the protection of the Constitution,\u201d if there is some foundation that witnesses other than the defendant were available for that purpose. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Domanski, </em>332 Mass. 66, 70-71 (1954), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peoples Express Co., </em>201 Mass. 564, 581 (1909). See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCaro, </em>359 Mass. 388, 391-392 (1971); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>342 Mass. 180, 186-188 (1961). As in <em>Domanski, </em>however, \u201c[t]here was nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>during the course of the trial to suggest that [the defendant] had witnesses available who were not brought forward.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Domanski, supra </em>at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Without that foundation, the comments on the lack of an alibi defense were improper. <em>Id. </em>At the same time, the defendant\u2019s response was \u201cless than fully adequate.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hawley, </em>380 Mass. 70, 85-86 (1980). Considering the context of the improper comments, the inadequate defense response, and the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury, we conclude that the error was not in itself sufficiently prejudicial to require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">4. <em>Substantial risk of miscarriage of justice. </em>None of the three errors asserted by the defendant, taken individually, is sufficiently prejudicial to require the reversal of his conviction. Nevertheless, we have \u201cserious doubt as to whether this defendant was [unduly] prejudiced\u201d by the combination of these errors. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>380 Mass. 545, 550 (1980). First, prejudicial hearsay testimony was improperly put before the jury. Second, clearly inadmissible impeachment of a defense witness was allowed. Finally, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, which could be construed as comments on the defendant\u2019s failure to call alibi witnesses, were improper, since there was no indication that such witnesses existed. On the whole, we are left with the clear opinion that these errors have resulted in a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. For that reason, we reverse the judgment, set aside the jury verdict, and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\"> Rule 22 states: \u201cExceptions to rulings or orders of the court are unnecessary and for all purposes for which an exception has heretofore been necessary, it is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order of the court is made or sought, makes known to the court the action which he desires the court to take or his objection to the action of the court ....
