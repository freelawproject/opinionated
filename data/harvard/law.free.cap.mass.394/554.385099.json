App. Ct. 1110 (1984). That order required the Probate Court to determine a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to be awarded to the plaintiff, John Edward Hurley (Hurley), as a prevailing party under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1982). The major thrust of the parties\u2019 arguments concerns whether the plaintiff was a \u201cprevailing party\u201d for the purpose of an attorney\u2019s fee award pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, we are in agreement with the order of the Appeals Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">We summarize the facts and the somewhat confusing procedural history of these actions. On June 14,1977, the Probate Court placed John Edward Hurley under the guardianship of his sister, Kathleen Hurley (guardian). On August 21, 1980, the guardian petitioned that court to modify and limit Hurley\u2019s guardianship because of improvements in his physical and mental condition. The petition sought a declaration that Hurley \u201cis no longer \u2018adjudicated incompetent\u2019 nor a \u2018person under guardianship\u2019 within the meaning of\u2019 art. 3 of Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution or of G. L. c. 51, \u00a7 1. The plaintiff also filed on August 21,1980, a memorandum of law in support of the petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The memorandum cited decisions which concerned whether, in certain circumstances, a mentally retarded person may have a constitutional right to vote. The court scheduled a hearing on this petition for September 25, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>In a letter dated September 9, 1980, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney notified the office of the Attorney General that the constitutionality of art. 3 and of G. L. c. 51, \u00a7 1, might be at issue in the petition filed with the Probate Court. He enclosed the pleadings, the memorandum, and notice of the hearing. An assistant attorney general informed the assistant register of probate, by a letter dated September 23, 1980, that the Attorney General did not intend to participate in the action because \u201c[t]he question as to whether a particular guardianship should be limited and, if so, to what degree . . . should best be treated as a matter between private parties.\u201d The assistant attorney general conveyed the Attorney General\u2019s interest in and desire to be informed of the progress of the litigation as it concerned \u201cwhether the constitutional and statutory voting exclusion of persons under guardianship applies to persons under limited as well as full guardianships.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The Probate Court judge commenced a hearing on September 25, 1980. The hearing was continued to October 3, 1980. On September 25, 1980, Hurley sought to register to vote before the assistant registrar of the election commissioners of Springfield. The assistant registrar did not permit Hurley to register because Hurley could not truthfully sign an affidavit that he was not under guardianship. See G. L. c. 51, \u00a7 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">On September 29, 1980, Hurley, by his guardian, filed in the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County a complaint \u201cseeking declaratory and injunctive relief to redress the deprivation of and interference with constitutional, civil, and federal statutory rights to vote and participate equally in the electoral process of John Edward Hurley.\u201d Hurley sought relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1973 and 1983, and various other State and Federal laws. The complaint contained a prayer for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. On October 3, 1980, a single justice, at the defendants\u2019 suggestion, ordered this complaint (transferred case) transferred to the Probate Court for consideration with the plaintiff\u2019s petition for modification and limitation of the guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">On October 3, 1980, the Probate Court held further hearings on the plaintiff\u2019s petition. The plaintiff filed, on the same day, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>motion to amend the petition to incorporate by reference the action filed in the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On October 6, 1980, the Probate Court entered an interlocutory order concerning the original probate petition. The judge found that \u201cHurley is capable of making informed decisions concerning the exercise of his right to vote,\u201d and ordered that \u201cHurley not be deemed to be under guardianship within the meaning of that term as the same is used\u201d in G. L. c. 51, \u00a7 1, and art. 3 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. Based on this order, Hurley was allowed to register and vote in the 1980 election.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The Probate Court docket does not indicate any action concerning Hurley\u2019s guardianship for over five months after October 6, 1980. On March 16, 1981, the court allowed the plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend the petition. The court also entered a decree or order<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on the original petition and the transferred case. The judge recited several findings concerning Hurley\u2019s progress including a finding that \u201cHurley is in fact capable of making informed decisions concerning the exercise of his right to vote.\u201d The judge ordered that \u201cHurley is not deemed to be under guardianship within the meaning of that term as the same is used in [G. L. c. 51, \u00a7 1, and art. 3]\u201d and limited the guardianship authority over Hurley\u2019s estate. The judge continued the matter for hearings on a proposed guardianship plan to be filed before June 30, 1981. The plaintiff did not appeal this order. The plaintiff contends, however, that he did not receive notice of the March 16, 1981, order. The docket substantiates the plaintiff\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">On April 16, 1982, the plaintiff filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the petition and the transferred case, requesting $8,989.41, which included compensation for the guardian ad litem. The parties filed various other pleadings in opposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>to or in support of the request for attorney\u2019s fees. On April 14, 1983, the plaintiff filed a supplementary motion for attorney\u2019s fees seeking $1,797.50 to compensate for additional time. The motion also requested a \u201ccontingency bonus\u201d thereby raising the fee request to a total of $11,866.70.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The judge entered an order on September 30, 1983, denying the plaintiff\u2019s motions for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The judge referred to the March 16, 1981, document as the court\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact and final judgment.\u201d The judge determined that the plaintiff did secure modification of the guardianship but did not prevail against the defendants. The plaintiff moved for correction and clarification of the court\u2019s September 30, 1983, order. Ruling on that motion, the judge entered a further order on December 8, 1983. That order deleted from the court\u2019s March 16, 1981, decree all references to the transferred case; allowed the Attorney General\u2019s motion to dismiss the transferred case as moot in view of the October 6, 1980, interlocutory order and the March 16, 1981, decree, both of which limited the guardianship and included an order concerning Hurley\u2019s right to vote; and reaffirmed the September 30, 1983, order that the plaintiff was not a prevailing party for purposes of an award of attorney\u2019s fees. The plaintiff appealed and filed a motion seeking additional fees. The plaintiff also seeks compensation for attorney\u2019s fees incurred on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">1. <em>Applicability of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. </em>The defendants argue that the plaintiff did not prevail in his civil rights suit, the transferred case, and that the petition filed in the Probate Court presented neither a substantial Federal constitutional question nor a State claim based on the same substantial Federal question. We disagree. A prevailing party, for the purposes of a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 fee award, achieves success on a substantial question of law arising out of a common nucleus of facts that give rise to a cause of action under any of the statutes listed in \u00a7 1988. <em>Maher v. Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 132 &amp; n.15 (1980). A claim presents a substantial question of law \u201cunless \u2018it is \u201cobviously without merit\u201d or . . . \u201cits unsoundness so clearly results from the previous decisions of [the Supreme Court] as to foreclose the subject and leave no room for the inference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>that the question sought to be raised can be subject to controversy.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. 312, 318 (1982), quoting <em>Hagans </em>v. <em>Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 537 (1974). A complaint need not mention explicitly the underlying statute as long as the elements of a cause of action are pleaded. <em>Rzeznik </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Southampton, </em>374 Mass. 475, 484-485 n.8 (1978). Individuals prevail \u201cfor attorney\u2019s fees purposes if they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit\u201d or \u201cwhen plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit acts as a \u2018catalyst\u2019 in prompting defendants to take action to meet plaintiff\u2019s claims.\u201d <em>Nadeau </em>v. <em>Helgemoe, </em>581 F.2d 275, 278-279 (1st Cir. 1978).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The plaintiff presented the question whether an individual with sufficient competence to warrant a limited guardianship, see <em>Guardianship of Bassett, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 56, 63 (1979), can be precluded from exercising his right to vote without abrogating his constitutional privileges. \u201c[A]ny alleged infringement of the right of citizens to vote must be carefully and meticulously scrutinized. \u201d <em>Kramer </em>v. <em>Union Free School Dist., </em>395 U.S. 621, 626 (1969), quoting <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>377 U.S. 533, 562 (1964). In <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Registrars of Voters of Belchertown, </em>368 Mass. 631, 637 (1975), we implicitly recognized this limitation when we \u201cnarrowly construed\u201d the voter exclusions in art. 3 and G. L. c. 51, \u00a7 1. The defendants argue that our decision in <em>Boyd, </em>in conjunction with <em>Guardianship of Bassett, </em>ensured that the Probate Court would grant the plaintiff\u2019s petition to limit the guardianship and declare his right to vote. Although this result may have been probable, prior decisions did not \u201c \u2018foreclose the subject and leave no room for the inference that the question sought to be raised [could] be the subject of controversy.\u2019\u201d <em>Stratos, supra </em>at 318. We conclude that the plaintiff did present a substantial question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">The facts in these actions concerned whether Hurley was sufficiently competent to warrant a limited guardianship. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>so, any derogation of his right to vote under art. 3 and G. L. c. 51, \u00a7 1, may have deprived him under color of law of secured rights. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Such a claim would not be precluded by Hurley\u2019s ability to obtain relief through limitation of the guardianship and a declaration that he was not subject to art. 3 and G. L. c. 51, \u00a7 1. <em>Stratos, supra </em>at 317. Therefore, the plaintiff presented a substantial question of law that arose from a common nucleus of facts that gave rise to a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">We next determine whether the plaintiff sufficiently alleged the elements of a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>See Rzeznik, supra. </em>The petition to limit the guardianship did not allege the elements of a \u00a7 1983 action. The only indication that the plaintiff raised constitutional issues by the petition appears in the memorandum of law which accompanied the petition. Such a memorandum, however, is not a pleading and would not result in a proper allegation of the elements of a \u00a7 1983 claim. See <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>514 F. Supp. 1004, 1019 (D.S.C. 1981). The plaintiff also filed a complaint which clearly alleged a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. A single justice transferred that complaint to the Probate Court at the defendants\u2019 suggestion. The Probate Court allowed the plaintiff to amend his petition to incorporate this transferred case by reference. Such an amendment, which states an additional cause of action arising from the same underlying facts, is proper. Mass. R. Civ. P. 15 (c), 365 Mass. 761 (1974). See <em>Cimino </em>v. <em>Milford Keg, Inc., </em>385 Mass. 323, 333 (1982). We conclude that the amended petition properly alleged the elements of a claim under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The defendants\u2019 argument that the plaintiff did not prevail on a claim within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 does not persuade us. The petition sought a determination that Hurley was sufficiently competent to warrant the limitation of the guardianship and a declaration of his right to vote. The court could have declared that an individual sufficiently competent to warrant a limited guardianship either was not subject to the voting exclusion in art. 3 and G. L. c. 51, \u00a7 1, or that the exclusion was unconstitutional as applied to such an individual. \u201c[Tjhat the relief achieved by the plaintiff[ ] was granted on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>statutory rather than constitutional grounds is no bar to [a] claim for fees under \u00a7 1988.\u201d <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Town Clerk of Greenfield, </em>384 Mass. 444, 454 (1981) cert. denied sub nom. <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>456 U.S. 947 (1982). See <em>Stock </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Hosp. School, ante </em>437 (1985). The Probate Court dismissed the transferred case as moot. To the extent the court\u2019s action concerned the prayer for declaratory relief, dismissal was proper because no actual controvery existed concerning Hurley\u2019s right to vote. As the Appeals Court noted, the Probate Court improperly dismissed that portion of the transferred case which requested attorney\u2019s fees. See <em>Coalition for Basic Human Needs </em>v. <em>King, </em>691 F.2d 597, 601-602 (1st Cir. 1982) (individual may recover attorney\u2019s fees even if controversy is moot). We conclude that the plaintiff was a \u201cprevailing party\u201d for purposes of an attorney\u2019s fee award pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">2. <em>Calculation of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. </em>In <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. 312, 320-325 (1982), we fully explained the factors to be applied in determining a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee award. We, therefore, limit our discussion to the applicability of certain factors peculiar to this case. The other factors discussed in the <em>Stratos </em>case are also applicable to a fee determination for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The initial petition sought a limitation of Hurley\u2019s guardianship. The Appeals Court\u2019s order noted \u201cthat substantial time was expended by [plaintiff\u2019s counsel] prior to October 6,1980 [the date of the interlocutory order], in determining whether Hurley in fact had made enough physical and mental progress so that limitations could be placed on his guardianship and on the authority of his guardian.\u201d In determining whether these hours are compensable, the Probate Court must consider to what degree this time was related to the \u00a7 1983 claim, \u201cfocus [ing] on the significance of the overall relief obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably expended on the litigation.\u201d <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 435 (1983). The court also must examine the time expended for the preparation of the complaint in the transferred case. Counsel apparently filed that action in an attempt, which may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>been overcautious, to ensure that Hurley could vote in the 1980 election. The court should determine to what extent preparation of the transferred case was a necessary and reasonable litigation expense. This determination should take into account any appraisal that counsel received from the Probate Court which indicated the likelihood of his timely success on the petition. The court should also consider the likelihood of success on the petition based on <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Registrars of Voters of Belchertown, </em>368 Mass. 631 (1975), and <em>Guardianship of Bassett, 1 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 56 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The plaintiff is also entitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee for time spent in establishing a fee and time spent on appeal of the fee. <em>Stratos, supra </em>at 325. The Probate Court must apply the factors expressed in the <em>Stratos </em>case to determine the reasonableness of such a fee. Additionally, the court should take into account the extent to which the plaintiff\u2019s delay in moving to correct docket entries affected the course of this litigation. The court should consider to what degree, if any, such delay was excusable. The plaintiff\u2019s right to a contingency bonus is subsumed in the factors used to determine a reasonable fee. Compare <em>Stratos, supra </em>at 321 with <em>King </em>v. <em>Greenblatt, 560 </em>F.2d 1024, 1026 (1st Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 438 U.S. 916 (1978). <em>See </em>Lamphere v. Brown Univ., 610 F.2d 46, 47(1st Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">For the reasons stated, we remand this action to the Probate Court with instructions to determine a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee in a manner consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b571-6\"> The plaintiff raises various other arguments that we need not consider. We note, however, that the plaintiff\u2019s request for fees pursuant to G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I, is inappropriate. To prevail under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I, an individual must prevail on a claim in which secured rights allegedly were denied by threats, intimidation, or coercion. See <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Corp., </em>393 Mass. 819, 822-823 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b571-7\"> The docket initially indicated that this memorandum was filed on September 25, 1980. After the Appeals Court issued its order, a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court allowed the plaintiffs motion to correct the docket entries thereby reflecting the filing of the memorandum on August 21, 1980. The plaintiff\u2019s delay in correcting this entry possibly added to the confusion in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\"> The docket entries indicated that the plaintiff did not file this motion until March 16, 1981. The plaintiff did not request that this error be corrected until after the issuance of the Appeals Court order. The various errors in the docket sheet and the delay in seeking correction may have affected the attorney\u2019s fee award in this action. The plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend was allowed on March 16, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\"> The March 16, 1981, document did not contain a label indicating the nature of the decree or order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b575-13\"><em> \u201cNadeau\u2019s </em>two tests are separate and distinct; satisfying either of them is sufficient to qualify a party as \u2018prevailing.\u2019\u201d <em>Coalition for Basic Human Needs </em>v. <em>King, </em>691 F.2d 597, 599 (1st Cir. 1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
