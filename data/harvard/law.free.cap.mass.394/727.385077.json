One civilian, Vincent J. Bordonaro, died of injuries he received during that incident. At a trial of several police officers for murder in the first degree, a jury found John W. McLeod and Richard P. Aiello guilty of murder in the second degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>and John T. Macauda guilty of manslaughter. The defendants were also found guilty on several other indictments, including assault and battery, assault and battery by means of dangerous weapons, and civil rights violations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They now challenge their convictions on several grounds. We transferred their appeals to this court on our own motion, and we affirm the judgments of conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The defendants join in arguing three reasons their convictions should be reversed. First, they argue that the judge abused his discretion by failing to conduct an inquiry into the possibility of prejudice during the grand jury proceedings, engendered by extensive preindictment publicity. Second, they contend that the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury on causation was incorrect. Third, they maintain that the judge should have ordered a mistrial because of alleged improprieties in the Commonwealth\u2019s closing argument. McLeod and Aiello also contend that the judge\u2019s manslaughter instruction impermissibly shifted to the defendants the burden of proving mitigating circumstances. Macauda individually poses three additional chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>lenges. First, he claims that the judge should have allowed him to conduct a voir dire examination of witnesses who changed portions of their testimony at trial or should have allowed his motion for a mistrial on this ground. Second, he contends that the judge should have given a requested instruction on intervening, independent cause. Finally, he argues that there was insufficient evidence proving that his actions were a proximate cause of Bordonaro\u2019s death, and that therefore his motion for a required finding of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case should have been granted. We reject each of these arguments and affirm the judgments of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">There was evidence from which the jury could have found the following facts. At approximately 11:30 p.m. on July 22, 1982, McLeod, an off-duty Everett police officer, arrived at the Village Pub, a Chelsea bar, where he consumed four alcoholic drinks. When the Village Pub closed, McLeod and others went to the \u201cmen\u2019s bar,\u201d a room on the first floor of King Arthur\u2019s Motel in Chelsea where alcohol was served after legal closing hours. McLeod arrived at King Arthur\u2019s at approximately 1:45 a.m., and consumed two or three more drinks. Between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m., a fight erupted between McLeod and several other patrons at the bar, including Alfred Mattuchio, Charles Celia, Charles Dimino, and Anthony Dimino. McLeod was badly beaten and thrown out of the bar, but he was able to reach a guard booth outside a nearby building, where he instructed the guard to telephone the Everett police.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Officers Aiello and Macauda responded to the call, picked up McLeod, and Aiello radioed the Chelsea and Everett police for assistance. They then drove the short distance to King Arthur\u2019s, where they were subsequently joined by about ten other Everett and Chelsea police officers. Seeing Mattuchio in the front doorway, the officers approached and announced that he was under arrest, but Mattuchio retreated inside the building and locked the door. The manager of King Arthur\u2019s, Anthony Dimino, then directed the persons still in the bar to go to room 209 on the second floor of the motel. Earlier, Helen Bozzi had helped Bordonaro, who was drunk, to room 209. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>The occupants of the room locked the door and barricaded it with furniture. After initially entering the building by a fire escape, the police informed the room\u2019s occupants that they were under arrest, and ordered them to open the door. The police also directed a variety of threats to those inside the room. When the door was not opened, the police began breaking it down.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">After ten to twenty minutes, the police managed to break down the door, using nightsticks, a tire iron, and an axe.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Several officers, including Aiello and Macauda then made the \u201cfirst entry\u201d into the room, and a general melee ensued. During the first entry, Aiello and Macauda each struck several persons with heavy, blunt instruments (e.g., nightsticks, tire irons, baseball bats, axe handles, nunchaku).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Helen Bozzi testified that Macauda struck Bordonaro, who was lying on the bed, with a tire iron. Charles Celia saw Macauda hit Bordonaro with nunchaku or a black, hooked instrument. Charles Tardivo testified that Aiello hit Bordonaro at least twice and that Macauda delivered \u201cthree solid whacks on the head\u201d to Bordonaro with a nightstick.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>At some point, the police left the room and Macauda returned to his cruiser. Bordonaro was by this time unconscious. Aiello was seen carrying a baseball bat while walking down the hall to McLeod, who had not participated in the first entry.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>After McLeod and Aiello walked back to the room, McLeod took the bat from Aiello.\u00ae During this \u201csecond entry,\u201d McLeod struck both Bordonaro and Mattuchio.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> With each of the several hits, witnesses reported that McLeod yelled, \u201cMy name is John McLeod and don\u2019t you forget it.\u201d Bordonaro was hit several times and he rolled off the bed onto the floor. Shortly after the incident, he regained consciousness for a brief time, but he later became unconscious and died at a hospital on July 30, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">1. <em>Grand jury prejudice. </em>The defendants argue that the judge should have conducted an inquiry to determine whether the grand jury were prejudiced by preindictment publicity. The defendants claim that they made a prima facie showing of prejudice, and urge us to modify the rule that bias or prejudice is no basis for challenging indictments returned by a grand jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monahan, </em>349 Mass. 139, 156 (1965). They contend that the judge should have inquired further or dismissed the indictments. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">First we reject the defendants\u2019 arguments that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution require that indictments be returned only by an unprejudiced grand jury. It is true that such a requirement has been imposed in Federal grand jury proceedings. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hyder, </em>732 F.2d 841, 842 (11th Cir. 1984); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>700 F.2d 70, 82 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 816 (1983). Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has refused to \u201cremotely intimate any view\u201d on whether this requirement is applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>to State grand jury proceedings <em>(Beck </em>v. <em>Washington, 369 </em>U.S. 541, 546 [1962]), and this court has not applied it to our own grand juries. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monahan, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Moreover, we see no reason to create such a rule in this Commonwealth. This court has long recognized that \u201c[t]he grand jury is an investigatory and accusatory body only. It cannot and does not determine guilt.\u201d <em>Brunson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 369 </em>Mass. 106, 120 (1975). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>157 Mass. 516, 517 (1893). Because of the historical and practical nature of the grand jury, and the availability of an unprejudiced petit jury at trial, the safeguards deemed necessary to protect an accused before a petit jury are not implicated to the same degree in grand jury proceedings. Thus, this court has held that, unlike petit jurors, grand jurors may act on their own personal knowledge and need not be free from all bias or prejudice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monahan, supra </em>at 155-156. <em>Commonwealth v. Woodward, supra </em>at 518-519. See <em>Commonwealth v. Lewis, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 562, 564 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In addition, however, the grand jury perform the important task of determining whether there is probable cause to indict an accused. <em>Commonwealth v. O\u2019Dell, </em>392 Mass. 445, 450 (1984). In this way, the grand jury act as a shield against unfounded criminal prosecutions. See <em>Commonwealth v. McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160, 163 (1982); <em>Lataille v. District Court of E. Hampden, 366 </em>Mass. 525, 532 (1974); <em>Branzburg </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665, 668 (1972), aff\u2019g <em>Matter of Pappas, </em>358 Mass. 604, 613-614 (1971). This court has already held that where the integrity of the grand jury process is seriously impaired, dismissal of an indictment may be appropriate. See <em>Commonwealth v. O\u2019Dell, 392 </em>Mass. 445, 447 (1984) (\u201cunfair and misleading presentation\u201d of evidence): <em>Commonwealth v. Salman, </em>387 Mass. 160, 166 (1982) (use of \u201cknowingly false testimony\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth v. St. Pierre, </em>377 Mass. 650, 656 (1979) (excessive reliance on hearsay). It is clear that a grand jury must act in a matter consistent with their oath.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Geagan, </em>339 Mass. 487, 497-498, cert. denied, 361 U.S. 895 (1959), and cases cited. It is equally true that further inquiry may be warranted where a defendant makes a prima facie showing of bias or prejudice so egregious as to result in an indictment based on \u201chatred or malice,\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The defendants have failed to make such a showing here. Although they rely on three elements to do so, none of these factors, taken individually or in combination, meets their burden. First, the defendants introduced copies of newspaper articles as well as recordings of television and radio programs to show pervasive media coverage of the incident. But as we have stated, the fact that grand jurors may have some familiarity with an alleged crime, bring this information into the grand jury room, and act on it, is not sufficient to require either further inquiry into alleged prejudice or the automatic dismissal of an indictment. Simply stated, the exhibits of media coverage do nothing to establish animosity on the part of the grand jury toward the defendants. Second, the judge\u2019s findings in his decision to allow a change of venue for trial before a petit jury because of pretrial publicity are irrelevant to the grand jury for the same reason.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Third, the defendants contend that certain actions by individual members of the grand jury illustrate their hostility, at least toward Macauda. The judge found that one grand juror said to Macauda, \u201c[Y]ou think we are idiots, we don\u2019t understand.\u201d The judge was fully warranted in concluding that this grand juror\u2019s attitude \u201ccould well have been the result of listening to 9 days of testimony and 28 prior witnesses,\u201d many of whom gave substantially different versions of events. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>defendants also allege that, during Macauda\u2019s testimony, one grand juror characterized the incident as a \u201cmassacre.\u201d Since a prior witness had already used the term, we agree that such a statement would not be persuasive evidence of malice held as the result of extensive, adverse publicity. Finally, we reject the defendants\u2019 challenge to the judge\u2019s finding that because not all of the officers indicted were indicted for the same offenses, it was apparent \u201cthat the grand jurors carefully deliberated and acted on the basis of the evidence presented, rather than as a result of bias induced by publicity.\u201d The defendants\u2019 contention that prejudice is shown because only Everett police officers were indicted for Bordonaro\u2019s death is without merit. Each defendant was indicted for a series of different crimes committed against a different array of victims, and each indictment was supported by a rational view of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">2. <em>Proximate cause instruction. </em>The defendants argue that the judge\u2019s proximate cause instruction failed to apprise the jury properly of that concept, and instead confused proximate cause with actual cause. Since none of the defendants objected to this instruction, we need only consider whether it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheline, </em>391 Mass. 279, 291-292 (1984). Since we conclude that the instruction was correct, there is no risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Actual cause encompasses \u201c[a]ll antecedents which contribute to a given result,\u201d no matter how tenuous the connection. Perkins, Criminal Law 687 (2d ed. 1969). \u201cProximate cause\u201d defines a point beyond which the law will not recognize a contributing factor as a cause giving rise to liability. \u201cThe term \u2018proximate\u2019 is used in contrast to the term \u2018remote.\u2019\u201d J. R. Nolan, Criminal Law \u00a7 122, at 51 (1976). Thus, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rhoades, </em>379 Mass. 810, 824-825 (1980), this court found fault with an instruction that left \u201cthe jury with the impression that if [a defendant\u2019s] act. . . in any way constituted a link, no matter how remote, in the chain of events leading to . . . death, [a defendant] should be convicted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">In <em>Rhoades, </em>however, the court approved an instruction that defined proximate cause as \u201ca cause, which, in the natural and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>continuous sequence, produces the death, and without which the death would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 825, quoting California Jury Instructions, Criminal \u00a7 8.55 (4th rev. ed. 1979). In this case, the judge used those very words to instruct the jury. The defendants have not suggested a more appropriate instruction, and we see no reason to change the view expressed in <em>Rhoades </em>that the instruction as given adequately expresses the notion of proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">3. <em>Closing argument. </em>The defendants contend that the judge should have granted a mistrial based on two statements allegedly made without evidentiary basis during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>387 Mass. 900, 910 (1983) (\u201cpure speculation [and] . . . contrary to the evidence\u201d). We hold that the prosecutor\u2019s comments constituted fair argument. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howell, ante </em>654, 661-662 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The defendants object to the prosecutor\u2019s statements which suggested that the defendants in the first entry struck Bordonaro because they mistakenly believed that he was Mattuchio.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The jury could have drawn such an inference. There was evidence that McLeod had told other officers that Mattuchio had been one of his assailants, that the police knew Mattuchio to be in room 209, that when the first entry was made he was initially hidden in the bathroom, that the assault on Bordonaro in the first entry was made before Mattuchio was discovered, and that Bordonaro had a general physical appearance similar to Mattuchio\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The defendants also challenge the prosecutor\u2019s suggestions that the jury could infer from the failure to arrest Anthony Dimino <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>that the police had no legitimate purpose in mind when they entered room 209.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> They contend that, at the time, there was no evidence that McLeod had identified any of his assailants other than Mattuchio. But McLeod himself testified that he said to Anthony Dimino, \u201cWhat the f_did you do this to me for?\u201d McLeod thus admitted that in the presence of Aiello and Macauda he accused Anthony Dimino of being one of his assailants. The jury could have believed that Dimino was in the hallway outside room 209 before that room had been entered, that he was identified by McLeod as one of his assailants, and that he was beaten by McLeod and other officers, but was not arrested. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>Thus, it could be inferred that the officers were there to punish McLeod\u2019s assailants rather than to make lawful arrests. \u201c[Cjounsel may argue as to the evidence and the fair inferences from the evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Earltop, </em>372 Mass. 199, 205 (1977) (Hennessey, C.J., concurring). The prosecutor did no more here.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">4. <em>Manslaughter instruction. </em>McLeod and Aiello argue that the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury on manslaughter improperly shifted to the defendants the burden of proving adequate provocation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Since the defendants failed to object to the instruction at trial, we consider only whether it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pickles, </em>393 Mass. 775, 776 (1985). We conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>instructions, taken as a whole (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>391 Mass. 853, 857-859 [1984]), adequately set forth the law. Therefore, there is no risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Manslaughter has been defined as a killing committed in \u201ca sudden transport of passion or heat of blood, upon a reasonable provocation and without malice, or upon sudden combat.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>356 Mass. 442, 445 (1969), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soaris, </em>275 Mass. 291, 299 (1931). In order to prove murder, it is the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with malice, and that he acted without reasonable provocation, or in the absence of sudden heat of blood or passion, or that there is no causal connection between the provocation, the passion, and the acts committed by the defendant. Otherwise, the crime is manslaughter. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>374 Mass. 583, 592 (1978) . See Perkins, Criminal Law 54 (2d ed. 1969). An instruction on manslaughter is warranted if there is some evidence, considered in the light most favorable to a defendant <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>379 Mass. 446, 450 [1980]), supporting a theory that the elements of manslaughter were present. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walden, </em>380 Mass. 724, 726 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>379 Mass. 177, 180 (1979) . The evidence must be sufficient to create a reasonable doubt in the minds of a rational jury that a defendant\u2019s actions were both objectively and subjectively reasonable. That is, the jury must be able to infer that a reasonable person would have become sufficiently provoked and would not have \u201ccooled off\u201d by the time of the homicide, and that in fact a defendant was provoked and did not cool off. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walden, supra </em>at 728; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rooney, </em>365 Mass. 484, 494-495 (1974), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">The Commonwealth argues that \u201csufficient time had elapsed between the provocation and the killing for passions to have cooled [so that] the crime was murder and not manslaughter.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, supra </em>at 592 n.6. The facts of this case do show a significantly longer cooling off period than is usually the situation in manslaughter cases. Here, McLeod had at least fifteen minutes, and more likely one-half hour between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>the time he was beaten and the time he struck Bordonaro. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>384 Mass. 396, 398 (1981) (manslaughter instruction warranted where victim shot by defendant during a fight), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>366 Mass. 705, 707-708 (1975) (manslaughter instruction not warranted where defendant, after being punched, left the room and shot victim several minutes later). Nevertheless, it also appears that the provocation in this case was substantially greater than in many other cases. McLeod was described as having been severely beaten and he lost consciousness at least once. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bertrand, </em>385 Mass. 356, 358, 363 (1982) (victim raised his hand to strike defendant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>376 Mass. 539, 542-543 (1978) (defendant\u2019s affections rejected by female friend). We assume, without deciding, that a manslaughter instruction was required on these facts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">The defendants take issue with the judge\u2019s failure to restate the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt during his discussion of provocation and heat of passion. \u201cAlthough the judge would have followed the better practice if he had restated the Commonwealth\u2019s burden, \u2018the law does not require repetition of the same thought at each turn. \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>391 Mass. 443, 452 (1984), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>372 Mass. 319, 324 (1977). In this case, the judge repeatedly instructed the jury that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt every essential element of the crimes charged, and he did so immediately following his manslaughter instruction. As we have recently reiterated, \u201c[a] jury charge will be upheld if it \u2018clearly placed the burden of proving malice beyond a reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>able doubt on the Commonwealth and contained other discussion which, although not referring to the burden of proof as to . . . reasonable provocation, adequately defined [that factor] and established [it] as negating a finding of malice.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nieves, ante </em>355, 360 (1985), quoting Common<em>wealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, supra </em>at 591. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, supra </em>at 452-453. The instruction was therefore constitutionally sufficient and no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice is presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">5. <em>Voir dire of witnesses. </em>During the trial, several of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses altered one or more elements of their version of events from earlier interviews and grand jury testimony. After learning of these changes, Macauda requested a mistrial or an opportunity to conduct a voir dire of the witnesses about the circumstances leading to the changes. Both requests were denied. Macauda argues that he was entitled to conduct a voir dire, and further contends that prosecutorial misconduct occurred because the Commonwealth failed to inform him of exculpatory information and because the Commonwealth presented false testimony. We conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>359 Mass. 500, 507 [(1971)], in refusing to allow a voir dire or in denying the motion for a mistrial. Furthermore, the record discloses no prejudicial misconduct by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Helen Bozzi\u2019s only change of testimony involved whether, after the incident was over, she or Macauda was the first to call the other an obscene name. We do not believe this change is particularly relevant to the crimes of which Macauda has been convicted, and in any event, Bozzi was extensively cross-examined about this change.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">At trial, Anthony Dimino indicated for the first time that Aiello and Macauda were the previously unidentified officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>whom he had earlier accused of assaulting Arthur Guttadauro in the hallway. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>Cross-examined at length, Dimino acknowledged that he testified before the grand jury that he did not get a good look at the two officers.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s refusal to grant a voir dire does not require a new trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. 55, 68, 71 (1984) (defendant\u2019s cross-examination as to prior inconsistent statements may significantly reduce witness\u2019s credibility to jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Charles Celia had previously described the weapon used by Macauda against Bordonaro as nunchaku. On direct examination, Celia testified both that Macauda was using nunchaku and that he hit Bordonaro with \u201ca black instrument that had like a hook on the end.\u201d On cross-examination, Macauda elicited from Celia the asserted reasons for the change: \u201cThey [nunchaku] bend \u2014 if you slow them down they look like they bend.\u201d Celia admitted that he had read a newspaper account of the trial in which another witness was reported to have said that Bordonaro had been struck with a long, black instrument with a hook on its end. Celia denied, however, that his description was colored by the reported testimony of that or any other previous witness. Macauda thus was able to establish when and how Celia had changed his testimony, the reasons for the alleged change, and other possible reasons Celia might have used a different description. These were the very elements for which Macauda contends a voir dire was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Charles Tardivo materially changed his testimony at trial. For the first time, he identified Macauda as the officer who gave Bordonaro \u201cthree solid whacks on the head\u201d with a nightstick. Macauda argues that a voir dire was necessary to determine the reasons for this change and when the Commonwealth learned of it. But in fact, both of these areas were explored at trial. At a lobby conference, the prosecutor specifically described the events leading to his knowledge that Tardivo would alter his past testimony.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Macauda has advanced no reason to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>question this explanation. On cross-examination, Tardivo denied discussing the case with other witnesses, but admitted to following the trial in the newspapers and on television. Tardivo admitted that he had previously failed to identify Macauda. He indicated that he could now identify Macauda because he recognized Macauda\u2019s photograph in a newspaper and could thereby associate a name with the person he saw attacking Bordonaro. Tardivo was extensively cross-examined about his many prior statements which were markedly inconsistent with his identification of Macauda.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It is not apparent what additional information of value could have been gained through a voir dire examination. This is not a case where the defendant alleges that an in-court identification is the product of an impermissibly suggestive out-of-court identification. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218 (1967). The lack of a prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>identification by Tardivo was \u201cone factor which may properly be considered by the jury in evaluating the witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lacy, </em>371 Mass. 363, 369 (1976). Macauda \u201cwas given every opportunity to explore [the inconsistencies] in cross-examination.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, supra. </em>Moreover, Macauda did not seek a continuance to assess the new evidence, although the judge offered to allow whatever time was necessary. There is nothing to suggest that the judge was required to deal with Tardivo\u2019s changed testimony in another way. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redding, </em>382 Mass. 154, 156 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Macauda also argues that with regard to the changes in the testimony of Bozzi, Dimino, and Celia, the Commonwealth repeatedly violated the rule of <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83 (1963), by failing to provide prior notice of changes in testimony that were exculpatory. But there is no evidence that the Commonwealth had any prior knowledge of Bozzi\u2019s or Dimino\u2019s changes. Indeed, the Commonwealth specifically denied such knowledge. The <em>Brady </em>rule, therefore, does not apply to the testimony of those two witnesses. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97 (1976). As far as Celia\u2019s testimony is concerned, even if we were to accept Macauda\u2019s characterization of the changes as exculpatory (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellison, </em>376 Mass. 1, 20-22 &amp; n.9 [1978]), Macauda suffered no prejudice. \u201c[T]he cross-examination . . . was not only extended but searching, and we do not think it would have been materially improved by earlier warning about the witness\u2019 departure from [prior statements].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>377 Mass. 887, 895 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Macauda further contends that, by calling Celia and Tardivo as witnesses, the Commonwealth improperly presented evidence that it knew or should have known was false. See <em>Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264 (1959). However, the record reveals no evidence supporting this assertion and Macauda offers none. Simply because a witness alters some portion of his testimony at the time of trial is not a sufficient reason to conclude that the new testimony is false, or that the Commonwealth knew or had reason to know that it was false. \u201cPresentation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>witness who recants or contradicts his prior testimony is not to be confused with eliciting perjury. It was for the jury to decide whether or not to credit the witness.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Holladay, </em>566 F.2d 1018, 1019 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 831 (1978). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lacy, </em>371 Mass. 363, 369 (1976) (lack of prior identification).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">6. <em>Independent, intervening cause. </em>Macauda contends that the judge erred by refusing to give Macauda\u2019s proposed instruction to the jury on independent, intervening cause.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Considering the ambiguous and potentially misleading language of the proposed instruction, we conclude that the judge was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Macauda\u2019s proposed instruction could be read to imply an incorrect statement of law. One interpretation of a part of the first sentence could be that if the jury found that Macauda\u2019s actions in the first entry were not the sole cause of Bordonaro\u2019s death, Macauda could not be found guilty of homicide unless the jury also found that he was responsible for the conduct of those involved in the second entry. Similarly, the second sentence clearly comprehends that if the jury found that Macauda\u2019s acts were not themselves wholly sufficient to cause Bordonaro\u2019s death, Macauda must be acquitted of any degree of homicide. These implications are contrary to the long-standing rule in this Commonwealth: \u201cIf a person inflicts a wound with a deadly weapon in such manner as to put life in jeopardy, and death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>follows as a consequence of this felonious and wicked act, it does not alter its nature or diminish its criminality to prove that other causes cooperated in producing the fatal result.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hackett, 2 </em>Allen 136, 142 (1861). Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rhoades, </em>379 Mass. 810, 823 n.12, 825 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giacomazza, </em>311 Mass. 456, 463 (1942). See <em>People </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>36 Cal. 3d 210, 220 (1984) (defendant\u2019s acts must be a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d contributing to death); <em>People </em>v. <em>Kibbe, </em>35 N.Y.2d 407, 413 (1974) (\u201csufficiently direct\u201d cause). Thus, Macauda\u2019s liability as a contributing cause of Bordonaro\u2019s death need not be related to any theory of joint liability, nor need Macauda\u2019s acts have been the sole cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">While the judge was required to instruct the jury on any issues which could be inferred from the evidence (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pinnick, </em>354 Mass. 13, 15 [1968]), he was not required to give an instruction that misstated the law. <em>Commonwealthv. Monahan, </em>349 Mass. 139, 170-171 (1965). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>254 Mass. 520, 530 (1926). We hold that the judge\u2019s instructions adequately covered the issues concerning independent, intervening cause. If Macauda preferred a different or more detailed instruction on this issue, he was required to state the law properly in his proposed instruction. Even had Macauda done so, it is not clear that the facts would have warranted giving the instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Golston, 313 </em>Mass. 249, 256 (1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1039 (1978) (to supersede defendant\u2019s liability, intervening cause must be the sole cause, not merely a contributing cause) ,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">7. <em>Motion for a required finding of not guilty. </em>At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the judge denied Macauda\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>motion for a required finding of not guilty on the indictment charging him with murder.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 (a), 378 Mass. 896 (1979). Macauda contends that his motion should have been allowed. He argues that the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s medical expert was insufficient to show that Macauda\u2019s acts were the proximate cause of Bordonaro\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">We review this argument, based on the evidence at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, construed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>384 Mass. 647, 651-652 (1981). Macauda\u2019s motion was properly denied \u201cif all the circumstances including inferences [that are not too remote according to the usual course of events] are of sufficient force to bring minds of ordinary intelligence and sagacity to the persuasion of [guilt] beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>388 Mass. 246, 251-252 (1983), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676 (1979). Each element of the offense must meet that test. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, supra </em>at 677-678. Thus, considering in the best light only the evidence introduced by the Commonwealth, coupled with any reasonable inferences which may be drawn from that evidence, we must determine whether a jury would have been warranted in concluding that Macauda\u2019s acts were a proximate cause of Bordonaro\u2019s death. We decide that, although the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness alone was insufficient to support Macauda\u2019s conviction, there was sufficient additional evidence which, combined with the expert witness\u2019s testimony, supports such a conviction. Therefore, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness testified that Bordenara died from acute subdural hematoma and cerebral contusions caused by \u201cone <em>or </em>multiple blunt force injuries to the head\u201d (emphasis added). He was unable to determine which injuries caused death, nor was he able to determine whether a single injury caused death, or whether death was the cumulative result of all of the injuries. He simply stated, \u201cIt could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>been from one injury or from multiple injuries.\u201d From this testimony, it is impossible to say whether Macauda\u2019s blows contributed to Bordonaro\u2019s death or whether some especially severe blow occurred during the second entry that cut off the effects of all previous blows and was itself the sole cause of death. Standing alone, this testimony of the expert witness would be insufficient to forge the causal link between Macauda\u2019s acts and Bordonaro\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Of course, it would also be possible to conclude that the cumulative effect of all the blows was required for death. In that case, there clearly would be a sufficient causal connection between Macauda\u2019s actions and Bordonaro\u2019s death. But when the evidence tends equally to sustain either of two inconsistent propositions, neither of them can be said to have been established by legitimate proof. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Croft, </em>345 Mass. 143, 145 (1962). <em>Smith </em>v. <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>99 Mass. 605, 612 (1868). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>339 Mass. 521, 528-529 (1959); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>324 Mass. 710, 713 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Nevertheless, the Commonwealth need not rely solely on that inconclusive expert testimony. The Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness also testified that there had been four or five blows to the head <em>each </em>of which required the application of \u201csevere\u201d force. There was also testimony that Macauda struck Bordonaro once with a tire iron (Bozzi); once with a black, hooked instrument or nunchaku (Celia); \u201cthree solid whacks on the head\u201d with a nightstick (Tardivo); as well as testimony that Macauda hit someone on the bed (where Bordonaro was lying or sitting) an unspecified number of times with an unspecified object (Charles Dimino). Furthermore, there was evidence that after the first entry, in which Macauda participated, Bordonaro became unconscious and did not regain consciousness until after the second entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">As we have already noted, Macauda could be convicted of a degree of murder or of manslaughter if the jury found that his acts contributed to Bordonaro\u2019s death, even if his actions alone would not have been sufficient to cause the death. Given the testimony on the number and force of the blows required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>to kill Bordonaro, the eyewitness testimony that Macauda struck the victim, the types of weapons Macauda was alleged to have used, and the state of the victim after the attack in which Macauda participated,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that Macauda\u2019s acts were a proximate cause of B ordenara\u2019s death. A jury would have been warranted in finding that either Macauda\u2019s blows alone or all the defendants\u2019 blows together caused Bordonaro\u2019s death, despite the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>357 Mass. 168, 178 (1970) (\u201cThe law should not, and does not, give the opinions of experts on either side of the issue the benefit of conclusiveness, even if there are no contrary opinions introduced at trial\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lunde, </em>390 Mass. 42, 47 (1983), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">This is not a case where the defendant\u2019s guilt \u201cis left to conjecture or surmise and has no solid foundation in established facts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montecalvo, </em>367 Mass. 46, 55 (1975), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>305 Mass. 393, 401 (1940). Nor is the issue left \u201ctrembling in the balance.\u201d <em>DeFilippo\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 531, 535 (1933). Instead, this is a situation where a verdict of manslaughter \u201cwas warranted from these facts in conjunction with a common sense understanding of the entire situation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aguiar, </em>370 Mass. 490, 500 (1976). See 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 568, at 779 (Chadbourn rev. 1979). In these circumstances, conclusive expert testimony was not required in order to permit an inference that a blow to the head with a tire iron is a sufficiently contributing proximate cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">In conclusion, we reject each of the arguments advanced by the defendants to set aside their convictions.
