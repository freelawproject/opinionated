Brown was convicted on an indictment charging him with \u201cburglary while being armed and making an assault in a dwelling.\u201d The judge sentenced Brown to imprisonment for a term of not more than ninety, nor less than sixty, years at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole. Brown challenges the judge\u2019s refusal to allow at trial certain lines of questioning designed to demonstrate the \u201cbias or prejudice\u201d of David Dorr, the key witness. Brown also contends that, in sentencing Brown, the judge abused his discretion and violated Brown\u2019s constitutional rights. We transferred the appeal here on our own motion. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>David Dorr was the key prosecution witness at Brown\u2019s trial. Dorr testified that on May 20, 1983, he and Brown broke into the home of Antoinette W. Culler, and that Brown hit Culler with a chair. In response to questions from the prosecutor, Dorr testified that the police arrested him for the crime at Culler\u2019s home about a week after it had occurred, and that at the time of his arrest he told Detective Sousa the story that he had just told the jury. Dorr also testified that he had pleaded guilty to the crime, and that, in return for Dorr\u2019s agreement to testify at Brown\u2019s trial, the prosecutor had agreed to recommend that Dorr be sentenced to a ten-year term at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Concord.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In his cross-examination of Dorr, defense counsel attempted to establish that Detective Sousa had planted Brown\u2019s name in Dorr\u2019s mind, but Dorr rejected defense counsel\u2019s suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Detective Sousa testified later in the trial. In his cross-examination of Sousa, in an effort to establish Dorr\u2019s anger toward Brown, making him a biased witness, defense counsel tried to establish that, before Dorr told Detective Sousa of Brown\u2019s involvement in the Culler crime, another police officer \u2014 Detective Rivers \u2014 had told Dorr that Brown had implicated Dorr in another crime \u2014 the breaking and entering of a pizza parlor. Detective Sousa denied having any knowledge of that.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Later in his cross-examination of Detective Sousa, defense counsel returned to that subject. After the judge sustained two objections by the prosecutor, counsel approached the bench. Defense counsel made an offer of proof that Dorr \u201cwas taken into the station on another matter. It was the breaking and entering into a pizza place. And he was told by I think Detective Rivers, he didn\u2019t know until now, \u2018that Kurt Brown had ratted him out\u2019 .... Immediately thereafter, Detective Sousa confronted him.\u201d The judge concluded that the matter \u201cshould have been brought out through Mr. Dorr, if at all\u201d and asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>the prosecutor whether Dorr was still available. He was. Defense counsel objected to the judge\u2019s ruling, but he did not ask to question Dorr further. Nor did defense counsel subpoena Detective Rivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Brown testified later in the trial. On direct examination, he testified that before Memorial Day of 1983 he had a conversation concerning Dorr with the owner of a pizza parlor located near Brown\u2019s home. Defense counsel asked Brown to relate that conversation to the jury. The prosecutor objected. Counsel approached the bench, and defense counsel made the following offer of proof: \u201cThere are two things here. He was asked by this fellow if he could find out who broke into New England Pizza II. He found out and told him that it was David Dorr. . . . David Dorr then confronted him sometime before Memorial Day. It is offered to show bias and prejudice of [Dorr], And after that time they never spoke again....\u201d The judge sustained the objection. \u201cThere may be another way,\u201d said the judge, \u201cbut that\u2019s not the one.\u201d Brown did not testify about the substance of his conversaton with the pizza parlor owner, and defense counsel did not bring it out in any other way. Brown did testify, however, that, after talking with the owner of the pizza parlor, he and Dorr had a confrontation and, as a result of that confrontation, never spoke to each other again.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Brown argues that he had the right to introduce evidence from which the jury could have inferred Dorr\u2019s bias. More specifically, Brown asserts in his brief that he had the right to introduce that evidence \u201cby any competent means, either on cross-examination or by the introduction of extrinsic evidence,\u201d even if the introduction of that evidence would reveal an otherwise inadmissible fact. Therefore, Brown concludes, the trial judge committed reversible error by excluding evidence offered by Brown concerning: \u201c(1) [Brown\u2019s] conversation with a local pizza store owner relating to \u2018finding out\u2019 who had committed the robbery of the store; (2) [Brown\u2019s] statements telling the store owner David Dorr had been involved; and (3) evidence relating to the fact David Dorr knew at the time he implicated [Brown] in the instant action that Kurt Brown had \u2018ratted on him\u2019 \u201d We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>agree with Brown\u2019s statement of the law, but we disagree with his conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u201cA defendant has the <em>right </em>to bring to the jury\u2019s attention any \u2018circumstance which may materially affect\u2019 the testimony of an adverse witness which might lead the jury to find that the witness is under an \u2018influence to prevar\u00edcate\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, </em>377 Mass. 755, 760 (1979), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marcellino, </em>271 Mass. 325, 327 (1930). That right remains intact even if the evidence offered reveals an otherwise inadmissible fact, such as the witness\u2019s commission of a crime. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>384 Mass. 377, 380-381 (1981). <em>Commonwealth v. Joyce, </em>382 Mass. 222, 229 (1981). <em>Commonwealth v. Redmond, </em>357 Mass. 333, 338 (1970). Furthermore, a defendant may introduce that evidence through, as Brown well puts it, \u201cany <em>competent </em>means\u201d (emphasis added), including \u201creasonable\u201d cross-examination of the witness, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v. Dougan, </em>377 Mass. 303, 310 (1979), or extrinsic evidence, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gabbidon, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 525, 530-532 (1984) (conversation between witness and defendant\u2019s uncle introduced through the uncle).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">On this appeal, Brown complains of no exclusion of <em>competent </em>evidence that would have allowed the jury to infer Dorr\u2019s bias against Brown. Brown argues that the judge erred by refusing to allow him to cross-examine Detective Sousa about an alleged conversation between Dorr and Detective Rivers. But Detective Sousa testified that he had no knowledge of such a conversation. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>A witness cannot testify about a matter about which he knows nothing. Furthermore, the judge did not \u201cexclude[ ] the total inquiry\u201d into the conversation between Dorr and Detective Rivers. <em>Commonwealth v. Ahearn, </em>370 Mass. 283, 287 (1976). Instead, the judge suggested that defense counsel could try to bring out the conversation through Dorr. That defense counsel did not act on the judge\u2019s suggestion nor subpoena Detective Rivers, another competent source of information about the conversation, does not make the judge\u2019s ruling erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Nor did the judge err when he refused to allow Brown to relate to the jury the substance of his conversation with the owner of the pizza parlor. The jury could have inferred bias from evidence of Dorr\u2019s knowledge of that conversation, if such evidence had been introduced, but they could not have drawn such an inference simply from a conversation at which Dorr was not shown to be present. Again, the judge did not exclude the total inquiry. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ahearn, supra. </em>He merely refused to allow Brown to place before the jury evidence that was irrelevant in the form offered. In doing so, the judge committed no error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sansone, 252 </em>Mass. 71,74 (1925). Defense counsel\u2019s offer of proof indicates that, sometime after Brown\u2019s conversation with the pizza parlor owner, Dorr \u201cconfronted\u201d Brown. Although that offer suggests that Dorr did have knowledge of Brown\u2019s conversation with the pizza parlor owner, a responsive answer to the question propounded would not have disclosed that information. \u201cEvidence offered must be responsive to a competent question, in order that its exclusion be error.\u201d <em>Hallwood Cash Register Co. </em>v. <em>Prouty, </em>196 Mass. 313, 315 (1907). The record indicates that the judge also refused to allow Brown to relate to the jury the substance of his \u201cconfrontation\u201d with Dorr, and that Brown objected to that ruling. But Brown\u2019s brief contains no argument about that ruling. Therefore, the point is waived. See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 919 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Brown objects to the severity of his sentence, but we decline to reach that issue. Brown has preserved his right to appeal his sentence to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 28A &amp; 28B; <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>358 Mass. 193, 195-196 (1970). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>363 Mass. 601 (1973), we reached the defendant\u2019s challenge to the severity of his sentences even though he had not appealed them to the Appellate Division, <em>id. </em>at 610-612, but in that case the Commonwealth did not argue the propriety of our addressing the defendant\u2019s challenge, as it did here orally. Having considered the issue here, we conclude that an eligible criminal defendant should first address to the Appellate Division a complaint regarding the severity of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\"> Defense counsel: \u201cI was asking, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I was under the impression someone had told David Dorr that Kurt Brown said he committed some crime.
