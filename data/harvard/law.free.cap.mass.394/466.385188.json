The department denied the plaintiffs\u2019 requests because it determined that each plaintiff had access to resources in excess of $2,000, the allowable resource limitation for individuals seeking MA benefits. 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 505.110 (1983). Pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, the plaintiffs sought judicial review of the department\u2019s actions. The Superior Court affirmed the department\u2019s determinations. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the Appeals Court. We transferred these cases to this court on our own motion. We reverse and remand the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Medical assistance is a cooperative Federal and State program which provides payment for medical services to eligible individuals and families. See 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 501.200 (1983). Title XIX of the Social Security Act authorizes the MA program. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396-1396p (1982). In order to receive Federal funding, the State program must be approved and meet all the requirements of Title XIX and the implementing regulations. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396. <em>See Harris </em>v. <em>McRae, </em>448 U.S. 297, 301 (1980); <em>Sargeant </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>383 Mass. 809, 815 (1981). The State may elect to provide benefits to medically needy individuals. See <em>Tinkham </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 505, 506-507 (1981). Such individuals may have sufficient income and resources for their basic maintenance but not for medical care costs. S. Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., reprinted in 1965 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 1943, 2014. Massachusetts has chosen to provide such benefits. G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 1. The department administers the program in the Commonwealth. G. L. c. 118E. Eligibility is based on an individual\u2019s available income and resources. G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 10. 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 505.000-505.470 (1983). An individual may have available resources of $2,000 and remain eligible for MA benefits. G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 10 (3). 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 505.110. An eligible individual is entitled to payment of care and services furnished \u201cduring the three months immediately prior to the month in which he filed his application,\u201d if the individual would have been eligible during that period had he applied. G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 14, as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1210, \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The major issue which controls resolution of this dispute is whether a \u201cresource spend down\u201d should be used to calculate available resources.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Utilization of a resource spend down would require the department to offset an individual\u2019s incurred medical expenses against any resources in excess of the eligibility limits. The statutes and regulations provide for application of the spend down principle to income eligibility determinations. G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 10. 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 338.080. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.831 (1984). On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that the State statutes require and the Federal statutes allow for a resource spend down. Furthermore, the plaintiffs assert that neither the Federal nor State regulations prohibit a resource spend down. Therefore, the plaintiffs claim that the department erroneously denied them benefits by determining their accessible resources without utilizing a spend down. The department argues that the MA program in G. L. c. 118E must comply with Federal interpretations of Title XIX. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for administering the program for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the Federal government. The HCFA issued in August of 1980 a medicaid action transmittal which interpreted Title XIX and applicable regulations as precluding a resource spend down. Therefore, the department argues, it is precluded from determining available resources through utilization of spend down principles. For the reasons stated below, we conclude that a resource spend down is the proper method of calculating available resources in determining an individual\u2019s eligibility for MA benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">We briefly summarize the relevant facts concerning each plaintiff as found in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">1. <em>James E. Haley. </em>Haley was a single fifty year old disabled man who resided with his mother. Carney Hospital admitted him on January 24, 1981. Haley applied for MA benefits on March 24, 1981, requesting payments retroactive to January 24, 1981. At the time of application, Haley had a bank account balance of $3,045.72. His mother\u2019s name also appeared on the account. His hospital bills then exceeded $11,000. On April 17, 1981, Haley withdrew $2,000 in assets from his account which he used in part payment of medical expenses. The department established Haley\u2019s eligibility for MA benefits as of May 7, 1981.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On appeal, the department\u2019s division of hearings and the Superior Court upheld the department\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">2. <em>Leon Moreau, guardian of the estate of Mary Verona. </em>The Probate and Family Court for Bristol County appointed Leon Moreau as the temporary guardian of Mary Verona on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>March 23, 1981, effective retroactively to March 6, 1981.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mary Verona, eighty-five years of age, received social security income (SSI) and MA benefits until November 30,1980. These benefits were then terminated due to an SSI overpayment of $819.40. Verona was admitted to the hospital on January 31, 1981. Verona\u2019s hospital expenses from January 31, 1981, through June 15, 1981, totaled $17,517.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">On July 3, 1981, Moreau applied to the department for retroactive MA benefits for Verona. At the time, Verona owned assets totalling $2,497.12. Moreau transferred an amount of Verona\u2019s assets to meet her obligations on June 28,1981. This transfer reduced her assets below $2,000. On July 29, 1981, the department denied the July 3,1981, application for retroactive MA benefits on the basis that Verona\u2019s assets exceeded the $2,000 eligibility limit. The department approved MA benefits for Verona effective June 28, 1981, the date on which the assets were reduced below the eligibility limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Moreau appealed the department\u2019s determination. In a decision dated October 16, 1981, an appeals referee of the department determined that Verona\u2019s liabilities of $18,337.83 (hospital expenses plus the $819.40 SSI overpayment) canceled out her $497.12 excess assets. The referee\u2019s decision approved Verona\u2019s application for retroactive MA benefits. The Commissioner of the department (Commissioner) authorized a rehearing of this case on October 27, 1981. The director of the division of hearings (director), after rehearing, issued an order denying Verona retroactive MA benefits because Verona had excess assets until June 28, 1981. The director ruled that the referee erroneously had applied a resource spend down to determine eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">3. <em>Beth Israel Hospital.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">a. <em>Mildred Harriman. </em>On December 23,1980, the Brookline health department evicted Mildred Harriman and the other resi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>dents of a rooming house at 1415 Beacon Street. Initially, the health department placed Harriman in Longwood Hospital. She was transferred to Beth Israel Hospital (hospital) on December 30, 1980. At the time, Harriman was confused and unable to provide adequate information. Sometime after December 24, 1980, and prior to February 3, 1981, the health department discovered thirteen uncashed social security checks dating back over three years amongst Harriman\u2019s belongings. The health department had difficulty cashing these checks. The checks totaled $2,300. Harriman had $912.49 in a bank account. On February 3, 1981, the uncashed checks were deposited into her bank account. Concurrently, Harriman authorized a check to be made out to the hospital for $1,400.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">On April 2, 1981, the hospital filed an application with the department for retroactive MA benefits on behalf of Harriman. The department had denied a previous application filed January 6, 1980, due to Harriman\u2019s excess resources. The April application requested MA benefits retroactive to January 20, 1981. The department approved the application retroactive to February 3, 1981. This was the date that Harriman\u2019s excess resources were spent down to below the eligibility limit. The hospital filed a timely appeal. The appeals referee approved the department\u2019s determination of Harriman\u2019s eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">b. <em>Dorothy Hurley. </em>The hospital admitted Dorothy Hurley on August 22, 1980. Hurley suffered from chronic psychosis and dementia. On October 9, 1980, the hospital filed an application for MA benefits with the department on Hurley\u2019s behalf. Because of her condition, hospital employees were unable to elicit from Hurley the necessary financial information pertinent to her eligibility. The department also had difficulty confirming any financial eligibility information. On December 31, 1980, the department denied this application because \u201cit was over 60 days old.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Sometime prior to February . 13, 1981, the hospital received information that Hurley had a brother living in California. On February 13, 1981, the Probate and Family Court for Suffolk County appointed Edward D. Hurley as his sister\u2019s temporary guardian retroactive to December 18, 1980. The hospital filed a timely appeal of the department\u2019s denial of MA benefits to Hurley on February 20, 1981. Sometime prior to March 6, 1981, Mr. Hurley determined that his sister had assets totalling $3,084.08. On March 16, Mr. Hurley submitted a check for $1,084.08 from Dorothy Hurley\u2019s account to the hospital in payment of medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">After a hearing, the department\u2019s appeals referee determined that the department incorrectly denied Hurley\u2019s application on the basis that it was received over sixty days prior to the denial. The referee, however, determined that Dorothy Hurley was not harmed by this action. Dorothy Hurley had $3,084.08 in assets until March 16, 1981, thereby preventing her being eligible for MA benefits. The referee was not persuaded by the fact that Hurley was not lucid enough to report the amounts and locations of her bank accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\"><em>G. L. c. 118E. </em>The plaintiffs argue that, even if Federal law does not allow the utilization of a resource spend down, the Massachusetts statutory scheme independently requires use of a resource spend down. We disagree. General Laws c. 118E, \u00a7 1, establishes the MA benefits program for Massachusetts. This section \u201cestablished, pursuant to <em>and in conformity with </em>the provisions of Title XIX of the Social Security Act (P.L. 89-97), a program of medical care and assistance for certain residents of the commonwealth\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1981, c. 351, \u00a7 172. The language of this section clearly indicates that the Legislature intended the MA benefits program to comply with the Federal statutory and regulatory scheme. Furthermore, St. 1969, c. 800, \u00a7 10, provides that the provisions of G. L. c. 118E are severable and that any provision \u201cin violation of any federal rule or regulation established by the [HHS] as a condition for receiving federal funds in connection with any program administered by said department . . . shall be null and void and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>such violation shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions.\u201d Therefore, we conclude that the department may only utilize a resource spend down if G. L. c. 118E, read in conformity with Title XIX of the Social Security Act, authorizes such a scheme. Any other result would jeopardize continued Federal contributions to this program. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396c.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\"><em>HCFA medicaid action transmittal. </em>In August, 1980, the HCFA issued medicaid action transmittal No. 80-58 to all State agencies administering MA programs. The transmittal stated: \u201cthe current page 6 of <em>ATTACHMENT 2.6-C </em>allows States to require a \u2018spend-down\u2019 of an individual\u2019s resources, by indicating that excess liquid resources can be applied to the cost of medical care. Although section 1902(a)(17)(D) of the Social Security Act provides this option with respect to income (by taking into account incurred medical expenses), neither the Act nor Federal regulations allow for such flexibility with regard to resources. We have, therefore, eliminated this option on page 6 of <em>ATTACHMENT 2.6-C </em>to correct this error and reflect Federal law and regulations.\u201d The transmittal is a guideline authorized by 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.3(d) (1984), which advises State agencies of the HCFA views concerning current Federal policy and interpretation of applicable statutes and regulations. <em>See Hernandez v. Blum, </em>61 N.Y.2d 506, 509-510 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The department argues that this transmittal is a binding interpretation of the statutory language by the agency charged with the statute\u2019s implementation. Consequently, the department argues that it cannot utilize a resource spend down. We disagree. Although \u201can administrative interpretation of a statute is accorded deference,\u201d <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>384 Mass. 198, 204 (1981), quoting <em>School Comm. of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>376 Mass. 112, 116 (1978), interpretative rule making is not controlling upon the courts, <em>Daughters of Miriam Center for the Aged </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>590 F.2d 1250, 1258 (3d Cir. 1978). At best HCFA action transmittals \u201care simply interpretive rules.\u201d <em>Colorado Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. </em>v. <em>Department of Health &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number><em>Human Servs., </em>558 F. Supp. 337, 352 (D. Colo. 1983). An \u201cagency may not, by interpretative rule, rewrite a position it had taken previously,\u201d when the interpretation is not supported by the statute. <em>Daughters of Miriam Center for the Aged, supra </em>at 1263. Courts previously have found such transmittals unpersuasive, especially where the interpretation results in a change from prior practice. See <em>Tinkham </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 505, 514-515 (1981); <em>Daughters of Miriam Center for the Aged, supra; Hernandez </em>v. <em>Blum, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Medicaid action transmittal No. 80-58 indicates that HCFA\u2019s earlier interpretation of the statutes and regulations allowed the use of a resource spend down.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The present interpretation is a clear departure from HCFA\u2019s prior view. There had been no concurrent change in the applicable statutes and regulations. We conclude that this interpretation should not be accorded great deference. We, therefore, look to the underlying statutory scheme and to the regulations duly adopted by HHS. See <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>371 Mass. 705, 707 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\"><em>Authority for a resource spend down. </em>Initially, we express our disagreement with the department\u2019s argument that the statute clearly and unambiguously precludes a resource spend down. This argument is based on the absence of a reference to resources in the clause requiring \u201cflexibility in the application of such standards with respect to income by taking into account, except to the extent prescribed by the Secretary, the costs (whether in the form of insurance premiums or otherwise) incurred for medical care or for any type of remedial care recognized under State law.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17)(D). We do not agree that this absence clearly precludes a resource spend down. This section requires that eligibility determinations \u201cprovide for reasonable evaluation of any such income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>or resources.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17)(C). The agency administering the MA benefits program must determine eligibility in a manner \u201cconsistent with the objectives of this subchapter [Title XIX].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17)(A). If application of an income spend down is a reasonable and consistent method of evaluating income, so a resource spend down is a reasonable and consistent method of evaluating resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The ambiguity in the statute is also evident by the HHS\u2019s and HCFA\u2019s actions. The regulation which HHS promulgated substantially tracks the underlying statute. See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 435.840, 435.841 (1984) (determination of resources must be reasonable). The major addition to the statutory language reflected in the regulations delineates the period in which the assets are counted. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.845 (1984). Prior to medicaid action transmittal No. 80-58, HCFA interpreted the statute and regulations as permitting a resource spend down. We conclude, therefore, that if an application of a resource spend down is consistent with the goals of Title XIX and is reasonable, it is authorized by Title XIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">We next determine whether utilization of a resource spend down is consistent with the Federal statutory scheme. Title XIX was \u201cdesigned to liberalize Federal law under which States operate their medical assistance programs so as to make medical services for the needy more generally available.\u201d S. Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong. 1st Sess., reprinted in 1965 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 1943, 2014 (hereinafter S. Rep.). To fulfil this goal, Congress sought to ensure eligibility to individuals with income and resources which prevented eligibility for other programs when the income and resources were exceeded by incurred medical costs. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17); S. Rep. at 2017-2020, 2147. A State must \u201ctake into account only such income and resources as (determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary) are actually available to the applicant or recipient and as would not be disregarded (or set aside for future needs).\u201d S. Rep. at 2018. A State may not \u201crequire the use of income or resources which would bring the individual\u2019s income below the amount established as the test of eligibility under the State plan. Such action would reduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>the individual below the level determined by the State as necessary for his maintenance.\u201d S. Rep. at 2019. We conclude that, although Congress did not require use of a resource spend down, such use is a reasonable method of evaluating resources.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Absent a properly promulgated regulation, \u201cto the extent that an agency determination involves a question of law, it is subject to de nova judicial review.\u201d <em>Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>364 Mass. 593, 595 (1974). Cf. <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Health, </em>388 Mass. 707, 720-724 (1983). We, therefore, must determine independently whether the Legislature intended to require the use of a resource spend down. The goal of the MA benefits program is to provide coverage of medical expenses to individuals with income and resources above eligibility levels set for other assistance programs. See G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 1. MA benefits are provided to individuals \u201cwhose income and resources are insuf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.\u201d G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 5, as amended by St. 1973, c. 1210, \u00a7 26. The Legislature intended to allow individuals to be eligible for benefits while retaining a certain level of income and personal property. G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 10. To further this goal, \u00a7 10 provides that up to $2,000 of personal property \u201cshall be exempt and shall neither be taken into consideration, nor be required to be applied toward payment or part payment of the cost of medical assistance available under this chapter . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 10(3). Absent a resource spend down, an individual unaware of the department policy would be required to apply otherwise exempt resources to the cost of medical assistance. See note 8, <em>supra. </em>This result is clearly in derogation of G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 10 (3). Section 13 further evidences the Legislature\u2019s determination to ensure an individual\u2019s retention of a certain level of resources. G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 13, as amended through St. 1981, c. 351, \u00a7\u00a7 183, 184.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The department\u2019s policy of determining eligibility without the application of a resource spend down does not comply with the requirement that an individual be allowed to retain a certain level of resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the department\u2019s method of determining eligibility without a resource spend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>down is \u201cnot in accordance with law.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7)(g).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We vacate the judgments and we remand the cases to the Superior Court for action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b483-7\"> Haley and Beth Israel Hospital appeal from judgments in the Superior Court in Suffolk County confirming the special master\u2019s reports which recommended affirming the decisions of the Department of Public Welfare (department).

L. c. 118E would require a resource spend down. We disagree. A fair reading of the record indicates that this issue was properly raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b485-8\"> The decision of the division of hearings notes that Haley had income up to May 7, 1981. The income in excess of eligibility limits was only $112.25. This excess would properly be reduced through the applicable income spend down provisions. There is no indication why MA benefits were not approved as of April 17,1981, when his resources actually dropped below the eligibility limits. We note that, had the department applied both a resource and income spend down, the incurred medical expenses apparently were sufficient to absorb both the excess resources and income. Under the application of a resource spend down, Haley would have been retroactively eligible for payment of services since his admission on January 24,1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b486-9\"> In his memorandum of decision, the Superior Court judge stated that June 9, 1981, was the date of the appointment of the permanent guardian.

L. c. 118E, \u00a7 8. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>section authorizes an institution which furnishes medical services under G. L. c. 118E, to make an application for, or to intervene if an application is made by, an individual. The institution is entitled to the same notice, hearing, and appeal rights as the applicant. G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b490-6\"> The department argues that, even when a resource spend down was an option provided in the medicaid preprinted State plan, the department did not select that option. This argument does not prevent us from the result reached today. If the Legislature requires the use of a resource spend down under G. L. c. 118E, the department\u2019s prior action in derogation of such a requirement does not aid the department\u2019s position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b492-6\"> The reasonableness of applying a resource spend down to eligibility determinations is apparent when one examines the effect of eligibility determinations without a resource spend down. An eligible individual is entitled to three months\u2019 retroactive payment of medical expenses. G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 14. Without a resource spend down, an individual with excess resources who is aware of the department\u2019s policy is in a better position than the average individual who is unaware of the policy. The aware individual can actually spend down his excess resources as soon as he incurs medical expenses which, absent excess resources, would be eligible for payment. Once the resources are actually absorbed, the individual is eligible for payment of medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The paradox occurs with a less sophisticated individual or an individual who is not in a condition actually to spend down resources. Upon application to the department, this individual would be informed that, because of excess resources, medical expenses incurred in the last three months would not be eligible for payment. This result would occur regardless of how miniscule the excess resources were in comparison to the medical expenses incurred in that three-month period.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">A concrete example of this absurd result is Mary Verona\u2019s situation. Verona had $497.12 in excess resources. Her hospital expenses for about a four and one-half months\u2019 period equalled $17,517.31. Common sense and simple mathematics require the conclusion that the $497.12 excess would have been absorbed in the first few days of hospitalization. However, Verona was incapable of actually spending down her resources. Therefore, the department, applying the present criteria, denied her retroactive eligibility until she actually paid out the $497.12 on June 28, 1981, thereby precluding any retroactive benefits. The unreasonableness of this result is self-evident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b493-6\">This amendment became effective on July 1, 1981. St. 1981, c. 351, \u00a7 299. It was not in effect for purposes of this case. However, this section is instructive of the Legislature\u2019s intent to require a resource spend down. See 1A C. Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7\u00a7 22.34, 22.35 (4th ed. 1974). The amendment liberalized the prior application of this section which denied eligibility to individuals who assigned or transferred real or personal property in order to render themselves eligible for benefits. Section 13 explicitly applies a resource spend down in these instances. G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 13, as amended through St. 1981, c. 351, \u00a7\u00a7 183, 184. The Legislature later rewrote \u00a7 13, to clarify further the application of a resource spend down to transfer of assets situations. G.L.c.ll8E,\u00a713,as appearing in St. 1982, c. 611, \u00a7 1. These changes indicate the Legislature\u2019s continued intent to ensure that individuals are allowed to retain a certain level of resources.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b494-6\"> In determining eligibility based on a resource spend down, the department may require an applicant actually to apply the resources to incurred medical expenses. After application of a spend down, retroactive benefits. must be granted if an applicant meets all other eligibility criteria.
