L. c. 276 or art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. We conclude that the trial judge was justified in finding that the police acted on a warrant issued on probable cause, and that the search of the defendant\u2019s home was conducted as if the warrant had met the statutory and constitutional requirements of particularity. Therefore, we hold that, in these circumstances, exclusion of the evidence seized is not required. Consequently, there was no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, and the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">The defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree of Sandra D. Boulware, and appealed to this court on the ground that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence seized pursuant to a defective search warrant. We reversed the conviction because the warrant failed to list with the requisite particularity the items to be seized. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>387 Mass. 488, 499-501 (1982) <em>(Sheppard I), </em>cert. granted, 463 U.S. 1205 (1983). We held that, because the warrant was defective, the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States required exclusion of the evidence seized, regardless of whether the officers executing the warrant acted on a good faith belief that the search and seizure were lawful. <em>Id. </em>at 507-508 &amp; n.20. We further concluded that the warrant violated G. L. c. 276, and art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights, <em>id. </em>at 501, but in view of the result we reached with respect to the Fourth Amendment claim, we did not consider whether exclusion was also required by State law. <em>Id. </em>at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">The United States Supreme Court reversed. <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>468 U.S. 981 (1984). The Supreme Court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>that the Fourth Amendment does not require exclusion in cases, such as this one, where \u201cthe officer conducting the search acted in objectively reasonable reliance on a warrant issued by a detached and neutral magistrate that subsequently is determined to be invalid. \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 987-988. See <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897 (1984). After the Supreme Court remanded the case, we directed, by order of July 13, 1984, \u201cfurther briefing ... on the question whether in view of the violation of art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth and G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 2, the evidence obtained as a result of that violation should be excluded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The evidence adduced at the trial for this brutal murder has been adequately described in our first review of this conviction, <em>Sheppard I, supra </em>at 489-496, and need not be restated here. The facts with respect to the issuance of the defective warrant are summarized as follows.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> One day after the body of the victim was found, and after a preliminary investigation which established probable cause,, <em>id. </em>at 492 n.7, the district attorney for the Suffolk District and two police officers, Sergeant Bomstein and Detective Peter J. O\u2019Malley, concluded that they should obtain a warrant to search the home of the defendant at 42 Deckard Street in Roxbury. <em>Id. </em>at 492. Detective O\u2019Malley prepared an affidavit in support of the application for the warrant, but, because it was Sunday, no suitable form for the search warrant itself could be obtained. <em>Id. </em>at 493. Detective O\u2019Malley did find a warrant form which had once been in use by the Municipal Court of the Dorchester District to authorize searches for controlled substances, and he attempted to adapt this form to authorize a search of the premises at 42 Deckard Street. <em>Id. </em>\u201cHe crossed out the words \u2018controlled substance\u2019 \u201d on one section of the form, and \u201creplaced the word \u2018Dorchester\u2019 with the word \u2018Roxbury.\u2019 He inserted a reference to \u20182nd &amp; Basement\u2019 of 42 Deckard Street as the place to search. However, the reference to \u2018controlled substance\u2019 was not deleted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>in those portions of the form that constituted the application for a search warrant and would constitute the warrant itself.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Detective O\u2019Malley and a group of other law enforcement officials then went to the home of a judge, who was also unable to locate an appropriate form. <em>Id. </em>at 493-494. Accordingly, the judge made a few changes on the form provided by Detective O\u2019Malley, and then dated and signed the warrant. \u201cThe judge made no change in the substantive portion of the printed warrant form which, therefore, contained authority \u2018to search for any controlled substance, article, implement or other paraphernalia used in, for, or in connection with the unlawful possession or use of any controlled substance. \u2019 The warrant made no reference to the items listed in Detective O\u2019Malley\u2019s affidavit in support of the application.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] It neither listed them, nor incorporated them by reference; nor was the affidavit attached to the warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Detective O\u2019Malley and others executed the warrant later that same afternoon. <em>Id. </em>They met the defendant\u2019s mother and sister at 42 Deckard Street, showed them the warrant, and told them that they were going to search the defendant\u2019s room and the cellar. \u201cIt does not appear that either of the two women read the warrant or asked to have it read.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Detective O\u2019Malley had with him throughout the search a copy of the affidavit listing the items to be seized. <em>Id. </em>A great deal of incriminating evidence was found on the premises, which we later characterized as \u201cmost important in rounding out a case based only on circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>The defendant moved to suppress the items uncovered in the search of his home on the ground that they were seized pursuant to a defective warrant. The Superior Court judge concluded that the warrant was issued on probable cause, but agreed with the defendant\u2019s contention that it was defective because it failed to list the items to be seized. <em>Id. </em>at 497. However, the judge admitted the evidence on the ground that the officers had conducted the search with a reasonable and good faith belief in the validity of the warrant. He found that the judge who had issued the warrant \u201ctold Detective O\u2019Malley that he would make the necessary changes in the warrant form so as to provide a suitable form of search warrant and that the warrant as delivered was sufficient authority in form and content to carry out the search as requested. He found also that the search of 42 Deckard Street was carried out within the limits that Detective O\u2019Malley understood the warrant to permit and that Detective O\u2019Malley had the affidavit and search warrant with him at 42 Deckard Street. He concluded that \u2018the actual search undertaken was within the limits of the authority the police thought reasonably had been granted. <em>'\"Id. </em>at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">1. <em>General Laws c. 276.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The defendant first contends that exclusion is required by G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 2, which provides that \u201c[sjearch warrants shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>designate and describe the building, house, place, vessel or vehicle to be searched <em>and shall particularly describe the prop</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number><em>erty or articles to be searched for\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Section 2A describes in some detail the form in which warrants shall be issued, and explicitly requires that the warrant contain a \u201cdescription of [the] property\u201d which is the object of the search. The warrant at issue here clearly failed to meet these statutory requirements. <em>Sheppard I, supra </em>at 499-501. It is equally clear that the warrant failed to meet the particularity requirement of art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights. <em>Id. </em>See Commonwealth v. <em>Taylor, </em>383 Mass. 272, 275 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>General Laws c. 276 does not specify the circumstances in which an exclusionary remedy will be applied to the fruits of a seizure conducted pursuant to a defective warrant. In cases in which we are asked to infer a remedy, we are guided by the principle of statutory construction that the act \u201cmust be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature . . . considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>388 Mass. 115, 119 (1983), quoting <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We emphasize that we are not confronted here with a deficiency as to the probable cause requirements of the statutes or of art. 14. General Laws c. 276 sets out more stringent requirements for a showing of probable cause than either the State or Federal Constitutions. Specifically, G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 2B, requires that the grounds for probable cause be set forth in an affidavit presented to a \u201ccourt or justice,\u201d and, therefore, the statute precludes a \u201ccourt or justice\u201d from giving any effect to sworn oral statements. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monosson, </em>351 Mass. 327, 330 (1966). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Goyett, </em>699 F.2d 838 (6th Cir. 1983) (Fourth Amendment permits magistrate to consider sworn oral statement as supplement to affidavit in determining probable cause for issuance of warrant); <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>441 F.2d 1224, 1226 (8th Cir. 1971) (same). One of the purposes of \u00a7 2B is \u201cto make sure that the Commonwealth could demonstrate <em>by a writing </em>that any given search and seizure was reasonable and based upon probable cause\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monosson, supra </em>at 330. Only if the statutorily prescribed procedure is followed can the defendant be \u201cgiven a full opportunity to challenge the legality of the search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Monosson, </em>the defendant was deprived of this opportunity because the affidavit in support of the warrant failed to \u201ccontain all the information presented under oath to the magistrate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329. We therefore concluded that the statute had been violated \u201cin a manner tending to prejudice the defendant,\u201d <em>id., </em>and thus that exclusion was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, ante </em>363, 365-369 (1985) <em>(Upton II), </em>we were faced with the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to set forth in the affidavit required by \u00a7 2B an adequate showing of probable cause. This violation of G. L. c. 276 thwarted the Legislature\u2019s evident intent to protect the citizens of the Commonwealth from searches and seizures not supported by probable cause. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monosson, supra </em>at 330. This violation, furthermore, was a \u201cdirect cause of the seizure and the prejudice from the violation [was] substantial.\u201d <em>Upton II, supra </em>at 368. We thus held that exclusion was required in circumstances where evidence was seized in violation of the statutory requirement of a written, sworn statement establishing probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Therefore, in both <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monosson </em>and <em>Upton II, </em>we applied a rule of exclusion to prejudicial, and thus substantial, violations of the statute. In light of the Legislature\u2019s heightened solicitude for probable cause requirements, both cases suggest that all violations of the statutory probable cause requirements are substantial. This is the case, either because of the prejudice caused by invasion of a defendant\u2019s right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, <em>Upton II, supra, </em>or because of the prejudice caused by the defendant\u2019s inability to challenge the search because of the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to preserve the grounds for the search in an affidavit. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monosson, supra </em>at 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In the instant case we deal not with a deficiency as to probable cause, but with a deficiency as to particularity. We conclude that, unlike the statute\u2019s probable cause provisions, the particularity requirements of G. L. c. 276 essentially track the particularity requirements of art. 14 and the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, we infer that the Legislature intended, as did the framers of art. 14, to protect \u201cindividuals from general searches, which [were] the vice of the pre-Revolution writs of assistance.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>354 Mass. 625, 629 (1968). See generally <em>Marron </em>v. <em>United States, </em>275 U.S. 192 (1927). We also infer that the Legislature intended that the Commonwealth be able to \u201cdemonstrate by a writing,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Monosson, supra, </em>that the scope of the officers\u2019 authority to search was properly limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The record supports the judge\u2019s finding that the defect in the warrant did not lead to a general search of the premises at 42 Deckard Street. <em>Sheppard I, supra </em>at 503. Instead, the police officers believed that their authority to search was limited in scope to those items set forth in the affidavit. <em>Id. </em>at 502-503. Moreover, \u201cthe search of 42 Deckard Street was carried out within the limits that Detective O\u2019Malley understood the warrant to permit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497. As we noted in <em>Sheppard I, supra, </em>\u201c[t]he search was conducted in the same way and with the same results as it would have been conducted if the warrant had not been defective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 503. Furthermore, the defendant was not deprived of the opportunity to challenge the scope of the search, since there was a \u201cwriting,\u201d in the form of an affidavit, which the officers had with them throughout the search, <em>id, </em>and which was available to the defendant at his trial. <em>Id. </em>at 496-497. In short, \u201c[t]he defect in the warrant was not harmful to the defendant in the circumstances of the actual search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 503. The officers in no way exploited, or attempted to exploit, the illegality of the warrant. Thus, despite the technical violation of the statute, the dual legislative aims were substantially satisfied. In these circumstances, we conclude that G. L. c. 276 does not require exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">2. <em>Article 14.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">We turn to the defendant\u2019s second argument, that application of an exclusionary remedy is required by art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Article 14, like G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 2A, and 2B, requires that there be a writing which specifies the objects of the search. We read art. 14 as requiring that the \u201cspecial designation\u201d of the \u201cobjects of search\u201d be included within the warrant, or that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>writing containing the designation be attached to the warrant and incorporated therein by reference. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>383 Mass. 272, 276-277 (1981). Thus, in this case, the warrant failed to meet the particularity requirements of art. 14. See <em>Sheppard I, supra </em>at 500-501. Nonetheless, we recognize that \u201cthis court has never accepted the concept of an exclusionary rule under the State Constitution when a search violated the requirements of art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights.\u201d <em>Upton II, supra </em>at 365. The issue before us is whether, in the circumstances presented here, the constitutional violation requires exclusion from evidence of the objects seized in the search. Because art. 14 includes no specific requirement of exclusion, we have before us a question, not of right, but of remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The particularity requirements of art. 14, like those of the statute, not only protect against the general search, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, supra, </em>but provide the defendant with the opportunity at trial to demonstrate that the officers\u2019 authority to search was impermissibly broad. We have already determined in our discussion of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 2A, and 2B, that these twin aims were substantially satisfied here. We now conclude that art. 14 does not require the exclusion of the evidence seized from 42 Deckard Street, because the search at issue was conducted as if the warrant had complied with constitutional and statutory requirements. Despite the technical violation of art. 14, the search was not \u201cunreasonable\u201d within the meaning of that constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Although there were violations of both art. 14 and G. L. c. 276, exclusion of the evidence seized is not required because there was no prejudice to the defendant, and thus the violations were not substantial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Other circumstances in other cases may well require the remedy of exclusion, and, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>other cases, certain concepts argued extensively by the parties in this case may well be relevant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Our reversal in <em>Sheppard I </em>was predicated on the trial judge\u2019s refusal to exclude the material seized from 42 Deckard Street, and on our holding that exclusion was required by opinions of the United States Supreme Court interpreting the Fourth Amendment. <em>Sheppard I, supra </em>at 507-508. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case to this court. <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>468 U.S. 981, 991 (1984). We have now concluded that there was no error in the judge\u2019s ruling under either the statutes or the Constitution of the Commonwealth. Further, consistent with our duties under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we have reviewed the entire record on the law and the evidence, and conclude that the defendant is entitled to no relief under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b399-6\"> For a more complete description of the events preceding the search of 42 Deckard Street, see <em>Sheppard I, supra </em>at 492-496, and <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Sheppard, supra </em>at 984-987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b400-7\"> See <em>Sheppard I, supra </em>at 492 n.7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b400-8\"> It is apparent, as the defense evidently conceded before the Supreme Court, that the warrant would have been valid \u201cif the judge had crossed out the reference to controlled substances, written \u2018see attached affidavit\u2019 on the form, and attached the affidavit to the warrant.\u201d <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Sheppard, supra </em>at 492 n.7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b400-9\">The police found, among other things,\u2019 boots which were stained by blood of the same type as the victim\u2019s, bloodstains on the concrete floor of the cellar, a bloody earring which was identified as looking like one the victim was wearing a week before her disappearance, bloodstained leotards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>which were identified as a type known to have been purchased by the victim, and a hairpiece which the victim was wearing on the day of her disappearance. <em>Sheppard I, supra </em>at 494-495.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b401-10\">General Laws, c. 276, \u00a7 2, as appearing in St. 1964, c. 557, \u00a7 2, provides: \u201cSearch warrants shall designate and describe the building, house, place, vessel or vehicle to be searched and shall particularly describe the property or articles to be searched for.

The property for which I seek the issuance of a search warrant is the following: (here describe the property as particularly as possible).</p>\n<p id=\"Aks\"><em>\u201cWherefore, </em>I respectfully request that the court issue a warrant and order of seizure, authorizing the search of (identify premises and the persons to be searched) and directing that if such property or evidence or any part thereof be found that it be seized and brought before the court; together with such other and further relief that the court may deem proper.</p>\n<p id=\"A-gr\">Name.</p>\n<p id=\"AG0\">\u201cThen personally appeared the above-named.......and made oath that the foregoing affidavit by him subscribed is true.</p>\n<p id=\"AKR\">\u201cBefore me this.....day of...........,19.</p>\n<p id=\"ArD\">Justice or Special Justice,</p>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">Clerk or Assistant Clerk of the......Court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b406-7\"> Article 14 provides: \u201cEvery subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches, and seizures, of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions. All warrants, therefore, are contrary to this right, if the cause or foundation of them be not previously supported by oath or affirmation; and if the order in the warrant to a civil officer, to make search in suspected places, or to arrest one or more suspected persons, or to seize their property, be not accompanied with a special designation of the persons or objects of search, arrest, or seizure: and no warrant ought to be issued but in cases, and with the formalities prescribed by the laws.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\"> Our analysis is similar to the approach set forth in the Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure \u00a7 SS 290.2 (2) (1975). The Model Code provides that \u201c[a] motion to suppress evidence . . . shall be granted <em>only if the court finds that the violation upon which it is based was substantial, </em>or if otherwise required by the Constitution of the United States or of this State\u201d (emphasis added). See <em>Sheppard I, supra </em>at 507 n.20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b408-8\"> The parties have debated whether the purposes of the exclusionary rule as a deterrent to illegal police conduct, and as protective of the integrity of the judicial process, are served by excluding evidence seized in a good faith and reasonable belief in the validity of a warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b408-7\">Liacos, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUl\">(concurring). I adhere to the views I expressed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>387 Mass. 488, 509 (1982) <em>(Sheppard I) </em>(Liacos and Abrams, JJ., concurring). I am gratified that the court no longer attaches significance to the supposed \u201cgood faith\u201d of the magistrate and the police officers. Compare <em>Sheppard I, supra </em>at 503-505 &amp; n. 19, with my concurrence at 509-521. The court today takes the view that, where there has been essential compliance with the requirements of G. L. c. 276 and of art. 14, suppression of the evidence seized is not necessarily mandated. I agree that \u201cbecause the search at issue was conducted as if the warrant had complied with constitutional and statutory requirements,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheppard, ante </em>381, 391 (1985) <em>(Sheppard II), </em>suppression of evidence seized is not required under State law. Accordingly, I join the court in its opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Lynch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGH\">(concurring). I concur in the result. In my dissent in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>387 Mass. 488, 523 (1982) <em>(Sheppard I), </em>I concluded that the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution did not mandate suppression of the evidence seized in this case. The Supreme Court agreed, and held that \u201cthe exclusionary rule should not be applied when the officer conducting the search acted in objectively reasonable reliance on a warrant issued by a detached and neutral magistrate that subsequently is determined to be invalid.\u201d <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>468 U.S. 981, 987-988 (1984). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 906-907 (1984). Even if an exclusionary rule, which has escaped detection for 205 years, is now discovered in art. 14, I see no reason to formulate a different rule for its application in this Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">In my dissent in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, ante </em>363, 380 (1985), <em>(Upton II), </em>I did not reach the issue whether G. L. c. 276 required the exclusion of evidence seized in the absence of probable cause, because I concluded that probable cause existed. Since I agree that G. L. c. 276 does not require exclusion in the circumstances of this case, I do not reach the issue of when, if ever, a violation of G. L. c. 276 requires the exclusion of evidence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
