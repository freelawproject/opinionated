Parkes, was convicted of lewd, wanton, and lascivious conduct in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. On appeal, Parkes claims that inadmissible and prejudicial hearsay testimony was allowed in evidence and that the prosecutor made certain improper statements during her closing argument. He also claims that his motion for a required finding of not guilty, made at the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>should have been allowed. Because we agree that the admission of the hearsay testimony was improper and created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, we reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\"><em>The Commonwealth\u2019s case. </em>The Commonwealth introduced the following evidence at trial. Brice Guile testified that just after midnight on the morning of April 18, 1999, he was driving a large tractor-trailer truck northward on Route 95 in the area of Rowley and Georgetown. Guile was driving in the extreme right-hand lane at 62 miles per hour. While looking in his rear view mirror, Guile noticed a small two-door coupe about twelve car lengths behind him and two lanes over on his left. There were no other cars in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">As Guile was passing a rest area in Rowley, the coupe moved over to the lane next to him and began to draw abreast of him. Guile noticed that its interior dome light was on. Then, as the auto moved next to the driver\u2019s side window, Guile looked into the coupe and noticed that there was a small, golf ball sized ornament hanging from the car\u2019s rear view mirror and that the car had bucket seats. He then observed that the driver of the car, later identified as the defendant, was holding his exposed penis with his right hand while driving with his left. The penis appeared to be erect. Guile further observed that the defendant was wearing a light colored shirt, had his pants unbuttoned, and had folded down the comer of his pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">After about four or five seconds, the defendant began to pull ahead of Guile. At this time, Guile braked his track and allowed the defendant to pass him. He then noted the defendant\u2019s license plate number and used his cellular telephone to report the number to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">In response to Guile\u2019s call, Trooper Kelly Secrest was dispatched from the Newbury State police barracks. Secrest testified that she spotted the defendant\u2019s car traveling north on Route 95 near Salisbury and pulled it over. Shortly thereafter, Guile and another State trooper, Dana Pagley (who also testified), arrived at the scene. Guile identified himself as the person reporting the incident and thereafter returned to the Newbury barracks and provided a written statement regarding the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\"><em>The defense. </em>The defendant testified that he had not been masturbating or doing anything else to attract attention during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>the incident in question, but rather was holding a bottle of water between his legs intending to take a drink from the bottle.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">More specifically, the defendant testified that, during the evening before the incident, he had attended a wedding reception in Boston with his girlfriend, Cheryl Sarokas, but then had left the reception, returned Sarokas to her apartment in Somerville, and left for his own home in New Hampshire because of nausea and stomach upset. The defendant further testified that he had taken off his belt to alleviate his discomfort and then, as he neared the tractor-trailer truck, had turned on the dome light in his car to enable him to obtain some chewable antacid tablets from a bag in the back seat. The defendant further testified that, at the time he was observed by Guile, he was holding a bottle of water between his legs and was intending to drink from the bottle as soon as he had taken the medicine. The defendant further testified that he was holding his thumb on top of the uncapped bottle in order to keep water from spilling before he had obtained the medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Sarokas also testified in behalf of the defendant, stating that she had attended a wedding reception with the defendant during the evening preceding the incident. She further testified that they had left the reception and returned to her apartment in Somerville because the defendant was not feeling well, and then the defendant had left her apartment to drive to his home in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">1. <em>Improper admission of hearsay evidence. </em>During her direct examination of Trooper Secrest, the prosecutor elicited that, at the time Secrest stopped the defendant, she told him that she was responding to \u201cseveral cell phone calls\u201d reporting that he was \u201cexposing himself.\u201d More specifically, Secrest testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-7\">Q: \u201cWhat conversation did you have with the defendant?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-8\">A: \u201cAfter he gave me his license and registration, I \u2014 I advised him why I had stopped him. That \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-9\">Q: \u201cWas he still in the car at that time?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-10\">A: \u201cYes, he was.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-11\">Q: \u201cAnd what did you tell him the reason was?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>A: \u201cI had told him that we had got several \u2014 we call them code 22 calls \u2014 they are cell \u2014 people, when people call on their cell phone \u2014 that we had gotten several cell phone calls that he was driving erratically, flashing his high beams and exposing himself to other people in traffic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Secrest further testified that, in response to her statement, the defendant stated that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know what [Secrest] was talking about,\u201d and that \u201che wasn\u2019t doing that.\u201d The defendant then went on to explain that he had been feeling ill and had turned the light on in his car only to allow him to obtain some medicine from a bag in the back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">In response to Secrest\u2019s reference to \u201cseveral cell phone calls,\u201d defense counsel brought out during his cross-examination of Secrest that there was no reference to multiple calls either in the police log or in the report Secrest had written regarding the incident. The prosecutor then elicited the following additional testimony on redirect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-7\">Q: \u201cWell, let me ask you this: The statement that was read from your report about what you were \u2014 what this driver was said to have been doing \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-8\">A: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-9\">Q: \u201c \u2014 where did that information come from?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-10\">A: \u201cIt came from \u2014 the code 22 caller statement?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-11\">Q: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-12\">A: \u201cThat came from Trooper Reddy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-13\">Q: \u201cSo who is Trooper Reddy?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-14\">A: \u201cShe was the desk officer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-15\">Q: \u201cAnd can you recall for us today whether one caller called in or more than one caller called in?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-16\">A: \u201cIt was given out over the radio as numerous calls.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>During her subsequent examination of Trooper Pagley, the prosecutor elicited the following additional testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-5\">Q: \u201cLet me ask you: On April 18th, 1999, just after midnight, what were you doing?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-6\">A: \u201cI was in the barracks at that particular hour.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-7\">Q: \u201cDid you receive some information?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-8\">A: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-9\">Q: \u201cAnd as a result, did you go out?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-10\">A: \u201cYes, I did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-11\">Q: \u201cSo what were you looking for when you left?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-12\">A: \u201cI was looking for a vehicle, supposedly was pulling up next to tractor-trailer units, exposing themselves with the dome light on inside the car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">The defendant contends that these references by the troopers to \u201cseveral cell phone calls\u201d and to multiple \u201ctractor-trailer units\u201d constituted inadmissible hearsay and that their admission violated his rights under the confrontation clauses of both the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. He further contends that, even though there were no objections to the testimony, its admission created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, and, hence, reversal is required. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967). We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">The Supreme Judicial Court has explicitly recognized that testimony of the type involved in this case \u201ccarries a high probability of misuse, because a witness may relate \u2018historical aspects of the case, replete with hearsay statements in the form of complaints and reports\u2019 even when not necessary to show state of police knowledge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, </em>430 Mass. 505, 509 (1999), quoting from McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 249, at 734 (E. Cleary 3d ed. 1984). Accordingly, the court has held that such testimony is admissible only if it is based on the police officer\u2019s own knowledge, it is limited to the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>required to establish the officer\u2019s state of knowledge, and the police action or state of police knowledge is relevant to an issue in the case. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosario, supra </em>at 509-510. These requirements reflect the need to keep such evidence \u201ccarefully circumscribed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">In the present case, Guile testified that he had reported the incident to the police as soon as it had occurred. There was therefore no issue as to why Secrest had stopped the defendant\u2019s car. Moreover, even if there were such an issue, there is no apparent reason \u2014 and the Commonwealth has suggested none \u2014 why Secrest needed to refer to \u201cseveral cell phone calls,\u201d rather than simply to \u201cinformation,\u201d or \u201ca call,\u201d when she was describing her conversation with the defendant at the time of the stop. Nor is there any apparent reason why Pagley had to refer to multiple \u201ctractor-trailer units\u201d in describing why he had been dispatched to find the defendant\u2019s car. In the circumstances, these references by the troopers to \u201cseveral cell phone calls\u201d and to multiple \u201ctractor-trailer units\u201d appear specifically designed to put before the jury that Guile had not been alone in reporting the defendant\u2019s self-exposure, rather than, as the Commonwealth contends, simply to explain the troopers\u2019 actions or to put in context the defendant\u2019s statements to the trooper at the time he was stopped. The testimony, therefore, was inadmissible hearsay and, hence, should have been excluded. See <em>id. </em>at 509-510, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">We also conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, admission of the testimony created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. \u201cAn error creates a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice unless we are persuaded that it did not \u2018materially influence[]\u2019 the guilty verdict.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 13 (1999), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra </em>at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">In the present case, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence against the defendant was far from overwhelming. In fact, it consisted almost entirely of Guile\u2019s testimony. While Guile was unequivocal about what he believed he had seen, he also testified that the incident occurred shortly after midnight and lasted for only four or five seconds. In the circumstances, the troopers\u2019 repeated references to additional reports that the defendant had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>exposing himself provided important corroboration for Guile\u2019s account of the incident, and may well have induced the jury to accept that account and to reject the defendant\u2019s contrary account.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 551, 557 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Moreover, while defense counsel did not object to the hearsay evidence, we cannot with fair assurance conclude, as the Commonwealth suggests, that his failure to do so was a tactical decision calculated to obtain a benefit for the defendant in the form of evidence that he later used to impeach the troopers\u2019 credibility by introducing evidence that there were not multiple calls. The troopers\u2019 credibility was of minor importance in the case. Rather, the vital issue was whether Guile\u2019s account of the incident might be believed notwithstanding his limited opportunity to observe what was occurring. In the circumstances, we do not think it plausible that defense counsel sought to obtain a benefit from allowing the troopers\u2019 testimony regarding additional complaints to be placed before the jury. The defendant could only be harmed by this evidence, and we view counsel\u2019s later efforts as damage control once it was first admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the admission of the hearsay evidence was fatally erroneous and reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction is required. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>419 Mass. 750, 761-762 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brouillard, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 448, 454-457 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">2. <em>Other issues. </em>We reject the defendant\u2019s claim that his motion for a required finding of not guilty, made at the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, should have been allowed. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was sufficient to warrant a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had engaged in lewd, wanton, and lascivious conduct in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, </em>382 Mass. 108, 117-118 (1980). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>296 Mass. 459, 460-462 (1937). Because we are reversing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>conviction, we need not address the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was improper. However, we caution that prosecutors (and defense counsel) should take care to adhere to proper bounds in presenting such argument. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>377 Mass. 772, 778 (1979), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ApHb\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-8\"> We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that the hearsay evidence failed to identify the defendant as the person who was exposing himself. As recited above, Secrest testified that she had stated to the defendant at the time she stopped him that \u201cwe had gotten several cell phone calls that he was . . . exposing himself to other people in traffic.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
