L. c. 152, \u00a7 11 A. We hold that the burden was upon the employee, not the administrative judge sua sponte, to move to supplement the medical record.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\"><em>Background. </em>The employee, Mary Rose Viveiros, appeals from a decision of the reviewing board of the Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Industrial Accidents, which affirmed the decision of an administrative judge denying additional benefits from February 8, 1996, forward. She argues that (1) the report of the IME was inadequate to support the decision, and (2) a videotape purporting to depict her working conditions was improperly admitted in evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\"><em>Facts. </em>Viveiros is a former employee of A &amp; A Manufacturing Co., Inc., where she worked as a garment examiner. As an examiner, she inspected the work of fourteen machine operators who installed pockets and zippers on garments. On October 16, 1995, she injured her lower back when she bent down to pick up a bundle of fabric. After reporting the incident to her supervisor, she left work to seek medical treatment at a local hospital, where she was given medication and released. She returned to work the next day and was assigned to a lighter job, which she left after two hours, still complaining of pain. She again reported this to her supervisor and sought medical treatment. She has not returned to work since.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The insurer, A.I.M. Mutual Insurance Company, denied initial liability and payment of benefits. Viveiros filed a claim for benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 30, and 34. On February 28, 1996, following a conference held pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A, the administrative judge ordered the payment of medical and temporary total incapacity benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 30 and 34, for the period of October 17, 1995, to February 8, 1996.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While both parties appealed that decision, the insurer withdrew its appeal on March 15, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2), Dr. Medhat Kader was named as an IME<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to examine Viveiros, which he did on May 1, 1996. Dr. Kader reviewed the reports of Viveiros\u2019s previous</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>treating physicians.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He found a causal relationship between the incident and the back pain, but concluded that at the time of his examination, Viveiros was not disabled and was capable of performing her previous job. His diagnosis at the time of the examination was a \u201clow back sprain, completely subsided with no residuals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Viveiros argues on appeal that the report of the IME was inadequate in that it \u201cfailed to address the disability and extent of it for the period prior to the date of the examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\"><em>Supplementation of the medical record. </em>Issues of fault are largely irrelevant in cases in which an employee is injured in the workplace. Of significance and in frequent dispute are \u201cthe fact and the extent of injury.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s Case, </em>424 Mass. 16, 20 (1996). To avoid what had been categorized as the battle of dueling doctors, G. L. c. 152 was amended to provide for an examination by an agreed upon or appointed impartial medical examiner. After the physical examination, the doctor is required to render a report, which must address certain issues.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That report is entered as an exhibit. \u201c[N]o additional medical reports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>or depositions of any physicians shall be allowed by right to any party; provided, however, that the administrative judge may, on his own initiative or upon a motion by a party, authorize the submission of additional medical testimony when such judge finds that said testimony is required due to the complexity of the medical issues involved or the inadequacy of the report submitted by the impartial medical examiner.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2), as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Coupled with these principles is the long held rule that the employee has the burden of proving the essential facts necessary to establish a case warranting the payment of compensation. See <em>Sponatski\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 526, 527-528 (1915); <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 586, 592 (2000); G. L. c. 152 \u00a7 8(1), as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 23 (\u201can insurer\u2019s inability to defend on any issue shall not relieve an employee of the burden of proving each element of any case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In this case, Dr. Kader concluded that on May 1, 1996, the date he examined Viveiros, she had reached a medical end result. While he opined that she had reached that point on the date he examined her, he did not offer an opinion as to when, prior to that date, she might have reached that point.* *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the report was silent on the extent of the disability, if any, between February 8, 1996, and the date of the medical examination on May 1, 1996, which was the period for which Viveiros was seeking additional benefits, the question arose as to who had the responsibility to address this alleged shortcoming. Viveiros argues that it was incumbent upon the administrative judge to order sua sponte additional medical evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Given the traditional roles of the parties, however, it was Viveiros, not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>administrative judge, who had the burden of moving to expand the medical record.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Section 11A(2) provides that an administrative judge <em>may, </em>on the judge\u2019s own initiative or upon a motion by either party, enter in evidence additional medical testimony when the judge finds such evidence necessary due to the inadequacy of the report submitted by the IME. A plain reading of the statute indicates that the judge\u2019s actions are discretionary. <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s Case, </em>424 Mass, at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">At the hearing, Viveiros did not move to present further medical evidence and chose to rely on the report of the IME.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As the request was never made, it was not incumbent upon the administrative judge to order it sua sponte. The administrative judge\u2019s finding that Viveiros failed to sustain the burden of proof necessary to support an award of further benefits was adequately supported by the record and was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\"><em>Admission of the videotape. </em>Viveiros also argues that the videotape that the insurer introduced at the hearing did not provide a fair representation of her working conditions and was therefore inadmissible. She testified to working at a faster rate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>than the workers shown on the videotape, thus, she asserts, making the videotape inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u201c [Videotapes should be admissible as evidence if they are relevant, they provide a fair representation of that which they purport to depict, and they are not otherwise barred by an exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>400 Mass. 524, 527 (1987). It was within the judge\u2019s discretion to admit the videotape. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tobin, </em>392 Mass. 604, 613 (1984), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>386 Mass. 466, 469-470 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In the present case, the videotape was relevant to the material issue of the physical tasks that Viveiros\u2019s job required. She did not argue that the physical tasks shown in the videotape were not accurately portrayed. Her concern, centering on her work pace being faster than that depicted in the videotape, went to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. The administrative judge\u2019s admission of the videotape depicting Viveiros\u2019s working conditions was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\n<em>Decision of the Industrial Accident Reviewing Board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-10\"> February 8, 1996, is the date of the examination and medical report of Dr. Shapiro, the insurer\u2019s physician, stating that Viveiros, in his opinion, had reached a medical end result and could return to her usual occupation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b321-11\"> \u201cWhen any claim or complaint involving a dispute over medical issues is the subject of an appeal of a conference order pursuant to section ten A, the parties shall agree upon an impartial medical examiner from the roster to examine the employee and submit such choice to the administrative judge assigned to the case within ten calendar days of filing the appeal, or said administrative judge shall appoint such examiner from the roster.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2), as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\"> The medical records Dr. Kader reviewed and incorporated in his report included the following reports: (1) Dr. Christiansen, of WorkMed Occupational Health Service, who, on October 17, 1995, diagnosed Ms. Viveiros as having \u201clumbar strain\u201d and authorized her return to work with medication and physical therapy; (2) Dr. Maurice A. Berard, of the Back Clinic at Charlton Memorial Hospital, who treated Viveiros on October 19, 1995, and reviewed an x-ray dated October 16, 1995, which revealed negative findings in the lumbosacral spine; (3) Dr. Jeffrey Swift, a chiropractor, who diagnosed \u201ca very mild lumbar sprain\u201d on October 19, 1995, and gave her chiropractic treatments until January 1, 1996, at which time he noted her motion to be \u201cessentially normal\u201d and intended to discharge her after her examination in one month; and (4) Dr. Shapiro, the insurer\u2019s physician, whose February 8, 1996, examination of Viveiros \u201crevealed essentially negative findings,\u201d and who determined at that examination that she was at an end result and was \u201cable to return to her usual occupation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\"> \u201cThe report of the impartial medical examiner shall, where feasible, contain a determination of the following: (i) whether or not a disability exists, (ii) whether or not any such disability is total or partial and permanent or temporary in nature, and (iii) whether or not within a reasonable degree of medical certainty any such disability has as its major or predominant contributing cause a personal injury arising out of and in the course of the employee\u2019s employment. Such report shall also indicate the examiner\u2019s opinion as to whether or not a medical end result has been reached and what permanent impairments or losses of function have been discovered, if any. Such impartial physician\u2019s report shall constitute prima facie evidence of the matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>contained therein.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A(2), as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b323-9\"> At his deposition on November 26, 1996, the doctor was never specifically asked by either party about his opinion as to when Viveiros had reached an end result. He was questioned as to whether his opinion was limited to the date of the examination, to which he replied, \u201cThat\u2019s what we do to evaluate people, examine them, listen to them, and we cannot watch them for a year and a half to see whether they have back pain or not. My job is to examine her and see what she is now when I examine her.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b323-10\"><em> Wilkinson\u2019s Case, </em>11 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 263, 265 (1997), and <em>Allie\u2019s Case, </em>12 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 167, 170 (1998), discuss two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>instances, which are not applicable here, where an administrative judge should have acted sua sponte. In <em>Wilkinson\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 264, the IME made no objective findings attributing the employee\u2019s incapacity to the industrial injury; believing the claim meritorious, the administrative judge concluded on his own that there was a causal relationship. The reviewing board ruled that the judge had arbitrarily awarded benefits for an incapacity that had no support in the medical evidence, and held that, in this circumstance, the judge had the authority, which he should have exercised, to order sua sponte additional medical evidence. In <em>Allie\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 168-169, the IME made no finding of a causal relationship between the employee\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome and her work, but the administrative judge, \u201c[b]y reasonable inference\u201d after reading the IME report, found a \u201cclear causal relationship\u201d and awarded benefits. Again, the reviewing board found that the administrative judge should have ordered additional medical testimony sua sponte, if there was no request for further medical testimony, and if the judge believed that the employee had a meritorious claim. These cases stand for the proposition that where the administrative judge is faced with an inadequate IME report and an employee\u2019s claim that the judge believes to be meritorious, the judge is empowered to authorize further medical evidence sua sponte, even though neither party has requested it, rather than rely on the judge\u2019s own lay medical opinion. These cases are distinguishable from the case at hand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b324-9\"> We do not intimate an inadequacy on the part of counsel here. Indeed, a reading of the various doctors\u2019 reports indicates that there might not have been any beneficial evidence that could have been submitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
