After nonbinding arbitration pursuant to G. L. c. 142A, the case was heard de nova in the Superior Court. A jury returned a verdict for the contractor on Simas\u2019s claim for breach of contract; however, the trial judge reserved a related claim under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, and decided it in favor of Simas. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that neither party\u2019s appeal has merit, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">1. <em>Background. </em>In August, .1993, Simas purchased a single-family house in Burlington, Massachusetts, and before moving in, he hired the contractor to make renovations. The parties entered into three separate contracts, all dated August 3, 1993, for work to be done on various parts of the house. The total price of the three contracts was $36,311.93. Under each of the agreements, Simas was to pay the contractor an initial amount upon execution of the contract, additional amounts at various stages of each project, and the balance upon completion. In each contract, the contractor agreed to perform the specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>work, to obtain all necessary permits, and to \u201cperform this contract in conformity with customary industry standards.\u201d Each contract also contained a clause providing for nonbinding arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"A-u\">Suffice it to say that the job did not go smoothly, and the project was terminated before the work was completed. After an exchange of written demands and counter-demands, Simas filed a request for arbitration with the home improvement contractor arbitration program of the executive office of consumer affairs, pursuant to G. L. c. 142A, on a form provided by that office.</p>\n<p id=\"APm\">General Laws c. 142A, entitled \u201cRegulation of Home Improvement Contractors,\u201d was inserted by St. 1991, c. 453. Among other things, it enumerates prohibited acts which may subject a contractor or subcontractor to administrative sanctions, criminal prosecution, and civil remedies. G. L. c. 142A, \u00a7 17. It also sets out requirements for residential contracting agreements and authorizes the inclusion of arbitration clauses, so long as the provisions are clearly and conspicuously disclosed in language designated by the director of consumer affairs and business regulation, and each party assents by separately signing and dating the provision. G. L. c. 142A, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute establishes a private arbitration services program, to be approved by the director, to consider disputes arising from contracts for residential contracting services. G. L. c. 142A, \u00a7 4. This program is made available not only in cases where the parties have contracted to use it, as was the case here, but also at the homeowner\u2019s request, in cases where there is no arbitration agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> G. L. c. 142A, \u00a7 <em>3(b). </em>The arbitrator\u2019s decision is not final; it may be appealed by seeking a trial de nova in the Superior or District Court, within twenty-one days of the issuance of the arbitrator\u2019s findings. G. L. c. 142A, \u00a7 <em>4(e). </em>In the trial de nova, \u201c[a]ll findings of fact issuing from arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>tian shall be taken as prima facie evidence . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 142A, \u00a7 <em>4(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">On February 25, 1994, the arbitration in this case was decided in favor of Simas. The arbitrator found, inter alla, that the contracted work was incomplete and performed poorly; that the contractor violated the payment schedule by invoicing and receiving payment for work that had not been done and materials that had not been delivered; that the contractor failed to procure all legally required permits; and that the contractor covered up work requiring rough inspection without first having had it examined by the appropriate town building officials. The arbitrator awarded Simas damages of $29,957.00, plus $800.00 in reimbursement of the arbitration fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">On March 11, 1994, the contractor initiated an action in the Superior Court by filing a document entitled \u201cDefendant\u2019s Appeal of Arbitrator\u2019s Decision Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 142A.\u201d Although filed by the contractor, this document was styled as a pleading in which Simas was named as the plaintiff and the contractor was named as the defendant. It prayed for a trial de nova of the arbitrator\u2019s decision and contained a jury demand on behalf of the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The contractor\u2019s filing was accepted as the equivalent of a complaint; the case was entered; and discovery ensued. However, because of the manner in which the initial pleading was styled, Simas did not respond with an answer or counterclaim. It was not until nearly a year later that Simas attempted a pleading of his own by filing a paper entitled \u201cMotion to Amend Request for Relief.\u201d In this document, Simas sought leave to amend his request for arbitration to include a demand for relief under G. L. c. 93A. Simas\u2019s motion was allowed, over the contractor\u2019s opposition, by a judge other than the one who later presided at th\u00e9 trial. As a result, Simas\u2019s c. 93A claim was included with Simas\u2019s claim under G. L. c. 142A in the de nova proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>The claim under G. L. c. 142A was submitted to the jury as a simple claim for breach of contract.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5The jury answered \u201cNo\u201d to a special question asking, \u201cDid the House of Cabinets, Inc. breach the contract with Julius J. Simas, Jr.?\u201d Thereafter the judge, in considering the c. 93A claim, found that the contractor had committed a number of violations of G. L. c. 142A that entitled Simas to relief under G. L' c. 93A.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge found further that Simas had suffered damages on account of some, but not all, of these violations and assessed total damages of $19,198.00. Because the judge also found that the contractor had not made a written tender of settlement under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9(3), he ruled that Simas was entitled to recover costs of $4,474.30, and attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $9,800. Judgment therefore entered on the c. 93A claim in the amount of $33,472.30, plus prejudgment interest from October 14, 1993, the date of Simas\u2019s initial written demand to the contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">2. <em>Simas\u2019s appeal. </em>Simas raises but one point in his appeal from the judgment against him on the jury\u2019s verdict on the breach of contract claim: that the trial judge erroneously excluded testimony about a telephone conversation on September 28, 1993, between Simas and the contractor\u2019s attorney, and a related letter from the contractor\u2019s attorney to Simas dated October 1, 1993. Simas contends that the excluded evidence was essential to rebut the contractor\u2019s defense to the breach of contract claim, which was that it remained willing to work on the project and to correct any deficiencies, but was prevented from doing so because Simas went to the premises on September 28, 1993, and removed the key that the contractor had been using to enter. According to Simas, the excluded testimony and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>letter would have established that, by September 28, the contractor had refused to perform any further work unless Simas made an additional, unjustified payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The fatal flaw in Simas\u2019s argument is that the trial judge did, in fact, permit him to testify that he removed the key only after he learned that the contractor was refusing to do any more work unless it received more money. Since the substance of the excluded conversation ultimately came in evidence, Simas suffered no prejudice from the trial judge\u2019s ruling. See <em>Powers </em>v. <em>H.B. Smith Co., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 657, 663 (1997). Furthermore, insofar as the October 1, 1993, letter is concerned, it appears never to have been offered in evidence or marked for identification.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Simas therefore failed to preserve the issue. See <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Rosen, 331 </em>Mass. 763 (1954); <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Southwick, </em>415 Mass. 465, 467-468 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">3. <em>Contractor\u2019s appeal. </em>As a threshold matter, the contractor contends that, because Simas never lived in the house where the work was performed, he was not entitled to the protection of G. L. c. 142A and could not sue for damages under G. L. c. 93A on account of c. 142A violations. General Laws c. 142A, \u00a7 1, defines an \u201cowner\u201d as \u201cany homeowner of a pre-existing owner-occupied building containing at least one but not more than four dwelling units, or tenant thereof, who orders, contracts for, or purchases the services of a contractor or subcontractor.\u201d The contractor reads the words \u201cpre-existing owner-occupied\u201d to mean that only homeowners who physically occupied their houses before contracting for improvements are entitled to the statute\u2019s protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">We reject this interpretation. The words \u201cpre-existing owner-occupied\u201d modify the word \u201cbuilding.\u201d Here there was no dispute that Simas\u2019s house was a pre-existing building; nor was there any dispute that the building was purchased by Simas for use as an owner-occupied dwelling as soon as the work was done. We think this was sufficient to bring Simas within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>class of individuals protected by the statute, as the contractor no doubt recognized when he signed three contracts containing an arbitration clause that explicitly referred to G. L. c. 142A.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The contractor next argues that Simas was precluded from pursuing his c. 93A claim because he elected to proceed to arbitration rather than bringing suit. The contractor fails to mention that Simas was contractually committed to go to arbitration \u201cprior to proceeding to legal action in the courts\u201d but given that fact, the defendant\u2019s argument reduces itself to the proposition that Simas forfeited his 93A claim simply by agreeing to arbitrate under the auspices of the approved program and not raising the claim in the arbitration proceedings. This position is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">There is no language in G. L. c. 142A that restricts an arbitrating homeowner\u2019s rights under G. L. c. 93A. If anything, the statute reflects an intention to facilitate a homeowner\u2019s c. 93A remedies by stating explicitly in G. L. c. 142A, \u00a7 17, that violation of any of the provisions of c. 142A shall constitute an unfair or deceptive act under the provisions of c. 93A. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>We ascertain no legislative intent to deprive owners who agree to participate in the arbitration program of the opportunity to advance a c. 93A claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Furthermore, even if we assume that Simas\u2019s G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, claim was arbitrable at his election,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> his failure to request that the c. 93A claim be considered at arbitration did not preclude a later action in court. The record reflects that everyone concerned \u2014 the parties, the arbitrator, and even the executive office of consumer affairs which promulgated the checklist form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>of arbitration demand which was utilized in this case<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 operated under the assumption that c. 93A claims were not to be heard at arbitration. Thus, the c. 93A claim was not within the scope of the c. 142A arbitration as framed by the arbitration demand, and Simas remained free to litigate it in court. See <em>TLT Constr. Corp. </em>v. A. <em>Anthony Tappe &amp; Assocs., Inc., </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 13 (1999) (error to dismiss G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, claim on claim preclusion grounds where record did not establish that parties intended to litigate c. 93A claim in prior arbitration proceedings or that arbitrator was asked to consider or decide it). See also <em>Blanchette v. School Comm, of Westwood, </em>427 Mass. 176, 183-184 (1998) (where teacher\u2019s statutory civil rights claim was not submitted to arbitration together with her grievance, she did not waive her right to pursue her claim in judicial forum). Contrast <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>412 Mass. 424, 427 (1992); <em>DaLuz </em>v. <em>Department of Correction, </em>434 Mass. 40, 45-46 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"ACqe\">The contractor\u2019s related claim, that it was error for the Superior Court to allow Simas\u2019s motion to amend his request for relief to include a claim for c. 93A damages, is equally without merit. Although we agree with the contractor that the asserted basis for the amendment was questionable, we nevertheless conclude that it was appropriate to allow the c. 93A claim to go forward in conjunction with the trial de nova.</p>\n<p id=\"Aax\">In his motion to amend, Simas contended that the amendment was necessary to conform the pleadings to the evidence at the arbitration.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, the arbitrator\u2019s findings do not reflect that she considered any claims under G. L. c. 93A. To the contrary, as we have observed previously and as the contractor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>concedes, the c. 93A claim was not raised in the arbitration. We therefore conclude that it was appropriate for the motion judge to have allowed Simas to assert his c. 93A claim in the Superior Court proceedings, not because the c. 93A claim had, in fact, been tried to the arbitrator and was required to be tried again at the trial de nova, but because the c. 93A claim was not intended to be arbitrated, was not included in the request for arbitration, and was not heard or decided by the arbitrator. See <em>TLT Constr. Corp. </em>v. A. <em>Anthony Tappe &amp; Assocs., Inc., supra </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay3q\">The contractor\u2019s next contention is that the trial judge erred in concluding that Simas made a proper demand under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9. On October 14, 1993, Simas\u2019s counsel sent a letter to the contractor\u2019s counsel which identified itself as a c. 93A demand letter. The letter cited specific ways in which the contracts between the parties failed to comply with G. L. c. 142A, \u00a7 2; it recounted the contractor\u2019s failure to obtain legally required construction permits, which resulted in a stop-work order from the town\u2019s building inspector; and it set forth a detailed list of defects in workmanship which required repair. The letter stated further that \u201c[bjecause of the unfair and decepfive acts and practices employed by [the contractor], Mr. Simas has been seriously damaged in an amount as yet not fully determined.\u201d In closing, the letter stated that Simas intended to seek remedies under G. L. c. 93A and invited the contractor\u2019s counsel to telephone Simas\u2019s counsel \u201cto discuss how our clients should proceed from here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Afq\">A demand letter under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, must identify the claimant and reasonably describe the unfair or deceptive act or practice relied upon and the injury suffered. G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9(3). An adequate demand letter will \u201cdefine the injury suffered and the relief demanded in a manner that provides the prospective defendant with \u2018an opportunity to review the facts and the law involved to see if the requested relief should be granted or denied\u2019 and enables him to make \u2018a reasonable tender of settlement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Geriatric Authy. of Holyoke, </em>394 Mass. 274, 288 (1985), quoting from <em>York </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>369 Mass. 157, 162-163 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Here, although the October 14, 1993, letter did not specify a dollar amount of damages, it described Simas\u2019s injuries in sufficient detail to permit the contractor reasonably to ascertain its exposure. See <em>Brandt </em>v. <em>Olympic Constr, Inc., </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 913, 915 (1983) (demand letter sufficient where amount of compensation owed was apparent from facts alleged); <em>Fredericks </em>v. <em>Rosenblatt, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 713, 717-718 (1996) (demand letter sufficient where it concretely described purported injury and amount of damages was reasonably ascertainable). Significantly, in this case, the contractor\u2019s business routinely required it to estimate the costs of making home improvements. Thus, the contractor was actually in a better position than Simas to compute the expense which would be involved in rectifying the defects described in Simas\u2019s letter. Furthermore, any doubt the contractor may have had as to the exact amount of damages claimed by Simas was quickly dispelled by a subsequent letter sent by Simas\u2019s counsel on November 4, 1993, in which the sum of $29,457.00 was explicitly demanded to settle the dispute. The judge correctly concluded that Simas made sufficient demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The contractor also claims that the trial judge erred in finding that it failed to make a reasonable tender of settlement in response to Simas\u2019s demand. The contractor\u2019s attorney responded in writing to both the October 13, 1993, letter and the November 4, 1993, letter. Both times, the contractor denied liability and demanded additional payment from Simas. The reasonableness of the contractor\u2019s response was a question of fact for the judge to determine in light of the terms of the demand and all of the attendant facts and circumstances. See <em>Patry </em>v. <em>Harmony Homes, Inc., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 6 (1980). We perceive no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Nor do we find any error in the trial judge\u2019s computation of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. As the findings illustrate, the judge\u2019s calculation carefully took into account the pertinent factors. See <em>Patry </em>v. <em>Liberty Mobilehome Sales, Inc., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 701, 706 (1983). The judge took special note of the fact that the contractor did not argue that it was inappropriate to award attorney\u2019s fees incurred by Simas in connection with the arbitration proceedings; the contractor only contested the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>those fees. Contrast <em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Subaru of America, Inc., </em>407 Mass. 1004, 1005 (1990) (issue raised and decided that attorney\u2019s fees incurred in arbitration pursuant to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 <em>IWk </em>[6] were not recoverable in subsequent c. 93A action). We therefore do not consider the contractor\u2019s new contention that it was impermissible to award any arbitration-related fees. See <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 334, 338-339 (1997) (issues not raised in trial court are waived on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Finally, the contractor directly challenges the judge\u2019s c. 93A decision, claiming that the jury\u2019s finding for the contractor was entitled to preclusive effect or, alternatively, that the judge erroneously failed to consider (as the contractor assumes the jury did) the significance of Simas\u2019s removal of the key. As previously observed, the jury were given only the claim for breach of contract, and the judge reserved the c. 93A claim for himself. Accordingly, the judge was permitted to make his own decision on the more expansive c. 93A claim without being constrained by the jury\u2019s finding, and was entitled to reach his own conclusions on the import of Simas\u2019s actions. See <em>Chamberlayne Sch. &amp; Chamberlayne Jr. College </em>v. <em>Banker, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 346, 354-355 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AN5\"> it is undisputed that the arbitration clauses in the parties\u2019 contracts met these statutory requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A-T\"> Alternatively, any party who is not precluded from doing so by an enforceable agreement to arbitrate or by operation of the statutory provision providing for arbitration at the homeowner\u2019s election may proceed in the first instance by way of civil action in Superior, District, or Small Claims Court.

App. Ct. 354, 357 (1991) (party seeking to nullify award in case arbitrated under auspices of G.
