The agreement stated that it was to survive as a binding contract and not merge with any judgment. The parties filed a \u201cJoint Motion for Entry of Judgment of Modification,\u201d and a judgment of modification incorporating their agreement entered on May 13, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-14\">Almost eleven years later, in March, 1997, the plaintiff, alleging that her needs had changed drastically, filed a complaint for modification seeking alimony and a division of certain assets, including two pensions of the defendant. In May, 1998, a judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>of the Probate Court, after an evidentiary hearing, awarded the plaintiff a portion of one of the defendant\u2019s pensions, concluding that the parties \u201cnever had a judicial determination that [the 1986 modification] agreement was fair and reasonable.\u201d Accordingly, she ruled, the defendant could not \u201cuse the [mjodification [agreement as a defense to either the [plaintiff\u2019s request for alimony or her request for a division of the [defendant's pensions.\u201d The defendant has appealed, citing, among other authorities, Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 60(b), and claiming that it was too late for the plaintiff to attack, and too late for the judge in effect to vacate, the 1986 modification judgment. We agree and reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">We take our facts from official court documents, including the modification agreement, and the \u201cFindings of Fact\u201d of the probate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\"><em>The 1984 divorce judgment. </em>The 1984 judgment of divorce nisi provided, inter alla, that the plaintiff have physical custody of the parties\u2019 two minor children; that she have the use and occupancy of the marital home until the youngest child attained the age of nineteen, at which time the house was to be sold and the proceeds divided equally between the parties; that the defendant pay principal, interest, and taxes on the marital home until it was sold; and that the defendant pay the plaintiff fifty dollars a week in child support, be responsible for reasonable medical and dental expenses incurred by the minor children, and maintain the wife on his medical insurance plan. Other than the'division of the proceeds from the marital home, the judgment contained no provisions for alimony or property division.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The judge in 1998 found that, at the time of the divorce, the plaintiff was aware that the defendant had a Massachusetts Electric Company pension, but she did not know its value. The judge also found that \u201cthe [djefendant did not disclose his pension to the [cjourt at the time of the divorce,\u201d and that he \u201cdid not adequately disclose his pensions to the [plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\"><em>The 1986 modification agreement and judgment. </em>In February, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>1986, the plaintiff wanted to sell the marital home because the defendant had married a neighbor with whom the plaintiff was acquainted, and the defendant was living two houses away from the marital residence, causing the plaintiff enormous stress. Both parties hired attorneys and, prior to the sale, executed a modification agreement, the basic terms of which the parties themselves negotiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The modification agreement begins with a number of introductory \u201crecitals.\u201d These set forth the provisions of the divorce judgment; indicate that the judgment made no provision regarding the division of the parties\u2019 personal property; state that both parties wished to sell the marital home sooner than called for in the judgment and that they had entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell the home on May 12, 1986, that the wife wished to obtain $10,000 more than the husband from the proceeds, and that the only remaining minor child of the parties, then seventeen years old, wanted to reside with her father. The last of the introductory \u201crecitals\u201d was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">\u201cBoth parties wish to reach a binding agreement resolving these matters and making a final division of their property, both real and personal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The agreement provides for the division of the proceeds of the sale of the marital home in accordance with the recital,* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a division of personal property,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and a waiver by each party of \u201call claim to past, present or future alimony\u201d except that the defendant agreed to pay to the plaintiff fifty dollars a week as alimony until the youngest child reached eighteen. As mentioned earlier, the agreement contains a survival provision, namely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u201cNotwithstanding the adoption or incorporation of this Agreement into a Judgment of Modification or other Judgment[,] this Agreement shall not be merged with such Judgment but shall survive such adoption or incorporation as a binding contract between the parties and shall retain independent legal significance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The agreement was incorporated in a modification judgment. Although the judgment stated that the agreement was merged into the judgment, the modification agreement controlled insofar as it stated that the agreement survived. The survival provision of a valid separation or modification agreement cannot be altered by the Probate Court. See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>389 Mass. 21, 24 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\"><em>1998 judgment. </em>Despite the intent of the parties to have a final division of their property and a binding contract, and despite the explicit survival clause, the judge, in ruling on the plaintiff\u2019s 1997 complaint, determined that the 1986 agreement did not control the division of property or the right of the wife to receive alimony. This was so because there had never been a judicial determination that the modification agreement was fair and reasonable. See note 7, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Noting that the pensions were not mentioned in the 1986 modification agreement, were not disclosed in financial statements, and were not raised in the attorneys\u2019 negotiations, the judge concluded that the parties did not intend the pensions to be included in the personal property divided by the agreement. In any event, she added, \u201cinclusion of the pensions would create such a disproportionate division of assets that the division would not be fair and reasonable.\u201d She also determined that, despite the intention of the parties, the waiver of alimony provision of the 1986 agreement was not fair and reasonable. The plaintiff\u2019s waiver was a significant concession for which she had received no consideration. Moreover, \u201c[sjince the parties never appeared before a judge, it is not possible to determine if the waiver was made knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Having concluded that the modification agreement and judgment was not a bar to either an award of alimony or of the defendant\u2019s pensions, and also concluding that the 1984 divorce judgment did not purport to make a complete division of marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>assets or to award alimony, the judge ruled that she could now consider whether an award of the pension or of alimony was appropriate. She reviewed the factors enumerated in G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, and awarded the plaintiff a portion of the defendant\u2019s Massachusetts Electric Company pension, but found the plaintiff \u201cnot currently in need of alimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Since \u201ca judgment concerning the division of marital property is not subject to modification,\u201d <em>Taverna </em>v. <em>Pizzi, </em>430 Mass. 882, 886 (2000); see <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>402 Mass. 406, 409 (1988), the award of a portion of the defendant\u2019s pension, in effect, vacated the 1986 modification judgment. Similarly, by applying the c. 208, \u00a7 34, factors, which govern an initial award of alimony, rather than the \u00a7 37 standard of a \u201cmaterial change of circumstances,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which governs a modification after there has been a judgment for alimony, see <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 716, 718-722 (1997); compare <em>Dwight </em>v. <em>Dwight, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 739, 744-745 (2001), the judge treated the alimony provision in the 1986 modification judgment as having no force or effect. The crux of the judge\u2019s decision was that the 1986 modification agreement and judgment were not binding because there was no judicial finding that the 1986 agreement was fair and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The defendant argues that a judge need not determine whether a modification agreement incorporated in a judgment is fair and reasonable when the agreement is entered into by parties no longer married to one another. This contention ignores the public interest in having spouses and children adequately provided for after divorce, a concern equally applicable whether the agreement is entered into during the marriage in expectation of separation or divorce, or at some later time. Cf. <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Osborne, </em>384 Mass. 591, 599 (1981). Cf. also <em>Bercume </em>v. <em>Bercume, </em>428 Mass. 635, 644 (1999) (\u201ctermination of a marriage . . . may have consequences long after the date of divorce\u201d). We see no reason why modification agreements are not subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>to the same requirements as are applicable to separation agreements. See 2 Lindey &amp; Parley, Separation Agreements &amp; Antenuptial Contracts \u00a7 65.30, at 65-8 (2d. ed. 1999) (\u201cmodification must be entered into knowingly and without fraud, coercion or other defect that would invalidate a separation agreement\u201d). Cf. <em>McGahee </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>48 N.Y.2d 832, 834 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In order for a separation agreement incorporated in a judgment to be a bar to an attempt to modify its provisions, a judge must rule \u201cat some time that the agreement was fair and reasonable.\u201d <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>409 Mass. 727, 730 (1991), citing <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Remick, </em>371 Mass. 433, 436-437 (1976). <em>Barry, </em>however, leaves no doubt that the requisite finding may be implicit and that the complaint to modify must be timely. 409 Mass, at 732-733. In <em>Barry, </em>the plaintiff, more than five and one-half years after her divorce, sought modification of alimony as ordered in a divorce judgment incorporating an agreement surviving the judgment. See <em>id. </em>at 727-728. The probate judge considering the complaint for modification assumed that the judge who had granted the divorce had found by implication that the separation agreement was fair and reasonable. He thought, however, that because the judge, when granting the divorce, had made no independent finding of the agreement\u2019s fairness and reasonableness, he, more than five years later, on a complaint for modification, could consider the fairness and reasonableness of the agreement at the wife\u2019s request. See <em>id. </em>at 728-729. The <em>Barry </em>court disagreed, ruling that the absence of an explicit finding of the judge granting the divorce did not warrant a reconsideration of the issue of fairness and reasonableness. See <em>id. </em>at 732-733. Noting that the judge who passed on the separation agreement knew that its fairness and reasonableness was before him, the Supreme Judicial Court concluded that the judge had implicitly ruled, \u201calthough perhaps wrongly,\u201d that the agreement was fair and reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 732. The court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">\u201cBeyond this fact-specific basis for denying the wife\u2019s complaint for modification lies the importance of the finality of judgments that is embodied in Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>60(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the absence of fraud or coercion in the making of the separation agreement, in the absence of the petitioning spouse being or becoming a public charge, in the absence of a showing that no judge has yet even implicitly considered the fairness and reasonableness of the separation agreement. . . , and in the absence of \u2018countervailing equities\u2019 <em>(Knox </em>v. <em>Remick, supra </em>at 437), spousal support provisions in a separation agreement voluntarily entered into, incorporated in but surviving the judgment of divorce, should at some time become free from question. Because the wife did not challenge the agreement within a reasonable time after the entry of judgment (see Mass.R.Dom. Rel.R 60[b][6]), it is too late to claim that the agreement was not fair and reasonable. Cf. <em>Gottsegen </em>v. Gottsegen, 397 Mass. 617, 628-629 (1986).\u201d5 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 732-733.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>In addition to the significance accorded to the principle of finality expressed in Mass .R.Dom.Rel.P. 60, and in <em>Barry, </em>our cases involving litigation between formerly married spouses accord far more importance than was recognized by the probate judge to the intent of the parties as expressed in their agreement. Even in cases where agreements merge in the judgments and do not survive, the parties\u2019 intent is significant. See <em>Bercume </em>v. <em>Bercume, </em>428 Mass, at 644, where the court in referring to such cases said: \u201cTo the extent possible, and consistent with common sense and justice, the modified judgment should take into account the earlier, expressed desires of the parties.\u201d See also <em>Huddleston </em>v. <em>Huddleston, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 563, 568-570 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">In view of the policies favoring settlement of property disputes, see <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>389 Mass, at 24; <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 720 n.3, favoring taking into account the intention of the parties that there be a final division, see <em>Cappello </em>v. <em>Cappello, 23 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 941, 943 (1986), and favoring finality of judgments, the findings of the judge to support her conclusion that the parties never had a judicial determination that the agreement was fair and reasonable were insufficient to vacate the 1986 modification judgment many years after its entry.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 720 n.3 (if agreement not unconscionable on its face, court is not bound to hold an evidentiary hearing to incorporate it in a judgment). The judge who signed the 1986 judgment had before him an agreement not unconscionable on its face and had access to the court papers, including the then-relatively recent 1984 divorce judgment which, under c. 208, \u00a7 IB, was required to contain \u201cappropriate orders.\u201d See <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>409 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>at 730. He also had before him a joint motion by separate counsel for the plaintiff and the defendant. In such circumstances, the judgment must be taken to have incorporated implicitly the findings necessary to support the validity of the judgment (and modification agreement), see <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 720, and thus to preclude a challenge eleven years later. Compare <em>Rezendes </em>v. <em>Rezendes, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 438, 440 (1999), where a showing was made that the request for modification (or clarification) was timely although a long period had elapsed. Here, the plaintiff has suggested no reason why her attack on the modification judgment could not have been brought earlier. See <em>Gottsegen </em>v. <em>Gottsegen, </em>397 Mass, at 628-629.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of modification entered May 19, 1998, is reversed, and a judgment is to enter on the docket of the Probate Court dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint for modification of the 1986 modification agreement and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-9\"> There is no suggestion, however, in the judge\u2019s findings that there was fraud on the part of the defendant. That there was insufficient disclosure of the value of the only pension at issue here, the Massachusetts Electric Company pension, is not a ground for vacating the modification judgment. The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>was represented by counsel and, knowing of the pension, could have ascertained its value. See <em>Sahin </em>v. <em>Sahin, </em>435 Mass. 396, 403 (2001); <em>Kirtz </em>v. <em>Kirtz, </em>12 Mass.

Such an opportunity would permit requests for modification based on the possibility, however remote, of success and would burden judges with the need to find facts related to events often long past.\u201d <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>409 Mass, at 733.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b349-5\"> The judge\u2019s complete findings on this matter were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">\u201cNeither party recalls coming before this Court to present the Modification Agreement.
