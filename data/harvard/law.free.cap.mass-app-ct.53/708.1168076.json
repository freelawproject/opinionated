Three days later, on September 21, 1990, the employee began a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>job as a corrections officer with the New Hampshire Department of Corrections. While still working as a corrections officer in New Hampshire, the employee filed for, and began collecting, workers\u2019 compensation benefits for a temporary total disability, under \u00a7 34 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, G. L. c. 152 (Act). This appeal raises the question whether certain of the employee\u2019s actions constitute fraud within the meaning of \u00a7 14(2) of the Act. We also consider the scope of the authority of an administrative judge of the Department of Industrial Accidents (department) to order recoupment of benefit overpayments within a proceeding to modify or discontinue benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><em>Background. </em>The employer\u2019s insurer, Continental Insurance Company (insurer), voluntarily placed the employee on temporary total disability compensation shortly following his September, 1990, injury, but after he had begun employment as a corrections officer. The employee did not at that time reveal to the insurer his employment as a New Hampshire corrections officer. The employee was fired from his New Hampshire job on May 28, 1991, for reasons not relevant to this appeal. In November, 1991, TWA learned of the employee\u2019s New Hampshire job and terminated his employment. On March 10, 1993, the insurer filed a discontinuance request with the department, pursuant to \u00a7 10 of the Act. The parties appeared before the administrative judge on August 2, 1993, for a conference as prescribed by \u00a7 10A, at which the employee acknowledged his (then previous) corrections employment. The parties did not reach agreement on an appropriate level of compensation benefits at the conference, and the administrative judge entered a conference order awarding the employee partial incapacity benefits of $400 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The insurer appealed the conference order, seeking a total discontinuance of benefits and sanctions pursuant to \u00a7 14(2). A hearing on the appeal was held before the administrative judge on May 31, 1994. Prior to the hearing, in January, 1994, an impartial medical examiner examined the employee, as provided in \u00a7 11A of the Act. The examiner\u2019s report, which was entered in evidence at the hearing before the administrative judge, concluded that the employee was partially disabled as a result of his work-related injury. The examiner\u2019s report also included the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>\u201c[The employee] believes that he will not be able to do the work that he did prior to the episode. At the present time the patient is not employed, having stopped work on September 18, 1990. He does some chores at home, helping his wife, but he tells me that he is not involved in any strenuous activities or activities would [szc] require the prolonged use of his right shoulder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">In December, 1994, the administrative judge entered a decision in which he concluded that the employee had defrauded the insurer by concealing his New Hampshire employment for the purpose of claiming temporary total disability. The finding of fraud rested on the employee\u2019s failure to disclose his employment to TWA, the insurer, and a rehabilitation consultant prior to the August, 1993, conference, or to the impartial medical examiner before the May, 1994, hearing. Both parties moved for reconsideration. After hearing, the administrative judge issued an addendum in March, 1995, modifying the December, 1994, decision. As so modified, the judge\u2019s decision ordered that: (i) the insurer pay partial disability compensation in the amount of $120 per week; (ii) the insurer pay the employee\u2019s medical treatment costs; (iii) pursuant to \u00a7 14(2), the employee pay to the insurer the whole costs of the proceedings and attorney\u2019s fees (including direct payment of his own attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $3,717), and a penalty of $3,259.80; and (iv) the insurer was entitled to recoup overpayments, up to a maximum weekly recoupment of $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The employee appealed the administrative judge\u2019s decision to the reviewing board of the department (board), which, in January, 1997, issued a decision that (i) reversed the administrative judge\u2019s finding of fraud and his orders pertaining to payment of costs, penalties, and fees; (ii) reversed the administrative judge\u2019s recoupment order, finding it to be beyond his authority; and (iii) vacated the administrative judge\u2019s calculation of earning capacity, recommitting the matter to the administrative judge for further findings on that subject. After issuance of the administrative judge\u2019s revised determination of the employee\u2019s earning capacity on remand, the insurer appealed to the board. In a \u201cSummary Disposition\u201d dated November 12, 1998, the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>left intact its January, 1997, decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The insurer next appealed the board\u2019s decision to a single justice of this court, who reinstated the decision of the administrative judge as to fraud, sanctions, and recoupment. However, the single justice also reported the case for consideration by a panel of this court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because there is no current appellate law on the issues raised. We agree with the single justice that the administrative judge had authority to order recoupment of overpaid benefits, but we agree with the board that the employee did not commit fraud pursuant to \u00a7 14(2) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\"><em>Standards of review. </em>In reviewing a decision of an administrative judge, the board must determine whether the decision is \u201cbeyond the scope of his authority, arbitrary or capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C, as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 31. <em>See Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 373, 377 (2000). We may set aside the board\u2019s decision only if it is infected with error under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 <em>14(7){a)-{d), (f)-(g'). Robinson\u2019s Case, </em>416 Mass. 454, 457 (1993).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number><em>Applicability of \u00a7 14(2).</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The board concluded, contrary to the administrative judge, that the employee did not commit fraud within the scope of \u00a7 14(2) of the Act, which provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">\u201cIf it is determined that <em>in any proceeding within the division of dispute </em>resolution, a party, including an attorney or expert medical witness acting on behalf of an employee or insurer, concealed or knowingly failed to disclose that which is required by law to be revealed, knowingly used perjured testimony or false evidence, knowingly made a false statement of fact or law, participated in the creation or presentation of evidence which he knows to be false, or otherwise engaged in conduct that such party knew to be illegal or fraudulent, ... the party shall be assessed, in addition to the whole costs of such proceedings and attorneys\u2019 fees, a penalty payable to the aggrieved insurer or employee, in an amount not less than the average weekly wage in the commonwealth multiplied by six.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Under the statutory scheme established by \u00a7\u00a7 10-11C of the Act, the process for determination of a claim for compensation benefits consists of four discrete stages, described in <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Industrial Accs., </em>415 Mass. 218, 223-225 &amp; n.13 (1993): (i) an initial informal conciliation proceeding (\u00a7 10)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; (ii) a conference before an administrative judge (\u00a7\u00a7 10, 10A); (iii) a hearing or hearings before an administrative judge (\u00a7 11); and (iv) an appeal before the board (\u00a7 11C). See <em>Neff </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Industrial Accs., </em>421 Mass. 70, 74 (1995). In its decision, the board correctly concluded that only proceedings within one of the four described stages fall within the scope of \u00a7 14(2). In so doing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>the board rejected the reasoning of the administrative judge that the provisions of \u00a7 14(2) must apply to all periods in which an employee receives benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">\u201c[A] statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 255 (1994), quoting from <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975). \u201c[T]he statutory language itself is the principal source of insight into the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Scheffer\u2019s Case, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977). \u201cThe language of the statute is not to be enlarged or limited by construction unless its object and plain meaning require it.\u201d <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 399 (1993). \u201cThe interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with primary responsibility for administering it is entitled to substantial deference.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, \u201c[a]n incorrect interpretation of a statute by an administrative agency is not entitled to deference.\u201d <em>Kszepka\u2019s Case, </em>408 Mass. 843, 847 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Section 14(2) is explicit in its reference to \u201cproceeding[s] within the division of dispute resolution.\u201d Under \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8 of the Act, an insurer may commence voluntary payment of weekly benefits without prejudice to its right to contest the claim later, or it may contest the claim by stating the grounds for its challenge. However, there is nothing in the Act to suggest that the mere filing of a claim and voluntary payment of benefits by an insurer constitute \u201cproceeding[s] within the division of dispute resolution.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the Legislature had wished to embrace within the punitive measures of \u00a7 14(2) all steps incident to the filing of claims for benefits under the Act, it could have so provided. Instead, it chose to limit the scope of \u00a7 14(2) to \u201cproceeding^] within the division of dispute resolution\u201d which, under the comprehensive statutory scheme established under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Act, consist of the four stages described in <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Industrial Accs., </em>415 Mass, at 223-225.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Nor does \u00a7 14(2) stand as the sole provision of the Act directed to fraud. Section 14(3), added as part of the 1991 amendments, see St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 38, applies inter alla to a broad sweep of statements or omissions made at any time for the purpose of obtaining benefits under the Act, and imposes sanctions including restitution, fines, and imprisonment for actionable misconduct. Unlike \u00a7 14(2), however, \u00a7 14(3) does not provide for payment of a penalty and attorney\u2019s fees to the insurer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In light of \u00a7 14(3), and the plain language of \u00a7 14(2) limiting it to \u201cproceeding^] within the division of dispute resolution,\u201d we reject the insurer\u2019s assertion that a refusal to apply \u00a7 14(2) to the circumstances of this case allows claimants to commit fraud with impunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The insurer nonetheless contends that the employee (i) committed fraud during the course of proceedings within the division of dispute resolution by continuing, after the conciliation and until the conference order modifying his benefits, to collect and cash weekly disability payments premised on a total disability, which benefits he had procured by his previous failure to disclose his New Hampshire employment; and (ii) caused or contributed to the production of fraudulent evidence by failing to report to the impartial medical examiner his postinjury employment, which omission infected the examiner\u2019s report submitted in evidence at the hearing before the administrative judge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As to the first argument, it is enough to observe that (as noted by the board) the employee\u2019s acts of cashing checks did not occur \u201cin any proceeding\u201d \u2014 they merely occurred at times</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>that followed the commencement of proceedings within the division of dispute resolution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The insurer\u2019s second argument is similarly unavailing. The administrative judge, having concluded (incorrectly, as we have determined) that \u201c[t]he \u2018proceeding\u2019 in this case began when [the employee] filed his claim, and will not end until he ceases to be involved in the worker\u2019s compensation system,\u201d made no findings whether the employee contributed to the production of false evidence, as the board noted. Moreover, given the fact that the employee had acknowledged his New Hampshire employment at the conference before the administrative judge in August, 1993, one would be hard pressed to conclude that, by failing to disclose the New Hampshire employment to the impartial medical examiner in January, 1994, the employee was attempting to place before the judge false or misleading evidence about his employment history. See <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass, at 258. Nor is there any indication that the impartial medical examiner was misled in his evaluation of the employee\u2019s medical condition or capacity to work by reason of the employee\u2019s failure to disclose his (then-terminated) New Hampshire employment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We agree with the board\u2019s conclusion that the employee did not participate in the creation of evidence he knew to be false, within the meaning of \u00a7 14(2).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\"><em>Recoupment. </em>The board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>recoupment order, finding that, absent a new complaint filed by the insurer pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11D(3) of the Act, the judge was without authority to order the recoupment sua sponte. In reversing the recoupment order, the board construed \u00a7 11D(3) of the Act to require a separate complaint for any order of recoupment in an amount greater than an insurer is authorized to deduct unilaterally from weekly benefit payments. Section 11D(3) (set out in the margin)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> allows an insurer unilaterally to reduce prospective weekly benefit payments by up to thirty per cent to recover overpayments indicated in a decision of an administrative judge. Recoupment in a larger amount (or by means other than offset) \u201cmay be ordered pursuant to the filing of a complaint pursuant to section ten [of the Act].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">In reversing the decision of the administrative judge, the board construed the permissive \u201cmay\u201d as a mandatory term, concluding that a separate complaint following entry of the administrative judge\u2019s decision is the only means to authorize recoupment in amounts greater than thirty per cent of the weekly benefits. We construe \u201cmay,\u201d as appearing in \u00a7 11D(3), in its ordinary, permissive, sense; we conclude that the Legislature intended only to specify one permissible means for recoupment of overpayments in circumstances where the administrative judge\u2019s decision declared such overpayments to exist without providing for their recoupment. Cf. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Water Commrs., Fire Dist. No. 1, S. Hadley, </em>411 Mass. 744, 751-752 (1992) (use of \u201cmay\u201d in statute authorizing assessment of water charges to condominium association was permissive rather than mandatory, and did not preclude other assessment systems).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">\u201cAn insurer that has paid compensation pursuant to a conference order, shall, upon receipt of a decision of an administrative judge or a court of the commonwealth which indicates that overpayments have been made be entitled to recover such overpayments by unilateral reduction of weekly benefits, by no more than thirty percent per week, of any remaining compensation owed the employee. Where overpayments have been made that cannot be recovered in this manner, recoupment may be ordered pursuant to the filing of a complaint pursuant to section ten or by bringing an action against the employee in superior court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Considered in its entirety, the limitation in \u00a7 11D(3) appears directed at the scope of an insurer\u2019s <em>unilateral </em>right to reduce weekly benefit payments where the administrative judge finds overpayment but does not address recoupment. Compare <em>Murphy\u2019s Case, ante </em>424, 430 (2001) (declining to order recoupment on appeal, where administrative judge did not order recoupment in underlying decision). In such circumstances, a new \u00a7 10 complaint would be necessary to bring the matter back before the administrative judge. We see no reason to limit the authority \u00a7 11D(3) confers on administrative judges to order recoupment so as to exclude situations where, as here, the need for recoupment is evident in a pending action initiated by an earlier \u00a7 10 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Furthermore, one of the evident purposes of the 1991 amendments to the Act was to streamline the process of claims administration. See <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Industrial Accs., </em>418 Mass. 165, 170 (1994). We see no benefit to the efficient administration of claims in a rule that would require a separate complaint for recoupment where an administrative judge is able to address the need for recoupment in his determination of a pending claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\"><em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>The board was correct to order the insurer to pay the employee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. The insurer initiated this action with a request to discontinue benefits and subsequently appealed from the administrative judge\u2019s conference order. Section 13A(5) of the Act requires payment of the employee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees if the employee \u201cprevails.\u201d As the employee has successfully defended against the insurer\u2019s request for discontinuance of benefits, the employee is entitled to his attorney\u2019s fees. The fact that the employee\u2019s benefits were reduced does not produce a different result. See <em>Cruz\u2019s Case, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 26, 28-29 (2001). Contrast <em>Green\u2019s Case, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 141, 144 (2001). The insurer\u2019s argument that it should be excused from responsibility for the employee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees by reason of the employee\u2019s violation of \u00a7 14(2) is inapposite, in light of our holding that no violation of \u00a7 14(2) occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment of the single justice is vacated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>The portions of the board\u2019s decision assessing the insurer for the employee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and reversing the administrative judge\u2019s finding of fraud and its associated sanctions are affirmed. That portion of the board\u2019s decision concluding that the administrative judge was without authority to order recoupment sua sponte is reversed. A new judgment shall enter accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b735-6\"> The board also affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s revised determination of the employee\u2019s earning capacity, which resulted in a higher weekly compensation rate of $254.02. The earning capacity calculation has not been challenged on appeal to this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b735-7\"> We note that it was not appropriate both to render a judgment in the case and to report it to a panel. See <em>Alberts </em>v. <em>Devine, </em>395 Mass. 59, 65, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Alberts, </em>474 U.S. 1013 (1985); <em>Ayala </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Authy., </em>404 Mass. 689, 693 (1989), overruled on other grounds by <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Hous. Assistance Program, </em>425 Mass. 79, 85 (1997); Mass.R.Civ.P. 64, as amended, 423 Mass. 1403 (1996); Mass.R.A.P. 5, as amended, 378 Mass. 930 (1979). Our rules provide that the parties may appeal a determination of a single justice on the merits, or, without deciding the merits, the single justice may report the case to a panel. See Rule 2:01 of the Appeals Court, as amended, 3 Mass. App. Ct. 805 (1975); Rule 2:02 of the Appeals Court, as amended, 3 Mass. App. Ct. 806 (1975); Rule 2:04 of the Appeals Court, 28 Mass. App. Ct. 1201 (1989); Standing Order of the Appeals Court Governing Appeals from the Industrial Accident Reviewing Board, as amended, 1996. Nonetheless, in light of the parties\u2019 reliance on the report by the single justice, we decide the case as if the decision of the single justice were before us on appeal.
