The officer immediately opened the cell and discovered an eight and one-half inch piece of flat stock unsharpened metal concealed within the newspaper.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a disciplinary hearing the plaintiff was found guilty on two charges relating to the piece of metal, which was admittedly contraband. Following an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>unsuccessful appeal to the superintendent, the plaintiff brought this complaint in the Superior Court challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the guilty findings. The trial judge allowed the superintendent\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In these circumstances, where the hearing officer for the prison could not himself decide whether the plaintiff even had knowledge of the contraband, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">I. <em>Facts. </em>The facts as they were presented and resolved at the disciplinary hearing were as follows: On March 18, 1998, the plaintiff was housed in cell 105 of the \u201cModular Unit\u201d at M.C.I., Cedar Junction, on \u201cAwaiting Action Protective Custody Status.\u201d Inmate Steven Balsavich, also incarcerated at M.C.I., Cedar Junction, was acting as an inmate runner for the Modular Unit. An inmate runner has the responsibility of basic cleaning tasks, as well as passing reading materials among the confined inmates. Officer William Shugrue happened to visit the Modular Unit that day, and upon entering the area, he noticed Balsavich kneeling on a folded newspaper and speaking to an inmate in cell 101. After noticing Officer Shugrue\u2019s entrance, Balsavich stood up with newspaper in hand, and began walking away from cell 101. Officer Shugrue, who had written a disciplinary report on Balsavich for possession of a weapon prior to this incident, summoned Balsavich to come and speak with him. Before complying with Officer Shugrue\u2019s request, Balsavich passed in front of cell 105, occupied by the plaintiff, and deposited the newspaper through a slot in the door apparently intended for food trays. According to Shugrue\u2019s report, he saw Balsavich \u201chand\u201d the plaintiff a folded newspaper which the plaintiff placed on the floor. By contrast, in the hearing officer\u2019s \u201cStatement of Evidence Relied Upon to Support Findings,\u201d Officer Shugrue is only reported to have clearly observed the plaintiff \u201creceive\u201d this item from another inmate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">After seeing Balsavich pass the newspaper through the slot, Officer Shugrue immediately opened the plaintiff\u2019s cell and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>picked the newspaper up off the floor. Upon inspection, Officer Shugrue found within the folds of the newspaper an eight and one-half inch piece of flat stock unsharpened metal. The plaintiff denied any knowledge of, or intent to possess, the contraband. Further, Balsavich, in an affidavit, admitted his knowledge of the contraband and made exculpatory statements concerning the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Later that day, Officer Shugrue filed a disciplinary report accusing the plaintiff of violating 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.24(2), (15), and (33) (1993).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This report designated the offenses as \u201cMajor.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A disciplinary hearing was held on April 7, 1998, at which the evidence submitted consisted of Officer Shugrue\u2019s testimony, his typed disciplinary report, the affidavit of inmate Balsavich, and the plaintiff\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The hearing officer found the plaintiff guilty of weapon possession, 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.24(15), and the attempt provision in 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.24(33). The violation considered under 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.24(2) was dismissed as being duplicative. The decision was \u201cpredicated on the written report of Officer Shugrue coupled with his oral summation.\u201d The hearing officer found: \u201cThe inmate, of his own volition, had in his possession an 8V2 inch weapon. Though irrespective of intent, it has been irrefutably established that this individual accepted this weapon (albeit concealed within a newspaper) from another inmate .... Though it cannot be independently established that this individual had personal knowledge of the weapon in question; nevertheless Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Shugrue reports that he clearly observed Inmate Jordan receive this item from another inmate.\u201d Furthermore, the affidavit submitted by Balsavich \u201cwas given its just review\u201d but was deemed to be without \u201cany . . . substantive merit.\u201d As a result of the guilty determination, the plaintiff\u2019s television, radio, canteen, and telephone privileges were suspended for six weeks.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The plaintiff appealed the hearing officer\u2019s guilty findings to the Superintendent of M.C.I., Cedar Junction, who denied the appeal. The plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court challenging the guilty findings of his disciplinary hearing. The defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion was allowed by the trial judge without a hearing. Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(b), 365 Mass. 824 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">II. <em>Discussion. </em>The plaintiff, appearing pro se, brings this action in the nature of certiorari pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Supp. 1999).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Walpole, </em>392 Mass. 198, 199 n.2 (1984), reversed on other grounds, 472 U.S. 445 (1985); <em>Wightman </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Walpole, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 442, 444 (1985). \u201cWhere inmates challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to justify a disciplinary board\u2019s decision, we apply the substantial evidence test . . . .\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Cedar Junction, </em>396 Mass. 830, 833 (1986). <em>Puleio </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 302, 305 (2001). See <em>Mayor of Revere </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 315, 321-322 (1991). Substantial evidence is evidence that \u201c \u2018a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\u2019 . . . taking into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Cepulonis </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 292, 296 (1983), quoting from <em>Trustees of Forbes Library </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>384 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Mass. 559, 568-569 (1981). It is also the \u201cboard\u2019s exclusive function to weigh the credibility of the witnesses and to resolve factual disputes between [the inmate\u2019s] testimony and that of the correction officer[].\u201d <em>Id </em>at 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The <em>Cepulonis </em>case presents an instructive application of the methodology for reviewing the sufficiency of evidence justifying a disciplinary board\u2019s decision regarding possession of contraband in prison. In that case, two correction officers were conducting a routine check of an inmate\u2019s room when they came across screwdrivers, wire cutters, pipe sections, and other contraband. <em>Id. </em>at 293-294. The prison disciplinary board found Cepulonis guilty of possessing escape equipment. <em>Id. </em>at 292. On appeal, he argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that certain items were actually escape equipment, or to show that he possessed the items that were found hidden in a window frame. <em>Id. </em>at 294. In that case, this court found it appropriate for the prison disciplinary board to \u201clook at the entire situation, in the context of the prison environment, to decide whether materials were being amassed which might aid an escape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 294. The court held that \u201cthe board could infer, based on the nature and probable use of the items seized,</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">. . . [the inmate\u2019s] admission to possession of the other contraband discovered, and the length of time he had occupied the room, that [the inmate] knew of, and had control over, the [contraband items].\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Puleio </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. at 305-306 (in case in which inmate claimed he could not be found guilty because he did not knowingly possess solder or intend to evade prison rules, knowledge and intent were inferred from evidence that solder was in the inmate\u2019s jacket, and inmate admitted that he had probably brought tool with him from another correctional institution). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deagle, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 563, 567 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">In this case, unlike <em>Cepulonis, </em>the surrounding facts and the inferences that can be drawn from them regarding knowledge of, and control over the contraband are murky at best, given (1) the concealment of the metal in the newspaper, (2) the deposit of the newspaper into the cell by an inmate runner, whose responsibilities included delivering the mail, (3) the lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>clarity in the hearing officer\u2019s findings concerning whether the plaintiff ever handled the newspaper, (4) Shugrue\u2019s immediate entry into the cell and removal of the metal, and (5) Balsavich\u2019s own reasons for disposing of the weapon quickly and surreptitiously to avoid discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">We are mindful that where \u201cthe testimony before the board could lead to different inferences, \u2018[a] court may not displace . . . [the] board\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views ....\u2019\u201d <em>Cepulonis, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. at 295, quoting from <em>Labor Relations Commn. </em>v. <em>University Hosp., Inc., </em>359 Mass. 516, 521 (1971). If the hearing officer, based on his own credibility determinations and review of \u201cthe entire situation [] in the context of the prison environment\u201d found that the plaintiff had knowledge of, and control over the weapon, this court would be bound to show great deference to that decision. <em>Cepulonis, supra </em>at 294-295. Contrast <em>Wightman </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Walpole, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. at 446-447 (uninformed belief that inmate possessed \u201cAngel Dust\u201d was insufficient to affirm summary judgment in favor of Department of Correction).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Here, however, the hearing officer made no such finding. He purported to find that the plaintiff chose, apparently by accepting or at least receiving the newspaper from the runner, to have the weapon in his \u201cpossession.\u201d He was not, however, prepared to conclude that the plaintiff intended to receive the piece of metal or even that he knew he had received it. Furthermore, the hearing officer did not decide how the plaintiff received the newspaper, i.e., was it put in his hand or just dropped through the slot. The plaintiff\u2019s handling of the newspaper, if it had been found to occur, might have supported a finding of greater interaction with the other inmate and perhaps knowledge or at least suspicion based on the weight of the object. This omission is of some significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">In sum, we conclude that there was not sufficient evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge of, and control over, the piece of metal to discipline him for possession of contraband. Where the evidence is so limited and problematic that the prison officials themselves could not, even based on their knowledge of the inmates and the institution and the attendant facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>circumstances, find that the plaintiff had knowledge of the weapon, we do not defer to the prison officials\u2019 decision to discipline the plaintiff for possession of contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The judgment in favor of the defendant is vacated. Within thirty days of the issuance of the rescript, the defendant will inform the judge of the Superior Court whether he proposes to reinstitute a hearing before a disciplinary board to offer additional proof. <em>Wightman </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Walpole, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. at 447. If not, the plaintiff may move for relief, including expungement of the disciplinary report, the hearing officer\u2019s decision, and all references thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-15\"> How the plaintiff received the newspaper is, as explained below, unclear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\"> The trial judge notes that \u201cthere is a conflicting view on the manner the newspaper, entered into the possession of the plaintiff. The testimony of Officer Shugrue at the hearing states that Balsavich \u2018handed\u2019 the newspaper to plaintiff. The D-report states that Balsavich placed the newspaper on the floor of the plaintiff\u2019s cell.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b610-6\"> The disciplinary offenses that the plaintiff was charged with under 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.24 were: \u201c(2) Violating any departmental rule or regulation, or any other rule, regulation, or condition of an institution or community based program\u201d; \u201c(15) Possession, manufacture, or introduction of a gun, firearm, explosive, ammunition, weapon, sharpened instrument, knife or tool\u201d; and \u201c(33) Attempting to commit any of the above offenses, making plans to commit any of the above offenses or aiding another person to commit any of the above offenses shall be considered the same as the commission of the offense itself.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\"> According to 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 430.09(4) (1993): \u201cIn designating the offense as a minor or major matter, the disciplinary officer may consider the following factors: (a) Threat to institutional security; (b) Repetitiveness; (c) Extent of harm done; and (d) Mitigating circumstances.\u201d The proceedings in a \u201cMajor\u201d matter are held pursuant to 103 Mass. Code Regs. \u00a7 430.11 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b611-7\"> Ancillary implications of this guilty finding referenced by the plaintiff include the possibility that his parole eligibility status could be affected, and restrictions could be placed on work opportunities within the facility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b611-8\"> While 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, is mentioned, the plaintiff fails to develop any argument whatsoever under this statute; therefore, pursuant to Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975), this claim has been effectively waived.
