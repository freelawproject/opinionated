(Wal-Mart), for an 85,000 square foot expansion to an existing 126,000 square foot Wal-Mart store located in the Raynham Woods Commerce Center, off Route 44 in Raynham. The plaintiff, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>is not an abutter, resides on Hill Street, approximately one mile from the expansion site. His objections to the permit stem from his concern about the impact of increased traffic in his neighborhood, particularly at the intersection of Hill Street and Route 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The plaintiff addresses three issues on appeal. As a threshold matter, he attempts to guard his flank by arguing that the Superior Court correctly concluded that he has standing to challenge the board\u2019s grant of the special permit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He then claims that the Superior Court should have invalidated the special permit because the board unlawfully delegated its decision-making authority to the town\u2019s planning board. Finally, he contends that the Superior Court should not have sustained the board\u2019s grant of the special permit because it was based on \u201cunreasonable and untenable grounds.\u201d Because we conclude that the plaintiff lacks standing to prosecute this appeal, we do not reach his arguments on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17, only \u201cpersons aggrieved\u201d have standing to appeal a decision of a zoning board or other special permit granting authority. Although the plaintiff is not a \u201cparty in interest\u201d as set forth in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 11, and therefore does not enjoy the rebuttable presumption of standing which is conferred upon such parties, see <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Corporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, </em>434 Mass. 141, 145-146 (2001), he nevertheless may qualify as a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d if he has put forth credible evidence to substantiate a claim of injury to his legal rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>which is more than speculative. See <em>Marashlian </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Newburyport, </em>421 Mass. 719, 721-722 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The trial judge found that the plaintiff used the intersection of Hill Street and Route 44 \u201con a regular basis\u201d and that there was credible evidence that the Wal-Mart expansion would result in at least some increase in traffic on Route 44. The judge then concluded that under the \u201cexpansive nature of standing set forth in Marashlian,\u201d he \u201cmust address the merits of the [plaintiff\u2019s] claim.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial judge\u2019s findings do not, however, address a separate and essential element of standing: that is, whether the plaintiff\u2019s injury is particularized, or, stated contextually, whether the plaintiff\u2019s traffic concerns are special and different from those of the rest of the community. See <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>429 Mass. 551, 554 (1999); <em>Harvard Square Legal Defense Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Cambridge, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 491, 493-494 (1989); <em>Barvenik </em>v. <em>Board of Aldermen of Newton, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 129, 132 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Although standing is \u201cessentially a question of fact for the trial judge,\u201d which will be reversed only if \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d <em>Marashlian, supra </em>at 721-722, we must \u201cscrutinize without deference the legal standard which the judge applied to the facts,\u201d to ensure that the ultimate findings and conclusions are consistent with the law. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Resolution GGF Oy, </em>417 Mass. 377, 382 (1994). Because the judge did not address the element of particularized injury, it is unclear whether his ultimate finding that the plaintiff made out a credible claim of injury was the product of correct legal analysis. However, it does not matter for our purposes whether the question before us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>is one of law or of fact, because we conclude that the proof of particularized injury is so slim that even under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard, the finding of standing cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">The evidence bearing on this issue can be summarized as follows. The plaintiff resides about a mile from Wal-Mart with his wife, his four children, his mother, and his sister and his sister\u2019s three children. His 18-acre parcel abuts neither the existing Wal-Mart property nor the additional land which is intended to be sold to Wal-Mart in connection with the proposed expansion. There are several intervening intersections and other traffic-generating businesses on Route 44 between the locus and the plaintiff\u2019s street. When the plaintiff leaves his home, he usually takes Hill Street a short distance north to Route 44. If he is heading toward Wal-Mart, he must make a left turn on Route 44, which is difficult to do because of the heavy stream of traffic. Sometimes he avoids this problem by making a right turn and later turning around to go in the other direction, or by taking a more circuitous route to emerge at another intersection with Route 44 where he can take advantage of a traffic signal. An even bigger challenge, according to the plaintiff, is driving on Hill Street across to the other side of Route 44, where his children\u2019s schools and playing fields are located. To address these difficulties, the plaintiff would like to see the special permit conditioned on a traffic light being installed at the intersection of Hill Street and Route 44. However, he does not dispute that a traffic signal warrant study found that a signal at this intersection is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">While the plaintiff undoubtedly is inconvenienced by the heavy traffic on Route 44 and understandably would like his concerns to be addressed by the town, this evidence is an insufficient predicate for finding that he is a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d by the granting of the special permit. Individuals acquire standing by asserting \u201ca plausible claim of a definite violation of a private right, a private property interest, or a private legal interest,\u201d as distinct from a claim that involves a matter of general public interest. <em>Harvard Square Defense Fund, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Cambridge, supra </em>at 492-493. Here, the plaintiff\u2019s interest is not substantially different from that of all of the other members of the community who are frustrated and inconve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>nienced by heavy traffic on Route 44. If anything, the one-mile distance between his home and the locus, as well as the existence of intervening intersections between the locus and Hill Street, suggest that his concern about increased traffic due to the Wal-Mart expansion may be far less acute than that of many other town citizens. See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Authy., </em>374 Mass. 37, 63 &amp; n.17 (1977) (expressing \u201cgrave doubts about granting standing\u201d to a nonabutter whose property interest was one-third of a mile from the site). Compare <em>Marashlian, supra </em>(abutters had standing based upon their use of public street parking to meet their business and personal needs and their fear of increased traffic and decreased public parking availability due to the development of a hotel across the street).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In short, the plaintiff does not qualify as an aggrieved person under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. Because the plaintiff did not meet an essential prerequisite to judicial review of the zoning board\u2019s decision, the case should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b705-7\"> Even though he prevailed on this point below, the plaintiff correctly perceives that standing remains a live issue on appeal. Although the defendants did not cross appeal from the judge\u2019s decision insofar as it found standing, they are not precluded from arguing, as they do here, that lack of standing provides an alternative ground for affirmance. See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Authy., </em>374 Mass. 37, 42-43 (1977). Furthermore, the issue of standing is said to be \u201cjurisdictional\u201d in the sense that the plaintiff\u2019s status as an \u201caggrieved person\u201d is an essential prerequisite to judicial review under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. See <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Plymouth, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 619, 620 (1993). It has therefore been suggested that the existence of standing may be considered by the court at any stage of the case, including on appeal, whether or not disputed by the parties. See Bobrowski, The Zoning Act\u2019s \u201cPerson Aggrieved\u201d Standard: From <em>Barvenik </em>to <em>Marashlian, </em>18 Western New England L. Rev. 385, 396-397 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b706-6\"> Ultimately, however, the judge determined that the proposed Wal-Mart expansion would result in an increase in traffic on Route 44 of less than two percent, with minimal impact on intersection operations and queues. He therefore concluded that the decision of the zoning board should stand. See generally <em>Subaru of New England, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Canton, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 483, 486-487 (1979) (describing function of trial court in reviewing special permit decision). We recognize that the judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion on the merits does not necessarily defeat the plaintiff\u2019s claim of injury to his legal rights. <em>Marashlian, supra </em>at 723. We also recognize that traffic concerns are legitimately within the scope of the zoning laws. <em>Id. </em>at 722. See <em>Circle Lounge &amp; Grille, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>324 Mass. 427, 430 (1949). Nevertheless, we reach a different conclusion on standing from that of the trial judge, for the reasons set forth in the text.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
