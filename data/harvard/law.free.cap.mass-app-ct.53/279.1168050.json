See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 367 (1985). We turn to the affidavit which is set forth in relevant part in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On January 28, 1999, the affiant, an experienced detective with the Boston police department, sought a warrant for the second-floor residence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>other specified areas at 21 Montvale Street, in the Roslindale area of Boston. He had, within the last two hours, received information from an informant, referred to as \u201cX,\u201d \u201cwhose whereabouts and identity [were] known\u201d to him, but who wished to remain anonymous. X told the affiant that he had \u201cobserved six rifles, three shotguns, two rifles, and one air pellet rifle\u201d at the locus, and that there were two people currently in the house, one called Ricky, who lived there with his parents, and the other named Alfonso. Their last names were unknown to the informant and he believed that \u201cthe parents\u201d (not identified) were not then at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">X also told the affiant that Alfonso said \u201cthat he took the guns in a Breaking &amp; Entering on the 27th of January, 1999, in West Roxbury.\u201d X stated that Ricky was going to put the guns in a black bag and place them in the garage, and that Alfonso \u201cwas making several phone calls\u201d to find a buyer. Alfonso was asking three to four hundred dollars for each weapon and had scheduled a meeting with two prospective buyers later in the evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">The affiant asserted that in fact there had been a breaking and entering at 24 Chestnut Street, in the West Roxbury section of Boston, on January 27, 1999, in which three 12 gouge shotguns, two 20 gouge shotguns, and a pellet gun were taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">The warrant issued and was executed that evening, at which time numerous guns were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">Recognizing correctly that Massachusetts adheres to the \u201ctwo pronged test\u201d of <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108 (1964), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number><em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410 (1969), see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton (Upton </em>I), 390 Mass. 562, 568-571 (1983), rev\u2019d., <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>466 U.S. 727 (1984), <em>S.C., Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 374 (1985) <em>(Upton II),</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>5the motion judge held that both prongs were met. We agree as to the first prong. Not only did X personally observe specific kinds of guns,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> i.e., rifles, shotguns, and an air pellet gun, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>406 Mass. 575, 578 (1990) (\u201cFirsthand receipt of information through personal observation satisfies the basis of knowledge prong\u201d), but he also heard Alfonso state that he had taken the guns in a breaking and entering on January 27, 1999, in West Roxbury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lapine, </em>410 Mass. 38, 41 (1991) (hearing a conversation satisfies the basis of knowledge prong); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>410 Mass. 75, 78-79 (1991) (basis of knowledge test satisfied by defendant\u2019s telling informant of plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The difficulty lies with the veracity test. None of the common bases for determining reliability is present: the affidavit does not mention successful past performance of the informant, or suggest that he or she made a statement against penal interest, or that the informer is \u201can ordinary citizen\u201d who provided informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>tian as a witness to a crime. See <em>Upton I, </em>390 Mass, at 569-570, and cases cited. In reaching his conclusion that the veracity prong had been satisfied, the motion judge relied on the following: (1) X had provided details which included the type and number of guns, where they had been obtained, and the plan for disposing of them; (2) similar guns had been stolen in a breaking and entering, thus \u201cessentially corroborat[ing]\u201d X\u2019s information; and, (3) X\u2019s reliability was bolstered by the fact that the affiant policeman knew X\u2019s identity and whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">We recognize that \u201c[a]n affidavit for a search warrant . . . \u2018must be tested and interpreted by magistrates and courts in a commonsense and realistic fashion. . . . [T]he resolution of doubtful or marginal cases in this area should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Germain, </em>396 Mass. 413, 418 (1985), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 108-109 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Nevertheless, in this case, each of the three considerations relied on by the motion judge is weak, and, even in combination, when the affidavit is read as a whole, the reliability of the information remains unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">a. The degree of detail is not impressive; indeed, assuming the affidavit is taken to mean that the informant saw six rather than twelve guns,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> his claimed observation of \u201csix rifles, three shotguns, two rifles, and one air pellet rifle,\u201d while adequate to satisfy the basis of knowledge prong, is not sufficiently accurate or specific to be \u201cself-verifying.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rojas, </em>403 Mass. 483, 487 (1988). The informant\u2019s description of the guns does not match the detailed description of the items stolen, namely, three 12-gouge shotguns, two 20-gouge shotguns, and a pellet gun. Compare the detailed and corroborated description in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Germain, 396 </em>Mass, at 418 (1985).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, here, \u201cthe informant did not provide particularized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>distinguishing characteristics of the . . . apartment, possessions, or activities.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rojas, </em>403 Mass, at 487. He did not even know the last names of the persons in the apartment.* ***<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Moreover, this court has questioned the notion that detail, alone, uncorroborated by police investigation, is an indication of veracity. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliveira, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 645, 648 (1993). In that case, Justice Kaplan, writing for the court, quoted from <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>State, </em>19 Md. App. 507, 533 (1974), with approval: \u201cIf the informant were concocting a story out of the whole cloth, he could fabricate in fine detail as easily as with rough brush strokes. Minute detail tells us nothing about \u2018veracity.\u2019 \u201d See Grasso &amp; McEvoy, Suppression Matters Under Massachusetts Law, \u00a7\u00a7 10-4(c), 10-5(b) (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">In sum, the details that satisfied the basis of knowledge test fell short of bolstering the informant\u2019s veracity. See <em>Upton I, </em>390 Mass, at 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">b. What details there were were not significantly enhanced by police investigation. True, there was here some corroboration. A robbery had taken place on January 27th in West Roxbury and five shotguns and a pellet gun had been stolen. But the circumstances related in the affidavit did not lend credibility to the informant. Where there has been a robbery or other criminal conduct and an informant provides facts which are not publicly known or shows knowledge of criminal \u25a0 behavior before the police are aware of the crime, the likelihood that the information is false is reduced. See 2 LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 3.3(f), at 170 (3d ed. 1996) &amp; at 19 (2002 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Our cases, and cases elsewhere, accord credibility in such circumstances. Thus, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Germain, </em>396 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>at 415-418, after listing other factors tending to show the reliability of the informant\u2019s disclosure about the robbery,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the court pointed to the detailed description of the items given by the informant which, police investigation confirmed, matched the detailed description given by the victims. Although the court did not specifically so state, it was most unlikely that knowledge about the items described as observed by the informant, a brown suede mask and a gray-colored handgun with rust spots on the top of the barrel, had been revealed to the public. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>See also the following cases where knowledge of unique details corroborated by police investigation supported the informant\u2019s credibility. <em>Yielding </em>v. <em>State, </em>371 So. 2d 951, 957 (Ala. Cr. App. 1979), cert, denied, <em>Ex parte Yielding, </em>371 So. 2d 962 (Ala. 1979)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeffcoat, </em>403 So. 2d 1227, 1229-1230 (La. 1981) (court noted that some items described by the informant, and confirmed by police as having been taken in two different burglaries, were \u201cunusual,\u201d e.g., a rug [in fact, a tapestry] showing deer drinking from a stream and an \u201cold time\u201d cap and ball pistol); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>836 S.W.2d 560, 562-563 (Tenn. 1992) (unique charm from a bracelet in the shape of a gold outhouse with a little man sitting inside was described by both the informant and the victim); <em>People </em>v. <em>Conwell, </em>649 P.2d 1099, 1101 (Colo. 1982), overruled on other grounds by <em>People </em>v. <em>Quintata, </em>785 P.2d 934, 937 (Colo. 1990) (court abandoned <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test and adopted totality of the circumstances test set forth in <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 238 [1983]) (informant\u2019s description of stolen stereo equipment as Technic, Pioneer and several other brands was confirmed by victim). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>320 N.W.2d 432, 434-436 (Minn. 1982) (informant\u2019s description of large quantities of pharmaceutical bottles of Dilaudid and Preludin was accorded weight, with other factors, to establish the informant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>truthfulness). See also cases where the informant had knowledge of a crime before the police did, e.g., <em>Harrelson </em>v. <em>State, </em>516 P.2d 390, 395 (Alaska 1973) (bad check); <em>State </em>v. <em>Daley, </em>189 Conn. 717, 724 (1983) (theft), or where the informant had knowledge of the modus operand! of a thief in three burglaries, but the modus operand! was known only to the perpetrator and investigating officers. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>96 N.M. 14, 15-16 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">In situations where the description or other information obtained from the informant is likely to be known by others, the information is not accorded similar reliability. Thus in <em>Upton I, </em>390 Mass, at 572-573, the court did not find sufficient reliability in an affidavit (reproduced in part at 564, n.2) containing the following averments. Police, on September 11, 1980, at about 12 noon, raided a motel room reserved by a Richard Kelleher and found credit cards of two persons who had reported recent thefts of a large quantity of gold and silver jewelry. At 3:20 p.m., some three hours after the beginning of the raid, an unidentified female called police, said she had seen stolen items including gold and silver jewelry in a motor home behind the home of George Upton, that Upton had purchased these stolen items from Ricky Kelleher, and that Upton was going to move the motor home because Kelleher\u2019s motel room had been raided. Although the informant knew of the police raid shortly after it had taken place, the court held the veracity prong unsatisfied. A search of the motor home was not warranted \u201cbased on a telephone tip from an anonymous informer who told a story connecting [the motor home] with the fact of a recent police search of a third person\u2019s room <em>on premises to which the public had </em>access.\u201d 390 Mass, at 573. (Emphasis supplied). The court repeated the fact of public access to the motel in <em>Upton II, </em>394 Mass, at 378, thus laying stress on the fact that the reliability of the tip could not be inferred from the circumstance that the informant knew that a third person\u2019s motel room had been raided. The public nature of the motel prevented the informant\u2019s knowledge from being sufficiently unique to be reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In the present case, too, veracity cannot be inferred from the fact that the informant knew of a recent robbery and that six guns of varying description had been stolen. \u201cThis information could indeed have been heard at a neighborhood bar, or pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>sibly, could have been heard on a local news broadcast, or could have been read in the paper. More substantial verification is required.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Greer, </em>87 Ill. 2d 89, 94 (1981), overruled in part by <em>People </em>v. <em>Tisler, </em>103 Ill. 2d 226, 243-246 (1984) (adopting <em>Gates </em>test) (discussing basis of knowledge prong).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">c. Nor is the veracity prong significantly enhanced by the affiant\u2019s assertion that he received information from a source \u201cwhose whereabouts and identity are known to me and who wishes to remain anonymous.\u201d While the \u201cstrict requirements of reliability ... are relaxed with respect to named and identified sources,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freiberg, </em>405 Mass. 282, 297, cert, denied, 493 U.S. 940 (1989), the scant description of the officer\u2019s contact with the informant \u201cmade this informant barely distinguishable from an anonymous tipster.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grinkley, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 62, 69 (1997). The affiant did not specify, nor can it be inferred, whether his knowledge of the identity of the informant was based on a telephone call or a personal meeting. \u201c\u00a1AJnyone can claim over the telephone to be a particular individual with impunity if that claim cannot be verified.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Upton I, </em>390 Mass, at 570 (informant treated as anonymous even though the officer told her over the phone that he knew who she was and the informant admitted she was that person).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grinkley, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. at 69, despite the informant\u2019s providing the police with her name and address, she was considered to be akin to an anonymous individual as her stated identity could not be verified; she had not left a telephone number and presumably could not be reached by .the police. The vague averment here that the affiant knew the identity and \u201cwhereabouts\u201d of the informant \u201cwho wishe[d] to remain anonymous,\u201d without any indication that he knew the name of the informant and that he could readily reach him or her, suggests even greater inaccessibility than the address found insufficient in <em>Grinkley. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melendez, </em>407 Mass. 53, 58 n.4 (1990). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>435 Mass. 171, 177 n.7 (2001), and the concurring opinion of Justice Sosman at 181-182 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Even where an informant is \u201cnamed\u201d and his address is given, that is but one factor to be weighed. See <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>v. <em>Atchue, </em>393 Mass. 343, 347 (1984). As carefully set out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grinkley, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. at 68-69, reviewing the authorities, our cases considering the reliability of a tip strengthened when given by a named and identified informant had significant other factors supporting the informant\u2019s reliability. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>420 Mass. 646, 652 (1995), and in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Va Meng Joe, </em>425 Mass. 99, 103-104 (1997), cases relied on by the Commonwealth, not only did the affiants identify the informants by name and address, or show they were reachable, but more importantly, the informants had accurately predicted the behavior of the respective defendants, a circumstance of \u201cspecial significance when determining the reliability of an informant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104. In sum, since the circumstances set forth in the affidavit were insufficient to show that the informant was credible or the information reliable, the physical evidence seized should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">2. <em>Motion to suppress statements. </em>We take our facts, essentially uncontested, from the motion judge\u2019s<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> findings, supplemented by uncontroverted testimony adduced at the suppression hearing. At 4:45 p.m. on January 28, 1999, escorted by an aunt or grandmother of \u201cRicky,\u201d see note 3, <em>supra, </em>who had let them in, four or five police officers of the Boston police department entered and secured the second floor apartment of 21 Montvale Street, Roslindale, in anticipation of the arrival of the search warrant. Detective Luis Cruz was the first officer to enter. His gun was drawn, but at his side. There were four persons in the apartment: the juvenile; Richard McMann, the son of Charlotte Cahill (the lessee of the apartment); and two others. After the four were pat frisked for weapons, preliminary inquiries revealed that two of the persons were wanted on outstanding arrest warrants. The two were arrested and taken to a police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The police, the juvenile, and McMann waited two and one-half hours before the officers received information that the warrant was on route. During this period, Charlotte Cahill and McMann\u2019s stepfather returned home from work.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>While the officer awaited the warrant, McMann and the juvenile were asked to sit on the couch. Although they were not handcuffed, they were not free to leave. The juvenile was not allowed to go to the bathroom alone and was accompanied there by Detective Cruz. He was not informed that he could make a phone call, and the police did not call his mother. The parties stipulated that she was at home and that the juvenile\u2019s uncle and grandmother were also available.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">At about 7:15 p.m., after receiving confirmation that the warrant was on the way, Detective Cruz and another detective began their interviews, first questioning McMann and then the juvenile. As McMann was being taken to .an empty bedroom for questioning, his mother, Charlotte Cahill, approached the officers and asked whether she could be present during the interview and whether McMann should have an attorney present. Cruz responded that since McMann was an adult (he was eighteen), the choice of whether he wanted his mother present, or wanted an attorney, was up to him. McMann stated that he did not want his mother to be present during the interview. This discussion took place in front of the juvenile who was still seated on the living room sofa.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">After finishing their interview with McMann, the two detectives escorted the juvenile into the bedroom. Cruz confirmed his date of birth (November 14, 1983), indicating he was fifteen years old. After reading the warnings required by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 479 (1966), Cruz asked the juvenile whether he wanted to have his mother brought to him so she could be present during the questioning or whether he wished to consult with another interested adult, suggesting that McMann\u2019s mother and two other adults were available in the kitchen. Cruz asked this question on three separate occasions, and each time the juvenile stated that he did not want to consult with an interested adult and did not want his mother present during the interview. He stated that he had been arrested twice before and that he understood his rights.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> After waiving his rights, he admitted that he had broken into a house in West Roxbury and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>that five or six guns were taken and the guns were now at 21 Montvale Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">After setting forth the foregoing facts (as supplemented), the judge found (1) that the juvenile was fifteen years old at the time of his arrest; and (2) was the subject of custodial interrogation. He made the following additional \u201cfindings\u201d.and then denied the motion to suppress the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u201c(3) The juvenile, (name), was afforded a meaningful opportunity to consult with an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u201c(4) The juvenile, (name), declined to have his mother or any other interested adult present during his interrogation after being repeatedly informed that he had a right to have an interested adult present.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u201c(5) The juvenile, (name), did- knowingly and intelligently waive his Miranda Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">\u201c(6) The totality of the circumstances surrounding the waiver of his Miranda Rights reveal the waiver was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">\u201c(7) The waiver of his Miranda Rights [was] in no way coerced by the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">In reviewing the motion judge\u2019s decision, we accept his subsidiary findings of fact, but make an independent determination of the correctness of his application of constitutional principles to the facts as found. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>389 Mass, at 135. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>410 Mass. 31, 34 (1991). Not only does the Commonwealth have \u201ca heavy burden in demonstrating that a \u2018defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to . . . counsel,\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>389 Mass, at 135 (internal citations omitted), but here, \u201cwhere the defendant is a juvenile, courts must proceed with \u2018special caution\u2019 when reviewing purported waivers of constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>410 Mass, at 34. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Philip S., </em>414 Mass. 804, 808 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">The leading Massachusetts case setting forth the requirements for a valid waiver of rights of a juvenile under the Fifth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>ment to the United States Constitution is <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>389 Mass. 128 (1983), where at 134, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">\u201c[F]or the Commonwealth successfully to demonstrate a knowing and intelligent waiver by a juvenile, in most cases it should show that a parent or an interested adult was present, understood the warnings, and had the opportunity to explain his rights to the juvenile so that the juvenile understands the significance of waiver of these rights. For the purpose of obtaining the waiver, in the case of juveniles who are under the age of fourteen, we conclude that no waiver can be effective without this added protection. . . . For cases involving a juvenile who has reached the age of fourteen,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> there should ordinarily be a meaningful consultation with the parent, interested adult, or attorney to ensure that the waiver is knowing and intelligent. For a waiver to be valid without such a consultation the circumstances should demonstrate a high degree of intelligence, experience, knowledge, or sophistication on the part of the juvenile.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Subsequent cases have instructed that it is \u201cthe juvenile\u2019s opportunity to consult that is critical, not whether he avails himself of it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacNeill, </em>399 Mass. 71, 78 (1987). Such opportunity, however, must be \u201cwith an interested adult who was <em>informed of, </em>and understood,\u201d the constitutional rights. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>410 Mass, at 35 (emphasis supplied). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>426 Mass. 424, 430 (1998). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCra, </em>427 Mass. 564, 567 (1998). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leon L., </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 823, 826-827 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">This is a significant requirement. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guyton, </em>405 Mass. 497, 500-502 (1989), held that the protections required to be accorded juveniles could not be satisfied if the \u201cadvisor\u201d (the defendant\u2019s sister) was herself a minor, thirteen days shy of her eighteenth birthday. The court noted that, even if the sister had been eighteen, the court had \u201cserious reservations about whether the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, including [the sister\u2019s] testimony that she \u2018understood\u2019 the Miranda warnings, was enough to demonstrate that [the sister\u2019s] understanding was adequate to qualify her to advise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>defendant about so crucial a question as whether he should relinquish his constitutional rights to remain silent and have counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502 n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Here, the juvenile\u2019s mother was not even made aware of her son\u2019s interrogation, let alone \u201cinformed of and made to understand\u201d the juvenile\u2019s constitutional rights the Commonwealth claims were waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Implicit in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>410 Mass, at 35, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>426 Mass, at 430, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCra, </em>427 Mass, at 566, is the assumption that the interested adult will be present at the interrogation area if not at the interrogation itself.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See generally Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 372 (2d. ed. 1983 &amp; 2001 Supp.). Such presence is surely the favored practice and should be facilitated by the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We are buttressed in this conclusion by the policy expressed in G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 67, which requires the \u201cimmediate\u201d notification of a parent by the police \u201cwhenever a child between seven and seventeen is arrested,\u201d and authorizes the police officer in charge of the police station to \u201cinquire into the case.\u201d By providing that \u201c[p]ending such notice and inquiry, such child shall be detained,\u201d the statute indicates that question<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>ing should not proceed until such notification has taken place. While we have not considered whether the lengthy detention of the juvenile was in effect an arrest, we see no reason why the policy considerations of \u00a7 67 should not here apply. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>346 Mass. 9, 17 (1963) (violation of G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 67, accompanied by lengthy questioning by police, an important factor in determining whether a confession or admission is voluntary.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Moreover, a juvenile in trouble may be embarrassed to ask for an adult\u2019s help, and this may have been the case here, as the juvenile heard the older youth reject his mother\u2019s presence. Where, as here, the juvenile was detained for two and one-half hours in circumstances in which his mother and other close relatives were available but were not even informed of his detention, the mere asking the juvenile by the police whether he wanted his mother to be brought to him so that he might consult with her did not, we conclude, provide the juvenile with an adequate opportunity to consult.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Nor is the Commonwealth correct that its offer to let the juvenile speak with one of the adults in the apartment was sufficient. There is no basis in the record to conclude that any of the adults present in the apartment qualified as an adult who was informed of and understood the juvenile\u2019s rights. The only adult as to whom there was evidence that she was even known by the defendant was Charlotte Cahill, McMann\u2019s mother. No special relationship of the juvenile to Cahill was shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Our cases involving \u201cinterested adults\u201d have all involved parents or other relatives. Indeed, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCra, </em>427 Mass, at 568, the requirement was characterized as \u201can opportunity for a meaningful consultation with a parent, or an adult acting in loco parentis.\u201d At the very least, the adult should be someone who can be considered \u201cinterested in the defendant\u2019s welfare.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">The Commonwealth argues that even should we determine (as we have) that the juvenile did not have the opportunity to consult with an interested adult, the alternative allowed by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>389 Mass, at 134, applies, namely, the circumstances show the juvenile had the necessary \u201chigh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>degree of intelligence, experience, knowledge or sophistication\u201d to waive his Miranda rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Because of the motion judge\u2019s decision that the Commonwealth had satisfied the first alternative, the opportunity to consult with an interested adult, the judge did not discuss the second question. However, as in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>402 Mass. 275, 280 (1988), \u201cthe omission is not crucial here because there is no evidence in the record that would have warranted\u201d such a finding. The only evidence the Commonwealth points to is the juvenile\u2019s statement to the police that he understood the Miranda warnings because he had been arrested twice before, once for a robbery.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> His previous arrests standing alone do not give him the required knowledge or sophistication. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guyton, </em>405 Mass, at 503, where the court stated:<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">\u201cThe judge\u2019s finding that... the defendant had \u2018extensive contact with the police and juvenile authorities and was well aware of his Miranda rights,\u2019 even if it were warranted by the evidence at the suppression hearing, does not satisfy [the second alternative of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>389 Mass, at 134], Extensive contact with the police and other authorities by itself does not demonstrate unusual sophistication or knowledge about the Miranda rights.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Proceeding with the \u201cspecial caution\u201d where a juvenile\u2019s waiver of constitutional rights is involved, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>361 Mass. 224, 228 (1972), we conclude that the motion to suppress the juvenile\u2019s statements should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>In view of our conclusion that both motions to suppress were erroneously denied, the adjudications of delinquency are reversed, and the verdicts are set aside.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The case is remanded to the Juvenile Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b304-5\"> He was found not delinquent on a complaint charging possession of ammunition.
