That appeal was entered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>this court on July 22, 1999, and was recently the subject of a decision affirming the convictions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 831 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">On December 28, 1999, well after the entry of his direct appeal in this court but before it was decided, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial in the Superior Court together with a motion for an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 7, 2000, the defendant filed a motion in this court to stay the pending appeal. That motion was denied by the single justice on June 9, 2000. Effective on June 20, 2000, a Superior Court judge endorsed the defendant\u2019s motions for a new trial and for evidentiary hearing essentially as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">\u201cThe Court . . . orders that no action be taken on defendant\u2019s motion for new trial ... at this time. Case is pending in the Appeals Court. Defendant\u2019s motion to stay appeal having been denied, no action is taken by the Court pending appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">\u201c[T]he Court . . . orders that defendant\u2019s motion for evidentiary hearing [on defendant\u2019s motion for new trial] is denied . . . [, t]he Court having ordered that no action be taken on defendant\u2019s motion for new trial pending appeal. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">On July 19, 2000, the defendant filed a notice of appeal with respect to the Superior Court order. Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion to reconsider the denial of his motion for an evidentiary hearing on the motion for a new trial. That motion was denied by the judge, and the defendant timely filed a notice of appeal from that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\"><em>Discussion. </em>As claimed by the Commonwealth, this case is controlled in all respects by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cronk, </em>396 Mass. 194 (1985), which states that \u201c[o]nce a party enters an appeal, ... the court issuing the judgment or order from which an appeal was taken is divested of jurisdiction to act on motions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>rehear or vacate.\u201d* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 197. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>419 Mass. 306, 309 (1995) (\u201cAn appeal from a sentence [pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28B] is analogous to an appeal from any judgment or order in that, once a party enters an appeal, the judge issuing the order from which an appeal is taken is divested of jurisdiction to act on motions to rehear or to vacate\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The cognate rule in the Federal courts, Fed.R.Crim.P. 33, provides that if an appeal is pending, a motion for a new trial based on the ground of newly discovered evidence may be granted only on remand of the case by the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">A motion for a new trial under rule 30(b), in effect, asks the trial judge to vacate the conviction. Accordingly, and the defendant does not argue otherwise, the judge here, conform-ably with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cronk, supra, </em>properly declined to act on the motion for a new trial during the pendency of the appeal of the case. The defendant, however, argues that the trial judge abused her discretion in denying his accompanying mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>tian for an evidentiary hearing on the motion for a new trial. We agree, not for the reasons asserted by the defendant,* **<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but rather because the motion for a hearing related directly to the motion for a new trial, and, therefore, also was outside of the judge\u2019s discretion and authority. Accordingly, the judge also should have declined to act on the motion for a hearing. The defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the denial of his motion for an evidentiary hearing is similarly outside of the judge\u2019s authority once the appeal from the underlying conviction has been entered in this court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The rule we confirm promotes consistent administrative \u201cno action\u201d treatment of rule 30(b) and related motions in the trial court during the pendency of an entered direct appeal of the underlying conviction whether those motions are filed before or after entry of the direct appeal. At the same time, it does not significantly limit trial court consideration of such motions. They may be decided at any time prior to the entry of the direct appeal in an appellate court and also may be considered after a conviction has received appellate review. The trial court disability we address is limited to the period between the entry of the direct appeal and the determination of that appeal and is subject to a commonly applied exception: if a motion for a stay of appeal pending disposition of a motion for a new trial has been granted by a single justice of an appellate court, a trial judge may act upon that motion, and related motions, notwithstanding the pendency of the appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is only when no such motion is made or in the circumstance, as occurred here, that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>defendant is unable to persuade the single justice or a reviewing appellate court<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that a stay should be granted that the defendant is forced to await the outcome of his direct appeal. Generally, the issue presented with respect to a motion for a stay of the appeal is whether the interests of fairness, balanced with the interests of judicial economy, best will be served by giving priority to a trial court resolution of the defendant\u2019s new trial motion. Several factors favor the grant of stays: the possibility that the motion for a new trial will be allowed; the economy of consolidating an appeal from the denial of a motion for a new trial with the direct appeal,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>384 Mass. 519, 524 (1981); the advantages to the defendant of such consolidated review of a motion for a new trial over postappeal review<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; and the general systemic benefits of earlier retrials in cases in which a motion for a new trial is allowed. Among the reasons for a denial of a request for a stay are the similarities of issues raised in the motion for a new trial and in the direct appeal, and a reluctance to delay appellate review when briefing has been completed and the case has been, or is ready to be, scheduled for oral argument.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">The absence of authority in a trial court to entertain new trial and related motions after an appeal of the underlying conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>has been entered is not to be interpreted as reflecting a lack of jurisdiction in other matters during the pendency of an appeal. By way of example, and not limitation, we note that Mass.R. Crim.P. 30(a), both at the time of trial, 378 Mass. 900 (1979), and after the recent amendment, 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), permits a trial judge to hear a motion for release from unlawful imprisonment or restraint, or for correction of an illegal sentence, at any time, as is the case with a timely filed motion under Mass.R.Crim.P. 29, 378 Mass. 899 (1979), for revision or revocation of a sentence. Similarly, Mass.R.Crim.P. 31, 378 Mass. 902 (1979), permits a trial judge to order a stay of the execution of a sentence of imprisonment after the entry of an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The judge\u2019s order that no action be taken on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial is affirmed. The judge\u2019s orders denying the defendant\u2019s motions for an evidentiary hearing and for reconsideration of that denial are vacated, and those motions are to be treated as not acted upon and awaiting determination by the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-15\">Rule 30(b), as amended, 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), became effective on October 1, 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b375-10\"> The defendant notes that the new trial motion was filed before he timely filed his brief in this court. That fact is of no consequence to our analysis as the determinative jurisdictional date is the date of entry of the appeal in the appellate court and not the date of filing of either the new trial motion or the notice of appeal in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b376-5\"> This court, in <em>Springfield Redev.
