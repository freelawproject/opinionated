Hollum, Jr., appeals from the dismissal of his complaint against the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB) and the Public Employee Retirement Administratian Commission (PERAC) by a Superior Court judge. The complaint alleged that CRAB and PERAC had improperly determined that Hollum was ineligible for the augmented retirement benefits provided by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 28N, even though he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>had retired from his position as an assistant deputy superintendent at the Worcester County jail and house of correction with over twenty years of service with county sheriffs\u2019 offices. Sectian 28N provides for such augmented retirement benefits<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for \u201cany correction or jail officer employed by county sheriffs\u2019 offices who has performed services in said office for not less than twenty years.\u201d We reverse the judgment for the defendants and remand for entry of judgment for Hollum.</p>\n<p id=\"AQq\"><em>The facts. </em>The documents and other materials included in the record show the following facts. Hollum was employed by the Essex County sheriff\u2019s office from July 1, 1970, to June 22, 1990. Between June 25, 1990, and November 1, 1994, when he retired for superannuation, he was employed by the Worcester County sheriff\u2019s office. At the time of his retirement Hollum was employed as an assistant deputy superintendent at the Worcester County jail and house of correction.</p>\n<p id=\"AfV\">The Worcester County sheriff\u2019s office is organized into three units: deputy sheriffs, correctional officers at the Worcester County jail and house of correction, and civilian employees at the Worcester County jail and house of correction and at the sheriff\u2019s office. Deputy sheriffs are police officers who may serve as civil and criminal process servers or who may serve in a formal law enforcement function at the Worcester County jail and house of correction. Correction officers are uniformed personnel who are charged with the care and custody of inmates and have limited law enforcement authority. Civilian employees are staff personnel who support the deputy sheriffs and correctional officers in carrying out their primary functions.</p>\n<p id=\"AFk\">Assistant deputy superintendents at the Worcester County jail and house of correction assume command of a department or unit of the facility. In connection with such command, assistant deputy superintendents supervise a number of correction officers of lower rank or grade, including captains, lieutenants, sergeants, and officers, in the direct care and custody of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>prisoners. They also perform various administrative tasks in connection with operation of the facility, including fiscal management, property maintenance, processing and personnel activities. They are referred to as correctional officers by the Worcester County sheriff\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Shortly prior to his retirement, Hollum requested that the Worcester County retirement board (board) provide him with an estimated calculation of his retirement allowance, calculated pursuant to the provisions of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 28N. The board requested that PERAC provide an opinion whether Hollum was entitled to have his allowance calculated pursuant to \u00a7 28N, and PERAC responded that Hollum was not entitled to have his allowance calculated pursuant to \u00a7 28N because he was employed as an assistant deputy superintendent rather than a correction or jail officer. PERAC reasoned that, while the term \u201ccorrection or jail officer\u201d is not defined in \u00a7 28N, the positions of \u201cassistant deputy superintendent\u201d and \u201ccorrection officer\u201d are listed separately in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(2)(g), indicating the Legislature\u2019s intent to treat as distinct the two positions. PERAC further reasoned that \u201c[i]f it were the intention of the [Legislature that all employees of [county] correctional facilities were to be entitled to retire under the provisions of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 28N, they would have expressly so stated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Acting on behalf of Hollum, the board asked PERAC to reconsider its decision. PERAC reiterated its decision. Hollum then appealed to CRAB pursuant to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(4). CRAB referred the matter for a hearing before a magistrate of the Division of Administrative Law Appeals. See G. L. c. 7, \u00a7 4H.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The magistrate upheld PERAC\u2019s determination. Like PERAC, the magistrate reasoned that if the Legislature had intended to include the position of assistant deputy superintendent within the positions covered by \u00a7 28N, it would have said so expressly.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Hollum filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision as permitted by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16(4). CRAB affirmed the magistrate\u2019s decision and adopted it as its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Hollum thereafter filed his complaint in Superior Court and moved for judgment on the pleadings. The judge denied Hollum\u2019s motion and allowed a cross motion by the defendants to dismiss the complaint, determining that the defendants\u2019 construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>tian of \u00a7 28N was reasonable and, hence, was entitled to deference.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 28N, as inserted by St. 1994, c. 36, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of sections one to twenty-eight, inclusive, to the contrary, <em>any correction or jail officer </em>employed by county sheriffs\u2019 offices who has performed services in said office for not less than twenty years shall, at his own request, be retired by said retirement board [and be eligible for the augmented retirement benefits provided by this section]\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">On its face, the phrase \u201cany correction or jail officer employed by county sheriffs\u2019 offices\u201d would appear to include an officer, such as Hollum, who is assigned to a county correctional facility and charged with direct responsibility for the care and custody of prisoners. \u201cThe word \u2018any\u2019 is generally used in the sense of \u2018all\u2019 or \u2018every\u2019 and its meaning is most comprehensive.\u201d <em>Fleck </em>v. <em>KDI Sylvan Pools, Inc., </em>981 F.2d 107, 115 (3d Cir. 1992), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Doughboy Recreational, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fleck, </em>507 U.S. 1005 (1993), quoting from <em>Leach </em>v. <em>Philadelphia Sav. Fund Soc., </em>234 Pa. Super. 486, 491 (1975). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rosenwasser, </em>323 U.S. 360, 362-363 (1945) (\u201cany\u201d employee means all employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act, unless specifically excluded).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Notwithstanding the use of the word \u201cany\u201d in \u00a7 28N, PERAC opined that \u00a7 28N was not applicable to Hollum because the positions of \u201cassistant deputy superintendent\u201d and \u201ccorrection officer\u201d are listed separately in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3(2)(g). Section 3(2)(g) provides for the classification of public employees in one of four numbered \u201cgroups\u201d for retirement purposes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Group 4, as appearing in St. 1996, c. 71, \u00a7 1, includes, among other persons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u201cemployees of the department of correction who are employed at any correctional institution or prison camp under the control of said department and who hold the position of correction officer, female correction officer, industrial instructor, recreation officer, assistant industrial shop manager, industrial shop manager, assistant to the supervisor of industries, supervisor of industries, senior correction officer, senior female correction officer, supervising correction officer, supervising female correction officer, prison camp officer, senior prison camp officer, supervising prison camp officer [or] assistant deputy superintendent. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Group 4 also includes \u201cthe sheriff, superintendent, assistant superintendent, assistant deputy superintendent and correction officers of county correctional facilities . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">This separate listing of the assistant deputy superintendent job title in \u00a7 3(2)(g) cannot shed any light on the question whether \u00a7 28N was intended to include assistant deputy superintendents such as Hollum. There is nothing in \u00a7 3(2)(g) which indicates that it was designed or intended for any such purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The hearing magistrate further reasoned that, if the Legislature had intended to include the position of assistant deputy superintendent within the ambit of eligibility for the augmented retirement benefit provided by \u00a7 28N, it would have said so expressly or, alternatively, adopted the language in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 28M, which was enacted two years prior to \u00a7 28N. Section 28M makes augmented retirement benefits available to certain employees of the Commonwealth\u2019s Department of Correction. More specifically, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 28M, as inserted by St. 1992, c. 164, provides that such augmented retirement benefits shall be available to \u201cany employee of the department of correction, classified under Group 4, whose major responsibilities include the care and custody of prisoners.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The magistrate stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">\u201cHad the General Court intended to include the position of assistant deputy superintendent as being eligible for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>section 28N benefit, it could have included it or adopted the language in section 28M and included all group 4 employees with the major responsibility of having the care and custody of prisoners. Since they did not, section 28N must be interpreted to restrict eligibility for this benefit to correction or jail officers employed by the county sheriffs\u2019 offices.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsW\">As we have noted previously, however, \u00a7 28N uses the comprehensive word \u201cany.\u201d In light of this language, we must construe the section as including employees such as Hollum because they are not expressly excluded, rather than as excluding employees such as Hollum because they are not expressly included. This is the natural meaning of the word \u201cany.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AIa\">Moreover, we can discern no reason, and CRAB has suggested none, why the Legislature would have wanted to include assistant deputy superintendents charged with the care and custody of prisoners in the group of persons employed by the Department of Correction who are eligible for the augmented retirement benefits provided by \u00a7 28M, but exclude assistant deputy superintendents charged with the care and custody of prisoners from the group of persons employed by county sheriffs\u2019 offices who are eligible for the augmented retirement benefits provided by \u00a7 28N. It is a familiar principle that statutes should be construed to avoid such inconsistent and incongruous results, if possible. See <em>Telesetsky </em>v. Wight, 395 Mass. 868, 873 (1985); <em>Acting Superintendent of Bournewood Hasp. </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>431 Mass. 101, 104 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"ACY\">We are mindful of our obligation to accord substantial deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute committed to its charge so long as the agency\u2019s interpretation is reasonable. See, e.g., <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Newton, </em>425 Mass. 468, 470 (1997). Nevertheless, we cannot ignore a statute\u2019s plain words or construe it to produce an illogical result. <em>ROPT Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Katin, </em>431 Mass. 601, 603 (2000). In the present case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>\u00a7 28N applies on its face to \u201cany\u201d correction or jail officer employed by a county sheriff\u2019s office. Hollum was employed in such a capacity and had direct responsibility for the care and custody of prisoners. We therefore can see no basis for denying him the benefit of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The judgment for the defendants is reversed, and a new judgment shall enter remanding the case to CRAB for the entry of a decision in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AaL\"> Specifically, \u00a7 28N, as inserted by St. 1994, c. 36, provides that retirement allowances calculated under the section \u201cshall be increased by one-twelfth of one percent for each full month of service in excess of twenty years service and prior to the last day of the month in which such member will attain the age of retirement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b247-9\">The defendants raised no issue as to whether Hollum had satisfied the twenty-year service requirement contained in \u00a7 28N.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Persons classified in groups 2 and 4 attain maximum retirement allowances at an earlier age than those classified in group 1. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 5(2). Persons classified in group 3 (officers and inspectors of the Department of State Police) are subject to the separate retirement provisions set forth in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b248-9\">The augmented retirement benefits provided by \u00a7 28M are precisely the same as those provided by \u00a7 28N \u2014 i.e., one-twelfth of one percent for each full month of service in excess of twenty years of service.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"AX2\"> As Hollum points out, construing \u00a7 28N in the manner suggested by the magistrate would exclude not only assistant deputy superintendents such as Hollum; but also all captains, lieutenants and sergeants assigned to the Worcester County jail and house of correction and charged with the care and custody of prisoners. Any such exclusion would be equally inconsistent with the use of the word \u201cany\u201d in \u00a7 28N.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
