However, based on the materials before us, it appears that neither a motion to amend the complaint nor a motion regarding party misnomer under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(8), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), has been made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Armstrong, CJ.</author>\n<p id=\"Adx\">As this case comes to us on appeal, the sole issue of significance is whether a Superior Court judge was correct in ordering summary judgment to be entered for the defendant, Host International, Inc. (Host), on the plaintiff\u2019s claim for breach of an employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">On July 31, 1992, the plaintiff was employed by Host as a sales clerk at a \u201cDunkin Donuts\u201d counter in a Logan Airport terminal. Following a brief verbal exchange between the plaintiff and a customer, a supervisor, Donnelly, who had not heard the exchange, came on the scene to find the customer, one Bigbie, stalking away from the counter, apparently angry. Donnelly ran after Bigbie and talked with him out of the plaintiff\u2019s hearing. So far as appears nothing further was said to the plaintiff until August 3, when he was summarily discharged by Donnelly. Donnelly stated his grounds in a handwritten \u201cnotice of disciplinary action\u201d dated that day.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff, so far as the record shows, never had an opportunity to present his side of the encounter with Bigbie before the discharge, although he did have a post-discharge exit conference with a Host \u201chuman resource manager\u201d on August 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">In the ensuing days Host opposed the plaintiff\u2019s application for unemployment compensation, although to no avail: the review examiner found \u2014 based, presumably, on the plaintiff\u2019s testimony \u2014 that the plaintiff \u201chad been working at the very busy counter when [Bigbie] cut through the line of waiting customers who had yet to be served by the [plaintiff], and tried to engage the [plaintiff] in a conversation about the special of the day and the contents of several doughnuts available. Since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the [plaintiff] was working alone, he replied quickly but not rudely to [Bigbie], who then became upset with the [plaintiff], calling the latter an \u2018asshole,\u2019 and walked angrily away.\u201d The examiner noted that the plaintiff \u201chad never before been warned about rudeness, although he had been counseled about trying to exhibit a more enthusiastic appearance in the workplace.\u201d (The judge could, of course, disregard this account on summary judgment, as it was not \u201cmade on personal knowledge,\u201d as Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(e), 365 Mass. 825 [1974], requires; but the same account was properly before the judge on affidavits.)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Among Host\u2019s arguments for summary judgment was that the plaintiff was an at-will employee, terminable at any time for any reason that is not discriminatory,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> see <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Action for Boston Community Dev., Inc., </em>403 Mass. 8, 9 (1988), and that no purpose would be served by a court getting into the question of justification. The plaintiff\u2019s claim is that he had rights greater than those of an employee at will, rights accorded through a personnel policies manual distributed to Host\u2019s employees generally, and given to the plaintiff, who was asked to sign for it, when he was first hired in November, 1989. The manual, both as it appeared in 1989 and as extensively amended and reissued in 1991, was part of the record before the judge and is before us. The manual as amended was distributed to all employees, including the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Because the plaintiff argues that the manual is the source of his rights in contract, we describe relevant portions of the amended manual in some detail. Following a welcome to new employees and a description of Host as an \u201cindustry leader and a leading contributor in your community,\u201d and a history of the company, there is a section entitled \u201cABOUT THE BOOK.\u201d The third paragraph of this section disclaims any intent to confer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>contractual rights on employees,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the fourth paragraph reserves the right to amend or cancel the manual without notice as circumstances require.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Four sections later is one entitled \u201cPROBATIONARY PERIOD,\u201d informing employees that their first ninety days are ones of evaluation during which they can be terminated without notice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A later section is entitled \u201cPROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It describes how employees who violate- company policies will receive warnings, either verbal or written, which will be placed in the employee\u2019s file. A significant paragraph advises the employee, \u201c[i]f you feel the warning is inaccurate or unwarranted, you should exercise your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Guarantee of Fair Treatment.\u201d It explains how warnings expire after one year and cannot thereafter be used to support termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The next section, \u201cCONDUCT ON THE JOB,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is central to the plaintiff\u2019s argument. It begins by advising that an employee can be terminated under progressive discipline if he has two written warnings and a third violation occurs. The third violation is grounds either for suspension (up to three days) or termination, subject to management\u2019s decision. In addition, the employee is told that certain listed violations are so serious that termination can follow even without prior warnings. The list includes such offenses as theft of Host property, possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>lethal weapons on the job, assaults, drug or alcohol use on the job, and a failure after a warning to follow a manager\u2019s order \u2014 the full list is in the margin at note 8; note should be taken of the last item in the list, \u201cMisconduct,\u201d not further described.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Several sections later appears the \u201cGUARANTEE OF FAIR TREATMENT\u201d referred to earlier in the section on progressive discipline. It advises the employee that \u201c[w]e recognize that being human, mistakes may be made in spite of our best efforts. We want to correct such mistakes as soon as they happen.\u201d The employee who has a problem is given a three-step procedure to follow, beginning with a discussion with his immediate supervisor; next, one with his manager; then, if the employee is still dissatisfied with the resolution, the manager will arrange for an interview with the general manager. Thereafter, if the employee wishes, \u201cthe entire matter will be referred to your Division Director of Human Resources for action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\"><em>Existence of contract incorporating handbook. </em>Host argues that the employee manual gave the plaintiff no contractual rights because of the clearly stated intent not to create a contract (see note 4, <em>supra) </em>and that, in addition, the reservation of a unilateral right to disregard or cancel the manual (see note 5, <em>supra) </em>made any contract illusory and unenforceable. Those arguments might have been tenable under language in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Action for Boston Community Dev., Inc., </em>403 Mass. 8 (1988), which appeared to recognize the efficacy of such clauses to prevent the creation of contractual obligations to the employee. However, the <em>Jackson </em>decision was quite explicitly clarified by the later decision of <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>422 Mass. 686, 691-694 (1996).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That decision followed the lead of such cases as <em>Toussaint </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mich., </em>408 Mich. 579 (1980), and <em>Woolley </em>v. <em>Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., 99 </em>N.J. 284, modified on other grounds, 101 N.J. 10 (1985), in calling for the provisions of such manuals to be enforced to the extent that they instill a reasonable belief in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>employees that management will adhere to the policies therein expressed. As explained in the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>decision, 422 Mass, at 694:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">\u201cManagement distributes personnel manuals because it is thought to be in its best interests to do so. Such a practice encourages employee security, satisfaction, and loyalty and a sense that every employee will be treated fairly and equally. See <em>Toussaint </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mich., [supra </em>at 613]. Management expects that employees will adhere to the obligations that the manual sets forth. Courts recently have been reluctant to permit management to reap the benefits of a personnel manual and at the same time avoid promises freely made in the manual that employees reasonably believed were part of their arrangement with the employer. Management voluntarily offers, and defines the terms of, any benefit set forth in its unbargained for personnel manual. The employees may have a reasonable expectancy that management will adhere to a manual\u2019s provisions. \u2018Without minimizing the importance of its specific provisions, the context of the manual\u2019s preparation and distribution is, to us, the most persuasive proof that it would be almost inevitable for an employee to regard it as a binding commitment, legally enforceable, concerning the terms and conditions of his employment.\u2019 <em>Woolley </em>v. <em>Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., [supra </em>at 299]. In the circumstances of this case, an affected employee\u2019s reliance on the manual would be reasonable, and O\u2019Brien, as one of those employees, is entitled to whatever rights that the manual sets forth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-32\">As to the disclaimer provisions of the Host handbook that the defendant would treat as dispositive, we think the <em>O\u2019Brien </em>decision more consonant with the reasonable expectation approach expressed in the <em>Woolley </em>decision. \u201cThe mere fact of the manual\u2019s distribution suggests its importance. Its changeability \u2014 the uncontroverted ability of management to change its terms \u2014 is argued as supporting its non-binding quality, but one might as easily conclude that, given its importance, the employer wanted to keep it up to date, especially to make certain ... that the benefits conferred were sufficiently competitive with those available from other employers . . . .\u201d <em>Woolley </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., supra </em>at 299. \u201cIt would be unfair to allow an employer to distribute a policy manual that makes the workforce believe that certain promises have been made and then to allow the employer to renege on those promises. What is sought here is basic honesty: if the employer, for whatever reason, does not want the manual to be capable of being construed by the court as a binding contract, there are simple ways to attain that goal. All that need be done is the inclusion in a very prominent position of an appropriate statement that there is no promise of any kind by the employer contained in the manual; that regardless of what the manual says or provides, the employer promises nothing . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax-\">The two clauses in the Host employee manual properly could be viewed by the fact finder as the functional equivalent of fine print. They appear buried in the general, introductory portion of the manual, in a section not as likely to attract the employees\u2019 attention as the very specific lists of obligations and benefits set out in the bulk of the manual. It cannot be said as matter of law that the plaintiff could not reasonably believe that the company would adhere to the portions of the manual establishing the system of progressive discipline and the guarantee of fair treatment, rather than apply them only when it chose. Compare <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Community Teamwork, Inc., </em>434 Mass. 761, 780 (2001) (\u201cwhere an employer calls special attention to the policy, a finding that the terms of the policy form the basis of an implied contract may be justified\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"ABB\"><em>Breach. </em>When Donnelly, the plaintiff\u2019s immediate supervisor, discharged him, the \u201cnotice of disciplinary action\u201d characterized the plaintiff\u2019s exchange with Bigbie as \u201cmisconduct,\u201d see notes 2 and 8, <em>supra, </em>presumably to bring the alleged rudeness toward Bigbie within the list of offenses so serious as to warrant bypassing the \u201cprogressive discipline\u201d requirement of two prior warnings. Upon closer scrutiny, that characterization gives pause. In isolation, \u201cmisconduct\u201d is a term so general that it could be used to mean anything management wanted it to mean. But the term does not appear in isolation, rather it has context in the manual, and in that context the usual and familiar rule of construction applies which treats a general, all-encompassing word at the end of a list of specific items as taking on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>character of those specific items. \u201cThe doctrine of ejusdem generis is applicable: \u2018Where general words follow specific words in an enumeration describing the legal subject, the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.\u2019 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47:17 (4th ed. 1973).\u201d <em>Dickson </em>v. <em>Riverside Iron Works, Inc., </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 53, 55-56 (1978) (using doctrine to construe contract). See <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Bettencourt, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 90, 92 (1996) (in statute describing \u201ca place of assembly, theater, special hall, public hall, factory, workshop, manufacturing establishment or building,\u201d the word building does not include a house). See also <em>USM Corp. </em>v. <em>Arthur D. Little Sys., Inc., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 108, 116 (1989) (interpretation of contract is question of law for court, whose objective is to \u201cconstrue the contract as a whole, in a reasonable and practical way, consistent with its language, background, and purpose\u201d). The items on Host\u2019s fist purport to be particularly serious breaches of company policy. Most of the items are criminal or borderline criminal conduct \u2014 theft, fighting, drug use, gaming, vandalism \u2014 or else deliberate disobedience of orders after a warning. (Repeated, unauthorized absenteeism is perhaps of different character but its inclusion does not alter the general character of the list.) In context, the word misconduct must be taken to import similarly serious breaches of behavior. By no account did the plaintiff\u2019s behavior amount to more than mere unresponsiveness.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There is no suggestion he used foul or abusive language or engaged in any physical action. If the plaintiff was not guilty of \u201cmisconduct\u201d as. the term is used in the employee handbook, the plaintiff is right in arguing that he should have had the benefit of progressive discipline \u2014 i.e., two warnings \u2014 and of the guarantee of fair treatment \u2014 in effect, a chance to tell his side of the story. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>On the evidence before the judge on summary judgment, it could not properly be ruled as matter of law that his claim was meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Even viewing the summary judgment record most favorably to the plaintiff, as we have, we recognize that the rights granted to Host employees are not extensive. They do not purport to protect the employee from termination except for cause. The rights granted are simply that the employee, except in cases of egregious misconduct, will have at least two warnings prior to termination and an opportunity to challenge the warnings by telling his side of the story to this supervisor and then to higher authorities. Implicit also is the opportunity given by warnings to improve performance. A court is hardly in a position to treat the right to be heard, the right to tell one\u2019s side of the story, as valueless. The employee manual itself recognizes that \u201cmistakes may be made in spite of our best efforts.\u201d As the guarantee of fair treatment states, \u201cWe want to correct such mistakes as soon as they happen.\u201d By its manual, Host may be found to have chosen, \u201cpresumably in its own interest, to create an environment in which the employee believes that, whatever the personnel policies and practices, they are established and official at any given time, purport to be fair, and are applied consistently and uniformly to each employee. The employer has then created a situation \u2018instinct with an obligation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Toussaint </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mich., </em>408 Mich, at 613, quoting from <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, </em>222 N.Y. 88, 91 (1917). We reverse so much of the judgment as dismisses the plaintiff\u2019s claim for breach of contract.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-7\"> The notice stated as follows: \u201cOn Friday [n]ight, July 31 Richard was working the Dunkin Donuts [u]nit at US Air. I was helping at the TCBY unit when I noticed two gentlemen go to the Dunkin [u]nit. They left quite abruptly &amp; I followed them to the cafe. I [a]pproached them to ask if something was wrong. The gentleman\u2019s quote was, \u2018The guy was a_asshole!\u2019 I tried to amend the situation &amp; asked what had happened. The gentleman had asked Richard what today\u2019s special meant &amp; his reply was \u2018Nothin!\u2019 The gentleman ask[ed] about other items and got similar rude response[s]. This seems to be a large problem because the gentleman gave me his card and asked to have service contact him because he didn\u2019t have time to write down his story. This is a direct violation of Host customer service [p]olicy. These types of actions cannot be tolerated and are considered misconduct. Therefore this will result in Richard being terminated.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b122-7\"> General Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 4(1), as amended through St. 2000, c. 254, \u00a7 6, bars discharges \u201cbecause of . . . race, color, religious creed, national origin, sex, sexual orientation . . . genetic information, or ancestry . . . .\u201d The plaintiff, apparently a black person, did in fact file a racial discrimination complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination. That complaint, however, was dismissed because it was filed after the six-month limitations period, and the claim cannot now be resurrected in court. See <em>Charland </em>v. <em>Muzi Motors, Inc., </em>417 Mass. 580, 581, 586 (1994); <em>Mouradian </em>v. <em>General Elec. Co., </em>23 Mass.

At that time I informed him that I didn\u2019t want anything from him, that he was a smart aleck, and that I would go elsewhere for my donut. I stomped away and went inside an adjacent shop to order a donut.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\"> The plaintiff also claimed in his complaint that his discharge violated Host\u2019s obligation of good faith and fair dealing, see <em>Fortune </em>v. <em>National Cash Register Co., </em>373 Mass. 96, 104-105 (1977). The claim is meritless and properly was dismissed because nothing in the facts of the case would satisfy the necessary element of unjust enrichment. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>424 Mass. 1, 6-7 (1996). Because it is not challenged on appeal, we also do not disturb the judge\u2019s ruling that the plaintiff\u2019s claim for emotional distress damages arising from his termination is barred by the exclusivity provision of the workers\u2019 compensation statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
