The plaintiff, disabled for twenty-one weeks, received weekly benefits from Brockton in accordance with G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF, which amounted in all to $23,505.82. As noted in the margin, the statute provides non-standard workers\u2019 compensation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>The plaintiff settled his tort claim against Readus for $20,000, the liability limit for bodily injury under Readus\u2019s automobile insurance policy. The carrier for Readus happened to be the defendant, Commerce Insurance Company. The defendant paid the plaintiff $6,666.67 by check. It wrote a check for the balance, $13,333.33, to the joint order of the plaintiff and the city of Brockton, and the plaintiff then endorsed the check to the city. The city, after paying compensation to the police officer under \u00a7 11 IF, was subrogated (with protection by equitable lien, see <em>Gonsalves </em>v. Commonwealth, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 606, 609 [1989]; <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Medeiros, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 600, 609 &amp; n.15 [2000]), in the amount of such paid compensation, to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery from the tortfeasor Readus* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; the figure of $13,333 apparently represented a willing compromise and surrender of part of the lien (the $6,666.67) in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Dadak made a separate claim based on the \u201cunderinsured\u201d provision of his insurance policy, also issued by Commerce, covering his privately owned car. His claim was submitted to binding arbitration. Plaintiff and defendant presented evidence before the arbitrator. The arbitrator found that the plaintiff\u2019s gross damages were $49,513.28 (including injuries, lost wages, and medical expenses). Under the policy terms, the defendant was allowed credits or offsets as follows: \u201cWe [Commerce] will reduce the damages [i.e., underinsurance benefits] an injured person is entitled to recover by: (1) The total amount collected from the automobile bodily injury liability insurance covering the legally responsible owners and operators of all insured autos .... (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>The amount paid under a workers\u2019 compensation law or similar law . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Under clause 1, the arbitrator found there was an offset of the $20,000 recovery from Readus\u2019s policy. But the arbitrator noted the parties differed in their interpretations of clause 3: the defendant contended the whole of the weekly benefits paid to the plaintiff \u2014 the $23,505.82 \u2014 should be offset, while the plaintiff contended the offset should be only $10,172.49, as the plaintiff had in effect returned $13,333.33 of the $23,505.82 to Brockton in reduction of the city\u2019s lien. The arbitrator, filing written findings and conclusions, accepted the defendant\u2019s interpretation of clause 3. The result was a net award to the plaintiff of $5,507.46 pursuant to the underinsurance provision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Within the twenty days from receipt of the award allowed for a claim of miscalculation of figures, see G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 9, the plaintiff asked the arbitrator to reconsider and add the $13,333.33 to the award, for a total of $18,840.79. The arbitrator replied, standing by his interpretation of clause 3: \u201ca credit for \u2018the amount paid under a Workers\u2019 Compensation law or similar law[,]\u2019 i.e. $23,505.82[,] plus \u2018the total amount collected from the automobile bodily injury liability insurance covering the legally responsible owners and operators of all insured autos\u2019 shall be deducted from the gross award made by me for Mr. Dadak.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The plaintiff timely commenced the present action in Superior Court, seeking modification of the award. This was based on the statutory grounds that \u201cthere was an evident miscalculation of figures or an evident mistake in the description of any person, thing or property referred to in the award,\u201d G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 13(a)(1). After a hearing, the judge ruled there was such an \u201cevident miscalculation\u201d and ordered the entry of a judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s favor for $18,840.79. The defendant appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The judge mistook the meaning of the statutory phrase.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The \u201cevident miscalculation of figures\u201d referred to is one which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>arises in the working out in mathematical terms of an agreed or assumed standard or principle. That was not the present case. Here there was disagreement about the standard or principle itself \u2014 the interpretation of clause 3 \u2014 and the award reflected the arbitrator\u2019s adoption of one interpretation rather than the other.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Illustrative of evident miscalculation in the sense of the statute is the case of <em>Ciampa </em>v. <em>Chubb Group of Ins. Cos., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 941, 941 (1988). It was agreed the plaintiff was entitled to the present value of future lost wages, $150 per week for 925 weeks at an interest rate of twelve percent. Upon review of the arbitrator\u2019s calculation pursuant to \u00a7 13(a)(1), a judge of the Superior Court suggested that the parties inform the arbitrator of an obvious error in his calculation of present value. The arbitrator modified the award accordingly, and the modification was held proper under \u00a7 13(a)(1): a mathematical mistake was \u201cevident\u201d from the original award. We cite in the margin similar instances of evident mathematical error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In contrast are instances like the present case, where arbitrators\u2019 awards were attacked for supposed miscalculation, but it turned out the awards stemmed, instead, from the arbitrators\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>adoption of particular substantive positions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 8It need hardly be noted that awards so arrived at, whether perceived in their results to be sensible or not, fair or unfair, are impregnable \u201c[s]hart of fraud, arbitrary conduct, or significant procedural irregularity.\u201d <em>Grobet File Co. of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>RTC Sys., Inc., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 132, 135 (1988). See G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 12(a)(l)-(5). We are not led into a discussion of the soundness or wisdom of the instant arbitrator\u2019s decision about the proper interpretation of clause 3.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cWe are thus bound by the arbitrator\u2019s findings and conclusions in this case, no matter the extent to which we may believe that they are \u2018grossly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>435 Mass. 54, 62 (2001), quoting from <em>Trustees of Boston &amp; Me. Corp. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>363 Mass. 386, 390 (1973). The judgment is reversed, and a new judgment shall enter confirming the arbitrator\u2019s original award.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-14\"> General Laws c. 41, \u00a7 11 IF, provides in part: \u201cWhenever a police officer ... of a city ... is incapacitated for duty because of injury sustained in the performance of his duty without fault of his own ... he shall be granted leave without loss of pay for the period of such incapacity .... All amounts payable under this section shall be paid at the same times and in the same manner as, and for all purposes shall be deemed to be, the regular compensation of such police officer . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Police officers are excluded from the ordinary Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, G.

L. c. 152, \u00a7 2, a police officer is not entitled to benefits merely because he was injured in the course of his employment: the officer must be injured through no fault of his own.\u201d <em>Wincek </em>v. <em>West Springfield, </em>399 Mass. 700, 704 n.3 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b327-7\"> A provision of \u00a7 11 IF \u201cmandates that a [city or] town be reimbursed for any amounts paid under \u00a7 111F to the extent that the legal liability of a third party who has paid damages has yielded additional relief to the injured police officer.\u201d <em>Wincek </em>v. <em>West Springfield, </em>399 Mass. 700, 701 (1987). To be distinguished are payments pursuant to a contractual obligation, like underinsurance benefits, which are not captured by \u00a7 111F.
