We affirm his two convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\"><em>The procedural background. </em>On April 28, 1998, the defendant was arraigned on charges of breaking and entering in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 16, and of unlawful possession of burglarious tools, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 49. He received a court-appointed attorney. A pretrial conference report was filed on May 11 and a motion to suppress identification was filed on June 19. At the conclusion of an evidentiary hearing on December 11, the motion was denied and a trial date was set for January 5, 1999. It was the sole trial scheduled for that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\"><em>The motion for continuance to change counsel. </em>On the morning of January 5, the attorney informed the court that he was \u201cnot prepared to go to trial today.\u201d However, counsel did not appear to be referring to substantive unpreparedness to try the case. He explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">\u201c[The defendant] called me up on December, I believe it was, 28th \u2014 I\u2019m not quite sure of the date \u2014 left a message on my answering machine. I got back to him on January 2nd. He said he did not want me; he has new counsel. He says he didn\u2019t like what I was doing, which \u2014 he told me I didn\u2019t hire an investigator; that I should have hired an investigator. We had some words exchanged. I told him that I did not want to represent him. He said under no circumstances did he want me to represent him because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>was going to be found guilty, and I have done nothing for his case. This was on January 2nd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\">\u201cI did tell him he should come before this court prior to today because this was a scheduled date for trial, which was, I believe, set back on December 11th.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">At the outset, we note that the obligation to come forward and inform the trial judge of the need for a continuance prior to the date of trial rests on counsel, not the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burbank, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 97, 104 (1989). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Prochilo, </em>187 F.3d 221, 226-227 (1st Cir. 1999).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 34Prior to the day of trial, appointed counsel did not wish to represent a client who did not want his representation. Further, counsel knew of another named private attorney, whom the defendant wanted as counsel, and with whom the current attorney spoke \u201cway back a week ago, over a week ago.\u201d That lawyer indicated that he would only enter an appearance if a continuance were granted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>The defendant was allowed, as he must be, to address the court. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>388 Mass. 655, 659 (1983). He complained that his attorney had failed to (1) secure a copy of the suppression hearing transcript; (2) scientifically test the evidence; and (3) hire an investigator. The judge denied the motion to continue the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">\u201cThe Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution afford a defendant the right to assistance of counsel in all State criminal prosecutions which may result in the loss of his liberty.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>371 Mass. 46, 50 (1976), citing <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335 (1963).* **<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When a defendant requests a continuance in order to change counsel, the judge must consider the defendant\u2019s right to obtain counsel of his choice as well as the public\u2019s interest in the fair, efficient and orderly administration of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fogarty, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 693, 697-698 (1988). While there is no unbridled right to replace one competent attorney with another, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunne, </em>394 Mass. 10, 15 (1985), a defendant may not be forced to go to trial with incompetent or unprepared counsel. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>389 Mass. 359, 366-367, cert, denied, 464 U.S. 941 (1983), citing <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>545 F.2d 273, 278 (1st Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">It is within the judge\u2019s sound discretion to grant a request for new counsel on the eve or day of trial, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuitt, </em>393 Mass. 801, 804 (1985), or to allow a motion for a continuance, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 482, 487 (1994). While there is no mechanical test for determining when such a denial is so arbitrary as to violate due process, the judge should make findings showing a balancing between the defendant\u2019s rights and the interests of the Commonwealth and demonstrating that discretion was in fact exercised. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>394 Mass. 209, 217 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fogarty, supra </em>at 698; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 802, 813 n.12 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Where the defendant\u2019s objections are concerned with the attorney\u2019s choice of trial tactics, this is ordinarily not sufficient to warrant a continuance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Price, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 955, 957 (1983), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ransom, </em>358 Mass. 580, 585 (1971). However, when a defendant alleges that counsel is unprepared, the judge should perform some colloquy to ascertain whether this is a dilatory tactic or whether counsel is truly unprepared.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flowers, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 557, 565-566 (1977) (trial judge should make further inquiry where the defendant alleges that attorney is unprepared), cert, denied, 434 U.S. 1077 (1978). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drayton, </em>386 Mass. 39, 45 (1982) (counsel stated that he was prepared); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuitt, supra </em>at 805 (same); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunne, supra </em>at 15 (no allegation that counsel not prepared); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>398 Mass. 806, 815 (1986) (same); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chavis, </em>415 Mass. 703, 712 (1993) (judge satisfied himself that attorney was prepared); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 276, 279 (1981) (attorney prepared for trial); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 202 (1983) (attorney represented to court that he was prepared for trial); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Price, supra </em>at 957 (no question that attorney prepared); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fogarty, supra </em>at 697 (attorney represented that she was prepared for trial); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burbank, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. at 102 (judge found that attorney was prepared). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jordan, supra </em>at 812, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chavis, </em>415 Mass. 703, 711 (1993) (\u201cAlthough counsel characterized himself as unprepared, he had been appointed [two and one-half months prior to trial], had the transcript of [the codefendant\u2019s] trial, and had attended a portion of that trial. In these circumstances, and with the additional protection of co-counsel, the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying [defense counsel\u2019s] motions for withdrawal and a continuance filed so close to the date for trial. The trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>allowed counsel to present his reasons and appropriately balanced the need for additional time against the increased costs, including prejudice to the victim, taking into account also \u2018the interest of the judicial system in avoiding delays which would not measurably contribute to the resolution of a particular controversy\u2019 \u201d [citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The preferred practice is to hear the defendant\u2019s reasons for wanting new counsel so that the judge\u2019s discretion will be exercised on an informed basis. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>388 Mass, at 659. It is also appropriate to ask counsel for a response. See note 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In the case at bar, the judge made no formal findings on the record to indicate a balancing of the public\u2019s interest in the fair, efficient and orderly administration of justice with the defendant\u2019s right to proceed with counsel of his choice, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fogarty, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. at 697-698; nor did the judge question counsel as to his preparedness or his response to the defendant\u2019s allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">While the judge should have made findings, either in writing or orally on the record, we can glean from the record the apparent rationale for the trial judge\u2019s decision: (1) it was the only case on for trial that day; (2) the Commonwealth was present with witnesses, one of whom had to leave the State the following day; (3) the case was a relatively simple one; (4) more importantly, experienced counsel had competently participated in an evidentiary hearing on his motion to suppress identification less than a month earlier, a hearing over which the trial judge presided; (5) the attorney had been representing the defendant for eight months, and had acted appropriately during that time period; (6) the defendant was, as the judge explained, \u201cnot entitled to a copy of the transcript as a condition precedent for going forward\u201d; and (7) counsel was not alleging that he was substantively unprepared, but that he was unprepared in the sense that the defendant did not wish his representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">In this light, the judge was well within his discretion to deny the motion to continue in order for the defendant to change counsel. Despite the lack of formal findings, we cannot say the judge committed error.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\"><em>Waiver of the right to counsel. </em>Once it was determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>the case would be proceeding that day, the defendant continued to indicate his displeasure both with the court\u2019s decision and with counsel. When the court indicated that the defendant had the option of proceeding with his appointed counsel or pro se with appointed counsel in a standby capacity, the defendant twice opted for the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">\u201c \u2018While a defendant may not be forced to proceed to trial with incompetent or unprepared counsel, ... a refusal without good cause to proceed with able appointed counsel is a \u201cvoluntary\u201d waiver.\u2019 <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>545 F.2d 273, 278 (1st Cir. 1976). . . . Unlike the defendant in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>371 Mass. 46 (1976), [the defendant here] was not presented with a \u2018Hobson\u2019s choice\u2019 of representing himself or of going forward with incompetent or unprepared counsel.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>389 Mass, at 366-367. \u201cGood cause includes, but is not limited to, \u2018a conflict of interest, incompetence of counsel, or an irreconcilable breakdown in communication.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britto, </em>433 Mass. 596, 600 (2001), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chavis, </em>415 Mass, at 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Here, it appears that counsel did not claim he was substantively unprepared. Indeed, the judge implicitly found him to be prepared. Rather, counsel indicated a breakdown in communication. \u201cThe Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to effective assistance of counsel, but it \u2018does not invariably require a \u201cmeaningful attorney-client relationship.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britto, </em>433 Mass, at 600, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuitt, </em>393 Mass, at 806. \u201cThe \u2018appropriate [Sixth Amendment] inquiry focuses on the adversarial process, not on the accused\u2019s relationship with his lawyer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britto, </em>433 Mass, at 607, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuitt, </em>393 Mass, at 806-807.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">\u201cEven if there were a breakdown, however, the defendant has failed to show how it \u2018likely deprived [him] of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britto, </em>433 Mass, at 608, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). As the judge opined at sentencing, \u201cOn the evidence I\u2019ve heard in this case, you could have had Clarence Darrow and it wouldn\u2019t have made a difference. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>The evidence was overwhelming as to your guilt.\u201d The defendant has not demonstrated how his proceeding pro se deprived him of a meaningful defense, nor how the alleged communication breakdown \u201cled to an apparently unjust verdict, prevented an adequate defense, or threatened the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Tuitt, <em>supra </em>at 712 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">\u201c[T]he determination of waiver may properly be based on \u2018the background, experience, and conduct of the accused\u2019 and the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, supra </em>at 368, quoting from <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938). The defendant, in his mid-fifties, was highly experienced with the criminal justice system. The prosecutor noted that, \u201c[ljooking at the defendant\u2019s record, he has as bad a record as I\u2019ve ever seen in this court.\u201d As the judge observed, \u201cit goes back to the Johnson administration.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Apparently the defendant had served approximately twenty years on other convictions, many of which were for similar crimes, in prisons in various East Coast States. He additionally made it abundantly clear that he did not wish to proceed \\yith his appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The lessons of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 552, 556-557 (1987), are illuminating. \u201c[A] finding that [the defendant] was knowledgeable may rest on a complex of factors. Here we have positive indications of an adequate understanding. The defendant had intimate experience of criminal procedures: his criminal record was extensive and included a number of charges like those at bar. . . . We conclude that a compelling case is made for holding in the particular circumstances that the judge did not abuse his discretion in declining to appoint substitute counsel at the defendant\u2019s last-minute request. Further, the defendant understood the consequences of the waiver involved\u201d (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">As further indication of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the criminal justice system, his self-representation was noteworthy. He asked appropriate questions and made appropriate comments.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He ultimately had counsel available to him on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>standby basis. Given his background and the evidence against him, it appears that the defendant was fully aware of the consequences of his actions and of his waiver.* *******<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-9\"> in a case where identification was the sole live issue, two disinterested witnesses testified that they saw the defendant exit a building from a broken window through which a break-in had occurred. They kept the defendant in their sight at all times until the police arrested him. That they would so testify at trial was clear from testimony at a pretrial hearing on a motion to suppress the identifications, which was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-6\"> Failure to do so might also be viewed as in contravention of the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct. See, e.g., Mass.R.Prof.C. 1.3, 426 Mass. 1313 (1998) (\u201cA lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client. The lawyer should represent a client zealously within the bounds of the law\u201d); Mass.R.Prof.C. 1.3 comment [3] (\u201cUnless the relationship is terminated as provided in Rule 1.16, a lawyer should carry through to conclusion all matters undertaken for a client\u201d); Mass.R.Prof.C. 1.16(d), 426 Mass. 1369 (1998) (\u201cUpon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client\u2019s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled, and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned\u201d); Mass.R.Prof.C. 1.16 comment [5] (\u201cAn appointed lawyer should advise.a client seeking to discharge the appointed lawyer of the consequences of such an action, including the possibility that the client may be required to proceed pro se\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\"> Because of the closeness to the trial date and the uncertainty whether a continuance would be granted, counsel was obligated to be ready for trial. If a continuance is granted upon the representation of counsel that he is unprepared, in circumstances similar to those here, it is within a judge\u2019s discretion to impose financial sanctions upon counsel based upon the approximate value of resources wasted by the continuance. See generally Mass.R.Crim.P. 10(b), 378 Mass. 862 (1979); Mass.R.CrimP. 48, 378 Mass. 923 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b584-8\"> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fogarty, </em>25 Mass.

Of course, both inquiry and response must be appropriately tempered to protect attorney-client confidentiality.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Lyndon B.
