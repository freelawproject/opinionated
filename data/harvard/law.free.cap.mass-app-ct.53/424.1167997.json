We also discuss the claims of one of the insurance carriers for reimbursement of benefits and penalties paid to the employee. Both insurance companies and the employee filed appeals from the decision of the Department of Industrial Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>cidents reviewing board (reviewing board). On motion of the parties, the appeals were consolidated. A single justice of this court reported the case to a panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><em>Factual background. </em>The employee is a Massachusetts resident. She was hired at the Boston headquarters of Patriots\u2019 Trail Girl Scout Council, Inc. (employer), to be a camp counselor and unit leader at Camp Wabasso in Bradford, New Hampshire, for the summer of 1994. In July, she was injured in the course of her employment. She was treated at a New Hampshire hospital and released the same day. The parties ultimately stipulated to the extent and duration of the employee\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">At the time of the injury, the employer carried two workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies. A Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty Mutual) policy covered New Hampshire claims and those of some other states, but explicitly excluded coverage for claims under Massachusetts law. A Massachusetts Bay Self-Insurance Group, Inc. (Mass. Bay) policy covered only Massachusetts claims. Following the employee\u2019s injury in New Hampshire and the filing of a first report there, Liberty Mutual paid some of the employee\u2019s medical bills under its New Hampshire policy, but denied payment of weekly benefits under that policy on the ground that there was \u201cno medical evidence to substantiate disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\"><em>Administrative proceedings. </em>Some time after the employee returned home to Massachusetts, she filed a claim against Liberty Mutual with the Commonwealth\u2019s Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA). Liberty Mutual denied the Massachusetts claim on the ground, among others, that it did not provide coverage under the Commonwealth\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law. The employee then filed a claim against Mass. Bay with the DIA. At the conference pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A, an administrative judge of the DIA ordered Liberty Mutual to pay the employee\u2019s benefits. Liberty Mutual filed a motion for reconsideration. A month later, when Liberty Mutual had not paid the benefits required by the conference order, the employee requested a status conference. At the status conference Liberty Mutual again asserted that it was not an insurer under the Massachusetts Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Mass. Bay agreed to accept an amended order, which required it to pay the employee benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15A, while at the same time appealing the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Following an evidentiary hearing, see G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11, the administrative judge found that Liberty Mutual was an insurer under c. 152, \u00a7 1(7). He concluded that Liberty Mutual had waived its defense that it was not an insurer under Massachusetts law by failing to assert that defense in its original denial of the employee\u2019s New Hampshire claim and by paying medical benefits under New Hampshire law. The administrative judge also thought it relevant that the Liberty Mutual premiums for the New Hampshire policy were based at least in part on the payroll for Camp Wabasso, which included the employee\u2019s wages. In consequence of these conclusions, he ordered Liberty Mutual to pay (1) the stipulated benefits to the employee; (2) a penalty of $10,000 to the employee pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8(1), for failure to comply with the conference order; (3) a penalty to the DIA pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14(l)(a), for a frivolous defense; and (4) attorney\u2019s fees and costs to both the employee and Mass. Bay for \u201cdefending] this claim . . . without reasonable grounds,\u201d doubled because of the complexity of the issues. He also ordered Liberty Mutual to reimburse Mass. Bay for the compensation Mass. Bay had paid the employee pursuant to the amended order. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15A. To avoid further penalties, Liberty Mutual paid all of these costs and penalties. See <em>Alliy </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 688, 690 &amp; n.2 (1996). It then appealed the administrative judge\u2019s decision to the reviewing board. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The reviewing board determined that \u201ceach and every order against [Liberty Mutual was] contrary to law.\u201d The board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s decision, including all of the judge\u2019s orders against Liberty Mutual. It ordered Mass. Bay to pay all amounts due to the employee under her workers\u2019 compensation claim as well as her attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Liberty Mutual then filed a motion to amend, requesting the reviewing board to clarify the obligations of all the parties, including the employee\u2019s obligation to repay the $10,000 penalty as well as Liberty Mutual\u2019s right to recover duplicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>payments made as a result of the hearing decisions. The reviewing board denied the motion, on the ground that its \u201cdecision sufficiently set[] out the rights and obligations of all the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\"><em>Issues on appeal. </em>There is no dispute that Massachusetts law applies to the employee\u2019s claim, because she entered the employment contract here. <em>Lavoie\u2019s Case, </em>334 Mass. 403, 406, cert, denied, 352 U.S. 927 (1956). <em>Conant\u2019s Case, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 695, 695-696 (1992). See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26. The employee argues that the reviewing board should not have reversed the penalties against Liberty Mutual and that she is therefore entitled to retain Liberty Mutual\u2019s penalty payment (and apparently the duplicate benefit payments as well). Mass. Bay argues that the reviewing board erred in concluding that Mass. Bay was responsible for paying the employee\u2019s claim because it is Liberty Mutual whose premiums reflect the employee\u2019s wages. Liberty Mutual filed two briefs: one in its role as appellee supporting the reviewing board\u2019s decision; the other as appellant seeking a clear directive \u201caffirming] its right to reimbursement of the duplicate benefit payments and the $10,000 [\u00a7 8(1)] award.\u201d (The briefs were filed before the cases were consolidated.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">We accept the decision of the reviewing board if not tainted by error under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(a)-(&lt;f), (/Mg)\u2022 <em>Robinson\u2019s Case, </em>416 Mass. 454, 457 (1993). See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12(2); <em>Haley\u2019s Case, </em>356 Mass. 678, 680 (1970); <em>Phillips\u2019s Case, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 612, 615 (1996). We \u201cgive due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the [department], as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, as amended by St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\"><em>Definition of an insurer. </em>The reviewing board concluded that \u201cthe fundamental problem in the [administrative judge\u2019s] decision [was] its disregard of the statutory definition of \u2018insurer,\u2019 \u201d under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7). The board ruled that \u201cLiberty Mutual was not an \u2018insurer\u2019 in Massachusetts under [the statutory] definition, and no order of payment from the [DIA] could issue against it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7), as amended by St. 1950, c. 277, \u00a7 2, an insurer is \u201cany insurance company . . . which has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>contracted with an employer to pay the compensation provided for by [c. 152].\u201d The board\u2019s decision that Liberty Mutual was not an insurer under this definition is sound. Liberty Mutual\u2019s policy with the employer explicitly provides in Part One that the workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy applies only to New Hampshire\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation law. No other state is listed. Massachusetts is explicitly excluded from the provisions regarding \u201cOther States Insurance\u201d as well. On the other hand, the employer\u2019s policy with Mass. Bay applies only to the \u201cWorkers\u2019 Compensation Law of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u201cA policy of insurance whose provisions are plainly and definitely expressed in appropriate language must be enforced in accordance with its terms.\u201d <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>387 Mass. 142, 146 (1982) (citations omitted). Here, the Liberty Mutual policy specifically excluded coverage under Massachusetts law, while Mass. Bay\u2019s policy is explicitly limited to Massachusetts coverage. (The explanation for changes in the employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance carriers and the need for separate policies is not relevant to the issues before us.) The reviewing board\u2019s determination that \u201cthe only policy available for the payment of benefits in Massachusetts was that of Mass. Bay\u201d was well warranted. See <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Transformer Serv., Inc., </em>374 Mass. 704, 711-712 (1978) (\u201cpolicy written for the insured was confined in its body to liability pursuant to the laws of New Hampshire and New York\u201d; insurer\u2019s denial of coverage was binding in litigation against uninsured employer). Cf. <em>HDH Corp. </em>v. <em>Atlantic Charter Ins. Co., </em>425 Mass. 433, 437 (1997) (workers\u2019 compensation insurer had no obligation to defend where employee brought civil action against employer rather than claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, as required by statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Mass. Bay argues that the workers\u2019 compensation carrier whose premiums reflect the injured employee\u2019s wages is responsible for the workers\u2019 compensation payments. The law clearly provides otherwise. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26; <em>Lavoie\u2019s Case, </em>334 Mass, at 406; <em>Hayes\u2019s Case, </em>348 Mass. 447, 450-452 (1965) (payment of premium based on payroll in which claimant\u2019s salary was included did not confer coverage where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>claimant was not employee). See also <em>Louis\u2019s Case, </em>424 Mass. 136, 141 (1997) (successor insurer payments). Cf. <em>Employers Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Merrimac Mills Co., </em>325 Mass. 676, 681-682 (1950) (pursuant to provision in policy, employer was liable to pay additional premiums after policy period, depending on amount of remuneration actually paid during applicable period). See generally 3 Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 63.04 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><em>Penalty. </em>The reviewing board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s order, explicitly addressing each aspect of the judge\u2019s decision. The board held that \u201cthe judge\u2019s order of \u00a7 14 penalties . . . cannot stand\u201d; reversed the order of \u00a7 8(1) penalties against Liberty Mutual for refusing to pay the conference order; and termed the order that Liberty Mutual reimburse Mass. Bay under \u00a7 15A \u201cunfounded.\u201d The basis for the reviewing board\u2019s decision was its conclusion that \u201cLiberty Mutual was never subject to liability under the Massachusetts law, [and therefore] . . . cannot be held to have violated that law in any way by its refusal to pay.\u201d The various penalty provisions all refer to an \u201cinsurer.\u201d See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 8(1), 14. Having decided that there was no error in the reviewing board\u2019s determination that Liberty Mutual is not an insurer, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7), there is no basis for us to find error in the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\"><em>Recoupment. </em>At the conclusion of its (appellant\u2019s) brief, Liberty Mutual requests that this court \u201caffirm [Liberty Mutual\u2019s] right to reimbursement of the duplicate benefit payments [to the employee] and the $10,000 [penalty] award[ed to her].\u201d The argument is that if, as the board found, Liberty Mutual was not an insurer of Massachusetts claims, it should not have been called upon to make any payments, and therefore it is entitled to recover the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">There is statutory as well as case law support for recovery of payments made under the workers\u2019 compensation statute. As to statutory relief, see, e.g., G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 7 (as in effect prior to 1985, see St. 1972, c. 742, \u00a7 1, authorizing State treasurer to seek reimbursement from employee); G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11D(3) (inserted by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 32, providing that \u201crecoupment may be ordered pursuant to the filing of a complaint pursuant to [G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10,] or by bringing an action against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>employee in [S]uperior [C]curt\u201d). See also <em>Pedro </em>v. <em>Spaulding Co., </em>3 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 76, 82 (1989) (holding that omission in 1985 reform act, see St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 18, of provision for recoupment was \u201coversight\u201d and resort could be had to the \u201ccatch-all\u201d provision set out in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10[1]); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Highland House Apartments, </em>12 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 322, 325 &amp; n.6 (1998) (overpayments made by mistake may be recouped by filing claim under \u00a7 10[1], based on \u201cthe language of \u00a7 11D[3], . . . considered together with the board\u2019s equitable powers and the historic right of recoupment . . .\u201d). Compare, as to the board\u2019s equitable powers, <em>Utica Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 262, 267 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">However, although workers\u2019 compensation law has authorized recoupment of monies paid, such payment appears to be a matter of discretion, see <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Highland House Apartments, </em>12 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. at 326, unless the employee is currently receiving benefits. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11D(2), (3). The exercise of discretion requires fact finding, cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>380 Mass. 851, 854 (1980) (exercise of discretion in setting bail), a task that neither the reviewing board nor this court is authorized to undertake. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 11C, 12(2). \u201cIt is well established that a court \u2018will not decide a workers\u2019] compensation case on the merits unless the record demonstrates that the parties have exhausted their available administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Utica Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. at 264, quoting from <em>Assuncao\u2019s Case, </em>372 Mass. 6, 8 (1977). Such is not the case here. We therefore leave the parties to pursue such further action as they may elect.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">\n<em>Decision of the reviewing board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
