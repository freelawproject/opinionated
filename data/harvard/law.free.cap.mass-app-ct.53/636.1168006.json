The judge did so after the Commonwealth\u2019s first witness, the arresting officer, impermissibly testified that a breathalyzer had been offered to the defendant after his arrest. The propriety of the declaration of a mistrial is not at issue on appeal. The Commonwealth appeals only the order barring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>retrial, claiming that the judge employed an incorrect legal standard and that application of the correct standard would in the circumstances permit retrial. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\"><em>Factual background. </em>The defendant, William G. Curtis, Jr., was arraigned on charges of operating under the influence of liquor and failing to stop for a police officer. Defense counsel requested that the trial prosecutor avoid mention of the breathalyzer examination offered to the defendant after his arrest, in accordance with G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commonwealth complied, advising its witnesses to avoid any such reference. Nonetheless, its first witness, in a nonresponsive answer to an innocuous question, testified that a breathalyzer test had been offered to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Defense counsel promptly objected, successfully moved to strike the reference, and after a brief sidebar, moved to dismiss. The judge rejected the motion as untimely on the rationale that jeopardy had already attached, and treated the motion as one for mistrial. The defendant argued that had the prosecutor in fact, as earlier promised, warned his witnesses not to mention the breathalyzer examination, the subsequent mention by an experienced police officer in the face of such warning constitutes the \u201ckind of intentional conduct that [the court] would need to find to dismiss the case based upon prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d The judge noted that the prosecutor\u2019s question \u201cdid not invite the [officer\u2019s] answer,\u201d a comment made even before hearing the prosecutor\u2019s version of events, i.e., that he had advised the officer of the breathalyzer prohibition just before the witness entered the court room, and that the question was not calculated to elicit such a reference. The judge then allowed the motion for mistrial, and the defendant immediately thereafter renewed his motion for dismissal. The judge ruled from the bench that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">\u201cIt\u2019s not a Motion to Dismiss, but I find no manifest necessity for this case to be re-tried in light of the conversation that was held between the [prosecutor] and the witness, an experienced police officer one who at a minimum should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>have known better than to [elicit] a breathaly[z]er-right question before a jury and then having been re-advised did so. In any event, I find there is no manifest necessity to ever try this case again.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">She then allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">At this point, the officer stepped forward to apologize. While conceding that he should have known better, he claimed that he had not intended to mention the breathalyzer test, that the reference was \u201cjust a slip,\u201d and that he had just raced from another proceeding in the same court house. The judge accepted the apology, as did defense counsel, who added, \u201cI don\u2019t think it was any free-willed intent but nonetheless.\u201d The judge concurred with defense counsel\u2019s assessment and, sometime later that day, ordered that the following findings be entered on the docket:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">\u201cThe [prosecutor] is without fault; in fact, he sought to prevent any potential problem by interviewing the arresting officer in advance of trial and at the request of defense counsel. He made it clear to the officer that he should not mention the breathalyzer test. At trial, the officer offered testimony about the breathalyzer test \u2014 that the defendant was offered the test. The testimony was not responsive to the Commonwealth\u2019s question. Accordingly, the Court finds prosecutorial misconduct and therefore a retrial is barred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">\n<em>Discussion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">1. <em>The Commonwealth\u2019s right of appeal. </em>The defendant has moved to dismiss the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal, arguing that the Commonwealth may not take an appeal from the declaration of a mistrial with prejudice, which he maintains is neither a dismissal nor an otherwise appealable interlocutory order. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E; Mass.R.Crim.P. 15, as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996). The defendant observes that the Commonwealth has not sought to retry the defendant and that no motion to dismiss has been granted from which an appeal might then otherwise lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>In determining whether the Commonwealth may take an appeal from a judicial action, we look to the true nature of the action rather than to what it has been termed or to its particular form. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hosmer, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 188, 189-190 (2000). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Babb, </em>389 Mass. 275, 281 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam Hue To, </em>391 Mass. 301, 306 n.5 (1984) (single justice correctly inferred from entire record that trial judge intended for dismissal to preclude further proceedings); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vaidulas, </em>433 Mass. 247, 252 (2001) (claim that court cannot review improperly captioned notice of appeal \u201celevates form over substance\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 570, 571 (1986) (oral motion for mistrial raised after jury returned verdict and was discharged is treated as motion for new trial). We are not bound by labels or checkmarks on a form. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hosmer, supra </em>at 189. \u201cWhether the Commonwealth has a right of appeal from the judge\u2019s ruling does not turn on the defendant\u2019s characterization of his motion as one for a mistrial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powers, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The judge declared a mistrial upon the defendant\u2019s request; such an action ordinarily is neither appealable by the Commonwealth nor a bar to retrial on double jeopardy grounds. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam Hue To, supra </em>at 310-311. Yet, in declaring a mistrial \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d the judge explicitly prohibited the prosecution from retrying the defendant and entered findings to that effect. The essence of the judicial action was finality: to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hosmer, supra </em>at 190. As such, it is reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">2. <em>The bar on retrial. </em>As noted above, a mistrial declared upon a defendant\u2019s request ordinarily does not present a bar to retrial on double jeopardy grounds. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam Hue To, supra. </em>An order of a mistrial or of a dismissal based upon prosecutorial misconduct bars retrial only if the misconduct is of a specific character: \u201c \u2018some form of \u201coverreaching,\u201d \u201charassment,\u201d or other intentional misconduct on the part of the prosecution aimed at provoking a mistrial . . . .\u2019 Unintentional prosecutorial mistakes, arising from negligence or inadvertence . . . , although resulting in mistrials, do not bar a second trial.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>45 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>App. Ct. 271, 274 (1998).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam Hue To, supra </em>at 311 (misconduct involving prosecution\u2019s lack of disclosure of exculpatory evidence and inept and \u201cbungling\u201d performance by police was insufficient to invoke double jeopardy bar); <em>Donavan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>426 Mass. 13, 14-16 (1997) (unintentional failure to lay proper foundation to expert testimony insufficient to bar retrial on double jeopardy grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">It is plain from the record before us that, at least initially, the judge applied the wrong legal standard when she barred retrial after determining that there was no manifest necessity to retry the defendant. The \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d test has no application in situations where, as here, the defendant requested or effectively consented to the mistrial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phetsaya, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 293, 297 (1996). Addtionally, \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d refers to the need to grant a mistrial over the defendant\u2019s objection, not the need to retry the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>ibid. </em>The judge\u2019s subsequently entered findings complicate rather than correct this error. The entry does not refer to the \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d test or even to the mistrial order, but instead cites \u201cprosecutorial misconduct\u201d as the reason to bar retrial. Even assuming these findings reflect a belated attempt to apply the proper legal standard, we conclude that the order must nonetheless be vacated because the judge failed to make findings necessary to bar a retrial, viz., that the prosecutorial misconduct constituted \u201c \u2018overreaching,\u2019 \u2018harassment,\u2019 or other intentional misconduct on the part of the prosecution aimed at provoking a mistrial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">We recognize that the specific character of the prosecutorial misconduct at issue presents a \u201cquestion of fact.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>403 Mass. 441, 448 (1988). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murchison, </em>392 Mass. 273, 276 (1984) (remanding case for further findings and rulings in light of decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam Hue To, </em>391 Mass. 301 [1984]). Nevertheless, we think a remand unnecessary since findings of prosecutorial provocation, overreaching or harassment, are simply not supportable on this record. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, supra </em>at 274-275. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam Hue To, </em>391 Mass, at 312. The judge neither found nor even suggested that she disbelieved the police officer\u2019s explanation. Indeed, the defendant does not contend that either the prosecutor or the officer desired to induce a mistrial. Nonetheless, he chafes at the description of the misconduct as simple \u201cinadvertence\u201d and appears to suggest that this case involves misconduct of a reckless nature warranting the severest sanction. The defendant, however, neither cites to controlling authority for such a proposition nor suggests any persuasive reason why retrial should be barred merely because of an unintentional reference by an officer who, all agree, \u201cshould have known better.\u201d Though a reckless reference in certain circumstances might prove sufficiently egregious to constitute overreaching, this is not such a case. See <em>Donavan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 15 n.2 (acknowledging cases from other jurisdictions, cited by defendant in that case, that bar retrial as result of egregious or gross misconduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">There is no intimation here that the prosecutor or the officer sought to avoid the completion of the trial or acted in bad faith, that the Commonwealth\u2019s case was lacking, or that irremediable harm to the defendant resulted from the utterance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam Hue To, supra', Donavan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>426 Mass, at 14, 16; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. at 274-275. We reverse the order barring retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-15\"> The defendant also was charged with failing to stop for a police officer and cited for speeding and operating without lights being displayed. \u25a0</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b661-8\"> The statute reads in relevant part: \u201cEvidence that the defendant failed or refused to consent to such test or analysis shall not be admissible against him in a civil or criminal proceeding . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(e), as appearing in St. 1994, c. 25, \u00a7 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b664-7\"> We assume for purposes of this case that police conduct is attributable to the Commonwealth for purposes of prosecutorial misconduct analysis. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam Hue To, </em>391 Mass, at 311.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b664-8\">It is unfortunate that the Commonwealth at the time neither voiced an objection to the \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d test used by the judge, nor attempted then or in a later motion for reconsideration to alert the judge to the correct legal standard; any of these steps might well have obviated the need for this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
