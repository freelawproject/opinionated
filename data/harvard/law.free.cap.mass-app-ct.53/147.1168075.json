Following probation violation hearings conducted on January 26 and 28, 2000, a second judge found that \u201con or about November 12, 1999, the defendant intentionally hit . . . Tori Beal in the right side of her face which resulted in a visible injury,\u201d and that by reason of this \u201csubsequent criminal activ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>ity\u201d the defendant had violated the terms of his probation. That judge revoked the defendant\u2019s probation, committing him on a suspended sentence that had previously been imposed. The defendant appeals, contesting the sufficiency of the probation violation evidence. There being no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Au9\">Officer Ronald Hilchey, a Haverhill police officer, testified for the Commonwealth to the events material to the probation violatian proceedings. Officer Hilchey responded within \u201ca minute\u201d to a radio dispatch describing a domestic disturbance at 7 Apple Street. Tori Beal, the defendant\u2019s live-in girlfriend, answered the door, and Officer Hilchey interviewed her. Officer Hilchey gave an account of that interview.</p>\n<p id=\"AXn\">According to Hilchey, Ms. Beal was \u201cvery upset and crying.\u201d She had a \u201cbruise\u201d on her right cheek that \u201cappeared to be a fresh bruise.\u201d The sweatshirt she was wearing had \u201cblood spots on [the] sleeve.\u201d She kept repeating that she was concerned for her son\u2019s safety. She said she had been drinking with her boyfriend, and she was concerned that her boyfriend would be angry at the baby. When first asked about the mark on her face, \u201cshe didn\u2019t really want to say anything because she didn\u2019t want to get anybody in trouble.\u201d Asked again, she said she was \u201cpunched in the face\u201d by the defendant. Pressed on this point by Hilchey, she repeated she was punched in the face, but then said \u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t right.\u201d When Hilchey told her that he believed she had been struck, she said she did not want the defendant arrested. When asked about prior episodes, she said that the defendant had been charged with the same type of domestic violence crime before. She told Hilchey that her face hurt, but refused an ambulance, explaining that it was \u201conly a punch.\u201d She refused to sign the police report, explaining that she did not want to get the defendant in trouble. The Commonwealth rested at the conclusion of Hilchey\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"AKh\">Tori Beal testified for the defendant. On cross-examination, she stated that she called the police on the evening in question, but then she added that, because she was drunk at the time, she did not remember calling the police but was told that she had. She also testified that she bruised her face when she fell out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>an automobile,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but she acknowledged, on cross-examination, that she never gave that explanation to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">A neighbor, Howard Hart, testified for the defendant. On cross-examination he acknowledged that Ms. Beal had told him, and had told the police in his presence, that the defendant had hit her.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3Ms. Beal\u2019s father also testified for the defendant. Regarding the bruise on his daughter\u2019s face, he testified, \u201c[I]t didn\u2019t look like a fall .... [I]t looked like a welt, kind of swelled up a little bit, all red. . . . Looked like she got, looked like she got hit to me but that\u2019s what I was trying to find out [from her].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"pAZ\">The judge entered his written findings. See rule 7(c) of the District Court Rules for Probation Violation Proceedings (West 2001) (\u201cThe court shall make written findings of fact to support the finding of a violation, stating the evidence relied upon\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After reciting the procedural background of the proceedings, the judge wrote, \u201cI find that on or about November 12, 1999, the defendant intentionally hit the same Tori A. Beal in the right side of her face which resulted in a visible injury. . . . Accordingly, I find that the defendant violated his terms of probation reason of criminal activity.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The defendant made no objection to any question by the prosecutor that sought hearsay statements of Ms. Beal, no doubt because of rule 6(a) of the District Court Rules for Probation Violation Proceedings (West 2001) (\u201cHearsay evidence shall be admissible at probation violation hearings\u201d). However, on appeal the defendant relies on rule 6(b) of those rules:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">\u201cWhere the sole evidence submitted to prove a violation of probation is hearsay, that evidence shall be suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ficient only if the court finds in writing (1) that such evidence is substantially trustworthy and demonstrably reliable and (2), if the alleged violation is charged or uncharged criminal behavior, that the probation officer has good cause for proceeding without a witness with personal knowledge of the evidence presented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>______</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>District Court Rules for Probation Violation Proceedings 6(b) (West 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The official commentary to rule 6(b) points out that this rule addresses those cases where \u201cthe probationer has no opportunity to confront a witness with personal knowledge and test the reliability of that evidence by cross-examination. This deprivation of the right to confrontation of witnesses implicates due process considerations.\u201d Commentary to rule 6(b) of the District Court Rules for Probation Violation Proceedings at 603 (West 2001). See <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 489 (1972) (\u201cminimum requirements of due process [in probation revocation cases] include . . . the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses . . . unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation . . .\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass. 108, 112-120 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Emmanuel E., </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 451, 453-455 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Obviously, the defendant was not denied the right to confront Ms. Beal or Mr. Hart regarding the statements attributed to Ms. Beal. See note 2, <em>supra, </em>as to Mr. Hart. Ms. Beal testified for the defendant. On direct examination, Ms. Beal denied that the defendant hit her on November 11, 1999; she added that she was confused by Hilchey\u2019s questions. She also testified that she told Hilchey that the defendant had not hit her. We conclude that the defendant was not denied due process by the admission of Hilchey\u2019s testimony regarding Ms. Beal\u2019s statements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">There was no error and the Commonwealth sustained its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s order revoking the defendant\u2019s probation and committing him on his suspended sentence forthwith is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"A4V\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-8\"> This version of events was also testified to by another defense witness, Eileen Fleming, a friend of Ms. Beal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b173-9\"> On redirect, Mr. Hart testified that he did not remember whether it was Ms. Beal or the police who said the defendant hit Ms. Beal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b173-10\"> The rules were adopted on December 2, 1999, and went into effect on January 3, 2000, prior to the hearing in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b173-11\"> The defendant makes no claim that subsequent criminal activity is not a violation of a condition of his probation. Moreover, because he makes no claim as to the adequacy of the judge\u2019s written findings under rule 7(c), that point is waived and requires no discussion. See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b174-9\"> Because of the conclusions we reach, we need not discuss the defendant\u2019s argument that Ms. Beal\u2019s statements were not excited utterances (as argued by the Commonwealth), and were inadmissible under rule 6(b)(2) because of the failure of the Commonwealth to show \u201cgood cause\u201d for proceeding \u201cwithout a witness with personal knowledge of the evidence presented.\u201d As noted in the text, the availability of Ms. Beal to the defendant made rule 6(b) irrelevant to the analysis of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"AqL\"> The fact that the complaint on this alleged assault and battery was later dismissed is of no consequence to our decision because of the different standard of proof and evidentiary rules in a criminal prosecution. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Holmgren, </em>421 Mass. 224, 225-226 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
