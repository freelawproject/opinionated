Because the arresting officer was not justified in stopping the defendant\u2019s vehicle, we reverse the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-16\">In reviewing the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion, we accept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>the motion judge\u2019s factual findings absent clear error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>420 Mass. 656, 657 (1995). \u201cHowever, the judge\u2019s ultimate findings and conclusions of law, especially those of constitutional dimensions, are open to independent review on appeal.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berment, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 522, 523 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Badore, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 600, 601 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The motion judge found the following facts. On Sunday, September 6, 1998, at approximately T.30 a.m., Richard Haley, a Westborough police officer on patrol in a marked cruiser received a radio dispatch from the Westborough police station to be on the lookout for a car. The description included the make, model, and license plate number. Haley was informed by the dispatcher that an off-duty police officer was following a vehicle on Route 9 in an easterly direction and had reported to the dispatcher on his cellular telephone that the car was traveling (together with another vehicle) in an erratic fashion. Haley, who was on Route 135 in Westborough, moved his car into position and received additional reports from the dispatcher, confirming the car\u2019s make and model and the progress of the vehicles as they came westerly from Southborough. Haley observed the described vehicles pass his position at the intersection of Route 135 and 9. Haley followed both vehicles for a quarter of a mile on Route 9 and noticed no motor vehicle infractions. On the basis of the report, however, he stopped one of the vehicles, which was driven by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In the course of the motion hearing, the prosecutor posed several questions to Haley about the source of the dispatcher\u2019s information. We have reproduced these in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Haley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>had no recollection whether the dispatcher actually knew the caller. Later in his testimony, Haley offered that only after the stop did he ascertain that it was reserve Officer McLaughlin who was the supposed caller. Neither the police radio dispatcher nor McLaughlin testified at the motion hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The dispositive question is whether the credibility of the caller or the reliability of his report was established. Under the broad constitutional claims recited in his motion, the defendant makes the argument that the stop of his motor vehicle was not premised upon reasonable suspicion based on specific facts and reasonable inferences that he had committed, was committing, or was about to commit a crime. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medeiros, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 240, 242 (1998). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>409 Mass. 16, 19 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grinkley, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 62, 66 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lubiejewski, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 212, 213-215 (2000). \u201c[T]he Commonwealth has the burden of showing . . . that \u2018the authorities had reasonable ground to believe that an exigency existed, and . . . [that] the actions . . . were reasonable under the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>429 Mass. 511, 515 (1999), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marchione, </em>384 Mass. 8, 10-11 (1981). That aspect of the government\u2019s proof passes muster. The problem lies with whether, under the relaxed version of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test, the government proved the \u201cveracity\u201d or \u201creliability\u201d prong of the test.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the case of proving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>informant\u2019s reliability, the burden of proof falls upon the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, supra </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">If there was reliability of the caller in the instant case, a conclusion that is far from inevitable from the record, it was a good deal more inchoate than the judge\u2019s findings indicate. \u201cWhere hearsay is the basis of action by the police, they must have a substantial basis for crediting the hearsay.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stevens, 362 </em>Mass. 24, 27 (1972), and cases cited. \u201cIf the police are relying on a radio transmission as grounds for the stop, there must be evidence presented at the suppression hearing as to its reliability.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medeiros, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. at 242. The government is far short of having proved anything so definitive here. The basic difficulty is not that McLaughlin was not personally known to Haley, compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciaramitaro, 26 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 110, 114-115 (1988), but that proof of this fact was entirely lacking at the motion hearing. Had there been proof that McLaughlin was a law enforcement officer known to Haley at the moment of the stop, the information he provided would have been presumed credible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, 36 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 252, 253 n.1 (1994). Here, the caller\u2019s representation that he was an off-duty police officer was established, if at all, after the stop. And there was nothing that Haley observed about the operation of the defendant\u2019s vehicle that corroborated the report. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, supra </em>at 19 (police corroboration may make up for deficiencies in either the reliability or basis of knowledge factors). It would have been relatively easy for the government to prove credibility by calling McLaughlin or the dispatcher as a witness at the motion hearing. Questions by the prosecutor that were apparently purposed at establishing the basis for Hale\u2019s stop failed to remedy this shortcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">We hold that the record does not support the judge\u2019s conclusion that the stop was justified. The judge\u2019s ruling was based on the caller himself having witnessed the defendant speeding and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>operating his vehicle in an erratic fashion. For that reason, it was critical for the government to prove his veracity. Haley only testified that at the time he initially observed the defendant\u2019s vehicle and signaled it to stop, the defendant was not exceeding the speed limit nor driving in an unusual fashion. At the time the defendant passed Haley, there was no motor vehicle violation warranting the stop. The reluctance of the motion judge to dismiss the case or suppress the evidence of Haley\u2019s observations of the defendant after the stop may be understandable since the effect of a dismissal or suppression would have resulted in the failure of the government\u2019s entire case. Nonetheless, we have repeatedly held that \u201c[wjhere the police rely on a police radio call to conduct an investigatory stop, under both Federal and State law, the Commonwealth must present evidence at the hearing on the motion to suppress on the factual basis for the police radio call in order to establish its indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berment, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 522, 526 (1995), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cheek, </em>413 Mass. 492, 494-495 (1992). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass. 541, 545-546 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Without Haley\u2019s testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s condition after the stop, the record is barren of any evidence of the defendant operating his motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor. As the evidence at the trial was the same as the evidence at the hearing, the guilty verdict is set aside, the judgment reversed, and judgment is to enter for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-17\"> The defendant was found not guilty of operating a motor vehicle negligently so as to endanger the public.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Q. \u201cWas there any other dispatch to you as to who was making the call, who was calling in to the Westborough Police Station with these observations?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">A. \u201cAh, I don\u2019t. . .
