We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">1. <em>\u201cCastle law\u201d instruction. </em>Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence obtained by a police officer after entering the defendant\u2019s apartment on the ground that the officer\u2019s entry in response to a complaint about a loud party was illegal. The motion was denied, and the trial judge denied a motion to resurrect the issue at trial. The defendant did not appeal from those denials, but on appeal claims that the judge erred in denying her request for a \u201ccastle law\u201d instruction because the evidence presented to the jury demonstrated that the officer\u2019s presence in the apartment was unlawful and that the defendant acted in the reasonable belief that the officer was about to inflict great bodily harm upon her. The trial judge denied the requested instruction on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to establish that she acted in the reasonable belief that the officer was about to inflict great bodily harm or death upon her.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">In determining the defendant\u2019s entitlement to a \u201ccastle law\u201d instruction, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to her. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>428 Mass. 393, 395 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paton, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 460, 463 (1991). That evidence may be summarized as follows. The police officer entered the defendant\u2019s apartment without her consent and without a warrant. At the time of the entry, there were nine people in the apartment, seven in the living room playing cards or watching television and two in the kitchen. The officer asked whose apartment it was, and the defendant acknowledged it was her apartment and that she was having a birthday party. The officer asked the defendant and three other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>people for identification. The defendant and the three individuals produced identification. The police officer left the apartment and returned approximately ten minutes later when he requested everyone to leave. The officer also told two individuals who had produced identification that they would be summonsed into court (ostensibly for being minors in possession of alcoholic beverages). The officer then entered the defendant\u2019s kitchen and seized two cases of beer. He told the defendant that he was taking the beer out of the house. The defendant objected, saying that she did not want him to take it without her permission or in the absence of another officer. The officer put the beer on the table and told her that if she said anything else he would have to arrest her (ostensibly for distributing alcohol to minors). The defendant continued to talk. As a result, the officer announced his intention to arrest her and grabbed her by her throat and arms and put her against the wall. In response, the defendant lashed out at the officer to get his arm off her neck and, in the defendant\u2019s words, \u201c[i]t just escalated from there.\u201d Thereafter, the officer sprayed mace in her eyes, hit her over the head with the mace can, and swung her headfirst onto the sofa, making it difficult for her to breathe. He forced her onto the floor where he handcuffed her and then dragged her out of the apartment; she was carried to a police cruiser by the arresting officer and another officer who had arrived on the scene after being summoned by the arresting officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">While there is a serious question whether the arresting officer was lawfully in the defendant\u2019s apartment, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kiser, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 647, 651-652 (2000) (police officer\u2019s entry into apartment without warrant in response to complaint of loud noise emanating from apartment was illegal because those circumstances did not meet test of exigent circumstances needed to justify exception to Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we need not address this issue because we agree with the trial judge that the evidence did not warrant a \u201ccastle law\u201d instruction. There was no evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the defendant\u2019s lashing out at the officer was precipitated by a reasonable belief that she was in danger of death or serious bodily harm. Rather, her use of force was a response to the officer\u2019s use of force upon her in making an arrest after she objected to his confiscation of her beer. As such, she had no right to use force to resist a lawful or unlawful arrest, unless the force used to arrest her was excessive or unnecessary. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montes, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 789, 792 (2000). While the defendant\u2019s version of the incident warranted an instruction that she had the right to use reasonable force to defend herself if the force used to arrest her was unnecessary or excessive, it did not warrant a \u201ccastle law\u201d instruction. The \u201ccastle law\u201d instruction was inapposite because, when faced with an arrest, a defendant has no right to self-defense except in the case of the use of excessive or unnecessary force and in those situations where the option of retreat or avoidance of physical combat has already been foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Although we are mindful that the judge in this case instructed the jury that \u201cfor the defendant to have acted in self-defense, she must have done everything that was reasonable in the circumstances to avoid physical combat before resorting to force,\u201d which may have obfuscated the issue of the defendant\u2019s right to self-defense, the defendant was not prejudiced by those remarks when the charge is viewed as a whole. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>429 Mass. 182, 185 (1999), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 386 (1997) (\u201c[w]e look to the charge as a whole to determine whether it fairly instructs the jury\u201d). Immediately following the judge\u2019s instructions on self-defense, the judge correctly instructed the jury that the defendant did not have the right to resist a lawful or unlawful arrest, but that \u201cif a police officer uses excessive force or unnecessary force to make an arrest, whether the arrest is legal or illegal, the person who is being arrested may defend him[self] or herself with as much force as . . . reasonably appears to be necessary.\u201d This instruction makes it clear that the defendant had the right to use force if the force used to make the arrest was unnecessary or excessive. Because the defendant averred that she did not attack the officer until he attempted to place her under arrest, the jury were not misled by the earlier instruction, and the defendant was not prejudiced by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>2. <em>Defense of property. </em>The defendant claims that she was entitled to an instruction on the right to protect her personal property from seizure and the right to protect her apartment from intrusion. Because the defendant did not request this instruction and did not object to the judge\u2019s omission of the instruction, our review is limited to the standard of a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. There was none.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The right to defend one\u2019s property relates to the right to use reasonable force \u201cto defend personal property from theft or destruction and real property from unwelcome invasion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Haddock, 46 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 248-249 n.2 (1999). Here, there was no evidence that the officer was attempting to steal or destroy the cases of beer that he removed from the defendant\u2019s apartment. Instead, where the beer was plausibly related to proof of the defendant\u2019s alleged distribution of alcohol to minors and the underage drinking observed by the officer, it was subject to seizure. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>District Ct. of Hampshire, </em>384 Mass. 736, 744-745 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Likewise, there is no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim that she was defending her real property from intrusion. At no time did the defendant voice any objection to the police officer\u2019s presence in her apartment. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haddock, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. at 247-249 (defendant almost immediately asked repossessors to leave her apartment). The evidence is uncontradicted that the altercation between the defendant and the police officer arose as a result of the officer\u2019s attempt to leave the apartment with the defendant\u2019s beer over the defendant\u2019s objection, and not because the defendant was attempting to repel his unwelcome intrusion into her apartment. We perceive no error in the omission of this instruction and certainly no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b412-15\"> A conviction of serving alcohol to a minor was placed on file with the defendant\u2019s consent. We therefore do not consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b413-6\"> The requested instruction is embodied in G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 8A, and provides as follows: \u201cIn the prosecution of a person who is an occupant of a dwelling charged with killing or injuring one who was unlawfully in said dwelling, it shall be a defense that the occupant was in his dwelling at the time of the offense and that he acted in the reasonable belief that the person unlawfully in said dwelling was about to inflict great bodily injury or death upon said occupant or upon another person lawfully in said dwelling, and that said occupant used reasonable means to defend himself or such other person lawfully in said dwelling. There shall be no duty on said occupant to retreat from such person unlawfully in said dwelling.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b414-6\"> But see <em>Howes </em>v. <em>Hitchcock, </em>66 F. Supp. 2d 203, 213-217 (D. Mass. 1999) (police officers could reasonably believe that exigent circumstances of potential destruction of evidence and potential threat to life and safety existed because of large underage drinking party with no parent home).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
