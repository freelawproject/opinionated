We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The jury could have reasonably found the following facts in support of their verdict: On July 6, 1978, Audrey Tamaro resided with her two children in an apartment in New Haven on the first floor of a four family duplex. Thomas Gaetano and Sandy Cicarilli lived in the apartment above Tamaro.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">In the early evening at approximately 8 p.m., Tamaro heard a disturbance outside the apartment building. Upon looking out her bedroom window, she observed an automobile pass in front of the duplex. She identified the driver as Anna Fariola, whom she had seen earlier that day. As the car slowly passed the duplex, Fariola yelled, \u201cTom, you son of a bitch.\u201d A male voice then added \u201cTom, we are going to kill you.\u201d Gaetano responded, \u201cFalcone I can\u2019t come down, you come up here. I am baby sitting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">The automobile went past the apartment building, turned around in a parking lot, and then came back toward the building. It came to a halt in front of Tamaro\u2019s apartment. Tamaro observed a man with dark hair and a beard sitting in the passenger seat. He thrust both arms out the window, pointed a pistol in her direction, and fired the weapon. The bullet struck her in the thigh, fracturing her femur, and causing other severe internal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">Relying on information supplied by Gaetano, the police arrested the defendant. Fariola\u2019s car was impounded, and later a fingerprint of the defendant was found on the rear view mirror.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">On July 11,1978, while recuperating in the hospital, the victim was shown a photo array of six men, all with beards and long dark hair. Tamaro picked out the defendant\u2019s picture and identified him as the man who shot her.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The first issue raised by the defendant is whether the court properly denied a post verdict motion for a new trial based upon the alleged failure of the prosecution to supply defense counsel with requested exculpatory or <em>\u201cBrady\u201d </em>material. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 96 S. Ct. 2392, 49 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1976); <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963). Prior to trial, the defendant made a general <em>\u201cBrady\u201d </em>request, demanding \u201call exculpatory information and material.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Packard, </em>184 Conn. 258, 439 A.2d 983 (1981); General Statutes \u00a7 54-86c;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7 741.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The prosecution responded to the motion, declaring that the only exculpatory material known to the prosecution was Gaetano\u2019s oral retraction of a statement given to the New Haven police department that was already known to defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">After the trial had concluded, the New Haven Register printed a story on April 6,1980, detailing the personal trauma the victim had suffered as a result of the incident. In the article, Tamaro stated she had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>unconscious for four days after the shooting. She also described her mental condition during the recuperative period as \u201cparanoid.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>'</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">On May 2,1980, during the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor remarked that the victim was \u201ca woman who is totally paranoid . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6Relying on this choice of words and the newspaper report, the defendant argued that the prosecutor knew of the victim\u2019s physical and mental condition at the time of her photo identification of the defendant, as well as at trial, and that the failure to divulge this information has denied him a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>In order to establish a violation <em>o\u00ed Brady </em>and its progeny, the defendant must demonstrate the prosecution had possession of material<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> information favorable to the accused that was not disclosed upon request. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bember, </em>183 Conn. 394, 404-405, 439 A.2d 387 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrara, </em>176 Conn. 508, 513-15, 408 A.2d 265 (1979). The defendant has failed to present to this court any reliable evidence that the prosecution knew the victim was unconscious for four days prior to the photo identification of the defendant, or that the prosecution knew the victim was suffering from paranoid delusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">At oral argument the defendant candidly admitted he was not aware of what information the prosecution had concerning the victim\u2019s physical or mental condition subsequent to the shooting. Instead, the defendant would have this court rely on a newspaper article as support for the proposition that the prosecution did, in fact, have such knowledge before or during trial. Apart from its general inadmissibility as a basis for a finding of fact,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the newspaper article does not even suggest that the prosecution was aware of the state of Tamaro\u2019s mental or physical condition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ant contends, however, that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks at the sentencing hearing corroborate his assertion that the prosecutor knew of the victim\u2019s condition. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">It appears that the prosecutor used the term \u201cparanoid\u201d in a hyperbolic fashion while arguing for the imposition of the sentence recommended by the state. Certainly he was not qualified to make a diagnosis of the victim\u2019s mental condition. Nor are we convinced that merely because he employed the same term as used by the newspaper, he must therefore be charged with knowledge prior to publication of all the information contained therein. At most, the prosecutor expressed a personal opinion,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> unsupported by medical evidence, based possibly on his reading of the newspaper article or upon his discussions with the victim. The <em>Brady </em>rule simply does not encompass the prosecutor\u2019s personal opinions concerning every facet of a case, especially when those opinions may be based upon information the prosecutor received after trial from a source also available to the defendant. Accord <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>supra, 109; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>408 U.S. 786, 795, 92 S. Ct. 2562, 33 L. Ed. 2d 706, reh. denied, 409 U.S. 897, 93 S. Ct. 87, 34 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Packard, </em>supra, 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">In sum, the defendant has done no more than speculate on the contents of the prosecution\u2019s files. This court has held that \u201c[a] finding of error cannot be based on the unsupported speculation of the defense that there were other constitutionally material matters in the state\u2019s file which were not turned over to the defense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grasso, </em>172 Conn. 298, 303, 374 A.2d 239 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>(1977), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Moynahan, </em>164 Conn. 560, 593, 325 A.2d 199, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 976, 94 S. Ct. 291, 38 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1973). Accordingly, we hold that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">The defendant\u2019s next claim of error concerns a statement made by the prosecutor during the state\u2019s closing argument, and the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury with respect to that statement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Specifically, he asserts (1) that the prosecutor improperly addressed the jury during closing argument by commenting on an objection made by the defendant; and (2) that the charge to the jury failed to cure the resulting prejudice. We first set out the factual background in which the issue arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">On the evening of July 6, 1978, Sergeant Michael Sweeney, of the New Haven police department, taped a statement given by Gaetano. On July 12, when the statement had been transcribed, Gaetano refused to sign it, stating he had been mistaken and now wished to give a new statement. Sweeney refused to record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Gaetano\u2019s retraction, believing Gaetano was lying. Subsequently, on July 19, Gaetano appeared at defense counsel\u2019s office where he signed a statement repudiating his prior conversations with Sweeney.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the summer of 1979 Gaetano drowned.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">At trial, the defendant introduced the statement of July 19 into evidence without objection. When the state attempted to introduce the statement of July 12, the defendant\u2019s objection was sustained and the document was excluded. Relying on the admitted document and other evidence, the defendant attempted to demonstrate that the police investigation was performed in a manner that would \u201ccover-up\u201d the allegedly mistaken arrest of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"A74\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>During his summation, the prosecutor tried to discredit the defendant\u2019s cover-up theory. While discussing the July 19 statement he stated: \u201cEventually, he [defense counsel] offers his own statement that he took on July 19th, 1978. As you recall after coming out, after argument, the State had no objection to that statement going in. The State is not just interested in convicting people, but looking for the truth. You can read it and make your own opinion as to what Thomas Gaetano was saying. On redirect, let\u2019s let it all hang out and let\u2019s have the statement that he gave to Sgt. Sweeney, the statement that he gave at the scene. No, you don\u2019t have those. All I am saying is, who might be hiding something in this case? All you have now is one statement of Thomas Gaetano, some retraction on July 19th, 1978.\u201d The defendant did not immediately object, but waited until after the court\u2019s charge to the jury which included a general caveat that no inference should be drawn where an objection to evidence was raised. At that time counsel excepted to the charge, orally requesting a more elaborate charge concerning a party\u2019s right to object to evidence. At no time did he request a mistrial. After the verdict the defendant made a motion for a new trial based upon the court\u2019s failure to give a more forceful instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>When reviewing allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, it must be kept in mind that \u201c[a] prosecutor is not an ordinary advocate. His duty is to see that justice is done and to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce prejudice and wrongful decisions by the jury.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Malley, </em>167 Conn. 379, 389, 355 A.2d 292 (1974) <em>(Bogdanski, J., </em>dissenting); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 574, 462 A.2d 1001 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>188 Conn. 432, 456-57, 450 A.2d 828 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>96 Conn. 160, 168-69, 113 A. 452 (1921). \u201cWhile the privilege of counsel in addressing the jury should not be too closely narrowed or unduly hampered, it must never be used as a license to state, or to comment upon, or even to suggest an inference from, facts not in evidence, or to present matters which the jury have no right to consider.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>supra, 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u201cIn examining the prosecutor\u2019s argument we must distinguish between those comments whose effects may be removed by appropriate instructions; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>supra, 163; and those which are flagrant and therefore deny the accused a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>103 Conn. 453, 477, 130 A. 899 (1925).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>supra, 457.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">There is no doubt that the prosecutor\u2019s remark was improper and inexcusable. No adverse inference may be drawn from counsel\u2019s exercise of an objection to the admission of evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>373 Mass. 569, 575, 369 N.E.2d 451 (1977); <em>People </em>v. <em>Lipman, </em>59 App. Div. 2d 748, 398 N.Y.S.2d 555 (1977). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Nevertheless, we note that no objection was made following the remark, suggesting defense counsel had not found the statement sufficiently prejudicial to require an immediate curative instruction from the court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>supra, 464-65. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s remark, although improper, was a small part of a very long closing argument. There is no evidence in the record before this court that the prosecutor attempted to \u201chammer home\u201d his point to the jury. See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Alicea, </em>37 N.Y.2d 601, 604, 338 N.E.2d 625 (1975) (prosecutor made repeated attempts to introduce inadmissible evidence); see <em>Patriarca </em>v. <em>United States, </em>402 F.2d 314, 322 (1st Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1022, 89 S. Ct. 633, 21 L. Ed. 2d 567, reh. denied, 393 U.S. 1124, 89 S. Ct. 987, 22 L. Ed. 2d 131 (1969). Finally, we note that the defendant proceeded, in part, on the theory that the police investigation was no more than a cover-up for a mistaken arrest. Examined in context, the prosecutor\u2019s response, invited by the defendant; <em>Patriarca </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 321 n.6; <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>supra, 464; <em>State </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>172 Conn. 458, 470, 374 A.2d 1107 (1977); was a double-edged sword: permissible in seeking to discredit the defendant\u2019s cover-up theory; impermissible in seeking to create a prohibited adverse inference concerning the exercise of the right to object to the admission of evidence. As such, the prejudicial impact was not as great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>as when comment is totally unprovoked.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Patriarca </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>supra. Reviewing the prosecutor\u2019s remark within the context of the entire trial; <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>supra, 457; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinsey, </em>173 Conn. 344, 348-49, 377 A.2d 1095 (1977); we hold it was not so prejudicial that it could not be cured by proper instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The trial court charged the jury that they were to draw no adverse inference from the objections made during trial. The defendant took exception claiming that a stronger instruction was required to remove the prejudice created by the prosecutor\u2019s remark. We note, however, that the defendant was no more specific than to request \u201cmuch stronger language to advise the jury that, obviously, objections and evidence which has been ruled inadmissible is not to be considered by them in any way.\u201d In such a case our duty is not to determine whether the language used by the court could have been improved upon but whether the charge fairly and adequately covered the subject matter of the exception. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 561, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>178 Conn. 689, 693, 425 A.2d 111 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Huot, </em>170 Conn. 463, 465, 365 A.2d 1144 (1976). The court\u2019s instruction properly covered the issue,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> admonishing the jury not to draw any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>\u201cunfavorable inference\u201d from the objections and exceptions taken during trial. The instruction was proper, and cured any prejudice resulting from the prosecutor\u2019s remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The defendant\u2019s final claim of error concerns the court\u2019s charge to the jury on the issue of identification. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 852, the defendant submitted a written request to charge on this subject that he himself characterizes as \u201carguably partisan.\u201d The court declined to give the proposed charge, instead using the standard charge,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> focusing the jury\u2019s attention on the factors set out in <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 115, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1977); see also <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 199-200, 93 S. Ct. 375, 34 L. Ed. 2d 401 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Theriault, </em>182 Conn. 366, 373-74, 438 A.2d 432 (1980). The court, however, omitted reference to the \u201cdegree of the victim\u2019s attention\u201d as requested by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>\u201c Tt is the law of this state that a request to charge which is relevant to the issues of the case and which is an accurate statement of the law must be given. . . . It is, however, also the law of this state that a refusal to charge in the exact words of a request will not constitute error if the requested charge is given in substance.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>182 Conn. 207, 211, 438 A.2d 418 (1980), quoting <em>Mazzuceo </em>v. <em>Krall Coal &amp; Oil Co., </em>172 Conn. 355, 357, 374 A.2d 1047 (1977); see also State v. <em>Maresca, </em>173 Conn. 450, 460, 377 A.2d 1330 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>172 Conn. 324, 330, 374 A.2d 247 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>166 Conn. 569, 574, 353 A.2d 776 (1974). The instruction given substantially conformed to the charge requested by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The court instructed the jury that \u201cthe State has the burden of proving identity beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d; that \u201cthe value of [the victim\u2019s] testimony depends on the opportunity she had to observe him at the time of the offense\u201d; that \u201c[y]ou should consider her capacity to observe and whether she had adequate opportunity to observe the accused\u201d; and that \u201c[the victim\u2019s] opportunity to observe [the accused] at the time of the offense [was] effected [sic] by how long or short a time was available, how far away or how close he was, how good the lighting was.\u201d This charge adequately guided the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>jury in its deliberations. Although the court did not use the term \u201cdegree of attentiveness,\u201d it employed substantially similar language, stating \u201cyou should consider [the victim\u2019s] capacity to observe and whether she had adequate opportunity to observe.\u201d There was no error in the court\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b23-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) provides as follows: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of assault in the first degree when ...

Ed. 2d 342 (1976), the Supreme Court held that the test of materiality was whether the information suppressed \u201cmight be sufficient to create a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., 113; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Packard, </em>184 Conn. 258, 439 A.2d 983 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bember, </em>183 Conn. 394, 439 A.2d 387 (1981). Because we do not reach that issue here, we intimate no opinion on the materiality of the allegedly suppressed evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b27-8\"> See <em>Cherniske </em>v. <em>Jajer, </em>171 Conn. 372, 370 A.2d 981 (1976) (newspaper article is inadmissible hearsay because of its lack of trustworthiness, and the inability to cross-examine).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b27-9\"> There is, in fact, some doubt as to whether or not the victim was unconscious for four days prior to the photo identification. The medical records, made available to defense counsel, give no indication that the victim was unconscious. Evidence produced at trial, however, established that she had been in the intensive care unit for four days, and that she had been receiving medication. We note that this information, equally available to the defense counsel and the prosecution, provided the defendant with an opportunity to discover <em>the </em>information he now alleges the prosecutor supressed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b28-8\"> Interestingly, defense counsel had similarly arrived at this conclusion when, at the beginning of his presentencing argument, he stated: \u201cIf the Court please, obviously [the prosecution] has some very strong <em>personal </em>feelings about this case.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b29-9\"> In Ms brief, and at oral argument, the defendant alleged that during the state\u2019s rebuttal argument the prosecutor made repeated references to excluded evidence. Because no transcript of the rebuttal argument was requested by counsel or available to this court, we consider only the claims of prosecutorial misconduct that allegedly occurred during the state\u2019s closing argument. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>190 Conn. 219, 226, 460 A.2d 961 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawicki, </em>173 Conn. 389, 396, 377 A.2d 1103 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Paluga, </em>171 Conn. 586, 598-99, 370 A.2d 1049 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>163 Conn. 304, 308, 306 A.2d 855 (1972). The defendant also argued in his brief that the prosecutor had commented on excluded evidence. At oral argument, however, the defendant conceded the \u201cgist\u201d of his claim was not the substance of the prosecution\u2019s statements concerning the excluded evidence, but rather the inference the prosecution was trying to draw from the defendant\u2019s objection to the evidence. We, therefore, focus on that issue. We note, however, that much of the substance of the excluded evidence was before the jury. See footnote 11, infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b30-7\"> Significantly, the statement of July 19 refers extensively to the unsigned statement of July 12, thus revealing a great deal of the substance of that statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-8\">\u201cI, Thomas M. Gaetano (dob 4-30-55) of 6 Oak Ridge Drive, New Haven, Connecticut, being duly sworn make the following statement of my own free will and accord:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-9\">\u201cOn July 6th, 1978 at approximately 8:30 p.m., I was at my home and I heard a car beeping its horn. I went to the window and looked out and saw a brown car up the street between my house and my neighbor\u2019s house on my left. I heard a voice saying: \u2018Come on down.\u2019 I said: T can\u2019t, I\u2019m watching the baby.\u2019 The voice said: \u2018Come here, I got something for you.\u2019 I moved away from the window and heard noises that sounded like fireworks. I laid back down on the couch. About five (5) minutes later, the little girl (Annie) who lives downstairs came up to my apartment and said that her mother was bleeding. I ran downstairs and talked to the woman\u2019s son who said he had called an ambulance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-10\">\u201cLater on members of the New Haven Police Department arrived and I told them of the incident involving the person in the brown car. At that time, I told the police that I thought the person in the brown car was Anthony Falcone because my girlfriend (Sandra Cicarilli) and his girlfriend (Anna Fariola) had been arguing that afternoon and I surmised it was him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-11\">\u201cAnother factor that influenced my surmise at that time was the fact that Anna Fariola has a brown car similar to the one I saw on the date in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-12\">\u201cA few days later, I went to the New Haven Police Department and told the investigating officer that I was not sure of my identification of the vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>or occupant. He accused me of lying, but I explained that my initial identification was uncertain because of my nervousness and vantage point. I refused to sign a written statement which had been prepared because he refused to change it as I stated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APT\">\u201cAt this time I want to state, without qualification, that I am not sure that the vehicle in question was Anna Fariola\u2019s car or that the occupant of the car was Anthony Falcone. As a matter of fact, I cannot even say with certainty that the occupant was a male or that the voice was that of Anthony Falcone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ\">\u201cI have read the foregoing statement consisting of five (5) pages and I swear the contents thereof are the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b32-8\"> This court has recently had reason to develop a third category: \u201cWhere a prosecutor in argument interjects remarks deliberately intended to undermine the rulings of the trial court to the prejudice of the defendant ... so offensive to the sound administration of justice that only a new trial can effectively prevent such assaults on the integrity of the tribunal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 575, 462 A.2d 1001 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b33-6\"> We recognize that requesting an immediate curative instruction may sometimes highlight a prejudicial remark in the eyes of the jury. Nevertheless, where counsel does not choose to make such a request or to seek a mistrial, he presumably does not view the remarks as so prejudicial that his client\u2019s right to a fair trial is seriously jeopardized. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 564-65, 462 A.2d 1001 (1983), where we ordered a new trial because of prejudicial remarks by the prosecutor, the defendant had objected immediately and had also moved for a mistrial. In this case there was ample opportunity to call the remark to the attention of the court in the absence of the jury either at the close of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument in which it was made or afterwards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b34-7\"> We do not intend to suggest that provocation is in any way an excuse for the prosecutor\u2019s behavior. In this regard, we agree with the First Circuit Court of Appeals: \u201c[W]e do not consider that a trespass by the defense gives the prosecution a hunting license exempt from ethical restraints on advocacy.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Patriarca </em>v. <em>United States, </em>402 F.2d 314, 321 (1st Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1022, 89 S.

Ed. 2d 131 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b34-8\"> The court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cDuring the course of this case the attorneys made various objections, took exceptions to my rulings and you were excused on a number of occasions. You are not to imply any unfavorable inferences in connection with either party because of these things. It is the duty of a lawyer to examine and cross-examine witnesses and to object to certain questions and to object to the introduction of certain exhibits and it is the duty of the judge to excuse the jury while certain matters or questions of law are debated.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b35-6\"> The charge on identification is set out in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">\u201cOne of the issues in this case is the identification of the defendant as the perpetrator of the crime. The State has the burden of proving identity beyond a reasonable doubt and you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the identification of the defendant before you may find him guilty. If you\u2019re not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the person who committed the crime you must find him not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-8\">\u201cIdentification testimony is an expression of the belief of a witness that the accused was the very person seen. Audrey Tamaro has testified that Anthony Falcone was the person she saw shoot her. The value of her testimony depends on the opportunity she had to observe him at the time of the offense and to make a reliable identification later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">\u201cYou should consider her capacity to observe and whether she had adequate opportunity to observe the accused. Her opportunity to observe him at the time of the offense is effected [sic] by how long or short a time was available, how far away or how close he was, how good the lighting was and whether she had had occasion to see or know him before the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-10\">\u201cYou should be satisfied that her identification subsequent to the offense was the product of her own recollection. You may take into account both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the strength of her identification and the circumstances under which the identification was made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE\">\u201cYou may also consider the length of time that lapsed between the occurrence of the crime and the photographic identification, a period here of about five days and the lapse of time between the crime and her in court identification, a period of about a year and eight months. I believe that she testified that she saw the defendant, by chance, in a store about a year after this crime and you may consider that, if it is your recollection of her testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM-\">\u201cYou must consider the credibility of Audrey Tamaro\u2019s identification in the same way as you would the credibility of any other witness. Consider whether she appeared to you to be truthful and whether she had the capacity and opportunity to make a reliable observation.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
