The conduct which led to the convictions for contempt arose out of a civil jury trial in which Julia Naunchek, appearing pro se, was the plaintiff.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court held the plaintiff in contempt of court under General Statutes \u00a7 51-33<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because of her statements during the course of the trial. On two consecutive days she was sentenced, first to ten days imprisonment, and then to twenty days imprisonment, effective at the end of the trial. Upon the conclusion of the trial and the execution of the sentences, which cumulatively ordered the plaintiff to serve thirty days at the Connecticut Correctional Institution at Niantic, the plaintiff filed a writ of error to this court challenging the legality of her convictions for contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The June 11, 1981 incident, which led to the first finding of contempt, occurred after the court had ordered the plaintiff not to interrupt the witnesses whom she was examining. When the plaintiff continued to interject her objections into the testimony of the witness Mark Shipman, the court ordered the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>to put her hand over her mouth, or to have her mouth taped, until the witness had answered the question. After the plaintiff, with the assistance of a matron, had covered her mouth, the court instructed the plaintiff not to move her hand until it had told her to do so. The plaintiff then said: \u201cYou\u2019ve been threatening me since I\u2019ve been here,\u201d and the court found her in contempt. The record reveals that the trial court, the same day, sentenced the plaintiff to imprisonment at the state prison for women \u201cfor the term of 10 days effective at the conclusion of trial of Case No. 21 86 70.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The June 12,1981 incident, which led to the second finding of contempt, occurred after the court had ordered the plaintiff, when examining witnesses, to refrain from calling them liars. The plaintiff persisted, saying to the witness Chester Sledzik: \u201cMr. Sledzik, you are lying.\u201d The court, after characterizing the plaintiff\u2019s statement as \u201cabsolutely outrageous,\u201d explained to the plaintiff that it was the jury\u2019s role to believe or not to believe a witness. When the plaintiff continued to protest, the court excused the jury and told the plaintiff that she was in contempt \u201cbecause of the fact you have just referred to this witness as telling a lie.\u201d In the absence of the jury, the court then gave the plaintiff an opportunity to apologize to the witness and to purge herself of contempt. The plaintiff refused to apologize. The court thereupon found her in contempt and sentenced her to an additional twenty days of imprisonment, again effective upon the conclusion of the ongoing civil jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s writ of error raises three issues. She claims that: (1) her conduct did not constitute contempt of court; (2) her alleged contempt should not have been adjudicated by the same judge against whom the alleged contempt was perpetrated; and (3) her adjudi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>cation for contempt violated her liberty interests under the constitutions of the United States and of the state of Connecticut.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Before we consider these various claims of error, it is important to note what is not at issue. The plaintiff recognizes that a conviction for criminal contempt can only be reviewed by a writ of error; <em>McClain </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>189 Conn. 663, 665, 457 A.2d 1072 (1983); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>186 Conn. 256, 257, 440 A.2d 969 (1982); and that review pursuant to a writ of error is limited to matters appearing as of record. <em>McClain </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 668; <em>State </em>v. <em>Assuntino, </em>180 Conn. 345, 347, 429 A.2d 900 (1980); <em>Goodhart </em>v. <em>State, </em>84 Conn. 60, 62-63, 78 A. 853 (1911). The plaintiff does not deny that trial courts have summary contempt power to deal with contumacious conduct that occurs in open court and in the immediate view of the judge. <em>McClain </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 667-70; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259; <em>Goodhart </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 63. The plaintiff does not contend that the trial judge was actually biased against her. The plaintiff does not dispute the validity of the underlying orders of the trial court, nor does she maintain that she failed to understand them, that she lacked the mental capacity to comply or that her noncompliance was unintentional. Finally, the plaintiff does not argue that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the sentences imposed, even viewed cumulatively, exceed the statutory limitations of six months imposed by the governing statute. See General Statutes \u00a7 51-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Bearing in mind the foregoing constraints on the scope of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, we address first her claim that her conduct did not as a matter of law constitute criminal contempt of court. The plaintiff argues that because her conduct was less extreme than that of others found in contempt, we must conclude that her behavior was only the overzealous presentation of a pro se litigant unschooled in the niceties of courtroom behavior. She maintains that her conduct, although concededly indiscreet and inappropriate, did not materially disrupt the trial or obstruct justice. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Pro se status does not give a litigant license to disregard the express orders of the court presiding over the trial. The record indicates that the trial court gave the plaintiff repeated instructions about the limits of permissible examination of witnesses and that she wilfully refused to observe the limits that had been set. She refused to avail herself of a proffered opportunity to purge herself of her second contempt. In these circumstances, the trial court was entitled to conclude that her flagrant disregard of its orders was so disruptive of the progress of the trial as to warrant findings of criminal contempt. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>421 U.S. 309, 315-16, 95 S. Ct. 1802, 44 L. Ed. 2d 186 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s second claim is that her citation for contempt should not have been adjudicated by the same judge before whom the allegedly contumacious conduct occurred. According to the plaintiff, this case should have been handled pursuant to General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>\u00a7 51-33a<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rather than \u00a7 51-33, which the trial court invoked. We conclude that, in the present circumstances, the trial court was not foreclosed from reliance upon \u00a7 51-33.</p>\n<p id=\"AsL\">We have only recently addressed the relationship between General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 51-33 and 51-33a, both of which regulate contumacious conduct committed in the presence of the court. As a matter of statutory construction, we held in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>186 Conn. 256, 261, 440 A.2d 969 (1982), that the apparent overlap between the statutes can be reconciled by permitting a trial court either to act summarily, during the trial, in accordance with \u00a7 51-33, or to defer adjudication to a later time, in \u201can appropriate situation,\u201d so that proceedings may be instituted under \u00a7 51-33a before a different judge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AWr\">The plaintiff advances two arguments why the present case is \u201can appropriate situation\u201d for deferred adjudication pursuant to \u00a7 51-33a rather than for immediate disposition pursuant to \u00a7 51-33. The plaintiff alleges that the trial court, by its own act of deferring sentence for the contempt of June 11 to the following day, signalled that there was no compelling need for summary action. The plaintiff also alleges that the trial court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>become so personally embroiled with the plaintiff that adjudication for contempt should have been referred to a different judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The plaintiffs first argument cannot survive scrutiny of the record, by which we are bound on a writ of error. The plaintiff relies on the transcript of proceedings on June 11, which indicates that she was found in contempt but contains nothing about the sentence imposed. This transcript is, however, incomplete, since only a fragment of the June 11 proceedings has been preserved for this appeal. Our printed record contains a judgment that the plaintiff was, \u201con the 11th day of June, 1981,\u201d found in contempt of court under \u00a7 51-33 and \u201cwas by said Court on the 11th day of June, 1981, sentenced to imprisonment to state prison for women, for the term of 10 days effective at the conclusion of trial of Case No. 21 86 70.\u201d It is therefore clear, on this record, that the trial court\u2019s action was consistent with its view that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct required a summary response.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s second argument requires an analysis of the significance of \u201cembroilment.\u201d We determined, in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, that \u00a7 51-33a was enacted in response to <em>Mayberry </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>400 U.S. 455, 465-66, 91 S. Ct. 499, 27 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1971). In our interpretation of our contempt statutes, we must therefore take account of constitutional principles of due process that affect the adjudication of contempt. <em>Mayberry </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>held (pp. 465-66) that the fair administration of justice disqualifies a judge from sitting in judgment on a contempt charge if he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>become so personally embroiled with a contemnor that it is unlikely for him \u201cto maintain that calm detachment necessary for fair adjudication.\u201d Id., 465. We are mindful of the oft-quoted statement of Justice Robert Jackson in <em>Sacher </em>v. <em>United States, </em>343 U.S. 1, 8, 72 S. Ct. 451, 96 L. Ed. 717, reh. denied, 343 U.S. 931, 72 S. Ct. 746, 96 L. Ed. 1341 (1952), that \u201c[sjummary punishment always, and rightly, is regarded with disfavor and, if imposed in passion or pettiness, brings discredit to a court as certainly as the conduct it penalizes.\u201d See R. Goldfarb, The Contempt Power, pp. 253-57 (1963). We agree, therefore, with the plaintiffs contention that significant evidence of personal embroilment would constitute an appropriate situation for deferred adjudication or deferred sentencing before a different judge. In determining when due process demands recusal, we recognize, however, that neither <em>Mayberry </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>nor <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>418 U.S. 488, 501-503, 94 S. Ct. 2697, 41 L. Ed. 2d 897 (1974), also requiring referral to a different judge, arose in the context of an immediate summary adjudication of contempt during the course of a trial. A trial court must have latitude in the preservation of courtroom control. <em>Sacher </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra; <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U.S. 517, 534, 45 S. Ct. 390, 69 L. Ed. 767 (1925). We hold, therefore, that a summary contempt conviction during the course of a trial, whose very timing bears witness to the trial court\u2019s judgment that the effective administration of justice requires an immediate judicial response, cannot be overturned without substantial evidence of personal embroilment on the part of the presiding judge. See <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 539; American Bar Association, Standards for Criminal Justice, Standard 6-4.5 (2d Ed. 1980).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Applying these principles to the present case, we must inquire whether the record demonstrates that the trial judge was in fact so personally embroiled that the plaintiffs conviction cannot stand. <em>Mayberry </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>and <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>teach us that we must appraise both the conduct of the contemnor and the reaction of the judge. While personal embroilment is a more likely reaction when the contemnor has mounted a personal attack on the judge, it may also be found in the character of the judge\u2019s response, if the judge has become visibly involved in a running controversy with the contemnor. \u201c[T]he inquiry must be . . . whether there was \u2018such a likelihood of bias or an appearance of bias that the judge was unable to hold the balance between vindicating the interests of the court and the interests of the accused.\u2019 <em>Ungar </em>v. Sarafite, 376 U.S. 575, 588 [84 S. Ct. 841, 11 L. Ed. 2d 921, reh. denied, 377 U.S. 925, 84 S. Ct. 1218, 12 L. Ed. 2d 217] (1964).\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>supra, 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">On the record before us, the plaintiff\u2019s claim of embroilment has not been factually substantiated. With regard to the first citation of contempt, the plaintiff complained to the trial court of harassment and intimidation after the court had threatened to have the sheriff put tape on the plaintiff\u2019s mouth unless she covered it with her own hand while a witness was completing his answer to the plaintiff\u2019s question. The court\u2019s finding of contempt, upon the plaintiff\u2019s initial refusal to comply, was followed by orderly questions and answers, so that the court shortly thereafter said: \u201cAll right, Mrs. Naunchek, you seem to be doing well with your hand over your mouth. You can stop doing it. I hope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>you\u2019ve gotten in the habit of being quiet while the witness is answering.\u201d This dialogue shows neither a sustained personal attack on the judge nor running controversy with the plaintiff. On the contrary, it shows a judge accomplishing his goal of assuring an orderly trial. With regard to the second contempt citation, the evidence of embroilment is even more ephemeral. Although the trial court expressed its outrage at the plaintiff\u2019s persistence in calling a witness a liar, the court immediately excused the jury in order to afford the plaintiff an opportunity to retract her statement and to purge herself of contempt. In its totality, this evidence reveals, apart from some minor impatience, the exercise of considerable control and reasonable restraint in the trial court\u2019s response to the plaintiff\u2019s repeated violations of the court\u2019s orders. This record does not establish either a statutory or a constitutional basis for a requirement that adjudication of these con-tempts should have been referred to a different judge. See <em>In re Buckley, </em>10 Cal. 3d 237, 255-58, 514 P.2d 1201, 110 Cal. Rptr. 121 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s third claim of error alleges a deprivation of constitutional rights to due process. That claim, however, merely reiterates the argued impermissibility of summary adjudication by the trial court before whom the contumacious conduct occurred. Because we have already addressed the constitutional implications of that argument, we need not consider this claim further.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-6\"> In the original action, the plaintiff had charged the defendants with \u201cjoint fraud, conspiracy and misconduct\u201d in connection with prior divorce and partition actions.
