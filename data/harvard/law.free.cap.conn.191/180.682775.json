General Statutes \u00a7 53a-123 (a) (2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the close of the state\u2019s evidence and again at the close of all evidence, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>each count. Both motions were denied by the court, and he was subsequently found guilty as charged by the jury. The defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to two counts of being a persistent felony offender; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40; and was sentenced to five to ten years on each count, to run concurrently, for an effective total sentence of five to ten years. From this judgment the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The defendant presents the following issues: (1) whether the defendant, who was an invited guest in one portion of a single family house, could be found guilty of burglarizing a bedroom within that structure; (2) whether the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury on the definition of \u201cbuilding\u201d as that term is used in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-103; (3) whether the evidence of value was sufficient to support a conviction of larceny in the second degree; and (4) whether the trial court erred in its supplemental instructions to the jury regarding the definition of market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The following facts could reasonably have been found by the jury: On March 6 and 7,1979, a one-family, two bedroom house on 41 Deerfield Avenue in Milford was occupied by four people, including Diane Boxwell, the defendant\u2019s niece. Boxwell and her daughter occupied the living room, Sherri Williams occupied one bedroom and Heidi Williams occupied the second bedroom. Although the front door to the house did not lock, the individual bedrooms were equipped with chain bolt locks on the doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>On March 6, 1979, between 5 and 7 p.m., Sherri Williams left the house after locking her bedroom door. It was her practice to keep the door locked, as her room contained numerous valuables, including a stereo system. She gave no one permission to enter her bedroom on March 6 or 7, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Boxwell invited the defendant to the Deerfield Avenue house on March 6,1979. He arrived at approximately 8:30 p.m. and remained there overnight, sleeping on a living room couch. The following morning Boxwell left for work at approximately 7 a.m., leaving her uncle at the residence. She had checked the bedroom doors to verify that they were locked.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Sherri Williams returned home at approximately 2:30 p.m. on March 7, 1979. She found her bedroom door open and the contents of her room in disarray. Her stereo system, which included two speakers, a turntable with cartridge and a receiver, was gone. Additionally, a roll of ten one dollar bills was missing from her bookshelf. None of the missing items was returned or found.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Julie Sweeton, who is also the defendant\u2019s niece, and Sherri Urabel arrived at 41 Deerfield Avenue at approximately 12:15 p.m. on March 7,1979. They had planned to take the defendant out to lunch. Each testified that upon arrival they viewed the defendant loading stereo speakers into a waiting taxi cab. The turntable and receiver were visible on the rear seat of the taxi. The defendant left in the taxi after failing to respond to Sweeton\u2019s inquiry as to what he was doing. Subsequently, Sweeton entered the house and noticed that Sherri Williams\u2019 bedroom door was open and that her stereo was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">In this appeal the defendant does not contest the sufficiency of the evidence regarding his wrongful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>appropriation of the missing property, but asserts that an essential element of each of the crimes, as charged, has not been sufficiently established. Additionally, he alleges error in the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury relative to each of these disputed elements. We first consider the defendant\u2019s claims relating to the burglary conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The defendant contends that the language of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-100,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> read in conjunction with \u00a7 53a-103 (a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> exculpates him under the facts of this case. Succinctly stated, it is his position that having been invited by his niece to be inside the premises at 41 Deerfield Avenue, his appropriation of the missing property from the bedroom of Sherri Williams cannot constitute an entering or remaining unlawfully \u201cin a building.\u201d Although candidly admitting that \u201c[i]t was certainly a crime for the defendant to enter her room and steal the stereo equipment,\u201d the defendant nonetheless asserts that the bedroom was not a separate \u201cbuilding\u201d within the meaning of that term and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>therefore his actions were \u201cmore properly a larceny in conjunction with some type of criminal trespass or criminal mischief.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">We begin our analysis by noting the definition of \u201cbuilding\u201d as stated within General Statutes \u00a7 53a-100. Under this section, \u201cbuilding\u201d is defined, inter alia, as follows: \u201cWhere a building consists of separate units, such as, <em>but not limited to </em>separate apartments, offices, or rented rooms, any unit not occupied by the actor is, in addition to being a part of such building, a separate building . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In light of this definition, we are satisfied that the subordinate facts recited above justify the conclusion that Sherri Williams\u2019 bedroom was a \u201cbuilding\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-103.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The testimony establishes the fact that three individuals (as well as one of the tenant\u2019s children) occupied distinct parts of a building originally constructed as a one-family residence. Although the defendant was invited within 41 Deerfield Avenue, it is clear that his \u201cinvitation\u201d was never expressly or impliedly extended to either of the bedrooms, which were locked. Indeed, Diane Boxwell testified that she had specifically \u201cchecked all the doors\u201d to ensure that they were locked prior to leaving for work on the morning of March 7,1979. Nor does the defendant\u2019s reliance upon the legislative history of \u00a7 53a-103 support his claim. It is clear that one purpose behind the enactment of our present burglary statutes was protection against intrusions likely to terrorize occupants. <em>State </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>190 Conn. 496, 506, 461 A.2d 973 (1983). The defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ant, noting that Williams knew of his presence within the house on the evening of March 6,1979, claims that the potential for terror was lacking under these circumstances. Can it be disputed that the defendant\u2019s actions would have terrorized Williams if she had been in her room at the time of the break-in? The defendant\u2019s argument is baseless, and his actions were just the type of activity against which the burglary statutes were designed to protect.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The defendant, while conceding that the court defined \u201cbuilding\u201d in the words of the statute, took exception to the court\u2019s charge with respect to that definition. Specifically, he claims error by the trial court in its charge that \u201c[w]hen a building consists of two or more units separately secured or occupied, any one of these units, when intruded upon . . . may be considered as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>a separate building.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the jury could well have concluded that the bedroom was a \u201cbuilding\u201d only because it was \u201cseparately secured or occupied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">When considered in its entirety, the charge adequately explained the meaning of a \u201cbuilding.\u201d See <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Bliss, </em>160 Conn. 128, 132-33, 273 A.2d 873 (1970). \u201c \u2018The charge to the jury . . . must be read as a whole, and an attempt to assert reversible error by culling a single phrase or inaccurate statement must fail unless it is reasonably probable that the jury were misled.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Turcio, </em>178 Conn. 116, 122, 422 A.2d 749 (1979). Moreover, even if we assume, for the sake of argument, that the court erred by including the \u201csecured or occupied\u201d language within its charge, this error heightened the evidentiary plateau necessary for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>conviction. Any such error \u201cwas favorable to the defendant and is therefore not a justifiable basis of complaint by him.\u201d <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>189 Conn. 129, 137, 454 A.2d 1282 (1983); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, </em>175 Conn. 569, 574, 402 A.2d 759 (1978). We conclude that the defendant has failed to satisfy his burden of showing that the trial court\u2019s charge defining \u201cbuilding\u201d was probably harmful to him. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vennard, </em>159 Conn. 385, 393-94, 270 A.2d 837 (1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 1011, 91 S. Ct. 576, 27 L. Ed. 2d 625 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">With respect to his conviction of larceny in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-123 (a) (2) of the General Statutes, the defendant contends that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to establish a larceny of property with a value in excess of $500. Conceding that there was sufficient evidence of his wrongful appropriation of the ten one dollar bills, the defendant avers that the jury could not reasonably have found the value of Williams\u2019 stereo system to be at least $490. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The evidence presented concerning valuation of the stereo system is as follows: Sherri Williams testified that she purchased the system as a package in May, 1978, or approximately ten months prior to the alleged larceny. She recalled paying \u201caround 550 dollars\u201d for all of the components, which figure included the applicable sales tax paid thereon. She used the system daily prior to its appropriation and on one occasion had it repaired. Although Williams characterized the set as in \u201cexcellent condition\u201d in March of 1979, she offered no opinion as to its value immediately before it was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>The state introduced as an expert witness Fred Thompson, an assistant sales manager at a stereo store which sold all of the components which comprised Williams\u2019 stereo system. He testified that the system could have been purchased as a \u201cpackage deal\u201d in May, 1978 for $485, excluding sales tax. He further testified that the same system sold as a package for $505 in March of 1979, again excluding sales tax.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thompson stated that in his opinion the use of the stereo for the ten month period between May, 1978 and March, 1979 would result in depreciation of between 5 and 10 percent. On cross-examination, however, Thompson admitted to having \u201cno idea\u201d what the exact amount of depreciation would be without evaluating the system itself.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He conceded only that the value of the system would be worth something less than the original purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The defendant offered the testimony of Leonard Fortgang, a public fire adjuster, on the issue of value. Although he offered no opinion as to the value of Williams\u2019 stereo system, in his opinion the value of the equipment would have decreased during the ten month period between May, 1978 and March, 1979. Depreciation during this period, according to Fortgang, would have been \u201cat least\u201d 10 percent, and perhaps as much as 15 to 20 percent depending upon the condition of the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-121, \u201cvalue means the market value of the property ... at the time and place of the crime or, if such cannot be satisfactorily ascertained, the cost of replacement of the property . . . within a reasonable time after the crime.\u201d Clearly, therefore, value is defined, first, in terms of \u201cmarket value,\u201d and only if such cannot be satisfactorily ascertained should the jury consider \u201creplacement cost.\u201d We have defined market value as \u201c \u2018the price that would in all probability \u2014 the probability being based upon the evidence in the case \u2014 result from fair negotiations, where the seller is willing to sell and the buyer desires to buy.\u2019 \u201d <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>169 Conn. 129, 138, 362 A.2d 914 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Where, as here, value constitutes an element of the crime as charged, we must determine \u201c \u2018whether the jury could have reasonably concluded, upon the facts established and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence whs sufficient to justify the verdict of guilty beyond reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>188 Conn. 515, 529, 450 A.2d 361 (1982); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>182 Conn. 52, 62, 437 A.2d 843 (1980). Giving the evidence the most favorable construction toward sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict; <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra; and recognizing that it is the function of the trier to assess the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>credibility and weight of the evidence presented; <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>178 Conn. 450, 457, 423 A.2d 118 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1015, 100 S. Ct. 667, 62 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1980); we are nevertheless unable to determine that the jury could reasonably have concluded that the market value of the stereo system was in excess of $490.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Although Sherri Williams testified that she purchased the stereo for \u201caround 550 dollars\u201d in March of 1978, this figure included the sales tax paid thereon.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, although market value is to be ascertained \u201cat the time and place of the crime\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-121; she offered no opinion as to the value of the set on the date of its appropriation. \u201cWhether an owner\u2019s testimony as to the <em>current </em>market value provides sufficient information to support a jury verdict depends on the circumstances of each case.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>supra, 63. In light of the factors delineated above, Williams\u2019 testimony provides an insufficient basis for reasonable jurors to ascertain, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the market value of the stolen stereo exceeded $490.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Nor can we conclude that the testimony of the experts provided a sufficient basis for a finding of market value in excess of $490. Although Thompson testified that a new system would sell for $505 in March of 1979, the same system sold for $485 in May, 1978. It was undisputed that the value of the system would depreciate during the ten month period between Williams\u2019 purchase and the appropriation of the system, although the amount of such depreciation was in dispute. Even assuming de minimis depreciation, therefore, the maximum market value of the system cannot reasonably be ascertained as in excess of $490.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Because there was insufficient evidence as a matter of law to conclude that the market value of the stolen property exceeded $500, the trial court erred in submitting that basis for rendering a verdict of larceny in the second degree to the jury. Even if we assume, for the sake of argument, that the evidence concerning replacement cost was sufficient to establish a value of the stereo in excess of $490, we cannot discern from the record before us whether the jury utilized that method for determining valuation. Thus the jury may have predicated its verdict on a standard which we have found to be deficient. \u201cIn these circumstances we think the proper rule to be applied is that which requires a verdict to be set aside in cases where the verdict is supportable on one ground, but not on another, and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury selected.\u201d <em>Yates </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U.S. 298, 312, 77 S. Ct. 1064, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1356 (1957). The conviction of larceny in the second degree must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Although the verdict on the charge of second degree larceny must be set aside since there was the possibility that the conclusion of the jury lacked a clearly valid evidential basis, the lesser included offense of larceny in the third degree<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was not subject to that debility. If we construe the evidence presented in a manner most favorable to the defendant, i.e., a purchase price of $485 for stereo equipment in May, 1978, coupled with a depreciation factor of 20 percent, the market value of the system nevertheless stands at $388. Regarding replacement cost, the purchase of an identical system in March, 1979 for $505, minus 20 percent applicable to depreciation, would result in a value of $404. Thus the only reasonable construction of the evidence pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>sented results in a value far in excess of $50 under both the market value and replacement cost approaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In this case, the trial court instructed the jury on the lesser included offense of larceny in the third degree, and the defendant does not claim error with respect to that charge. \u201c \u2018Since the jury could have explicitly returned such a verdict, the defendant was well aware of [his] potential liability for this crime and would not now be prejudiced by modification of the judgment rendered on the verdict consistent with the above.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Scielzo, </em>190 Conn. 191, 205, 460 A.2d 951 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In light of our conclusion concerning the verdict of larceny in the second degree, we need not reach the defendant\u2019s final assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">There is error with respect to the conviction of larceny in the second degree. The case is remanded for modification of that judgment in accordance with this opinion and for resentencing on the lesser included offense of larceny in the third degree as that statute existed at the time the defendant was arrested and charged in this case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-103 (a) states: \u201cburglary in the third degree: class D felony, (a) A person is guilty of burglary in the third degree when he enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-11\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 53a-123 states: \u201clarceny in the second degree: class D felony, (a) A person is guilty of larceny in the second degree when: (1) The property consists of a motor vehicle, (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>value of the property or service exceeds five hundred dollars, or (3) the property, regardless of its nature or value, is taken from the person of another.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa1\">\u201c(b) Larceny in the second degree is a class D felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvD\">We note that \u00a7 53a-123 has been amended, inter alia, to increase the value of property or service pursuant to subsection (a) (2) from five hundred to five thousand dollars.

Where a building consists of separate units, such as, but not limited to separate apartments, offices or rented rooms, any unit not occupied by the actor is, in addition to being a part of such building, a separate building; (2) \u2018dwelling\u2019 means a building which is usually occupied by a person lodging therein at night, whether or not a person is actually present; (3) \u2018night\u2019 means the period between thirty minutes after sunset and thirty minutes before sunrise.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">\u201c(b) The following definition is applicable to sections 53a-101 to 53a-106, inclusive: A person \u2018enters or remains unlawfully\u2019 in or upon premises when the premises, at the time of such entry or remaining, are not open to the public and when the actor is not otherwise licensed or privileged to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b194-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-103. burglary in the third degree: class D felony, (a) A person is guilty of burglary in the third degree when he enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\"> Relying on the principle of ejusdem generis, the defendant asserts that the various examples of \u201cseparate units\u201d contained within General Statutes \u00a7 53a-100 (a) (1) support his claim that a bedroom within a single family residence cannot constitute a \u201cbuilding.\u201d This argument loses sight of the fact that the delineation of examples of \u201cseparate units\u201d within \u00a7 53a-100 (a) (1) is expressly \u201cnot limited to\u201d the several examples provided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b196-6\"> The defendant cites numerous cases from other jurisdictions which he avers stand for the principle that a person on premises with consent cannot be convicted of burglary. These cases, however, are distinguishable from the factual situation presently before us. They stand for the general proposition, with which we do not quarrel, that a person who has permission, license or authorization to enter a particular area cannot be found guilty of burglary therein. E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>182 Colo. 3, 5, 510 P.2d 435 (1973); <em>People </em>v. <em>Carstensen, </em>161 Colo. 249, 250, 420 P.2d 820 (1966); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thibeault, </em>402 A.2d 445, 448-49 (Me. 1979). By urging a rigid application of this general rule, the defendant effectively seeks this court to adopt a per se rule to the effect that one who obtains consent to enter a portion of a single family home can never be guilty of burglary with respect to a different section therein. We will not subscribe to such a blanket construction of the term \u201cbuilding,\u201d which decimates the purpose of the burglary statutes and which ignores the myriad of factual circumstances under which a burglary may occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">We caution, however, that our conclusion should nqt be construed as a relaxation of the requirement that an actor must enter or remain \u201cunlawfully in a building.\u201d Where, as here, the state seeks a burglary conviction based upon unlawful entry of a separate unit within a structure, its burden includes a sufficient showing that any license or privilege to remain in one section of the structure did not extend to the separate unit wherein the burglary allegedly occurred. We hold only that this burden was satisfied in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b197-6\"> In reference to the definition of the term \u201cbuilding,\u201d the trial court charged as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">\u201cBurglary is an intrusionary offense. It cannot exist without the element of intrusion and that intrusion must be in what the law calls a building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">\u201cNot everything that is built is a building. Ordinarily, and especially in connection with the crime you are considering, that word implies a structure which may be entered and used by human beings, whether or not actually so entered and used as a dwelling, or for business or for other purposes involving occupancy by people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">\u201cThe law, however, has broadened this definition to include, in addition to what we usually know as a building, a watercraft, aircraft, trailer, sleeping car, railroad car, or other structure or vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-10\">\u201cOne other consideration must also be mentioned in this connection. When a building consists of two or more units separately secured or occupied, any one of these units, when intruded upon within the reach of the law we are now considering, may be considered as a separate building. By the same token, however, the whole building is considered nonetheless a building for the purposes of unlawful intrusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-11\">\u201cSo, once again, if a building, or a building is defined as follows: A building, in addition to its ordinary meaning, includes any watercraft, aircraft, trailer, sleeping car, railroad car, or other structure or vehicle. Where a building consists of separate units such as, but not limited to, separate apartments, offices or rented rooms, any unit not occupied by the actor is, in addition to being part of such building, a separate building.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b199-5\"> Including sales tax, the purchase price of the system, in May of 1978 and March of 1979, respectively, was $518.95 and $540.35.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Thompson testified that the total \u201clist price\u201d of the sound system was $545 in May of 1978 and $560 in March of 1979. He defined \u201clist price\u201d as the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price on each separate component of the stereo system. Thompson made it clear, however, that \u201cdiscounting\u201d from the \u201clist price\u201d was very common, and that selling various components in a \u201cpackage deal\u201d further lowered the selling price of a stereo system. Thus, although the \u201clist price\u201d of the individual components totaled $545 and $560 in May of 1978 and March of 1979, Thompson stated that the price at which he sold a system containing the components of Williams\u2019 stereo, on a package basis, was $485 and $505 in May of 1978 and March of 1979, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b199-7\"> In response to defense counsel\u2019s question as to the value of Williams\u2019 stereo on March 7, 1979, Thompson stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">\u201cA. Well, we spoke earlier of depreciation, you know, if the gear still existed and were to be put on the market there probably would be some depreciation. So it would not be worth four hundred eight-five dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">\u201cQ. What would it be worth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-10\">\u201cA. I have no idea. There is not really a very positive way of ascertaining that without the gear, without having someone evaluate it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-11\">\u201cQ. Well, wouldn\u2019t it depreciate at least by ten percent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-12\">\u201cA. I would say roughly somewhere in that ballpark.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b201-7\"> The parties agree that sales tax is not a component of market value. In May of 1978, Connecticut\u2019s sales tax was 7 percent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b202-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 53a-124 states in pertinent part: \u201clarceny IN THE THIRD DEGREE: CLASS B MISDEMEANOR, (a) A person is guilty of larceny in the third degree when: (1) The value of the property . . . exceeds fifty dollars . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b203-9\"> Because one count of the defendant\u2019s conviction as a persistent felony offender was premised upon his conviction of the felony of larceny in the second degree, that conviction will have to be set aside, as the state concedes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
