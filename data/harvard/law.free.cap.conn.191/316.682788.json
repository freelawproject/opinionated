Binsse, <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ramela Martin, and Doris Hodge,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the plaintiff, Martin Schwarzschild, in connection with the purchase of the stock in the Roosevelt School located in Stamford.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A subsequent addendum to the May 18 agreement between the plaintiff and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>defendants contains the arbitration clause involved in this appeal: \u201cIf there shall be any dispute under this agreement the parties agree to submit it to arbitration . . . The addendum is signed by all three defendants, but not by Martin Schwarzschild.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">A short time after the note was executed, the defendants defaulted. By letter dated November 26, 1973, arbitration was requested by all of the defendants. This arbitration session, however, was never completed; a mistrial was declared due to the resignation of one of the arbitrators. Although the record reveals neither when this first hearing began nor when it concluded, it was not until the hearing was well under way that the defendants learned that Martin Schwarzschild had not signed the arbitration addendum. The defendants promptly initiated a civil action, <em>Ramela Martin et al. </em>v. <em>Martin Schwarzschild </em>(No. 0029537),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> claiming fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>and invalidity of the contract and seeking, inter alia, recission of the contract and an order restraining further arbitration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In October of 1975, the plaintiff commenced an action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-410 and 52-411<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for an order directing the defendants to proceed with arbitration and for a further order appointing a replacement for the arbitrator who had resigned during the first hearing. The trial court, <em>Stapleton, J., </em>directed all parties promptly to proceed to arbitration, pending and subject to final judgments in two other related cases, <em>Schwarzschild </em>v. <em>Binsse et al, </em>and <em>Ramela Martin </em>v. <em>Schwarzschild </em>(No. 156872). The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion to stay the proceedings in the latter case, and on October 25,1977, the court, <em>Zarrilli, J., </em>granted the motion and ordered the parties to proceed to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">On February 27,1979, the arbitrators issued a unanimous finding holding the defendants jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff for $144,301.09 and providing that \u201c[a]ll other claims made by any other parties are disallowed.\u201d When the applications by the defendants to vacate and by the plaintiff to confirm the arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>tion award were joined for trial, the court, <em>Belinkie, J., </em>confirmed the award. It is from this judgment, dated April 27,1981, that the defendant estate takes the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The defendant estate presents the following issues on appeal: (1) whether the agreement in this case constituted an arbitrable contract; (2) whether the arbitration award conformed to the submission; (3) whether a prior Superior Court order by the court, <em>Stapleton, J., </em>invalidated the arbitration proceedings; (4) whether the issue of timely presentation of a claim to the estate of Binsse was considered by the arbitrators; and (5) whether there was proof of partiality by one of the arbitrators sufficient to invalidate the award.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We shall consider each of these claims separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The threshold question involved in this appeal concerns the issue of the validity of the arbitration agreement and consequently the arbitrability of the dispute. The defendant argues that since the arbitration addendum was not signed by the plaintiff, it was not valid or binding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Section 52-408 of the General Statutes provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a]n agreement in any written contract or in a separate writing executed by the parties to any written contract, to settle by arbitration any controversy thereafter arising out of such contract . . . shall be valid, irrevocable and enforceable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>except when there exists sufficient cause at law or in equity for the avoidance of written contracts generally.\u201d Nowhere in the statute is found the specific requirement urged on us by the defendant that the contract be signed by both parties. The statute requires only that the agreement between the parties be contained in a \u201cwritten contract\u201d or \u201cseparate writing\u201d;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> this requirement has been resolved in the plaintiffs favor by both the arbitrators and the trial court. We find no error in this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Of paramount importance to the resolution of this issue is the fact that it is the defendant, the party whose signature <em>is </em>found on the arbitration agreement, who is seeking to avoid the arbitration award. Furthermore, it is the defendant who initially not only petitioned for arbitration but also participated in the arbitration sessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">As evidenced by its signature as well as its initiation of the arbitration proceedings, the defendant recognized and agreed to the contract to arbitrate. One enjoying rights is estopped from repudiating dependent obligations which he has assumed; parties cannot accept benefits under a contract fairly made and at the same time question its validity. <em>Mozzochi </em>v. <em>Luchs, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 19, 23, 391 A.2d 738 (1977). Clearly, the quid pro quo accorded both parties was the mechanism of arbitration, a benefit which served to avoid the expense and delay of court proceedings. \u201cIn the absence of a statute requiring a signature . . . parties may become bound by the terms of a contract, even though they do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>not sign it, where their assent is otherwise indicated, such as by the acceptance of benefits under the contract.\u201d 17 Am. Jur. 2d, Contracts \u00a7 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">It is incongruous for the defendants to have initiated and attended the initial arbitration proceedings, although aborted, and then to question the propriety of the arbitration agreement in the reinstituted hearing. We therefore hold that a party who signs an arbitration agreement, petitions a court for arbitration, then participates in the arbitration proceedings may not later avoid his agreement because of a claim that the other party did not sign the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">In a subsidiary claim, the defendant asserts that the arbitrators exceeded their powers; General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 52-418 (d);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in that they exceeded the scope of the submission by deciding the question of arbitrability. By this argument the defendant effectively seeks a second determination, pursuant to \u00a7 52-418, on the issue of whether there exists a binding agreement to arbitrate. We will not countenance such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>In <em>Waterbury Board of Education </em>v. <em>Waterbury Teachers Assn., </em>168 Conn. 54, 357 A.2d 466 (1975), we recognized that the arbitrability of a dispute, although properly raised on a motion to vacate, is a distinct claim which may not be reviewed pursuant to the specific proscriptions of \u00a7 52-418. \u201c \u2018[T]he court is bound by the arbitrator\u2019s determination unless that determination clearly falls within the proscriptions of \u00a7 52-418 of the General Statutes, <em>or procedurally violates the parties\u2019 agreement.\u2019 </em>Thus, the mere conformity of the submission to the award does not foreclose the court from reviewing whether that award is in violation of the parties\u2019 agreement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 63. In <em>New Britain </em>v. <em>Connecticut State Board of Mediation &amp; Arbitration, </em>178 Conn. 557, 560-61, 424 A.2d 263 (1979), we outlined two ways in which, in the ordinary case, a party may question the arbitrability of a particular issue. First, he may refuse to submit to arbitration at the outset and instead compel a judicial determination of the issue of arbitrability. His other alternative is to submit the issue in conjunction with the merits of the dispute to the arbitrators themselves. Id., 560. Left unanswered in <em>New Britain, </em>however, was the procedural question presented by this case: when a party to a pending case has refused to arbitrate voluntarily, thus requiring the other party, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-409,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to compel arbitration by gaining a \u201cjudicial reconciliation\u201d of the threshold issue of arbitrability; <em>New Britain </em>v. <em>Connecticut State Board </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number><em>of Mediation &amp; Arbitration, </em>supra, 561; may the party who is forced to arbitrate later raise the arbitrability issue in the Superior Court as a basis for vacating an arbitration award? To be consistent with the view that a \u00a7 52-409 order requiring arbitration is not a judgment from which an appeal lies; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Schwarzschild, </em>174 Conn. 778, 380 A.2d 538 (1977); the issue of arbitrability necessarily must be reviewable upon application to the Superior Court. To hold otherwise would be to deny appellate review to a claim which we previously precluded from review on the grounds that it was premature. Thus, although we refuse to consider the defendant\u2019s claim of arbitrability as couched in the language of \u00a7 52-418, under these circumstances we recognize the issue as properly before us. To the extent that the trial court refused to consider the arbitrability of the dispute in light of the all inclusive language of the submission, the decision is erroneous. This error, however, is harmless, since we have previously rejected the merits of the defendant\u2019s arbitrability claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The defendant next claims that the arbitration award should be vacated because the arbitrators \u201cexceeded their powers\u201d; General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 52-418 (d); by acting at all. The estate claims that in view of a stay granted by the trial court, <em>Stapleton, J.,</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in 1976, arbitration could not subsequently take place, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>even though the court, <em>Zarrilli, J., </em>ordered the commencement of arbitration in 1977. This claim is without merit and was properly rejected by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The decision by the court, <em>Zarrilli, J., </em>was rendered in the plaintiffs favor upon a motion for stay of proceedings in <em>Ramela Martin </em>v. <em>Schwarzschild </em>(No. 156872) pending arbitration. The order discussed the existence of the prior order by the court, <em>Stapleton, J., </em>and properly concluded that it was not bound by this earlier order on the grounds of res judicata: \u201cThe law is well settled that the decision by one judge is not binding on another judge when later in the same proceeding, he is confronted with a like question. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sul, </em>146 Conn. 78, 83, [147 A.2d 686 (1958)]; <em>Christiano </em>v. <em>Christiano, </em>131 Conn. 589, 596, [41 A.2d 779 (1945)]. Tf the same point is again raised he has the same right to reconsider the question as if he had himself made the original decision.\u2019 <em>Levay </em>v. <em>Levay, </em>137 Conn. 92, 96, [75 A.2d 400 (1950)]; see also <em>Santoro </em>v. <em>Kleinberger, </em>115 Conn. 631, 638, [163 A.107 (1932)].\u201d <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>186 Conn. 86, 98-99, 439 A.2d 1066 (1982). Accordingly, the court, <em>Zarrilli, J., </em>stayed the defendant\u2019s attempt to invalidate the arbitration agreement and ordered the parties to proceed with arbitration as expeditiously as possible. The then defendant Martin\u2019s appeal from this order was subsequently dismissed by this court for lack of a final judgment. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Schwarzschild, </em>supra. We conclude that the ruling by Judge Zarrilli was well within the authority of the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 52-409. The claim that the arbitrators \u201cexceeded their powers\u201d under these circumstances cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Little need be said relative to the defendant\u2019s contention that the issue of timely presentation of a claim to the estate of Binsse was not considered by the arbitrators. The defendant claims that after the death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Edward Binsse, the plaintiff failed to present his claim against the estate within the time limited by General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 45-205.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that the defendant\u2019s contention was \u201cnot supported by any evidence and is refuted by the only evidence before the court . . . .\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The estate failed to make a factual showing to support its position that its defense to liability had not been heard and resolved by the arbitrators. It failed to prove that the nonclaim defense was not considered at the arbitration because it did not introduce the record of the arbitration proceedings to the trial court. The burden rests upon the appellant to show that there was error in the judgment from which the appeal is taken, and that includes the preparation of a proper record. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pilch, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 536, 539, 394 A.2d 1364 (1977); see <em>also Barnes </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>190 Conn. 491, 494, 460 A.2d 1302 (1983). Although a true picture may not be presented, the case must be decided on the record before us. <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>164 Conn. 387, 389, 321 A.2d 443 (1973). Since the circumstantial evidence included in the present record indicates that the nonclaim issue was submitted to the arbitrators, and since the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ant failed to introduce the record of the arbitration proceedings to prove otherwise, the decision reached by the trial court must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The defendant\u2019s final claim of unlawful bias on the part of one of the arbitrators, Joseph P. Zone, is equally unpersuasive. The estate argues that Zone should have disqualified himself at the second arbitration hearing because he had attended the first proceeding prior to its inconclusive termination. Evidence offered by the defendant at the trial, if believed, would show only that \u201cthere were papers that Mr. Zone appeared to have had with him\u201d that \u201cdid not appear to be part of the records that [were] in front of us at that time.\u201d We agree with the trial court that this testimony alone is insufficient to substantiate any claim of partiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">It is the established policy of this court to regard arbitration awards with liberality. That is, every reasonable presumption will be made in favor of the arbitrators\u2019 acts. The burden rests on the party attacking the award to produce sufficient evidence to invalidate it. <em>Milford Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>179 Conn. 678, 683, 427 A.2d 859 (1980). Absent a showing of \u201cperverse misconstruction or positive misconduct\u201d or a provision in the agreement authorizing it, the determination of the arbitrator is not subject to judicial inquiry. <em>Danbury Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>United Rubber Workers, </em>20 Conn. Sup. 300, 308, 134 A.2d 356 (1957), aff\u2019d, 145 Conn. 53, 138 A.2d 783 (1958). This court has summarily rejected attempts to overturn arbitration awards on grounds of partiality in cases, like the present one, which lacked sufficient evidentiary support. <em>Von Langendorff </em>v. <em>Riordan, </em>147 Conn. 524, 163 A.2d 100 (1960). Accordingly, we find that there is no basis for vacating the decision of the arbitrators on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The defendant estate presents in its appeal a plethora of grounds for the vacation of the arbitrators\u2019 award; we remain unpersuaded of the existence of any of the defects which would require vacation of the award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418. For the foregoing reason, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s application to vacate the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-8\"> Edward Binsse died in June of 1973; all proceedings thereafter have been conducted in the name of his estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b327-9\"> While the defendant\u2019s brief repeatedly refers to \u201cdefendants\u201d and \u201cappellants-Estate of Binsse and Martin,\u201d at oral argument counsel for the defendant estate explained that the estate of Binsse is the sole defendant pursuing this appeal.
