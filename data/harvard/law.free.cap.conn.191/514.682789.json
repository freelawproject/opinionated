The petitioner, Southern Connecticut Gas Company (hereinafter gas company), sought appointment of a receiver for the rental income of the respondent, housing authority of New Haven (hereinafter housing authority), alleging that the housing authority was in substantial default of payments due for gas service in designated state and federally financed premises for which the housing authority was the owner, agent, lessor or manager. Despite procedural and substantive objections by the respondent, the trial court found an outstanding indebtedness of $799,387.83, and appointed a receiver pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ant to General Statutes \u00a7 16-2621<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The respondent promptly appealed from the judgment of the trial court. During the pendency of the appeal from this judgment, its effect was stayed so that the appointed receiver has not yet undertaken his court-ordered responsibilities. Pending resolution of the appeal, the gas company has continued to provide gas service and the housing authority has paid, in part under protest and subject to a claim of refund, the amount of $1,760,000. Relying on those payments, the respondent housing authority thereupon moved the trial court to vacate its judgment and to dismiss the petition for the appointment of a receiver. The trial court granted this motion. Two appeals are currently before us, the respondent\u2019s appeal from the appointment of the rent receiver, and the petitioner\u2019s appeal from the receivership\u2019s termination. We find no error in the first appeal but error in the second appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The respondent housing authority raises four issues in its appeal. It claims error in the trial court's: (1) denial of its motion to dismiss the petition for receivership; (2) failure to uphold its alleged exemption under General Statutes \u00a7 8-65; (3) failure to hold the rent receivership statute, General Statutes \u00a7 16-262f, unconstitutional; and (4) limitation of the scope of the rent receivership hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>The respondent moved the trial court to dismiss the petition for a receivership on the ground that the petitioner had failed to comply with the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 506. That section, which governs the appointment of \u201ca receiver of rents . . . in or ancillary to a civil action,\u201d appears to contemplate the initiation of a prior or contemporaneous civil action to which the receivership can relate. The petitioner was alleged to have filed no civil action. Although the petitioner has in fact commenced civil proceedings in the trial court since that time,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it contested the motion to dismiss on the basis that the Practice Book section was inapplicable to utility rent receiverships under \u00a7 16-262f, The trial court, relying on the holding in <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 609, 613-15, 401 A.2d 454 (1978), that such a utility rent receivership proceeding is a special statutory proceeding and not a civil action, denied the motion to dismiss. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Section 16-262\u00cd permits public service companies to petition for a statutory rent receivership under limited circumstances that are statutorily linked to the \u00a7 16-262e (a) prohibition on the termination of utility services. Under \u00a7 16-262e (a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> service may not be terminated: (1) to a residential dwelling; (2) despite nonpayment of a delinquent account; (3) for service billed directly to the residential building\u2019s lessor, owner, agent or manager; and (4) when it is impracticable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>occupants of the building to receive service in their own name. Unable to terminate service to such a residential dwelling, public service companies are expressly instructed, by \u00a7 16-262e (a), to \u201cpursue the remedy provided in section 16-2621\u201d Under \u00a7 16-262\u00cd, a public service company may seek appointment of a receiver of the rents upon the \u201cdefault of the owner, agent, lessor or manager of a residential dwelling who is billed directly . . . for utility service furnished to such building . . . .\u2019\u2019The section requires an immediate judicial order \u201cto show cause why a receiver should not be appointed,\u201d and a prompt hearing, whose \u201csole purpose . . . shall be to determine whether there is a sum due and owing between the owner, agent, lessor, or manager and the . . . utility.\u201d The summary rent receivership proceedings authorized by \u00a7 16-262f constitute, as we have previously recognized, a statutory tradeoff for the requirement of continued service imposed by \u00a7 16-262e <em>(a). Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>183 Conn. 85, 94, 438 A.2d 828, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 837, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>102 S. Ct. 143, 70 L. Ed. 2d 118 (1981). Because these statutory proceedings are sui generis, they do not require the filing of a companion civil action, and the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The respondent\u2019s second claim of error maintains that a public housing authority is afforded immunity from the rent receivership provisions of \u00a7 16-262\u00cd by virtue of the exemption provision of \u00a7 8-65 of the General Statutes. Under that section, \u201c[a]ll real and personal property ... of a housing authority shall be exempt from . . . execution ... or other judicial process . . . provided the provisions of this section shall not apply to or limit . . . the right of obligees to pursue any remedies for the enforcement of any pledge or lien given by a housing authority on its rents . . . .\u201d The trial court found this claim to be unpersuasive because it concluded that the word \u201clien\u201d should be read to include involuntary as well as voluntary liens. On such a reading of \u201clien,\u201d a rent receivership could be encompassed within the proviso of \u00a7 8-65, and the two statutes would not be in conflict. Although we disagree with this reasoning, we find the respondent\u2019s claim unsustainable on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The precise ambit of the provisions of \u00a7 8-65 need not be determined today. For present purposes, it suffices to note that its language appears to address directly only two types of liens: judicial liens, which are forbidden, and consensual liens, which are permitted. We are concerned, in this case, with a receivership which, if it were to be considered a lien at all, would be a statutory lien. The receivership authorized by \u00a7 16-262f does not result in the issuance of \u201cexecution or other judicial process,\u201d nor does it arise out of a \u201cpledge or lien given by a housing authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>The statutory problem confronting us can be summarized as follows. Section 8-65, which specifically establishes the immunity of public housing authorities, makes no provision for any kind of statutory liens, including statutory rent receiverships. Section 16-262f, which specifically establishes a right to a utility rent receivership, makes no distinction between private and public ownership of residential dwellings,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and hence makes no specific provision for public housing authorities. We believe that this statutory standoff is best resolved on the basis that \u00a7 16-262\u00cd, because it was enacted in 1975, must prevail over \u00a7 8-65, which was enacted in 1939. It is a well established principle of statutory construction that later enactments by the General Assembly are presumed to repeal earlier inconsistent ones to the extent that they are in conflict. <em>Beccia </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>185 Conn. 445, 458, 441 A.2d 131 (1981); <em>C. White &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rocky Hill, </em>181 Conn. 114, 123, 434 A.2d 949 (1980); <em>Pizzola </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>167 Conn. 202, 206, 355 A.2d 21 (1974). Furthermore, a later enactment will have this effect without regard to the characterization of either act as general or specific in its effect. <em>Beccia </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra. Although repeal by implication is generally disfavored, this route is incumbent upon us when, as in this case, the two relevant statutes cannot stand together. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Carbone, </em>172 Conn. 242, 256, 374 A.2d 215, cert. denied, 431 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>U.S. 967, 97 S. Ct. 2925, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1063 (1977). The respondent housing authority therefore cannot prevail on this claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The respondent\u2019s third and fourth claims of error relate to that provision of \u00a7 16-262\u00cd which limits the scope of the judicial hearing on the application for a rent receivership. Under \u00a7 16-262\u00cd (a), the court is authorized to hold a hearing no later than seventy-two hours after the issuance of a show cause order relating to the receivership. \u201cThe sole purpose of such a hearing,\u201d according to the statute, \u201cshall be to determine whether there is a sum due and owing between the owner, agent, lessor, or manager and the company or municipal utility.\u201d In its third claim of error, the respondent challenges the constitutionality of so limited a hearing, and in its fourth claim of error it challenges the propriety of evidentiary rulings grounded in the limitations statutorily imposed on the hearing. We find neither of these claims persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The respondent\u2019s constitutional attack on \u00a7 16-262\u00cd argues that it is impermissible under the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions; Conn. Const., art. I \u00a7 10; U.S. Const., amend. XIV; to restrict the issues that can be heard on a receivership petition. The respondent makes this argument both on its own behalf and on behalf of other creditors who are alleged to have superior claims to the housing authority\u2019s rent receipts. As to the latter, the respondent has failed to demonstrate how alleged invasion of the rights of others gives rise to a constitutional claim that this respondent may pursue. We have uniformly resisted the efforts of litigants to assert constitutional claims of others not in a direct adversarial posture before the court. See <em>General Electric Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>185 Conn. 583, 593-600, 441 A.2d 581 (1981); <em>Hardware Mutual Casualty </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number><em>Co. </em>v. <em>Premo, </em>153 Conn. 465, 470-71, 217 A.2d 698 (1966). As to the former, we agree with the holding in <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 609, 613, 401 A.2d 454 (1978), that the legislature may constitutionally provide for a receivership proceeding that is \u201cshort, concise, peremptory and immediate.\u201d The defenses that the respondent may raise under this statute are no more limited than those available in the statutory summary eviction proceedings which the Supreme Court of the United States found to comport with the requirements of due process in <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Normet, </em>405 U.S. 56, 64-69, 92 S. Ct. 862, 31 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1971). Our constitution, in the circumstances of this case, requires no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The respondent\u2019s evidentiary claims largely fall by the wayside once we uphold the limited scope of the statutory proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court was clearly correct in refusing to admit proffered evidence on the practical effect of a rent receivership and on possible federal preemptive rights. The respondent\u2019s claim that some of the properties in question did not qualify for a rent receivership because the \u201cleased building program\u201d did not make the housing authority the \u201cowner, manager, operator or agent of said premises\u201d might have warranted trial court inquiry to see whether the statute was applicable at all. That claim has, however, become moot by the fact that it relates to federal housing projects which have fully settled their disputes with the petitioner.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>We therefore conclude that the trial court was correct in appointing a rent receiver, in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 16-262f, once it found the respondent housing authority to be substantially indebted to the petitioner. There is no error in appeal No. 9587, the respondent\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The second appeal in this case is an appeal by the petitioner gas company from a judgment terminating the rent receivership because of substantial payments by the respondent housing authority to the petitioner subsequent to the original order for the appointment of a rent receiver. The trial court concluded that termination of the receivership, which had in fact never been formally implemented, was required by the terms of \u00a7 16-262\u00cd (b) \u201cbecause the original arrearage has been paid.\u201d On this basis, the trial court found it unnecessary to address issues before it relating to late charges, interest, and accord and satisfaction. We disagree that it was proper to terminate the receivership without first resolving the questions raised by the parties concerning the proper allocation of the various moneys paid to the petitioner during the pendency of the appeal from the appointment of the receiver. The issues will have to be resolved at a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The termination hearing proceeded in accordance with a stipulation of facts that established the following. Of the amount of $799,387.83 found to have been due and owing as an arrearage at the time of the original receivership proceedings, $531,413.75 was attributable to the state-financed projects still subject to the rent receivership at the time of the termination hearing. In its calculation of the amount originally due and owing, the court had included both amounts for gas supplied and for \u201clate charges,\u201d so that it was inaccurate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>originally to have characterized the designated amount as consisting entirely of an \u201carrearage.\u201d The parties were in disagreement about the proper allocation of moneys paid to the petitioner after the receivership had been ordered. The respondent tendered its payments for attribution to current charges and to certain designated arrearages, while the petitioner applied the payments first to late charges, then to the oldest previous balance and only lastly to current gas charges. This disagreement about allocation of particular payments mirrored a general disagreement about the liability of the respondent housing authority to pay late charges or interest. During the relevant period, the respondent housing authority has paid approximately $1,760,000 to the petitioner, in part under protest. With respect to the two projects, Brookside and McConaughty, for which the petitioner claims that there were still sums due and owing at the time of the termination hearing, the petitioner has billed the respondent about $1,080,000 for gas delivered and about $230,000 for late charges; on those accounts, $84,000 was still due and owing.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">In determining that these facts warranted termination of the receivership, the trial court focused on the language of \u00a7 16-262f (b) that \u201c[a]ny receivership established pursuant to [\u00a7 16-262\u00cd (a)] shall be terminated by the court upon its finding that the arrearage which was the subject of the original petition has been satisfied . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Comparing $1,760,000, the amount paid to the gas company, with the amount of approximately $531,000 originally due and owing that was attributable to the state-financed projects still subject to the receivership, the court concluded that the statutory criterion had been met. On this reading of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>statute, it was, in the view of the trial court, unnecessary to determine the disputed issues of the gas company\u2019s entitlement to late charges, interest, or attorney\u2019s fees. Because we disagree with the trial court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 16-262\u00cd (b), we find it necessary to order a new trial for the resolution of the various points of contention between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The reference in \u00a7 16-262\u00cd (b) to \u201cthe arrearage which . . . has been satisfied\u201d cannot be read in isolation from the provisions in \u00a7 16-262\u00cd (a) that specify the allocation of receivership collections. Although the receivership in this case was never in fact implemented, the trial court, with the consent of the parties, treated the motion for termination as if the appointed receiver had undertaken to collect rental payments during the time that the receivership was in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Section 16-262\u00cd (a) has specific instructions for the allocation of rental payments collected pursuant to a statutory utility rent receivership. The receiver must first pay the petitioning utility company for utility services supplied on and after the date of the receiver\u2019s appointment. Thereafter, provision is made for the payment of reasonable fees and costs due the receiver, and then for the payment of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred by the petitioner. Only after all these payments have been made are moneys from rentals to be applied to any arrearage found by the court to be due and owing. Although a court is empowered to order an accounting \u201cat such times as it determines to be just, reasonable and necessary,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> nothing anywhere in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>\u00a7 16-262f authorizes an accounting to depart from the statutory priority which allocates collected rentals to arrearages only after current charges, receivership fees, and attorney\u2019s fees have first been paid. In other words, it is impossible to determine whether \u201cthe arrearage . . . has been satisfied,\u201d in \u00a7 16-262f (b), until it is determined what constitutes \u201cpayment for current . . . gas . . . service\u201d and \u201cpayment . . . for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs\u201d in \u00a7 16-262\u00cd (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">It is clear from the record that, in this case, there were a number of disputed issues with regard to payments for \u201ccurrent service\u201d and entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees. Apart from our conclusion that termination of the receivership was premature until these issues were resolved, we express no opinion on their merits. We have made no determination concerning either the procedural or the substantive soundness of the petitioner\u2019s claims that there are still sums due and owing to it. Only a new trial can properly adjudicate these claims and the respondent\u2019s defenses thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">There is error in appeal No. 11838, the petitioner\u2019s appeal. The judgment in that appeal is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. There is no error in appeal No. 9587.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-5\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 16-262f. petition for receiver of rents; HEARING; APPOINTMENT; DUTIES.

After a default has once been properly established, a statute may constitutionally continue a receivership until all present and past indebtedness related to the receivership has been paid. As we held in <em>Hartford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>183 Conn. 85, 89-90, 438 A.2d 828, cert. denied, 454 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>837, 102 S. Ct. 143, 70 L. Ed. 2d 118 (1981), lesser constitutional safeguards attach to postjudgment than to prejudgment remedies. The respondent is therefore incorrect in his argument that constitutional principles require us to accept the trial court\u2019s construction of General Statutes \u00a7 16-262\u00cd (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
