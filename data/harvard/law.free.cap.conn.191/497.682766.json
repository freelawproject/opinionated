The defendants<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> have appealed maintaining that an order of mandamus was improper because (1) the commissioner performs a discretionary duty when awarding a public work contract; (2) the plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law; and (3) the plaintiffs bid was incomplete, requiring the commissioner to reject the bid pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-137e (c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We do not reach any of these issues but conclude that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring this action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The facts are not disputed. The commissioner solicited bids for the project pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-137a.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff and fourteen other construc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>tion companies submitted bids on forms supplied by the department of administrative services.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On January 12, 1983, a public bid opening was held where it was announced that the plaintiff had submitted the lowest bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">On January 17,1983, the department of administrative services rejected the plaintiffs bid because the signature of the president, who purported to act as the agent for the company, had been impressed on the bidding form with a rubber stamp. The administrative services department had in the past maintained the practice of rejecting all bids that did not have an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>original handwritten signature.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to the chief bidding officer, the department interpreted General Statutes \u00a7 4-137e (b) E<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to require handwritten signatures. He conceded, however, that the department had not promulgated any regulation concerning its interpretation of the statute, and that no bidders had been notified of the requirement that bids be signed by hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The commissioner eventually awarded the contract to the defendant A. Petrucci Construction Company, the next lowest bidder. The plaintiff sought a temporary restraining order against the construction company as well as the commissioner, which was granted on March 11,1983. There has been no work performed on the project since that order was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">In <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Lukens Steel Co., </em>310 U.S. 113, 125-30, 60 S. Ct. 869, 84 L. Ed. 1108 (1940), it was held that prospective bidders had no standing to challenge an administrative interpretation of a public contract law because the competitive bidding statutes were enacted solely for the protection of the public and conferred no enforceable rights upon those seeking to do business with the government. \u201cCourts should not, where Congress has not done so, subject purchasing agencies of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Government to the delays necessarily incident to judicial scrutiny at the instance of potential sellers, which would be contrary to traditional governmental practice and would create a new concept of judicial controversies.\u201d Id., 130. Although the delay occasioned by this litigation has been greatly curtailed by our granting a motion for an expedited appeal, a period of more than six months has elapsed since this action was brought during which needed repair work upon a state facility has been stalled and may now have to be performed under conditions different from those contemplated when bids were submitted. This court has consistently followed the view that an unsuccessful bidder has no standing to challenge the award of a public contract. <em>Joseph Rugo, Inc. </em>v. <em>Henson, </em>148 Conn. 430, 171 A.2d 409 (1961); <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>143 Conn. 338, 122 A.2d 399 (1956); 10 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d Ed. Rev.) \u00a7 29.77. Recently, in <em>Spiniello Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>189 Conn. 539, 456 A.2d 1199 (1983), we held that only \u201cwhere fraud, corruption or favoritism has influenced the conduct of the bidding officials or when the very object and integrity of the competitive bidding process is defeated by the conduct of municipal officials,\u201d does an unsuccessful bidder have standing to challenge the award. Id., 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\u201cStanding is the legal right to set judicial machinery in motion. One cannot rightfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court unless he has, in an individual or representative capacity, some real interest in the cause of action, or a legal or equitable right, title or interest in the subject matter of the controversy.\u201d <em>Hiland </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>28 Conn. Sup. 243, 245, 257 A.2d 822 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">This court has declared that \u201c[a] bid, even the lowest responsible one, submitted in response to an invitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>for bids is only an offer which, until accepted by the municipality, does not give rise to a contract between the parties.\u201d <em>John J. Brennan Construction Corporation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>187 Conn. 695, 702, 448 A.2d 180 (1982), citing <em>Joseph Rugo, Inc. </em>v. <em>Henson, </em>190 F. Sup. 281 (D. Conn. 1960); see also <em>Spiniello Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>supra; <em>Joseph Rugo, Inc. </em>v. <em>Henson, </em>148 Conn. 430, 171 A.2d 409 (1961); <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>supra; 10 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d Ed. Rev.) \u00a7 29.80. An unsuccessful bidder, therefore, has no legal or equitable right in the contract. Not unlike any other person whose offer has been rejected, the disappointed bidder has no right to judicial intervention.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Lukens Steel Co., </em>supra, 129; <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>supra, 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Absent any impairment of a private right, judicial review may be obtained only when authorized by statute. In the federal arena, a disappointed bidder has standing under the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702, which provides, \u201c[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, <em>or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action </em>within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See <em>B. K. Instrument, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>715 F.2d 713 (2d Cir. 1983); <em>Airco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Energy Research &amp; Development Administration, </em>528 F.2d 1294 (7th Cir. 1975) (per curiam); <em>Armstrong &amp; Armstrong, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>514 F.2d 402 (9th Cir. 1975) (per curiam); <em>Hayes International Corporation </em>v. <em>McLucas, </em>509 F.2d 247 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 864, 96 S. Ct. 123, 46 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1975); <em>William F. Wilke, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of the Army, </em>485 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>F.2d 180 (4th Cir. 1973); <em>Merriam v. Kunzig, </em>476 F.2d 1233 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 911, 94 S. Ct. 233, 38 L. Ed. 2d 149 (1973); <em>Scanwell Laboratories, Inc. v. Shaffer, </em>424 F.2d 859 (D.C. Cir. 1970).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Connecticut counterpart to \u00a7 702, however, is much more limited in scope. It provides that \u201c[a] person who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a). A party seeking review of a state agency\u2019s action, therefore, must establish more than aggrievement (injury in fact); he must establish that the injury resulted from a final decision in a contested case.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Rybinski </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>173 Conn. 462, 469-72, 378 A.2d 547 (1977) (commission meeting not a hearing within purview of General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 [2]; therefore not a contested case); <em>Old Rock Road Corporation </em>v. <em>Commission on Special Revenue, </em>173 Conn. 384, 387-88, 377 A.2d 1119 (1977) (provisional grant of racing license not a final decision). An agency decision to reject a bid or to award a contract has none of the attributes of a formal hearing, nor is a formal hearing required by law. For this reason, the agency\u2019s decision does not involve a contested case, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>the disappointed bidder cannot assert standing under \u00a7 4-183 of the Administrative Procedure Act. See <em>Rybinski </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019Retirement Commission, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Nor does the competitive bidding statute provide the disappointed bidder with standing. This court has frequently declared \u201c[m]unicipal competitive bidding laws are enacted to guard against such evils as favoritism, fraud or corruption in the award of contracts, to secure the best product at the lowest price, and to benefit the taxpayers, not the bidders.\u201d <em>John J. Brennan Construction Corporation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>187 Conn. 695, 702, 448 A.2d 180 (1982); see also <em>Joseph Rugo, Inc. </em>v. <em>Henson, </em>148 Conn. 430, 435, 171 A.2d 409 (1961); <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>supra, 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">In <em>Spiniello Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>189 Conn. 539, 456 A.2d 1199 (1983), we recognized that our prior decisions had the effect of preventing judicial review of potentially meritorious claims concerning the implementation and execution of competitive bidding statutes. We also acknowledged the fact that the group most benefited by the statute \u2014 the public \u2014 had no effective means of protecting their interests. We substantially adopted the position in <em>Scanwell </em>that \u201c[t]he public interest in preventing the granting of contracts through arbitrary or capricious action can properly be vindicated through a suit brought by one who suffers injury as a result of the illegal activity, but the suit itself is brought in the public interest by one acting essentially as a \u2018private attorney general.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scanwell Laboratories, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shaffer, </em>supra, 864; see generally Davis, Administrative Law Treatise (2d Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 24:2, 24:3. Thus, we held that where fraud, corruption or acts undermining the objective and integrity of the bidding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>process existed, an unsuccessful bidder did have standing under the public bidding statute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We limited the scope of our holding in order to strike the proper balance between fulfilling the purposes of the competitive bidding statutes and preventing frequent litigation that might result in extensive delay in the commencement and completion of government projects to the detriment of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">We are unable to agree with the trial court that the commissioner\u2019s actions so undermined the competitive bidding process as to fall within the exception recognized in <em>Spiniello. </em>There was no allegation of fraud or favoritism, nor was either proven.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plaintiff attempted to establish only that the practice was so arbitrary as to undermine the bidding statute. This case, however, involves none of the factors we considered significant in <em>Spiniello. </em>There, the municipality had imparted information to one bidder that it had not provided other bidders. See <em>Spiniello Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>supra, 542. Thus, parity of information no longer existed among the bidders as envisioned by the statute. In this case, however, the commissioner had not informed any bidder of its requirement. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>construction company which received the contract award was not given any special advantage over the plaintiff in submitting its bid, nor was it privy to any secret information.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Noticeably absent in this case are elements traditionally thought to undermine the competitive bidding process. The commissioner did not apply its requirement inconsistently or in a discriminatory fashion. Nor was there any proof that the commissioner was acting in bad faith. In short, the commissioner made a good faith interpretation of the competitive bidding statute requirements, and applied it in a consistent fashion. The plaintiff was therefore without standing to challenge the award of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-13\"> A memorandum of decision was filed on May 13, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-6\"> The A.

Every general bid which is on a form not completely filled in, or which is incomplete, conditional or obscure, or which contains any addition not called for, shall be invalid; and the awarding authority shall reject every such general bid. No such general bid shall be rejected because of the failure to submit prices for, or information relating to, any item or items for which no specific space is provided in the general bid form furnished by the awarding authority, but this sentence shall not be applicable to any failure to furnish prices or information required by this section to be furnished in the above</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\"> Although neither party expressly raised this issue, the cases cited in the defendants\u2019 brief did bring the issue to our attention and it was discussed during oral argument.

When the issue involves either the trial court\u2019s or this court\u2019s jurisdiction, however, we have no alternative but to address the issue. <em>Willard </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>135 Conn. 303, 306, 63 A.2d 847 (1949); <em>Foss </em>v. <em>Foss, </em>105 Conn. 502, 512, 136 A. 98 (1927); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 30, 463 A.2d 566 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b508-9\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 4-137a. bidding for public building contracts.

Such award shall be made within sixty days after the opening of such bids. If the general bidder selected as the general contractor fails to perform his agreement to execute a contract in accordance with the terms of his general bid and furnish a performance bond and also a labor and materials or payment bond to the amount specified in Item 1 of the form for general bid, an award shall be made to the next lowest responsible and qualified general bidder. If the lowest responsible and qualified bidder\u2019s price submitted is in excess of funds available to make an award, the commissioner of administrative services or the joint committee on legislative management, as the case may be, is empowered to negotiate with such bidder and award the contract on the basis of the funds available, without change in the contract specifications, plans and other requirements. If the award of a contract on said basis is refused by such bidder, the commissioner of administrative services or the joint committee on legislative management, as the case may be, may, if he or it deems it advisable, negotiate with other contractors who submitted bids in ascending order of bid prices without change in the contract, specifications, plans and other requirements.
