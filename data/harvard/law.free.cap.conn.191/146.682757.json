His sole claim on appeal from that judgment is that the trial court erred in limiting his cross-examination of a police officer who had been instrumental in his apprehension and arrest. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Officer John Uliano was called as a witness by the state. Although he had been identified by a previous witness as being directly involved in a foot chase and subsequent arrest of the defendant, Uliano\u2019s testimony on direct examination was limited to the following facts: The defendant was in custody, charged with burglary; Uliano had searched the defendant at the police station; and Uliano had found a Bulova watch in the defendant\u2019s front pants pocket. On cross-examination, the defendant\u2019s attorney attempted to elicit details of the arrest from Uliano. The trial court sustained the state\u2019s objections to these questions as being beyond the scope of the direct examination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">A defendant\u2019s right \u201cto be confronted with [by] the witnesses against him\u201d guaranteed by the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and by article first, \u00a7 8 of the Connecticut constitution, includes the right to reasonable cross-examination of those witnesses. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>174 Conn. 287, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>300, 386 A.2d 243 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Villafane, </em>171 Conn. 644, 676, 372 A.2d 82 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1106, 97 S. Ct. 1137, 51 L. Ed. 2d 558 (1977). The defendant\u2019s right to cross-examination, however, is not absolute and is subject to reasonable limitation by the court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mastropetre, </em>175 Conn. 512, 521, 400 A.2d 276 (1978). \u201cThe scope of cross-examination is limited by the scope of the direct examination unless there is an attack on the credibility of the witness. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>165 Conn. 599, 607, 345 A.2d 17 [1973]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 64, 327 A.2d 576 [1973]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>162 Conn. 112, 116, 291 A.2d 750 [1971]; <em>Mendez </em>v. <em>Dorman, </em>151 Conn. 193, 198, 195 A.2d 561 [1963]; 81 Am. Jur. 2d, Witnesses, \u00a7 478.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Zdanis, </em>173 Conn. 189, 195, 377 A.2d 275 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\u201cThe general rule is that restrictions on the scope of cross-examination are within the sound discretion of the trial judge . . . but this discretion comes into play only after the defendant has been permitted cross-examination sufficient to satisfy the sixth amendment.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>182 Conn. 501, 508, 438 A.2d 749 (1980). As a rule, although the extent of cross-examination is within the trial court\u2019s discretion, it should be liberally allowed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>supra, 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Uliano\u2019s testimony on direct examination concerned only his search of the defendant at the police station and his discovery of the Bulova watch during that search. He did state that the defendant was in custody for burglary, but he did not say anything about how he knew this fact or about how the defendant came to be in custody. The defendant\u2019s questions of Uliano concerning details of the arrest, which had been made earlier in the day far from the police station, were only indirectly related to the search and seizure about which Uliano testified on direct examination. Had the defendant\u2019s questions been designed to attack Uliano\u2019s credibility, it would have been a violation of the sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel to restrict the cross-examination in this manner. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>190 Conn. 84, 102-103, 459 A.2d 1005 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Zdanis, </em>supra, 195. The defendant did not claim to the trial court, however, that the questions pertained to credibility. The court was therefore acting well within its discretion in limiting the scope of the cross-examination to the scope of the direct examination, and it does not appear that an injustice has been done. \u201cIf the defendant wished to extend the scope of his cross-examination beyond that covered in direct examination, he should have made the witness his own.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-13\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-103. burglary in the third degree: class D felony, (a) A person is guilty of burglary in the third degree when he enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-14\">\u201c(b) Burglary in the third degree is a class D felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b157-6\"> Edited of the legal arguments of counsel, the cross-examination of Officer John Uliano was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">\u201cCross-examination by Mr. Arnold:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-8\">\u201cQ.
