The plaintiff, S. Prestley Blake, brought an action against the defendant, David Levy, seeking damages for tortious interference both on his own behalf and as assignee for Curtis Blake. The defendant moved to strike the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>plaint insofar as it stated a claim for vexatious litigation, on the ground that the prior litigation had not terminated in the plaintiffs favor. Although the plaintiff objected to the motion to strike because his complaint alleged tortious interference with business relations rather than vexatious litigation, the trial court nonetheless granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike. The plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The facts that govern this appeal are not in dispute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff was the chairman of the board and a major stockholder of Friendly Ice Cream Corporation (Friendly). On December 24, 1978, Friendly merged with Hershey Corporation (Hershey) pursuant to a stock purchase agreement negotiated by the plaintiff. On the day the merger was to be consummated, the defendant approached the plaintiff and demanded a broker\u2019s commission for his efforts in effecting the merger. The plaintiff refused to pay the commission, asserting that the defendant\u2019s demand was fraudulent, that the defendant was a complete stranger to the transaction and that it was he, and not the defendant, who was responsible for bringing the corporations together and concluding the stock purchase contract. The defendant thereupon filed suit in the United States District Court to recover a broker\u2019s fee, not from the plaintiff but from Friendly. <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Friendly Ice Cream Corporation, </em>U.S. District Court, D. Conn., Civil No. H-80-88 (1980). In 1981, the litigation between the defendant and Friendly terminated by a negotiated settlement, pursuant to which Friendly paid the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>$60,000. The plaintiff in this action was never made a party to the litigation between the defendant and Friendly.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The trial court, on this record, concluded that the plaintiffs allegations failed to support a cause of action for tortious interference by the defendant with a business relationship between the plaintiff, Hershey and Friendly. In part, the trial court relied upon the absence of an allegation of privity between the alleged wrongdoer and the injured plaintiff. Further, the trial court found that the plaintiffs pleadings fell short of alleging conduct that would fall within the definition of wrongful interference with a business relationship as that tort is defined in 4 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7\u00a7 766, 766A and 766B (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">On appeal the plaintiff raises two related claims. He argues that the trial court erred: (1) in holding that a claim for tortious interference with business relations requires privity between the plaintiff and defendant and (2) in concluding that the allegations of the complaint were insufficient to withstand a motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">The plaintiff argues correctly that the trial court erred in its conclusion that the plaintiffs complaint was insufficient because of the absence of an allegation of privity between the parties. Although this court has required privity of contract in order to sustain a claim for negligent interference with contract obligations; <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>124 Conn. 227, 233-34, 199 A. 93 (1938); <em>Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>N.Y. &amp; N. H. R. Co., </em>25 Conn. 265, 276 (1856); there is no such requirement in cases involving intentional interference with business relations. <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>35 Conn. 437, 446 (1868); <em>McNary </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>34 Conn. 384, 388 (1867). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>trial court\u2019s determination to grant the motion to strike was not, however, based exclusively on a privity theory. We therefore must examine whether, for other reasons, the trial court was correct in concluding that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim for tortious interference. See <em>Ivey, Barnum &amp; O\u2019Mara </em>v. <em>Indian Harbor Properties, Inc., </em>190 Conn. 528, 532, 461 A.2d 1369 (1983); <em>W. J. Megin, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>181 Conn. 47, 54, 434 A.2d 306 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Assuntino, </em>180 Conn. 345, 353, 429 A.2d 900 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The plaintiff claims that the defendant\u2019s act of filing suit against Friendly and pursuing the litigation to a $60,000 settlement, when the defendant allegedly knew that the lawsuit was groundless and fraudulent, constitutes tortious interference with the plaintiff\u2019s relationship with Friendly and Hershey under the stock purchase agreement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">This court has long recognized a cause of action for tortious interference with contract rights or other business relations. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>189 Conn. 648, 660, 458 A.2d 355 (1983); <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Endriss, </em>187 Conn. 374, 376-77, 446 A.2d 9 (1982); <em>Kecko Piping Co. </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>172 Conn. 197, 201-202, 374 A.2d 179 (1977); <em>Harry A. Finman &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Truck &amp; Trailer Service Co., </em>169 Conn. 407, 414-15, 363 A.2d 86 (1975); <em>Busker </em>v. <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>156 Conn. 456, 461, 242 A.2d 708 (1968); <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Feinberg, </em>130 Conn. 671, 674, 37 A.2d 355 (1944); <em>Skene </em>v. <em>Carayanis, </em>103 Conn. 708, 713-15,131 A. 497 (1926); <em>McNary </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>supra, 390; <em>Bulkley </em>v. <em>Storer, </em>2 Day 531, 536 (1807). While our cases have not focused with particularity on what acts of interference are tortious, we have made it clear that not every act that disturbs a contract or business expectancy is actionable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>Jones </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>supra, 660-61. \u201c[F]or a plaintiff successfully to prosecute such an action it must prove that the defendant\u2019s conduct was in fact tortious. This element may be satisfied by proof that the defendant was guilty of fraud, misrepresentation, intimidation or molestation ... or that the defendant acted maliciously.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Kecko Piping Co. </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>supra, 201-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Like the definition that emerges from our own cases, the Restatement (Second) of Torts defines intentional interference with business relations to cover a broad range of behavior.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Every act of interference is not, however, made tortious. In the terminology of the Restatement, the test is whether the actor\u2019s behavior is \u201cimproper.\u201d See 4 Restatement (Second), Torts c. 37, introductory note (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>The plaintiff argues that in order for his claim to be legally sufficient he need only plead the existence of a business relationship, the defendant\u2019s interference and the plaintiffs resulting loss. Although some courts have accepted this definition of tortious interference, placing the burden on the defendant to plead and prove some justification or privilege; see, e.g., <em>St. Louis-San Francisco R. Co. </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>607 F.2d 126, 132-33 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Buckaloo </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>14 Cal. 3d 815, 827-28, 537 P.2d 865, 122 Cal. Rptr. 745 (1975); <em>Alfred A. Altimont, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chatelain, Samperton &amp; Nolan, </em>374 A.2d 284, 289 (D.C. 1977); this approach incorrectly relegates the central determination of whether the defendant\u2019s behavior was improper to an affirmative defense. In an action for intentional interference with business relations we think the better reasoned approach requires the plaintiff to plead and prove at least some improper motive or improper means. See, e.g., <em>United Wild Rice, Inc. </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>313 N.W.2d 628, 632-33 (Minn. 1982); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Dairyland Ins. Co., </em>97 N.M. 155, 159, 637 P.2d 837 (1981); <em>Straube </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>287 Or. 357, 361, 600 P.2d 371 (1979); <em>Leigh Furniture &amp; Carpet Co. </em>v. <em>Isom, </em>657 P.2d 293, 302-304 (Utah 1982). \u201c[A] claim is made out [only] when interference resulting in injury to another is wrongful by some measure beyond the fact of the interference itself.\u201d <em>Top Service Body Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>283 Or. 201, 209, 582 P.2d 1365 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In order to determine whether specific acts alleged to constitute tortious interference are improper, we must weigh competing personal and community interests. In a case like the present one, where the claimed impropriety arises out of previous litigation, we may usefully look for guidance to the principles that have evolved to define the tort of malicious prosecution and vexatious litigation, because those kindred torts have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>also had to address the competing policies of deterrence of groundless litigation and protection of good faith access to the courts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">We have held that a claim for vexatious litigation requires a plaintiff to allege that the previous lawsuit was initiated maliciously, without probable cause, and terminated in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. <em>Vandersluis </em>v. <em>Weil, </em>176 Conn. 353, 356, 407 A.2d 982 (1978); <em>Calvo </em>v. <em>Bartolotta, </em>112 Conn. 396, 397, 152 A. 311 (1930); <em>Schaefer </em>v. O. <em>K. Tool Co., </em>110 Conn. 528, 532, 148 A. 330 (1930). In suits for vexatious litigation, it is recognized to be sound policy to require the plaintiff to allege that prior litigation terminated in his favor. This requirement serves to discourage unfounded litigation without impairing the presentation of honest but uncertain causes of action to the courts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Rainier\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>Dairies </em>v. <em>Raritan Valley Farms, Inc., </em>19 N.J. 552, 565-66, 117 A.2d 889 (1955). The requirement furthermore serves the interest of finality of judicial decisions, by preventing a person who was unsuccessful in the original proceeding from relitigating the same issues in a subsequent action for vexatious litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">When a lawsuit ends in a negotiated settlement or compromise, it does not terminate in the plaintiffs favor and therefore will not support a subsequent suit for vexatious litigation. See <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Aluminum Seal Co., </em>250 F.2d 595, 601-602 (3d Cir. 1957); <em>Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corporation </em>v. <em>Elgin Coal, Inc., </em>358 F. Sup. 17, 20 (E.D. Tenn. 1972); Prosser, Torts (4th Ed. 1971) \u00a7 120; 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 674, comment j, \u00a7 660, comments a, c (1977). This conclusion recognizes that the law favors settlements, which conserve scarce judicial resources and minimize the parties\u2019 transaction costs, and avoids burdening such settlements with the threat of future litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">While we have not previously considered the relationship between the tort of intentional interference with business relations and the tort of vexatious litigation, we now hold that neither tort action can be maintained when the underlying lawsuit whose propriety is at issue terminated in a good faith negotiated settlement. In these circumstances, there is no basis of policy for distinction between the two torts, and courts in other jurisdictions have similarly concluded. For example, in <em>Baker Driveaway Co. </em>v. <em>Bankhead, Enterprises, </em>478 F. Sup. 857 (E.D. Mich. 1979), the court held (p. 860) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>a suit alleging that the defendant had maliciously interfered with the plaintiffs commercial relationships by filing a groundless objection to the plaintiff\u2019s patent application could not be brought when the proceedings in the patent office had not yet terminated in favor of either party. Such a suit would have interfered with the societal policy permitting the parties to petition the government. Id. In <em>Rainier\u2019s Dairies </em>v. <em>Raritan Valley Farms, Inc., </em>supra, 563-66, the court disallowed a claim for malicious interference with the plaintiff\u2019s business that was grounded on an allegation of malicious institution of administrative license revocation proceedings against the plaintiff. To permit such a claim, the court reasoned, would defeat \u201cthe counter-policy in favor of free access to judicial and <em>quasi-judicial </em>bodies . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 564. See also <em>Hoover </em>v. <em>Van Stone, </em>540 F. Sup. 1118, 1124 (D. Del. 1982); Perlman, \u201cInterference with Contract and Other Economic Expectancies: A Clash of Tort and Contract Doctrine,\u201d 49 U. Chi. L. Rev. 61, 77 (1982); note, \u201cTortious Interference with Conduct of a Business,\u201d 56 Yale L.J. 885, 889 (1947); cf. <em>Munson Line </em>v. <em>Green, </em>6 F.R.D. 14, 18 (S.D.N.Y. 1946) (complaint that did not state cause of action for malicious prosecution because of absence of \u201cspecial injury\u201d did state claim for tortious interference because plaintiff alleged a continuing pattern of malicious and fraudulent behavior by the defendant amounting to \u201cmore than a glorified cause of action for malicious prosecution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The only cases that we have discovered which recognize a cause of action for tortious interference with business relations predicated on previous litigation, alleged to be groundless but not alleged to have terminated in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, have done so without any discussion of the competing policies at stake. See <em>Herbert Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Oxy-Dry Sprayer Corporation, </em>1 Misc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>2d 71, 74, 145 N.Y.S.2d 168 (1955); <em>Erlandson </em>v. Pullen, 45 Or. App. 467, 472, 608 P.2d 1169 (1980). We do not find the holding of those cases persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court was correct in its ruling that: \u201cTo allege that defendant wilfully and maliciously brought suit for a broker\u2019s fee against a corporation in which plaintiff holds stock, the suit ending in settlement, falls short of alleging that defendant wrongfully interfered with a financial expectancy of plaintiff by inducing a third party to fail to perform a contract or to cause a third party from entering or continuing a business relationship with plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">There is no. error.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-6\"> A motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading.
