The defendant landlords own four apartment buildings in the city of New Britain. At all times relevant to the present appeal, each building was at least fifteen years old and contained more than four rental units. In 1973, New Britain adopted- the provisions of General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 19-347r and limited its applicability to buildings containing four or more housing units, thereby requiring a certificate of occupancy, after a vacancy and prior to human habitation, for each rental unit in the defendants\u2019 buildings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>In May, 1979, the defendants received written notice from the city of New Britain informing them of the requirement that certificates of occupancy be obtained prior to any units being rented. Although the defendants applied for certificates of occupancy on one of the buildings, their application was denied. A certificate has not been obtained for any of the units within the four buildings owned by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The plaintiffs are fifty-five tenants who rented units in the defendants\u2019 buildings from May, 1979, through October, 1980. Each plaintiff rented his apartment after a vacancy. From May, 1979, through October, 1980, the defendants collected $58,695 in rent from the tenants in the plaintiff class.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The plaintiffs instituted this action in May, 1980, seeking compensatory and punitive damages as well as injunctive relief. The fulcrum of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is that the defendants\u2019 failure to comply with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47a-5 and 47a-57, as well as General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 47a-4 (c) and \u00a7 47a-7 (a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> constituted \u201cunfair or deceptive acts\u201d within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>purview of CUTPA. Class certification was subsequently granted. At trial, the testimony of three officials of the city of New Britain established that each of the defendants\u2019 buildings contained numerous and severe housing and health code violations. The case was thereafter submitted to the trial court on a stipulation of facts as recited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The trial court found that the apartments \u201cwere uninhabitable and constituted a serious threat to the health and welfare of the plaintiff occupants,\u201d and that therefore the defendants had failed to discharge their responsibilities pursuant to \u00a7 47a-7. Accordingly, the court enjoined the defendants from evicting the plaintiffs; General Statutes \u00a7 47a-4a; and from any further collection of rents without first obtaining certificates of occupancy. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47a-5, 47a-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Additionally, the court concluded that the plaintiffs were entitled to damages under the provisions of CUTPA. Noting the continued collection of rents despite the uninhabitability of the apartments and without certificates of occupancy as required by \u00a7\u00a7 47a-5 and 47a-57 and as ordered by New Britain officials, the court characterized the actions of the defendants as \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>The court construed the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cactual damages\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (a);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as the rents illegally collected from May 1, 1979, through October, 1980. Although noting that the defendants are entitled to a setoff against any recoverable sum for the reasonable use and occupancy value of the occupied rental units, the court held that the burden of proving this occupancy value rested upon the defendants. Since evidence concerning the reasonable value of the rental units was established for only three members of the plaintiff class, the court entered a setoff in favor of the defendants only to the extent of the reasonable use and occupancy value of the units occupied by these plaintiffs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After appointing a receiver of rents, the trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiffs, from which judgment the defendants appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">On appeal, the defendants present the following primary issues: (1) Whether the trial court erred in concluding that \u00a7\u00a7 47a-5 and 47a-57 impose a duty upon landlords to obtain certificates of occupancy; (2) whether the trial court erred in concluding that the defendants\u2019 actions amounted to unfair or deceptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>trade practices; (3) whether the trial court erred in its award of compensatory damages and in its concomitant allocation of the burden of proof concerning the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The threshold issue presented by the defendants attacks the trial court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7\u00a7 47a-5 and 47a-57 impose a duty upon landlords to procure certificates of occupancy prior to the lawful collection of rent. The defendants argue that either the tenant or the landlord may apply for the certificate and that therefore no \u201cspecific\u201d duty rests upon the defendants. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The contention of the defendants is adequately addressed by the clear language of the statutes. Subsection (a) of \u00a7 47a-57 unequivocally states that \u201chousing units . . . shall not be occupied for human habitation, after a vacancy, until a certificate of occupancy has been issued . . . .\u201d Under both subsection (c) of \u00a7 47a-57 and \u00a7 47a-5, the failure to comply with subsection (a) prohibits the \u201cowner or lessor\u201d from recovering rents. Moreover, under the specific mandates of \u00a7 47a-7, entitled \u201cLandlord\u2019s Responsibilities,\u201d a landlord must \u201c[cjomply with the requirements of ... all applicable building and housing codes materially affecting health and safety of both the state or any political subdivision thereof; (2) make all repairs and do whatever is necessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition, except where the premises are intentionally rendered unfit or uninhabitable by the tenant . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The unmistakable import of these statutes places the burden upon the landlord to obtain the required certificate of occupancy. Pursuant to \u00a7 47a-57, the certificate is required after a vacancy and prior to \u201chuman habitation,\u201d an interval during which only an owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>would have any authority to secure the certificate. Failure to comply imposes sanctions only upon the \u201cowner or lessor\u201d by forbidding the recovery of rents. Finally, it is specifically the duty of the landlord to comply with all applicable building and housing codes, which form the raison d\u2019etre for the certificate of occupancy. We conclude that \u00a7 47a-57 \u201cestablishes a procedure whereby landlords must obtain a Certificate of Apartment Occupancy . . . before renting any apartment in an apartment house containing four or more dwelling units.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Hill Construction Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>366 F. Sup. 737, 738 (D. Conn. 1973). The contention of the defendants lacks validity, legally and pragmatically.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Citing numerous cases, the defendants vigorously attack the finding of the trial court that the defendants engaged in any unfair or deceptive acts or practices as prohibited by General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In light of the subordinate facts recited above, however, we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that CUTPA creates a private cause of action to recover damages based upon violations of \u00a7\u00a7 47a-57 and 47a-5.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>\u201cFor guidance in determining what may constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices, CUTPA directs us to the \u2018interpretations given by the Federal Trade Commission and the federal courts to Section 5 (a) (1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45 (a) (1)) ... as from time to time amended.\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (b).\u201d <em>Ivey, Barnum &amp; O\u2019Mara </em>v. <em>Indian Harbor Properties, Inc., </em>190 Conn. 528, 533, 461 A.2d 1369 (1983). We have held that, as a threshold requirement, private litigants proceeding under CUTPA \u201cmust demonstrate some nexus with the public interest.\u201d Id., 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In <em>FTC </em>v. <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co., </em>405 U.S. 233, 92 S. Ct. 898, 31 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1972), the United States Supreme Court, in construing the scope of the Federal Trade Act and the concomitant power of the federal trade commission, concluded that \u201clegislative and judicial authorities alike convince us that the Federal Trade Commission does not arrogate excessive power to itself if, in measuring a practice against the elusive, but congressionally mandated standard of fairness, it, like a court of equity, considers public values beyond simply those enshrined in the letter or encompassed in the spirit of the . . . laws.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) Id., 244. The court thereupon proceeded favorably to cite the factors considered by the commission in determining whether an action or practice, while not explicitly in violation of the law or deceptive, is nevertheless unfair: \u201c \u2018(1) whether the practice, without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, offends public policy as it has been established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise \u2014 whether, in other words, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>it is within at least the penumbra of some common law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers . . . \u201d Id., 244n.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">In the present case the defendants\u2019 actions of receiving the rent, while not specifically prohibited pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 47a-5 and 47a-57, unquestionably offended the public policy, as embodied by these statutes, of insuring minimum standards of housing safety and habitability. As recited above, \u00a7 47a-57 imposed a duty upon the defendants to obtain certificates of occupancy after a vacancy and prior to human habitation. The defendants, with full awareness of this requirement, nonetheless failed to secure the certificates and continued to accept rental payments, the collection of which they had no right to enforce. The actions of the defendants amounted to unfair acts or practices within the meaning of \u00a7 42-110b.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The question of damages presents a more vexing problem. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42-1 lOg (a), \u201c[a]ny person who suffers any <em>ascertainable loss </em>of money or property . . . as a result of . . . a method, act or practice prohibited by section 42-110b, may bring an action . . . to recover <em>actual damages.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The trial court awarded the plaintiffs actual damages equal to the total rents paid from May 1,1979, through October, 1980, and concluded that it was the defendants\u2019 burden to establish, by way of a setoff, that damages should be reduced by the reasonable use and occupancy value of the units. In effect, the court placed the burden of proving actual damages upon the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">It is axiomatic that a claimant seeking damages bears the burden of proving, with reasonable certainty, those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>damages sustained as a result of his injury. <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>189 Conn. 484, 488, 456 A.2d 1196 (1983); <em>Pacelli Bros. Transportation, Inc. v. Pacelli, </em>189 Conn. 401, 410, 456 A.2d 325 (1983); <em>Johnson v. Flammia, </em>169 Conn. 491, 500, 363 A.2d 1048 (1975). Although damages often are \u201cnot susceptible of exact pecuniary computation and must be left largely to the sound judgment of the trier\u201d; <em>Johnson v. Flammia, </em>supra; this situation does not invalidate a damage award as long as \u201cthe evidence afforded a basis for a reasonable estimate by the [trier] of that amount.\u201d <em>Paiva </em>v. <em>Vanech Heights Construction Co., </em>159 Conn. 512, 517, 271 A.2d 69 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Under CUTPA, \u201c[t]he ascertainable loss requirement is a threshold barrier which limits the class of persons who may bring a CUTPA action seeking either actual damages or equitable relief.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corporation, </em>184 Conn. 607, 615, 440 A.2d 810 (1981). By alleging and proving the receipt of rent by the defendants under the circumstances recited above, the plaintiffs have satisfied this threshold requirement. In their complaint, however, the plaintiffs seek actual damages, and argue that the appropriate recovery thereof under CUTPA is the return of all rent money collected by the defendants. The validity of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim under CUTPA does not, ipso facto, require the court to return the rent money. Nor does the existence of the claim shift the burden of proof as to the reasonable use and occupancy value of the units to the defendants. Since the plaintiffs have chosen to seek damages under \u00a7 42-1 lOg, they are bound by the statutory requirement of proof of actual damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In the present case it is undisputed that the plaintiff class paid $58,695 in rent to the defendants. Their injury was the failure of the defendants to obtain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>required certificates of occupancy and the concomitant substandard conditions of the units, which is adequately supported by the record. What the plaintiffs failed to establish, at least with respect of fifty-two members of the plaintiff class, was the actual damages occasioned by the injury. They must present sufficient evidence to enable the trier to ascertain with reasonable certainty the diminution of the rental value occasioned by the defendants\u2019 wrongful conduct.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">We conclude that the trial court erred only as to its determination of damages and its allocation of the burden of proof under \u00a7 42-110g. Accordingly, the judgment is set aside, the case is remanded and a new trial is ordered limited solely to the issue of damages as to each member of the plaintiff class.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-8\"> Genera] Statutes \u00a7 42-110b states: \u201cunfair trade practices prohibited. legislative intent, (a) No person shall engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">\u201c(b) It is the intent of the legislature that in construing subsection (a) of this section, the commissioner and the courts of this state shall be guided by interpretations given by the Federal Trade Commission and the federal courts to Section 5 (a) (1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45 (a) (1)), as from time to time amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">\u201c(c) The commissioner may, in accordance with chapter 54, establish by regulation acts, practices or methods which shall be deemed to be unfair or deceptive in violation of subsection (a) of this section.

While we disagree with the defendants\u2019 contention that it is unclear what facts the court relied upon in rendering its decision, the short answer to the defendants\u2019 claim is that they failed to file a motion for articulation with the trial court. <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>190 Conn. 491, 493-94, 460 A.2d 1302 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b501-8\"> The defendants make the additional claim that the trial court misconstrued the scope of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47a-5 and 47a-57 (c) by interpreting the statutory term \u201crecoverable\u201d to include the meaning of the words \u201creceipt\u201d and \u201ccollected.\u201d It is the defendants contention that these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>statutes, while barring recovery of unpaid rents, do not explicitly prohibit the defendants from \u201creceiving\u201d or \u201ccollecting\u201d rents voluntarily paid. We agree. See footnote 13, infra.

We refuse to remand on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Although the trial court found that the plaintiffs did not \u201cvoluntarily\u201d pay their rents, the record is devoid of support for this finding. The only reasonable conclusion, based on the evidence presented and the stipulation of facts, is that the plaintiffs voluntarily paid rents to the defendants, albeit in ignorance of their rights under \u00a7\u00a7 47a-5 and 47a-57 (c). There is no basis, therefore, to distinguish the present case from our holding in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Dreamy Hollow Apartments Corporation, </em>150 Conn. 702, 703-704, 192 A.2d 648 (1963), which we find dispositive of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">We find no valid basis for the defendants\u2019 additional claim that the court erred in appointing a receiver of rents.
