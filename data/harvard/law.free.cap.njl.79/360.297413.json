Decker by one Rebea D. Gridley on a claim of property, with all things touching and concerning the same.\u201d The justice\u2019s docket as returned is in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-14\">\u201cCourt for the trial of small causes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-15\">\u201cBefore E.........D..........., justice of the peace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-16\">\u201cState of New Jersey, County of <em>Essex </em>\u2014 ss.:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>\u201cRebea D. Gridley <em>v. </em>Augustus F. W. Lehman and Thomas H. Decker. On claim of property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">\u201cAn application was made before me this 23rd day of March, 1909, by Rebea D. Gridley, through her attorney, George II. Peirce, for the issuance of a <em>venire </em>of six men as a jury in the above case as by law made and provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">\u201cJ issued a <em>venire </em>in the above-stated case the 24th day of March, 1909, returnable on the 29th day of March, 1909, at two o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Then follow the usual entries as to the return, the swearing of the jury, the trial, and verdict for the <em>defendant </em>as to certain goods specified, and for the <em>plaintiff </em>as to \u201call the balance of the goods and chattels on the .schedule of goods as claimed by the <em>plaintiff</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">As to these docket entries the case is strikingly similar to <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Johnson, 2 Cr. </em>120. As in that case, we are informed from other papers sent up with the return that the goods in question were attached by a constable as the property of Willis T. Gridley by virtue of a writ of attachment issued by another justice of the peace at the suit of Decker against said Willis T. Gridley; that the claimant served notice on the attaching constable and made application to the justice for a <em>venire. </em>But, as in Baird <em>v. </em>Johnson, the docket, which is the record, does not identify the <em>venire </em>and trial with the attachment of claim of property, or application to the justice. It does not even say that it was an attachment and not an execution; nor that a claim of property was presented to the justice for trial. The proceedings are therefore erroneous in the first and second respects mentioned in the opinion in the case cited, whose reasoning need not be here repeated. In the later case of <em>Folwell </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>24 <em>Vroom </em>572, 576, it was again held on the authority of Baird <em>v. </em>Johnson, that the filing of the claim was essential to his jurisdiction to issue the <em>venire. </em>These preliminaries cannot be taken for granted; and the docket is the only official and legal information available to us as to the jurisdiction acquired by the justice. The two eases lay down a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>complete scheme of practice, and there seems to be no reason why the rules so carefully laid down therein should not be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Eor these reasons and on the authority of the cases cited, the proceedings must be set aside. This conclusion makes it unnecessary to discuss the other matters presented in briefs of counsel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
