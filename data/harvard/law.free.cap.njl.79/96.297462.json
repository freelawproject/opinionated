But if the return be in such form that the court can see that it is false, frivolous ox calculated to embarrass or delay the remedy sought, a case is made for a motion to quash in a summary way and award a peremptory writ. It is only in such case that the extraordinary power of the court will he used to set aside the return and compel obedience. Slower and more formal methods of procedure must be used where the return offers solid defences and shows good cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>for not obeying the mandate of the writ. Where these appear the respondents are entitled to have the material facts pleaded to, and traversed, or tried by demurrer, <em>Gallager </em>v. <em>Board of Public Work of Jersey City, </em>16 <em>Vroom </em>465.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Three of the reasons <em>for </em>not obeying the writ, taken together, aver in <em>effect </em>\u2014 first, that, after the entry of judgment, the condemnation proceedings were abandoned by mutual consent and the judgment vacated; <em>second, </em>that an agreement of sale was then made between the parties for the sum of $13,000, which the relators have refused to perform, and <em>third, </em>that since the entry of and agreement to vacate the judgment and the agreement to sell, the relators have wasted and spoiled the lands and collected rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">We think that these reasons present questions of , fact which must be settled by a jury, and which cannot be determined by this court upon the present motion. We do not see that they are either false or frivolous, or that they are designed to embarrass or delay the remedy sought. On the contrary, the evidence taken upon which the writ issued, at which we may look <em>(Pleasantville </em>v. <em>Pleasantville Water Co., </em>47 <em>Vroom </em>343), tends to show that the return in this respect is not sham.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">We incline to think the allegations of the return referred to, if true, show good cause why the directory part of the writ has not been obeyed. But whether so or not certainly there is thus presented dubious legal questions that ought not to be decided on a motion to quash a return. <em>Silverthorne </em>v. <em>Warren Railroad Co., </em>4 <em>Vroom </em>173.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">The motion to quash the return will be denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
