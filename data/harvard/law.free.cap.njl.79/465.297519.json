L. </em>1897, <em>p. </em>46) provides, <em>inter alia, </em>(section 19), that the common council shall have power to make and establish ordinances, rules, regulations and b}-laws \u201cas they may deem necessary and proper for the good government, order, protection of persons and property and the preservation of the public health and prosperity of said city.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">It is difficult to avoid the conclusion, in view of this concession of the parties, and the legislative mandate, that the common council shall be required to protect \u201cpersons and property,\u201d that this exercise of power was not only a compliance with the provisions of the charter, but that, in the presence of the power, the absence of its exercise in an ocean city such as this, might be considered reprehensible. The grant of power contained in this charter is sufficient in scope and meaning to support this ordinance as the legitimate exercise of the police power contained within the terms \u201cprotection of persons and property.\u201d <em>Lochner </em>v. <em>New York, </em>198 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number><em>U. S. </em>45; <em>Camfield </em>v. <em>United States, </em>167 <em>Id. </em>518; <em>Weil </em>v. <em>Ricord, </em>9 <em>C. E. Gr. </em>169.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Conjoined with, this express delegation of power is that rule of municipal law, based upon necessary public policy, and the fundamental maxim <em>Solus populi supremo lex, </em>which maintains \u201cthat the safety of life, limb and property, being one of the prime objects of municipal incorporation, all appropriate regulations tending to promote this object are within the police power delegated to a municipality.\u201d 28 <em>Cyc. </em>705, and eases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Haying concluded that the other reasons assigned are without substance, we conclude that this writ should be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
