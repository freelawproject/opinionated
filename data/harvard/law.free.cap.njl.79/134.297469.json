If the car was overcrowded at the time plaintiff entered it, that condition was as obvious to him as to the defendant\u2019s agents that permitted it, and we incline to think that the plaintiff assumed the risk of any danger naturally to be expected from such overcrowding. If, on the other hand, the car became overcrowded after plaintiff entered it, by his act in pushing through the crowd to the back platform before the car stopped, he passed from a position of safety inside the car to tlic very place where the overcrowding was likely to be dangerous to him: Under these circumstances, he cannot complain as against the defendant on account of the acts of members of the crowd.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The ease of <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>North Jersey Street Railway </em>Co., 35 <em>Vroom </em>686, does not help the plaintiff in the case at bar. While no -opinion was expressed as to the duly, if any, of the \u25a0 carrier to limit the number of passengers on its cars, it is plainly intimated that the practice is so common and so acquiesced in by the public, as to require passengers to take notice of it, and that the duty of the carrier was \u201cto use a high degree of care to protect the plaintiff, not indeed from crowd'ing <em>per </em>but from danger likely to arise from crowding;\u201d and the ruling that a case for the jury was presented was put upon the ground that the motorman, who opened the door and gate to let passengers out, took no measures for their safety, and might legitimately be considered by a jury to have failed in the duty of extra care arising out of the crowded condition. But the present declaration makes no charge of negligence on this theory. As we have already seen, negligence is predicated, not on any failure to protect an alighting passenger from clangers of the crowd, as in the Hansen case, but on the failure to prevent overcrowding; a condition so common as to be familiar to every user of street cars in large cities and accepted by the public. The Court- of Errors and Appeals said in the Hansen case, in substance, that under such circumstances overcrowding is not <em>per se </em>negligence. So far as ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>pears in the present case, the defendant may have taken measures which would appear to reasonable men as entirely adequate to insure safety of debarking passengers against the danger of crowds.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Let there be judgment for the defendant on the demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
