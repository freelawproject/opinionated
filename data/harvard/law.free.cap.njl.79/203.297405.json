The writ was issued against Elizabeth Seckendorff; the judgment was so entered, and no appearance by defendant was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The trustee in bankruptcy, in behalf of creditors, now attacks the order, substituting the name \u201cJulia\u201d for that of Elizabeth after the entry of judgment against the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The proceedings in attachment are statutory, and become cognizable under the provisions of the forty-third section of the Practice act only after appearance entered by the defendant, in which event, by the terms of the Attachment act, the suit proceeds as in suits commenced by summons. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Megroz, </em>26 <em>Vroom </em>427; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>22 <em>Id. </em>457.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The power of amendment, therefore, prior to the appearance of the defendant, must be found not in the Practice act but in the Attachment act; and it has been held by this court that the affidavit in attachment is not amendable by supplemental proof. <em>Corbit </em>v. <em>Corbit, </em>21 <em>Vroom </em>363; <em>McGrew </em>v. <em>Steiner, </em>48 <em>Id. </em>377.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">We think also that the trustee in 'bankruptcy, representing, as he does, the creditors of the bankrupt, has a legal <em>status </em>to attack the regularity of the judgment entered against the bankrupt. <em>Merchants National Bank </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Steel Co., </em>28 <em>Vroom </em>336; <em>Bankruptcy act </em>(30 <em>Stat. L.) </em>565, \u00a7 70; <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>124 <em>U. S. </em>20; <em>Chesapeake Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Seldner, </em>122 <em>Fed. Rep. </em>593.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Eor these reasons we think the order permitting the amendment of the writ of attachment, and of the judgment entered thereon, should be set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
