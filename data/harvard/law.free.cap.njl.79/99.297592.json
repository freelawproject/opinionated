HUGO A. THOMSEN.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b135-6\">Argued June 1, 1909 \u2014</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A13\">Decided November 9, 1909.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b135-7\">Whore, in an action to recover damages for personal injuries resulting from negligence, a judgment \"for the plaintiff has been reversed and a new trial awarded, an amendment of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration will not be allowed which would operate to institute a new and different suit between the parties and presenting other questions.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-8\">On motion to amend declaration.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b135-9\">Before Justices Swayze, Trenchard and Minturn.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-10\">For the motion, <em>Willard W. Cutler.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-11\">\n<em>Contra, Collins &amp; Corbin.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b135-12\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b135-13\">Trenchard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARpY\">The original declaration in this action contained three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-14\">This court, in an opinion reported in 45 <em>Vroom </em>445, sustained a demurrer to the first and third counts, hut allowed the second count to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-15\">The plaintiff then went to trial and obtained a judgment against the defendant, which, in an opinion in the Court of Errors and Appeals reported in 47 <em>Vroom </em>754, was reversed and a new trial awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-16\">The plaintiff now moves to amend his declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-17\">As it now stands the declaration charges in substance that the defendant was possessed of an automobile capable of being operated at a speed of sixty miles an hour, and it was the duty of the defendant to use due care of the same while being operated upon the highways; that defendant disregarded that duty by negligently directing and allowing it to be operated by a member of his family, and while it was so negligently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>operated by a member of defendant\u2019s family, <em>for the defendant, </em>plaintiff was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">It is now proposed to so amend the declaration that it will charge in effect that the defendant knowingly purchased a dangerous machine for the purpose of allowing it to be used by his daughter, an incompetent person, and negligently allowed her to use it, to the injury of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">This, we think, sets up a new and different cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Section 12-6 of the Practice act <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1903, <em>p. </em>572) authorizes all amendments necessary for the purpose of determining in the existing action the real question in controversy between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">But where the proposed amendment will institute an entirely new and different cause of action it will not be made. <em>Lower </em>v. <em>Segal, </em>31 <em>Vroom </em>99; <em>Fitzhenry </em>v. <em>Consolidated Traction Co., </em>34 <em>Id. </em>14-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">We have pointed out, that, as the declaration now stands, the negligence charged is made to depend upon the allegation that the automobile was carelessly operated by the defendant\u2019s servant, for- the defendant. The gist of the action is the negligence of the servant imputed to the master.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">As it is proposed to amend the declaration, the negligence counted on is that of the father in supplying his inexperienced daughter with a dangerous machine, and its gist is the negligence of the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">Such an amendment would not tend towards the determination in this suit of the real controversy between the parties thereto, <em>i. e., </em>the issue which the parties hoped and intended to try <em>(Hoboken </em>v. <em>Gear, </em>3 <em>Dutcher </em>265; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>West Jersey and Seashore Railroad Co., </em>47 <em>Vroom </em>282), but rather would operate to institute a new and different suit between the parties and presenting other questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">The motion is denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
