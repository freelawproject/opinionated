The declaration alleges that the defendant permitted a footway to be established along its said railroad at and near the fire proofing works in Perth Amboy. It is not shown that it established the footway or that the footway was npon the railroad property. It continues : \u201cAnd constructed and maintained a crossing at grade over its railroad at the place aforesaid.\u201d It is not shown where this crossing led or what its purpose of maintenance was. The declaration then states: \u201cAnd the defendant then and there invited, induced and lured the public, or such part thereof as had occasion or cared to use the footway and crossing, to walk along and over its railroad, and the public had then and there been accustomed to use the footway and crossing for many years at the invitation and with the knowledge and consent of the defendant.\u201d Of course the word \u201cinvitation\u201d as here used is a mere conclusion of law. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>North Jersey St. Ry. Co., </em>43 <em>Vroom </em>19. That case holds that circumstances from which invitation, in its legal sense, is fairly inferable, must he staled in the pleading, and the basis for the legal liability of the defendant is then properly laid, but the mere allegation of the pleader\u2019s conclusion from inadequate or undisclosed facts tenders no such issue. The same may be said of the words \u201cinduced aud lured.\u201d The fact that the public had been accustomed to uso the footway and crossing are not aided by tire use of the words \u201cat the invitation of the defendant,\u201d and customary use, even with the knowledge and consent of the defendant, does not amount to an invitation to use the same, nor can invitation be inferred from the use of the words \u201caccustomed\u201d \u201cand with the knowledge and consent of the defendant,\u201d for they would indicate nothing more than a permission or mere license. Furthermore, there are very respectable authorities.which hold that a person who goes upon the lands of another for his own convenience or as a mere licensee is not there by invitation. <em>Plummer </em>v. Dill, 156 <em>Mass. </em>426. In that case it is said: \u201cIt is well settled in <em>Southcote </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>1 <em>H. &amp; N. </em>247, which was a ease of a guest receiving gratuitous favors of another has no such relation to the other as to create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>the duty to make the place where hospitality is tendered safer or better than it is,\u201d and continues: \u201cIt is well settled there that to come under an implied invitation, as distinguished from a mere license, the visitor must come for a purpose connected with the business in which the occupant is engaged or which he permits to be carried on there. There must at least be some mutuality of interest in the subject to which the visitor\u2019s business relates, although the particular thing which is the object of the 'visit may not be for the benefit of the occupant.\u201d So, it was held in <em>Larmore v. Crown Point Work, </em>101 <em>N. Y. </em>391, that a person who entered on the defendant\u2019s premises to see if the defendant would give him employment, was a mere licensee, and that the defendant was not liable for injury caused by the unsafe condition of the place. There are many cases where the language indicates that the invitation extends only to those who come on business connected with that carried on at the place and for the transaction of which the place is apparently intended. So in <em>Severy </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>120 <em>Mass. </em>306. See cases collected in <em>Plummer </em>v. <em>Dill, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">It is clear that unless an invitation in its legal sense can be inferred from the allegations in the declaration, the passing oyer the crossing must be put on the ground of mere license or permission, and it was held in <em>Guinn </em>v. <em>Delaware and Atlantic Telephone Co., </em>43 <em>Vroom 278, </em>that \u201ca landowner, may in fact reasonably anticipate an invasion of his property, but in law he is entitled to assume that he will not be interfered with * * *. The exemption of {lie landowner from liability as to trespassers and licensees is necessary to secure him the beneficial use of his land.\u201d See, also, <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>West Jersey and Seashore Railroad Co., </em>49 <em>Id. </em>19.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The railroad company is here the owner of the premises on which the crossing is placed. Where the crossing leads to, for what purpose it was placed, whether to other parts of the premises of the defendant, has not been stated and not being fortified by the use, as above stated, of the word \u201cinvitation,\u201d the measure of the duty of the landowner with regard to trespassers or licensees is only to abstain from willful acts. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>is no liability for negligence except as to those persons upon the owner\u2019s lands by invitation, express or implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">In <em>Dexoe </em>v. <em>N. Y., O. &amp; </em>W. <em>R. R. Co., </em>34 <em>Vroom </em>279, Mr. Justice Depue said in a case where the company had acquiesced in the use of its premises by the public in crossing its tracks, \u201cto sustain the suit, the counsel must make out of these facts an invitation to persons to use this crossing as the deceased was using it when she was hurt; for it is established law that use even with the knowledge of the owner of lands by sufferance, acquiescence or permission, creates no duty on his part, except to refrain from acts willfully injurious. The phrase \u2018accustomed use\u2019 has been declared in its broadest sdnse to be misleading, in that it would apply to the case of an owner who suffers his land to lie waste, over which the public, by his passive acquiescence, was permitted to pass and repass at pleasure,\u201d and quoting <em>Turess </em>v. <em>N. Y., S. &amp; </em>R.<em> R. </em>32 <em>Id. </em>318, where he says: \u201cThe Chief Justice in the last-cited case distinguished an entry and use by invitation from an entry and use by mere permission, as follows: \u2018In the case of an implied invitation the relation is imposed upon the owner or occupier of land only when he has done something which justified one who enters upon his land and makes use of it or something upon it in believing that he intended such use to be made; and he who makes such use can claim the relation only when he is justified by the acts or conduct of the owner or occupant in believing that such use was intended,\u2019 \u201d and in concluding the opinion in the DeVoe case the court said: \u201cThere are no facts and circumstances which could be construed as an invitation to the deceased to use the company\u2019s grounds for the purpose for which she was using them, and there should have been a nonsuit.\u201d See, also, <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Library Company, </em>26 <em>Id. </em>307. <em>Furey </em>v. <em>N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., </em>38 <em>Id. </em>270, is not to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The declaration does not disclose by facts and circumstances therein alleged for what purpose the plaintiff was using the crossing or that it was in accordance with the design for which it was adapted and allowed to be used. The allegations are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>barren of facts'from which it can be concluded that the plaintiff was invited to use the crossing and from which a duty is imposed upon the defendant to exercise care for the plaintiff, which is the gist of an action for negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The demurrer will be sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
