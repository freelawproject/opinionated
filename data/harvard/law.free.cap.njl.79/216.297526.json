Posner was elected by the newly-organized common council, and on January 4Hi, was again elected by resolution of that body, and Mr. Watson now prosecutes two writs of <em>certiorari </em>to test the legality of these resolutions under which Mr. Posner claims title to the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">The test of legality under the statute is presented by an answer to the inquiry whether the election of Mr. Watson at the adjourned meeting held on December 31st was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>election held at \u201cthe first stated meeting after the passage of the ordinance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u25a0 We think his election was premature, in view of the well-settled rule that an adjourned meeting is but a continuation of the meeting from which it was adjourned. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jersey City, </em>1 <em>Dutcher </em>309; <em>Flood </em>v. <em>Atlantic </em>City, 34 <em>Vroom </em>530; <em>Stiles </em>v. <em>Lambertville, </em>44 <em>Id. </em>90.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The charter of New Brunswick <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1863, <em>p. </em>347, \u00a7 30) provides that in the event of a veto by the mayor of any resolution passed by the common council, such a resolution shall take effect only from the time it shall have been passed over the veto. The effect of this charter provision was to postpone the final passage of the ordinance, until the veto of the mayor had been overridden, at which time only could the ordinance become effectual; and as that meeting was also the meeting at which Mr. Watson\u2019s appointment was made, it is quite manifest that the appointment was in accord neither with the letter nor the spirit of the statute creating the office, and for that reason the writs of <em>certiorari </em>now before us should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">We have reached this result upon the merits of the ease, and without reference to the propriety of the remedy invoked, because the question was not raised in argument or in briefs of counsel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
