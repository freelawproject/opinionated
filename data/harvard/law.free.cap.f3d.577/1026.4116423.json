Based upon our interpretation of the controlling statute, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I), our answer is \u201cno.\u201d Thus, we agree with the decision of our Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\u201cBAP\u201d), <em>see Ransom v. MBNA Am. Bank, N.A. (In re Ransom), </em>380 B.R. 799 (9th Cir. BAP 2007), and affirm the decision of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-14\">The facts in this case are undisputed and are taken from our BAP\u2019s decision. The debtor, Jason Ransom, filed for chapter 13 bankruptcy relief. Among his assets, he scheduled a 2004 Toyota Camry he owns free and clear of any loans or other encumbrances. In his liabilities, he scheduled a total of $82,542.93 in general unsecured claims, including a claim held by MBNA America Bank (\u201cMBNA\u201d) in the amount of $32,896.73.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">On his Statement of Current Monthly Income (\u201cForm B22C\u201d), Ransom reported a current monthly income of $4,248.56, and an annualized income of $50,982.72, which put him above the median income for his household size in his state of residence, Nevada. He claimed monthly expense deductions \u2014 including the vehicle \u201cownership cost\u201d deduction at issue in this case' \u2014 in the amount of $4,038.01, and a resulting monthly disposable income of $210.55.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-16\">In his chapter 13 plan, Ransom proposed paying $500.00 per month over sixty months, providing approximately a 25% distribution on general unsecured claims. MBNA objected to confirmation of the plan, arguing Ransom was not devoting all of his projected disposable income to fund the plan as required under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(b)(1)(B). Specifically, MBNA argued that Ransom could deduct a vehicle ownership cost only if he actually was making lease or loan payments on the vehicle and, because Ransom owned his vehicle free and clear of encumbrances and lease obligations, he was not entitled to the vehicle ownership cost deduction. Thus, MBNA argued, Ransom\u2019s projected disposable income should be $681.55 (the $210.55 he reported in disposable income plus $471.00, the amount of the vehicle ownership cost deduction to which MBNA objected).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>The bankruptcy court agreed with MBNA, holding that Ransom could deduct a vehicle ownership cost only if he currently was making loan or lease payments on the vehicle. The bankruptcy court therefore entered an order denying without prejudice confirmation of the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">Ransom sought and obtained leave to appeal the bankruptcy court\u2019s interlocutory order to our BAP. BAP affirmed the bankruptcy court. <em>See Ransom, </em>380 B.R. at 808-09. Concurrently with its opinion affirming the bankruptcy court, BAP certified its disposition of the case to this circuit for possible review of a non-final order. <em>See id. </em>at 809 n. 21. This circuit authorized this interlocutory appeal to go forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">A court may not approve a chapter 13 plan if the holder of an allowed unsecured claim (here, MBNA) objects to confirmation of the plan <em>unless </em>the debtor demonstrates (1) \u201cthe value of the property to be distributed under the plan on account of such claim is not less than the amount of such claim\u201d; or (2) \u201cthe plan provides that all of the debtor\u2019s projected disposable income to be received in the applicable commitment period ... will be applied to make payments to unsecured creditors under the plan.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(b)(1)(A), (B). Ransom seeks to defeat MBNA\u2019s objection to his plan under the second option by demonstrating that his plan provides that all of his projected \u201cdisposable income\u201d will be applied to make payments to unsecured creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">\u201cDisposable income\u201d is defined as \u201ccurrent monthly income received by the debt- or ... less amounts reasonably necessary to be expended ... for the maintenance and support of the debtor....\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(b)(2)(A)(i). Because Ransom is an above-median income debtor, the \u201camounts reasonably necessary to be expended,\u201d is to be determined \u201cin accordance with\u201d the means test set forth in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707(b)(2). <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">Under the \u201cmeans test\u201d in \u00a7 707(b)(2), a debtor\u2019s monthly expenses</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-E\">shall be the debtor\u2019s <em>applicable </em>monthly expense amounts specified under the National Standards and Local Standards, and the debtor\u2019s <em>actual </em>monthly expenses for the categories specified as Other Necessary Expenses issued by the Internal Revenue Service for the area in which the debtor resides.... Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the monthly expenses of the debtor shall not include any payments for debts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">The National Standards and Local Standards referenced in \u00a7 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) are located in the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (\u201cIRS\u201d) Financial Analysis Handbook, which is, in turn, contained in the IRS\u2019s Internal Revenue Manual (\u201cIRM\u201d). The IRS uses the IRM in determining a taxpayer\u2019s ability to pay a delinquent tax liability. <em>See In re Fowler, </em>349 B.R. 414, 416 (Bankr.D.Del.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-13\">The IRS\u2019s Local Standards include allowable transportation expenses. These transportation expenses are broken down into two categories: (1) operating costs and public transportation costs, and (2) \u201cownership costs.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is the \u201cownership cost\u201d deduction that is at issue here. Specifically, at issue is whether the ownership cost deduction is \u201capplicable\u201d under \u00a7 T07(b)(2) (A) (ii) (I), and therefore allowed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>to a debtor who owns his vehicle free and clear and thus does not have any loan or lease payments on his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">As described by our BAP, there exists \u201ca significant split in authority\u201d on this issue. <em>See Ransom, </em>380 B.R. at 803-06. Some courts have allowed the deduction of an \u201cownership cost\u201d for a vehicle that is subject to neither secured debt nor a lease; other courts have not. Most recently, two of our sister circuits have joined the camp allowing the deduction, which puts us in the uncomfortable position of disagreeing with them. <em>See Tate v. Bolen (In re Tate), </em>571 F.3d 423 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Ross-Tousey v. Neary (In re Ross-Tousey), </em>549 F.3d 1148 (7th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">In <em>Ross-Tousey, </em>the Seventh Circuit adopted what has been referred to as the \u201cplain language approach,\u201d and held that a vehicle not encumbered by a debt or lease qualified nonetheless for the \u201cownership cost\u201d deduction. <em>Ross-Tousey, </em>549 F.3d at 1157-58. The court was persuaded that \u00a7 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I)\u2019s use of the adjective \u201capplicable\u201d \u2014 rather than \u201cactual\u201d \u2014 in relation to the \u201cownership cost\u201d deduction refers \u201cto the selection of an expense amount corresponding to the appropriate geographic region and number of vehicles owned by the debtor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1157. \u201cIn other words, under [this] approach, the Local Standard vehicle ownership deduction \u2018applies\u2019 to the debtor by virtue of his geographic region and number of cars, regardless of whether that deduction is an actual expense[ ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1157-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">In <em>Tate, </em>the Fifth Circuit found the \u201cplain language approach,\u201d as set forth by the Seventh Circuit in <em>Ross-Tousey, </em>to provide the \u201cbest reading of \u00a7 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I),\u201d and therefore also adopted that approach. <em>Tate, </em>571 F.3d at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">However, roughly half of the courts to address the issue, including our BAP and the Eighth Circuit BAP, have found a debtor is entitled to the ownership cost deduction only if the debtor actually has loan or lease payments on a vehicle. <em>See, e.g., Ransom, </em>380 B.R. at 809; <em>Babin v. Wilson (In re Wilson), </em>383 B.R. 729, 734 (8th Cir. BAP 2008); <em>In re Coffin, </em>396 B.R. 804, 809 (Bankr.D.Me.2008); <em>Gross-man v. Sawdy, </em>384 B.R. 199, 203, 205 (E.D.Wis.2008); <em>In re Slusher, </em>359 B.R. 290, 308-09 (Bankr.D.Nev.2007). These courts reason that the ownership cost deduction is \u201capplicable\u201d only if the debtor is in fact incurring such an expense in the form of a loan or lease payment on a vehicle, i.e., that \u201capplicable\u201d means that a debtor actually is making a loan or lease payment. <em>See, e.g., Wilson, </em>383 B.R. at 732-33 (\u201c[A] vehicle ownership expense is only applicable if a debtor is in fact incurring such an expense.\u201d); <em>Grossman, </em>384 B.R. at 204 (\u201c[T]he word \u2018applicable\u2019 is meant to modify the term \u2018monthly expenses.\u2019 Therefore, the deduction is to be used if and only if the debtor actually has the monthly expense of an actual car payment.\u201d (citation omitted)). In other words, these courts equate \u201cownership cost\u201d with \u201cloan or lease payments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">In reaching the conclusion that a debtor is entitled to the ownership cost deduction only if the debtor actually has loan or lease payments on a vehicle, some courts have adopted what has been referred to as the \u201cIRM approach,\u201d which relies on the IRS\u2019s interpretation of \u201capplicable\u201d contained in the IRM. The courts employing the IRM approach reason that because Congress incorporated the IRS National and Local Standards into \u00a7 707(b) (2) (A) (ii) (I), it must have intended \u201ccourts to look at how the IRS defines these categories, and how the IRS calculates those expenses.\u201d <em>Slusher, </em>359 B.R. at 309; <em>see Grossman, </em>384 B.R. at 204 (relying on the IRS\u2019s interpretation of the Local and National Standards in concluding that a debtor must have a car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>payment to take the ownership cost deduction); <em>Wilson, </em>383 B.R. at 733 (same).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnW\">Under this reading, \u201cactual\u201d and \u201capplicable\u201d do mean two different things\u2014 one is a limitless deduction within the specified categories of Other Necessary Expenses, and the other is a deduction limited to the amount and type specified by the IRS. Had Congress intended to indiscriminately allow all expense amounts specified in the National and Local Standards, it would have written 707(b) (2) (A) (ii) (I) to read, \u201cThe debtor\u2019s monthly expenses shall be the monthly expense amounts specified under the National Standards and Local Standards ...\u201d rather than \u201cThe debtor\u2019s monthly expenses shall be <em>the debtor\u2019s applicable </em>monthly expense amounts specified under the National and Local Standards .... \u201d This distinction may not appear from the dictionary definitions of both terms, but it did, and does, belong to the IRS\u2019 historical and practical use of those standards at the time Congress adopted BAPCPA. In referring to such specialized standards, it would be quite odd if Congress intended to preclude courts from examining the context in which the authoring agency, the IRS, used and employed those standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8t\"><em>Slusher, </em>359 B.R. at 308-09 (citation omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">The IRS Collection Financial Standards, which are used in calculating repayment of delinquent taxes, provide: \u201cIf a taxpayer has a car, but no car payment, only the operating costs portion of the transportation standard is used to figure the allowable transportation expense.\u201d See IRS Collection Financial Standards (March 1, 2009).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The IRM similarly requires a taxpayer to have a loan or lease payment to qualify for the ownership cost deduction. See Internal Revenue Service Manual, Financial Analysis Handbook, Pt. 5, ch. 15, \u00a7 5.15.1.9CL.B) (May 29, 2008).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">This approach also is arguably supported by Congress\u2019s intent in implementing the means testing as part of BAPCPA \u2014 \u201cto ensure that debtors repay creditors the maximum they can afford.\u201d H.R. Rep. 109-31(1), at 1, <em>reprinted in </em>2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 88, 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">As did our BAP, we decide this issue not on the IRS\u2019s manual, but instead on the \u201cstatutory language, plainly read,\u201d <em>Ransom, </em>380 B.R. at 806 n. 18, which we believe does not allow a debtor to deduct an \u201cownership cost\u201d (as distinct from an \u201coperating cost\u201d) that the debtor does not have. An \u201cownership cost\u201d is not an \u201cexpense\u201d \u2014 either actual or applicable \u2014 if it does not exist, period. Ironic it would be indeed to diminish payments to unsecured creditors in this context on the basis of a fictitious expense not incurred by a debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">Accordingly, we adopt the cogent reasoning of our BAP, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-12\">Congress has deemed the expense of owning a car to be a basic expense that debtors can deduct in calculating what they can afford to pay to their creditors. However, in making that calculation, what is important is the payments that debtors actually make, not how many cars they own, because the payments that debtors make are what actually affect their ability to make payments to their creditors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>The statute is only concerned about protecting the debtor\u2019s ability to continue owning a car, and if the debtor <em>already </em>owns the car, the debtor is adequately protected.... When the debtor has no monthly ownership expenses, it makes no sense to deduct an ownership expense to shield it from creditors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-5\">Section 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]he debtor\u2019s monthly expenses shall be the debtor\u2019s applicable monthly expense amounts specified under ... the Local Standards.\u201d As set forth in the statute, the adjective \u201capplicable\u201d modifies the meaning of the noun \u201cmonthly expense amounts;\u201d it indicates that the deduction of the monthly expense amount specified under the Local Standard for the expense becomes relevant to the debtor (i.e., appropriate or applicable to the debtor) when he or she in fact has such an expense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-6\">The ordinary, common meaning of \u201capplicable\u201d further impels us to this conclusion. \u201cApplicable,\u201d in its ordinary sense, means \u201ccapable of or suitable for being applied.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 60 (11th ed.2005). Given the ordinary sense of the term \u201capplicable,\u201d how is the vehicle ownership expense allowance <em>capable of being applied </em>to the debtor if he does not make any lease or loan payments on the vehicle? In other words, how can the debtor assert a deduction for an expense he does not have? If we granted the debtor such an allowance, we would be reading \u201capplicable\u201d right out of the Bankruptcy Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-7\">The debtor also argues for allowance of the vehicle ownership expense deduction on equitable grounds. He claims that, due to the age of the car, the likelihood of major repairs and the costs of such repairs will increase. He further contends that the allowable operating costs under the Local Standards do not take into account the costs of major repairs. However, as the court in <em>[In re Carlin, </em>348 B.R. 795 (Bankr.D.Or.2006)] noted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAy\">Numerous safeguards are in place to protect both debtors and creditors. Debtors who own old or high mileage cars \u201cfree and clear,\u201d are entitled to an extra $200 per month operating expense. Also, a \u201cfree and clear\u201d owner is not \u201cstuck\u201d with the vehicle operating expenses allowed under the IRS Standards. Section 707(b)(2)(B) is also available for \u201cabove the median\u201d Chapter 13 debtors. Section 707(b)(2)(B), allows additional expenses based on \u201cspecial circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-9\">348 B.R. at 798 (citations omitted). We agree with the court in <em>Carlin </em>and conclude that the debtor\u2019s appeal to equity is unavailing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-10\">Further, our interpretation of \u00a7 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) has a substantive effect that is consistent with the underlying goals of BAPCPA. <em>Cf [United Sav. Ass\u2019n v. Timbers of Inwood Forest </em>As<em>socs., </em>484 U.S. 365, 371,108 S.Ct. 626, 98 L.Ed.2d 740 (1988)]. To interpret the statute otherwise is counterintuitive to one of the main objectives of BAPCPA: to ensure that debtors repay as much of their debt as reasonably possible. When viewed within the larger context of BAPCPA, we believe the statute can only be interpreted to \u201capply\u201d expense standards in cases where debtors in fact pay such expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-11\"><em>Ransom, </em>380 B.R. at 807-08 (footnote and some citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-13\">The \u201ccorrect\u201d answer to the question before us, which the courts have been struggling with for years \u2014 at the unnecessary cost of thousands of hours of valuable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>judicial time- \u2014 depends ultimately not upon our interpretation of the statute, but upon what Congress wants the answer to be. We would hope, in this regard, that we the judiciary would be relieved of this Sisyphean adventure by legislation clearly answering a straightforward policy question: shall an above-median income debtor in chapter 13 be allowed to shelter from unsecured creditors a standardized vehicle ownership cost for a vehicle owned free and clear, or not? Because resolution of this issue rests with Congress, we have taken the unusual step of directing the Clerk of the Court to forward a copy of this opinion to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b951-8\">.
