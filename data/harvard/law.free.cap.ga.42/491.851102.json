Weaver gave to McCarter a promissory note, signed by them, and due on the,' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>12th of March, 1863'. In 1869, McCarter sued them thereon as joint promissors. No plea appears by the record. At September Adjourned Term, 1871, McCarter\u2019s attorneys dismissed, as to Weaver, and took a judgment, by default, against Turner. <em>Fi. fa. </em>issued and was proceeding to sell Turner\u2019s property. He prayed for an injunction. He averred that he was, in fact, but Weaver\u2019s security, and that McCarter knew it; that Weaver had filed a plea, which is lost, and the cause had to stand for trial before a jury, in its regular order. He said he filed no plea, because he was willing for a judgment to go against him and Weaver, jointly. That the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys waited till the last day of the term, when it was obvious that said cause could not be reached in its order as a cause at issue, and, after he had left Court, dismissed as aforesaid, without notice to him, and took said judgment. He said he should not be compelled to pay the note, because by such action of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, suit against Weaver was forever barred by the Limitation Act of 1869. Further, he said said judgment was void, because plaintiff had filed no affidavit of payment of taxes, nor proved their payment, as required by the Relief Act of 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-5\">The Chancellor ordered McCarter to show cause why the injunction should not be granted. The answer admitted all the statements in the bill, except the loss of Weaver\u2019s plea, and that Turner was but Weaver\u2019s security. It stated that Weaver\u2019s sole plea was that, in 1863, he had tendered McCarter Confederate currency in payment of the note, which he refused, and which Weaver kept for him till it was worthless, and it charged that Turner was a principal debtor. On the hearing, there was evidence, <em>pro </em>and <em>eon, </em>as to the alleged securityship of Turner. The Chancellor refused the injunction, and that is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-6\">J. B. Stewart and L. J. Winn, by L. B.

The bill charges that, at the time the suit was dismissed as to Weaver, the note was barred by the statute of limitations, and that the necessary effect of the dismissal was to injure the complainant by depriving him of his right to go upon Weaver, the principal, in case he paid the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">If these facts be true, we think the case a clear one for the complainant. Here was an act of McCarter, which <em>\u201c </em>increased his (complainant\u2019s) risk, exposed him to greater lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>bility, and injured him:\u201d Revised Code, 2126. Here is a case in which, by <em>the act of the creditor, </em>\u201cthe liability of the principal became extinct:\u201d Revised Code, 2121. This act of the principal did not and could not have come to the knowledge of the surety until after the judgment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">It is an every day exercise of chancery jurisdiction to grant a new trial and enjoin a judgment at law in consequence of the discovery of a defense which the complainant did not know of, and could not, with proper diligence, have known before the judgment at law: 1 <em>Georgia Reports, </em>136; 2 <em>Georgia Reports, </em>275; 3 <em>Georgia Reports, </em>78; 4 <em>Georgia Reports </em>181. This defense did not accrue until a few minutes before the judgment, and from the very nature of it could not have come to the knowledge of the security. \"We are clear, therefore, that if the complainant has stated the facts truly, he has a strong claim to relief. The answer admits all the facts but one; especially, does it admit the amendment dismissing the suit as to Weaver under the circumstances charged. The fact not admitted, but positively denied, is that the complainant was Weaver\u2019s security. We are not sure that the complainant would not have the same ground of relief, if he is to be considered a joint obligor instead of a security. It was a serious wrong against Turner for McCarter to dismiss the suit <em>versus </em>Weaver under the circumstances. A creditor has no right to act so as to discharge one joint obligor to the injury of his co-obligor. And even under the state of facts set forth by McCarter, however the parties might stand as to him, as between themselves Weaver was the principal, and the loss of the debt as against Weaver would be a total loss to Turner if he has it to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">But we think the evidence that Turner was only surety, even as to McCarter, is very strong. On one side we have the statement of Turner and of Weaver, of two of the arbitrators and of Norton. On the other, the statement of McCarter, and of two others, both of whom, however, only testify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>negatively, to-wit: that they did not hear the statements testified to by the other witnesses. The evidence for the complainant largely preponderates, and we think the injunction ought to have been granted. Indeed, we suppose the refusal of the Judge was not put on the facts but on the law, and on the effect of the judgment. But as we have said, this was not under the circumstances a bar, and we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
