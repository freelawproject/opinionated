Homestead. Gifts. Before Judge Cole. Bibb Superior Court. December, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-5\">Mims, an adult, applied to the Ordinary for a homestead out of certain lands. It was objected to, by the administrator, <em>cum testamento </em>annexo, of Mim\u2019s father, and by certain creditors of the father, some of whom held judgments against the father, upon the ground that it was the property of the father, and subject to pay the father\u2019s debts, etc. It was, on appeal from the Ordinary, pending in the Superior Court. The parties agreed to submit the law and facts to the Judge for decision. Mims showed that the land was given to him, by his father\u2019s will, as a specific legacy, and that, four or five days before his father\u2019s death, he sent for Mims, delivered him the keys to the premises, and the title deeds, saying, the premises were his; that he had given them to him in his will, etc. And he showed that, after his father\u2019s death, he ti\u2019eated the premises as his own, and that the administrator allowed him to do so. When this alleged gift was made, the father was abundantly able to pay his debts, without a resort to this land, but emancipation of slaves, etc., had changed that state of his estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-6\">On the other hand, it appeared, that the father stayed on the place, with the son, till he died, and the administrator said he allowed Minas to treat the place as his, only because, he supposed that he could pay all his debts, without a resort to that land. The Judge refused the homestead, and that is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-7\">John Rutherford, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-8\">Nesbits &amp; Jackson, Whittle &amp; Gustin, for defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQc\">What makes a gift: R.

As to the question, whether this land was <em>given </em>by hifather to T. N. Mims, during the life-time of the father, the jury has, under the facts, found against the gift. There was evidence on both sides and, under the rule, the verdict is not to be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">2. To make out the gift\u2019it would require proof of pr\u00e9sent intention to give \u2014 a complete renunciation of right, by the father, without power of revocation, and a full delivery of possession, as a gift, <em>inter vivos. </em>If the- act were only, an earnest of the bequest in the will \u2014 a foretaste of the bounty, to be completed at the going into effect of the will, it was no gift to pass the title. We think there is evidence to sustain the verdict upon this point, and, as we .have said so often, we will not disturb a verdict which there is evidence to sustain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">3. Even if the legal title to this land was complete under the will, and by.the assent of the executor it was not so complete as tq'relieve it from liens upon it, whilst it was the property of the father, at his death <em>all </em>his property became assets for the payment of his debts. The legatees <em>talce </em>subject. to this charge. The lien of these judgments followed the laryQ into his hands, as they would have done into the hands/of any <em>purchaser </em>from the father. Can he stand in a better position than a purchaser? It would be a violation of all principle so to hold. The assent of the executor is onlyl effective, so as to bind himself. Even the executor cannot, by his assent, divest the judgment lien. He migjht, perhaps, do this by a public sale under the law, as an officer of the law, but it would be a strange doctrine to establish that an executor may, by his assent to a legacy, deprive the creditors of their interest in the assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Altogether, we see no error in this record. It would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>grossly unfair to permit the adult child of Mr. Mima to take the legacy under this will and leave the debts of the testator, and especially, judgment debt, which the law makes of the highest dignity, unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
