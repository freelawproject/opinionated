Bankruptcy. Before Judge Johnson. Muscogee Superior Court, May Term, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-7\">Conner brought ease against said Company for the loss of his goods. When the cause was called for trial, defendant\u2019s counsel said plaintiff could not proceed because, <em>pendente lite, </em>Conner was adjudged a bankrupt. This was admitted, and plaintiff\u2019s counsel then proposed to make Conner\u2019s assignee in bankruptcy a party plaintiff. It was replied that he had been discharged and this was admitted; but the assignee was present and consented to be made a party. The Judge said the cause had abated, and refused to make the assignee a party. Conner\u2019s counsel then stated that they were interested, having a fee of fifty per cent, on the recovery, and proposed to have the cause proceed in Conner\u2019s name for their use. This was refused, nothing more appeared and the cause was held to have abated. These refusals and this holding are assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-8\">H. L. Penning, J. E.

L. 244.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b38-5\">McCay, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">This is an anomalous case. Pending the proceedings in bankruptcy, and until the assignee was discharged, we are <em>not </em>clear that, under the Bankrupt law of the United States the bankrupt could proceed in his own name: United States Bankrupt Law, sections 18, 43, 16. Though it would seem that, by the English practice, where the rules of pleading too are very precise, the suit may proceed in the name of the bankrupt: 2 Wilson, 372; 3 T. R., 437; 7 East, 64; 1 T. R., 463; 1 B. and Adol., 459; 2 Daniel and L., 49; 3 Taunt, 59, and Peck <em>vs. </em>Jenniss, <em>et al., </em>7 Howard, 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">But it appears that the proceedings in bankruptcy have been <em>concluded, </em>the whole matter settled and the assignee discharged. We must conclude that, for some proper reason, the title to this claim has reverted to the bankrupt. <em>Prima facie, </em>that is true, because the assignee has not undertaken to control it. It may have been left to the bankrupt <em>after </em>paying <em>all </em>his debts. It may have been allowed him as his poor debtors\u2019 exemption under the Bankrupt law. It may have been allowed to him on a composition with his creditors, as provided by the Act, even after the fiat of Bankruptcy, We do not assert as true, any of these things. The presumption is, that the judgment of the Bankrupt Court, <em>dicharging </em>the bankrupt and the assignee, closes up the business. If there was fraud, the fraud was in obtaining the discharge of the assignee, which will not be presumed, and cannot be set up by this defendant here. <em>Prima facie, </em>at least, this claim belongs to the plaintiff. The fact that there <em>has been </em>an assignee, and that he has been discharged, does not affect the question; since, as we have said, the <em>presumption </em>is that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>assignee, as the agent of the Bankrupt Court, would not have been discharged, leaving this claim undisposed of, had there not been some proper reason for leaving it in the control of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Surely, the debt of the defendant was not discharged. There is no other person authorized to sue it, and it is but fair to presume that the plaintiff is now pressing it for purposes consistent with honesty, and for the use of whoever is entitled to the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">We think, therefore, the Court erred in holding that the suit abated until it is made to appear that the plaintiff is not the true owner, or is not asserting this right fairly; we think he had a perfect right to proceed, and it is not for the defendant to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
