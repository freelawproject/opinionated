Calhoun, for use of, etc., plaintiff in error, <em>vs. </em>The Mayor and Council of Atlanta, defendant in error.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b187-5\">When the plaintiff obtained a verdict against the defendant for the sum of $99 45, and. a judgment was entered thereon by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, leaving the amount of the costs to be recovered in blank, to be taxed by the Clerk, and afterwards the plaintiff and defendant agreed to settle the judgment under the following circumstances: \u201c It is agreed between counsel for plaintiff and defendant, that defendant declines to settle the above stated case if thedefendant has to pay the costs of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses; that defendant would settle if plaintiff would receipt the judgment in said case as follows: Received of the defendant $106 00, in full of the within judgment; that said receipt was given as demanded by plaintiff, and the principal and interest paid in full, the Clerk\u2019s costs having been previously paid; that at the time plaintiff\u2019s counsel refused to agree that plaintiff should be liable for any costs, defendant\u2019s counsel stating that he would risk the receipt as above described.\u201d Afterwards, a motion was made by the plaintiff to enter a judgment <em>nunc pro tunc </em>for the use of his witnesses for the cost due them, which motion was refused by the Court, whereupon the plaintiff excepted:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ArrE\"><em>Held, </em>That it was the right of the plaintiff to have had all the legal costs due in the case, including the costs of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, taxed by the Clerk, and inserted in the blank left in the judgment for that purpose, and to have proceeded to collect the principal, interest and cost, by due process of law, but, inasmuch as the plaintiff agreed to settle the judgment on the terms proposed by the defendant, with a full knowledge of all the facts, and gave a receipt in full of the within judgment, there was no error in the refusal of the Court to allow the motion to enter a judgment <em>nunc pro tunc </em>against the defendant for the costs due the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b187-6\">Costs.

Pending that writ of error, the parties were in treaty as to settling the ease. Defendant would not agree to pay the fees of plaintiff\u2019s wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>nesses, but said he would pay if plaintiff would receipt the <em>jd. fa. </em>as follows: \u201cReceived of the defendant the sum of $106 00, in full of the within judgment.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel refused to agree that plaintiff should pay his own witnesses\u2019 fees. Defendant\u2019s counsel replied that he would pay said amount, $106 00, (which was in full of principal and interest,) if said receipt was given, and would risk the effect of the receipt. The receipt was then signed, and the $106 00 was paid. Afterwards, plaintiff\u2019s counsel brought the foregoing facts to the notice of the Court and prayed to fill said blank in the judgment for costs, <em>nune pro tuno, </em>with the sums due by plaintiff for the fees of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-6\">Besides the above, it was agreed that the Clerk\u2019s costs had been paid, and that no costs were entered into said judgment or <em>fi. fa., </em>though the witnesses had proved their subpoenas, and delivered them to the Clerk on the day that the judgment was entered up, and before the <em>ji. fa. </em>was issued. And it seems to have been conceded that these witnesses were sworn on the trial. The proceeding was in the name of the plaintiff, for the use of the witnesses named in the motion. The Court overruled the motion, and that is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-7\">T. P.
