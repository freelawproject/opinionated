During June Term 1870, counsel for F. K. Wright moved to arrest said judgment: 1st. Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>cause <em>it was not </em>signed by plaintiff\u2019s attorneys. 2d, Because the judgment is in favor of Martha McBride, individually, and not as administratrix. 3d.

Because process issued against Marshall, administrator, when he was not sued. 6th. Because F. K. Wright is but a security, and yet the judgment is not against him as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-5\">The Court overruled the motion. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then moved to \u201camend their judgment so as to make the whole record harmonize.\u201d F. K. Wright\u2019s counsel objected, because this amendment would make a new and distinct judgment, and because he had a valid defense under the Relief Act of 1868, which he wished to make, but was prevented from doing so, by hearing that the Court was enforcing the resolution of the General Assembly, suspending all proceedings by the Courts on contracts made prior to June, 1865, by passing over all such cases, and knew not the contrary until he heard of this judgment. They insisted that if the judgment was open to amendment, the cause was open to defenses, and they presented his sworn plea in which he averred that he was not interested in said note, was a bare security, that it was given for bank bills loaned said firm by McBride, which bills had become valueless by the result of the late war, that at the date of the note said firm was worth $50,000, specifying their property; that he then had over one hundred slaves, that all this property was lost by the result of the war, and Hill &amp; Wright were discharged in bankruptcy; that Marshall\u2019s estate had become insolvent by emancipation, that McBride and his said administratrix, since his death, contributed to said war by being citizens of Georgia and of the Confederate States, and supporting said government, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>that, during the war, McBride refused to take Confederate currency in payment of said note, though James H. Hill tendered the same to him. He claimed the benefit of the Relief Act of 1868. The Court refused to allow said defense filed, and allowed the judgment to be amended by adding after \u201cplaintiff,\u201d \u201cas administratrix of James H. McBride, deceased,\u201d and after \u201cdefendant\u201d \u201cas security,\u201d and ordering the names of James H. Hill, John Wright and J. R. Marshall, administrator, to be omitted from the judgment. It does not appear that any other judgment was entered up but the old one stood amended by said order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-4\">F. K.
