Ellington\u2019s petition, as the propounder of the paper hereinafter mentioned as the last will of Violet B. Ellington, was filed on the 27th of March, 1869, and contained the following averments: Said Violet B. Ellington, formerly of Columbus, Georgia, died at Lipp Spring, Germany, in the Kingdom of Prussia, on the 3d of October, 1868; she declared her last will and testament in the presence of three or more persons, on the 3d of September, 1868, a copy of which is attached; propounder is the person most largely interested in said will. Joseph B. Dillard and others, as heirs-at-law of said Violet B., filed their <em>caveat, </em>upon the grounds: 1st, said paper was not her will; 2d, it was not reduced <em>to </em>writing and signed'by her in her lifetime; 3d, it is not attested and subscribed by three competent witnesses; 4th, she was a native of Georgia, always domiciled in said Columbus, and had left temporarily, <em>amino revertendi. </em>At the time of making said paper, and at her death all her estate, real and personal, was in Georgia, and therefore could be devised only according to the laws of Georgia. The paper was not made according to the laws of Georgia, in that there were not three competent witnesses present when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>was made; she did not bid those present, or any of them, to bear witness that the same was her will; it was not made in her last sickness, nor in the house of her habitation or dwelling, nor where she had been resident ten days or more before making the paper; nor was she then surprised or taken sick, being fi\u2019om home; 6th, the application is not made within six months from the date of her death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-5\">This cause was transferred to the Superior Court by appeal. Ellington amended his petition by averring that Violet B., had been domiciled in Georgia till the 1st of January, 1871, and then abandoned her domicil, went to Berlin, Germany, and was domiciled there for two years; that she made said will and deed, as aforesaid; that said paper was her will, of full force at her death, it being made according to all the forms of law prescribed for making wills at said Lipp Spring; that afterwards, to-wit, on the ......day of ........., 1869, at Paderborn, in Germany, said will was duly proven and admitted to record, according to the laws of that place; at the time of her death, and of said probate, said Violet B. had, and yet has personalty worth $5,000 00, and many of her legatees reside in said county of Muscogee. And he produced a copy of the records and prayed to probate said paper as Violet B.\u2019s will in said Superior Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-8\">By yet another amendment he averred that she was a native of Georgia till she was twenty-five years old; that on the 1st day of January, 1867, she left her home, went on a trip to Germany, remained at Berlin two years, went to Lipp Springs, where she was taken sick with a fatal disease, being away from home; on the 3d of September, 1868, she dictated her last will in the presence of three witnesses, and died \u25a0on the 3d of October, 1868, never having recovered of said sickness, and said will so dictated was reduced to writing within thirty days from said dictation. She had $5,000 00 worth of property in said county of Muscogee. And he prayed the probate of the paper as her nuncupative will.' It is well to note that Violet B. is called Isabella in the papers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>On the trial, the propounder introduced and read to the jury a writing, containing certain facts agreed upon by the parties as testimony in said cause, which writing so agreed to and read to the jury, is in letters and figures, as follows, to-wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-4\">\u201c Simeon C.

All of which testamentary dispositions appear upon the said paper writing; that the said paper writing speaks the truth, with the recitals therein, in reference to the facts therein recited; that said paper writing was executed, in substance and form, according to the laws of force in that part of Germany where the same was executed, and, by the laws of that country, would be a good testamentary disposition of real and personal property, located in that country; that said will has been proven and admitted to record, according to the laws of that country; that the property conveyed by said will, except the specific bequests in said paper mentioned, consists of lands and railroad stocks, located in the State of Georgia.\u201d On the trial of the case in the Could below, the Court charged the jury, \u201cthat if they believed, from the testimony in the case, the testatrix, in her life-time, made said paper writing and signed her name to the same, then the said paper writing was not a good <em>nuncupative </em>will, and if the jury so believe, they must find for the caveators;\u201d to which charge the propounder of the will excepted. A <em>nuncupative </em>will, as defined by the law, is one which depends merely upon <em>oral evidence, </em>being declared by the testatrix <em>in extremis, </em>before at least three competent witnesses, and afterwards reduced to writing, within thirty days, under the provisions of our Code, after the speaking of the same. The paper propounded, if it had been attested and subscribed in the presence of the testatrix, by three witnesses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>would have been a good <em>written will, </em>under the law of this State. The fact that it was attested and subscribed by only two witnesses does not make it, in the sense of the law, a <em>nuncupative </em>will, although made during the last sickness of the testatrix, <em>thirty days before her death; </em>the more especially as it does not appear from the evidence in the record that, at the time the paper writing was signed by the testatrix, she was <em>in extremis, </em>or that the legal execution of the written paper was prevented by any sudden surprise or providential cause. If, after the will had been written, as dictated by the testatrix, and signed by her, and before the requisite number of witnesses could have subscribed the same, she had suddenly died, then the paper might have been propounded as a <em>nuneupative </em>will, notwithstanding she had signed the paper; for its legal execution would have been prevented by the act of God.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">But, inasmuch as the facts stated in the record, and admitted to be true (and there being no conflicting evidence) do not, in my judgment, shew that the testatrix, at the time she signed the paper propounded, was in the sense of the law, <em>in extremis, </em>so as to authorize the same to be established as her <em>nuncupative </em>will under the law applicable to that class of wills, I am of the opinion that the judgment of the Court below should be affirmed, notwithstanding the Court charged the jury that if the testatrix in her lifetime made said writing and <em>signed her name </em>to the same, it was not a good nuncupative will; the verdict is right under the law applicable to the facts stated in the record; that is to say, the statement of facts admitted to be true, (there being no conflicting evidence) are not sufficient in law, to authorize the paper writing propounded to be established as the <em>nuncupative </em>will of the testatrix, although the charge of the Court on the point of <em>signing </em>the will may have been too restrictive, if the admitted facts would have authorized the jury to have found a different verdict, had the charge of the Court been otherwise upon that point in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Let the judgment of the Court below be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"179\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Lochrane, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AaM\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The question in this case is, whether the will made by Miss Ellington, in Prussia, can be set up as a nuncupative will, under the laws of Georgia. The Court below held, \u201cthat the paper propounded having been written in the life time of the testatrix, and signed by her, was not a good nuncupative will.\u201d The will was declared verbally by Miss Ellington, while in a low condition of health, dying of consumption at Lipp Springs, Germany, in the presence of officials, who took down her declarations as they were <em>made; </em>and after they were thus written down, they were read over to her, approved by her, and she signed them, and they were witnessed by the two officials. It is admitted that one other witness was present during this time, who is brought in as a witness in the proceedings in this case. It will be noticed that these verbal declarations were reduced to writing in her presence, and signed by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The propounder lays down three general propositions upon which he relies: 1st. That this will was the verbal declarations of Miss Ellington touching the disposition of her estate after her death, which they say was accompanied by all the circumstances required to set up a nuncupative will under our laws. 2d. That the reducing these verbal declarations to writing did not alter their effect or character. 3d. That her signing them after they had been reduced to writing did not change their effect or character.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">To strip this case of all unnecessary theories, and take its plain meaning, we find that'the testatrix did not intend any <em>verbal </em>or <em>nuncupative </em>will. She had time, opportunity and means to make such a will as she <em>intended; </em>and she made it. She was not <em>in extremis, </em>or in haste, and lived thirty days after this will was executed by her. The only difficulty was that she made a will before two witnesses, under the law of Prussia, instead of three, under the law of Georgia. If she had required the nurse to have signed at the time she signed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>and the others signed, she would have had a valid written will. But she did not, and hence arises the difficulty of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">If we take this will, as made by Miss Ellington, with her signature thereto, how can we arrive at the conclusion that she made a nuncupative will? Here is a will made by the testatrix thirty days before her death, written as she dictated it, signed by herself and two witnesses. Laying, for the present, every other question one side, can we hold this to be an unwritten will, under the laws of this State? It bears no mark of such an instrument; neither in its inception nor in its consummation, does it present the familiar <em>indicia </em>of a nuncupative will.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">And, after all the consideration we are able to give the question, we have not seen any law controlling us to reverse the judgment of this Court, in <em>Stamper vs. </em>Hooks, 22 Georgia Reports, 604. That decision was the opinion of the Court with Judge Lumpkin, one of the greatest men that ever ornamented this Bench, with McDonald, a man of powerful and overtowering intellect, with Benning, a man of large imputation and ripe experience in the profession. These men have declared, as the solemn judgment of the Court, that the signing of the paper which the party intends to be his will, prevents its being a nuncupative will.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">In Bacon\u2019s Abridgement, nuncupative wills are defined, \u201cby word or without writing.\u201d We find it laid down in Redfield, 188-9: \u201cIn many instances, it has been held that instructions for the drawing up of a written will, declared before the requisite number of witnesses, may be received and proved, etc., as a nuncupative will, where the testator is, by the act of God, rendered incapable of completing his will, in the mode contemplated by him. But this has been denied, in some cases; and, as it seems to us, with the greater show of reason and authority, since the very definition of a nuncupative will, <em>in all recent times, </em>is that it be made by the testator when he is <em>in extremis, </em>and so conscious of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>fact that he apprehends he has not time to make a will in writing, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">But when the will is in writing, and signed and witnessed, it cannot beset up as an unwritten or nuncupative will. Our Code, section 2443, provides for reducing <em>the words spoken </em>to writing. The will is not a written, but a nuncupative, testamentary disposition of property. It is urged that this was a verbal declaration. So are mostly all wills not in the handwriting of the testator. This fact cannot change the law. If A, lying on his bed, verbally dictates his will to B, who writes it down and then reads it over to A, and he signs it, in the presence of three witnesses, this is a written will. If all this transpires in the presence of, and is attested by two witnesses, this failure of the proper attestation does not make it nuncupative, and this is this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Again, in this ease, the testatrix used no words at the time that bear the intention of her making a nuncupative will. The record shows that she desired the appointment of a judicial or official committee, not as witnesses to her nuncupation, but to execute her will, in consonance with the laws of Prussia. The record nowhere treats it as nuncupative, but as her last will. The language is her purpose to <em>enact, </em>which, not only in its ordinary sense, but as demonstrated by the proceedings, means <em>the whole solemn ceremonial of a record, </em>more than writing. Such is the conclusion of this will. After reading to her, she approved and signed, and the proceedings say, <em>\u201c </em>The last will having been verbally declared to-day by Miss Isabella Ellington, from the State of Georgia, in America, before the undersigned Deputies from the District Court, <em>in order to be recorded </em>in the minutes of the proceedings,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Then, we say, from the record, that the will and its execution both bear intrinsic evidence of the manner and intention of the act, and negatives all presumption of nuncupation or declaration intended to be left to witnesses, after her death, to set-up or establish. Again, we say that, under the weight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>of authority, from the evidence, she was not <em>in </em>extremis; that is to say, she was not in such condition, from the agreed statement of facts, as is contemplated by law for the making of nuncupative wills.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Our Code does not define the last sickness, but leaves us to go back to the common law and ascertain the meaning attached to the words by the judicial exposition of Courts. From the time of Henry VIII., the law had become established in England that such wills, to be of any avail, must be made in the last extremity, when the testator did not expect to recover and had not time to make a more deliberate will, or a will in writing. The English statute, 29 Car., II., is like our own. The law of nuncupative wills, as to last sickness, etc., in this country, has received the same construction. In Priscilla E. Jarnall\u2019s will, 4 Rawle, it was held, the testator must be <em>in extremis </em>and have no time to make a written will; and one made by a consumptive patient, nine days before her death, was held not valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">A nuncupative will is not good unless made when the testator is <em>in extremis, </em>or overtaken by a sudden and violent sickness, and has not time to make a written will, is the construction of \u201c last sickness,\u201d under statutes of New York, 20 John\u2019s, 502. A nuncupative will is only good when made in such extremity of the last sickness as precludes a written one: Bayce vs. Frick, 4 Watts and Serg., 357. A nuncupative will, to be valid, must be made by a person <em>in </em>extremis, who has not power, ability or time to make a written one: 10 Gratt., Va., 548. The same doctrine is held in Hans vs. Palmer, 21 Prim., 296; see 4 Bradf. N. Y., 154, <em>ex re </em>Thompson; also in Lucas vs. Gaff, 33 Miss., 629. And the doctrine we educe from the authorities is to the effect, \u201cthat, where the testator did not intend to make a nuncupative will, and there was time to make a written one, it cannot be set-up as a nuncupative will, if such writing was signed by the testator, though not formally witnessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The class of cases like that in 1st Gratt., 129, are not ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>plicable to the case at bar. In that case, where there was not time to complete the written will, it was set-up as nuncupative ; but the act of completion must not have been dependent on mistake of the law, or other voluntary act of the testator. But in eases where extreme illness and the act of God prevents the fulfillment of the testator\u2019s design, such as swooning and other extreme necessity. If it is the result of choice, t cannot be so regarded in the light of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">It may be properly stated, as a general rule, that the questions arising, under the Code, as to <em>rogatio testium, </em>last sickness and circumstances, are matters of fact for the jury to find, under the law, as given them in charge by the Court. And we unhesitatingly affirm this rule, under our law, to be Valid. But when the evidence agreed on could not change the verdict, legally \u2014 that is to say, when, under the facts and the law, the jury could not change the conclusion, we do not deem it necessary, on this account, to send the case back for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">And for these reasons, I concur in affirming the judgment of the Court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"180\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b385-7\">McCay, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQb\">dissented, but wrote out no opinion. His dissent, delivered from the bench, was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Where, at the request of a citizen and resident of Georgia, a young lady, who was temporarily in Prussia, a commission of its officials' was appointed by a Court of that country to take the \u201cimmediate deposition, or as it may be, reception of her last will,\u201d one of which commission was designated as \u201cthe Counsellor\u201d or \u201cJudge\u201d of said Court, and the other as \u201csworn Recorder of the minutes,\u201d and said commission convened at her lodgings, examined her landlord as to her identity and the time of her stay with him, were then admitted to her room, where they examined into the state of her health, her mental condition, her residence, her condition in life, and received from her a confirmation of her having requested their appointment, and thereupon, she dictated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>them, by word of mouth, her testamentary dispositions in detail, one other witness being present besides the said commission, and the whole of said proceedings were reduced to writing, headed, \u201c Proceedings held at the Lipp Springs Watering Place Hotel, September 3, 1868,\u201d and were sigued, officially, by said \u201cRecorder,\u201d and by said \u201cCounsellor\u201d or \u201cJudge\u201d of said Court, and also by the testatrix, who was at the time confined to her bed, in a low condition, and had been informed by her physician that she did not have long to live, and who died, within a month of said sickness, and.said minutes were transmitted ,to said Court as a record thereof of the <em>verbal dispositions </em>of the testatrix:</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\"><em>Held, first, </em>That on a trial before a jury of an issue formed upon the propounding of said will, as a nuncupative will, it was error in the Court to charge the jury that, if the testatrix signed the writing proposed to be set up, it could not be set up as a nuncupative will.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">2. That whether the said will was made in the last sickness of the deceased, and whether the other requisites of the statute regulating nuncupative wills had been complied with, were questions of fact for the jury, and the Court having, by its charge withdrawn these facts from the jury, a new trial ought to be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
