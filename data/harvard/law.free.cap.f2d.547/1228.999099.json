BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1310-28\">Without a Jolly Roger from the mast, this is non-violent contemporary piracy from, of all things, the United States Marshal. This comes from Defendant Spicer\u2019s appeal from a conviction for violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2233,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for forceably rescuing or dispossessing the Marshal from his lawful custody of a seagoing tug. Although Spicer raises a variety of claims of trial court error, they can all be narrowed to one question \u2014 whether force, threats or other intim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>idation against the <em>person </em>of a duly authorized Federal officer is an essential element of the crime set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2233? We answer that question in the negative. Affirmance of the conviction follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-4\">Spicer was the owner and operator of the Tug Atlas. On April 11, 1975, a Deputy United States Marshal served a summons and warrant of arrest on the Tug in the Panama City Marina at St. Andrews Bay, Florida pursuant to a writ issued by the District Court in a civil admiralty proceeding against the owner <em>in personam </em>and the vessel <em>in rem. </em>Spicer, with his consent, was appointed custodian and keeper of the Tug <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was advised of his duties and responsibilities. Chief among these was that the Tug could not be moved without prior authorization from the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-5\">In early August 1975, Spicer bought provisions for a boat in Panama City and paid for them with an insufficient funds check. On Sunday, August 10, 1975, people were observed by the dock master loading victuals and supplies in sacks onto the Tug. Spicer was recognized as among those loading the Tug. Sometime between that Sunday afternoon and Tuesday, when the dock master returned to work, the vessel had been removed without paying any docking fees. On August 12, 1975, the Marshal\u2019s office became aware that the vessel had been removed and it was discovered that the removal took place without any authorization. In October 1975, Spicer signed a crew on in New Orleans under official shipping articles<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the Tug for a voyage from New Orleans to Belize, Central America. Ultimately, the Tug was found abandoned in New Orleans.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-12\">Defendant was indicted on one felony charge of violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2233. The indictment charges that on or about August 10,1975, David Spicer did unlawfully, willfully, and forceably rescue and dispossess a certain tug, Atlas, from the United States Marshal after it had been seized pursuant to a warrant issued by a Federal District Judge pursuant to a civil case. The jury found him guilty and Spicer was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-13\">Spicer argues that the Trial Court committed reversible error by (i) denying his motions for acquittal, (ii) refusing to give his requested jury charge that force against a duly authorized officer is an essential element of the crime set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2233, and (iii) charging the jury that force was not an essential element of this crime.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In its essence, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>claims that there is only one issue presented by this appeal \u2014 whether \u201cforce, threats, or other intimidation against the person of a duly authorized federal officer [is] an essential element of the crime set forth in Title 18, U.S.Code, Section 2233?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">Defendant relies primarily upon the hoary case of <em>United States v. Ford, </em>D.N.C., 1887, 33 F. 861, a case dealing with the predecessor statute to \u00a7 2233 and the only reported case ever to have considered this statute. The reported case consists solely of the jury charges by the Court in a case involving an indictment for an attempt to rescue property under seizure. There, Government agents seized unstamped liquor from the premises of the defendant. When the defendant returned to find the agents collecting his liquor, he threatened to shoot the officers, but the officers restrained the defendant before he was able to get his gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-5\">In <em>Ford, </em>Defendant was charged with attempting to rescue property lawfully seized by United States agents. The crime consisted of \u201cthe forceable retaking of property out of the hands of officers of the law who have it in legal custody. An attempt to rescue is a forceable, but unsuccessful, effort to accomplish a rescue.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-6\">In his jury instructions, the trial judge in <em>Ford </em>remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-7\">\u201cForcible obstruction or hinderance does not necessarily mean actual violence to the person of an officer. Threatening language, or conduct calculated and intended to intimidate prudent, cautious, and ordinarily brave men, and make them desist from the performance of official duty from well-grounded apprehension of serious personal harm, is forcible conduct, in contemplation of law, although unsuccessful in its aim and purpose. A person can apply opprobrious epithets to officers, and use language of vehement denunciation, but if he does not, by acts or words, manifest a present purpose of personal violence and injury, he is not guilty of forcible obstruction or hinderance of legal authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1312-11\"><em>Id., </em>at 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-12\">Under this rule of law, the question for the jury to resolve was stated to be \u201cwhether the language and conduct of the Defendant was, under all the circumstances, intended and well calculated to intimidate the officers, and prevent them from carrying off the unstamped spirits which had been legally seized, so that by due proceedings they might be condemned as forfeited to the government.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-13\">Defendant argues that this case provides the correct meaning of \u201cforceably\u201d in \u00a7 2233 \u2014 force or threats against the <em>person </em>of a duly authorized Federal officer. However, a careful reading of <em>Ford </em>suggests that the real question in that case was not whether force against the person of a duly authorized Federal officer is an essential element of the crime in every ease, for, in <em>Ford, </em>there was no question but that the defendants threatened to use force against the officers who were attempting to seize his property. Instead, the Court, by its instructions, was attempting to explain to the jury how they should handle defendant\u2019s affirmative defense that his forceful conduct was not intended to impede the officers from seizing his property, but resulted from a sudden fit of passion caused by an apparent injury to his mother from one of the officers present. Thus, the real issue in <em>Ford </em>was whether or not the conduct of the defendant constituted a threat of force directed against the officers to prevent their seizure of his property or whether it constituted a sudden impulse of passion excited by an apparent injury to the defendant\u2019s mother. More to the point, <em>Ford, </em>in its unessential dicta, is not binding on us as precedent, and we refuse to follow it because we disagree with the rule of law stated in the jury instructions we have quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-14\">In Defendant\u2019s second argument, he contends that a comparison of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2232,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the misdemeanor statute, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>\u00a7 2233, the felony statute, reveals that Congress must have required a greater degree of moral turpitude in the felony statute. This greater degree of moral turpitude in the felony statute is provided, Defendant claims, by an implicit requirement in \u00a7 2233 that there be actual force or violence against the duly authorized federal officer, thereby warranting the imposition of a greater punishment as a felony. If we do not so read the statute, Defendant suggests, the Government would have the unbridled discretion to seek an indictment under either \u00a7 2232 or \u00a7 2233, for the same act, even though conviction under one is a felony and conviction under the other is a misdemean- or.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">In response the Government argues that the construction given to the nearly identical language of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7212(b)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> should be applied to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2233. Here, the Government relies primarily on two <em>cases </em>\u2014 United <em>States v. Owens, </em>4 Cir., 1975, 511 F.2d 1205, and <em>United States v. Scolnick, </em>3 Cir., 1968, 392 F.2d 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">In <em>United States v. Owens, supra, </em>defendant was charged with two counts of violating \u00a7 7212(b). The first count was for endeavoring to intimidate and impede by threat or force officers of the IRS during the performance of their official duties. Count II charged the Defendant with force-ably rescuing certain vehicles which had been seized by agents of the IRS. The jury returned a finding of not guilty as to Count I and guilty as to Count II, and it is from that finding that the Defendant appealed. The short per curiam opinion by the Fourth Circuit stated that the \u201cevidence presented against Owens was circumstantial. However, we conclude that it was sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Owens had committed the crime. * * We find no cause for reversal in Owens\u2019 other assignments of error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-12\">The facts underlying <em>Owens </em>were the following.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s vehicles had been levied upon by Revenue Officers. A sticker was placed on the windshield of several trucks and the defendant was told that the vehicles were under Government seizure. When the defendant saw what the officers were doing, he ran up to them, stuck his hand into his rear pocket as if he had a gun there, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill anybody, but you are taking everything I\u2019ve got and I don\u2019t see that I have anything to lose.\u201d The revenue agents thereupon departed the area as they had been instructed to do when threatened or intimidated while conducting their official business. The officers returned the next day only to find that all the vehicles under seizure had been removed. This removal was made in the absence of the Revenue Officers and without any force or intimidation directed toward them <em>at that time.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-13\">The Court\u2019s affirmation of defendant\u2019s conviction under Count II, which covered only the forceable rescue of the vehicles during the <em>absence </em>of the IRS agents, indicates that the Fourth Circuit, as we divine its decision, does not require any showing of force, threats, or intimidation against the <em>person </em>of a duly authorized revenue agent as an essential element of \u00a7 7212(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-14\">In <em>United States v. Scolnick, supra, </em>the IRS seized a safe deposit box by serving a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>Notice of Levy, Notice of Federal Tax Lien and Notice of Seizure on the bank in which the box was located. A seal was placed upon the box warning anyone attempting to open it that it was seized for federal income tax purposes. The key to the box was turned over to the IRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">Before the IRS was able to take actual physical possession of the box,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the defendant and his confederates began a plan designed to remove the contents of the safe deposit box. The defendants first rented another safety deposit box in the bank in order to gain admission to the vault. Several days later, by hurling a rock through the window of the bank, they were able to create a disturbance which allowed one of them to seize the bank\u2019s master key. By using it in conjunction with the duplicate key which Defendant had retained to assist the co-conspirator, the co-conspirator was able to carry from the bank the entire safety deposit box which had been seized by the IRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">The Third Circuit held that these facts were sufficient to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 7212(b) \u2014 \u201cthe essential elements required by the statute to constitute the offense are seizure and rescue.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 326. The Court emphasized further that \u201cforceable rescue, as that term is used in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(b), is not, in our opinion, limited to proof of force exerted against <em>persons. </em>Rather, we think the statute embraces the force here proved, viz., the breaking of the bank window, the removal of the [Internal Revenue] Service\u2019s seal on the box and the removal of the safe deposit box and its contents from the bank.\u201d (Emphasis added). <em>Id., </em>at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-6\">We read both <em>Scolnick </em>and <em>Owens </em>to hold that proof of force exerted against <em>persons </em>is not an essential element of \u00a7 7212(b). From the nearly identical language and the identical purposes of the two statutes, we also conclude that the construction given to the term \u201cforceable rescue\u201d in \u00a7 2233</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-9\">should be the same as the definition given to that term in \u00a7 7212(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-10\">Spicer, under an order from the Marshal to which he willingly consented, ceased to be the custodian of this vessel. He not only breached the trust imposed on him by the United States Marshal but he asserted a dominion over the tug utterly inconsistent with that trust and the preemptive writ issued by the District Court. The force used here was in navigating the tug under its own power and under Spicer\u2019s direction with the purpose to use it in a manner that defied and frustrated the warrant of seizure. This was not an innocuous harbor movement but a purpose upon the master (defendant) to put the tug to work outside the harbor on commercial uses wholly inconsistent with its judicially declared state of immobility and beyond the jurisdictional limits of the District Court. This force was sufficient to uphold Spicer\u2019s conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2233.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-11\">Anticipating this natural and logical conclusion, Defendant asserts that our holding today will allow the Government absolute discretion to indict Defendants for the same act under either \u00a7 2232 or \u00a7 2233, even though conviction for one will result in only a misdemeanor while conviction for the other will result in a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-12\">We conclude, however, that our definition of \u00a7 2233 is not improper and does not give the prosecutor unfettered discretion beyond that which he already has. <em>See, </em>e. <em>g., United States v. Cox, </em>5 Cir., 1965, 342 F.2d 167, <em>cert. denied, </em>1965, <em>sub nom., Cox </em>v. <em>Hauberg, </em>381 U.S. 935, 85 S.Ct. 1767,14 L.Ed.2d 700.<footnotemark>9a</footnotemark> The propriety of our interpretation is supported by <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>1973, 412 U.S. 346, 93 S.Ct. 2008, 36 L.Ed.2d 941. In that case, as a result of having deducted various nondeductible items on his income tax returns, the defendant was prosecuted under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7206(1), which makes it a felony, for a person to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>\u201cwillfully\u201d make and subscribe, under penalties of perjury, any return, statement, or ot^er document which he does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter. The facts disclosed that the only real issue in the case was whether or not his transgressions were \u201cwillful\u201d under the meaning of the statute. The trial judge instructed the jury under \u00a7 7206(1), but refused to grant a lesser-ineluded-offense instruction under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7207, which makes it a misdemeanor for any person \u201cwillfully\u201d to deliver or disclose to the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate any list, return, account, statement, or other document known by him to be fraudulent or to be false as to any material matter. On appeal to the Supreme Court, the question presented was \u201cthe meaning of the critical word \u2018willfully\u2019 as it is employed in these two successive statutes. Is its meaning the same in each, or is the willfulness specified by the misdemeanor statute, \u00a7 7207, of somewhat less degree than the felony \u2018willfulness\u2019 specified by \u00a7 7206?\u201d 412 U.S. at 348, 93 S.Ct. at 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-4\">Defendant, relying on language from <em>Spies v. United States, </em>1943, 317 U.S. 492, 63 S.Ct. 364, 87 L.Ed. 418, and <em>Abdul v. United States, </em>9 Cir., 1958, 254 F.2d 292, argued that the word \u201cwillfully\u201d in the misdemeanor statute should be construed to require less scienter than the same word in the felony statute. His argument was the same as that urged by Defendant here\u2014 that the Court should be unwilling to presume that Congress intended to enact both felony and misdemeanor provisions which overlap in this important area. In a similar vein, defendant argued that the existence of a hierarchy of tax offense strongly suggests that willfulness in a tax misdemeanor is of a different quality from that required for a felony.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-10\">The Supreme Court rejected Defendant\u2019s arguments: \u201cWe conclude that it is proper and correct for the District Court to refuse the lesser-included-offense instruction. In our view, the word \u2018willfully\u2019 has the same meaning in both statutes.\u201d In rejecting Defendant\u2019s argument that Congress could not have intended to enact both felony and misdemeanor provisions which overlap, the Court noted that the \u201ccritical difficulty for respondent is that the two sections have substantially different express terms.\u201d 412 U.S! at 357, 93 S.Ct. at 2015. Thus, the Court recognized that these \u201cdifferences in the respective applications of \u00a7\u00a7 7206(1) and 7207 provides solid evidence that Congress distinguished the statutes in ways that do not turn on the meaning of the word \u2018willfully.\u2019 * ' * * Thus the word \u2018willfully\u2019 may have a uniform meaning in the several statutes without rendering any one of them surplusage.\u201d 412 U.S. at 358, 93 S.Ct. at 2016. Thus, the Court concluded, \u201cthe word \u2018willfully\u2019 has the same meaning in \u00a7 7207 that it has in \u00a7 7206(1).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-11\">In the case now before us, we reject Defendant\u2019s argument on the same ground relied upon by the Supreme Court in <em>Bishop </em>\u2014that 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2232 and \u00a7 2233 have substantially different express terms, so that our interpretation of \u201cforceably\u201d in \u00a7 2233 does not render \u00a7 2232 mere surplus-age. As the titles to the two sections indicate, \u00a7 2233 is exclusively concerned with the rescue of property <em>after </em>the same has been seized by an officer under the authority of the revenue laws of the United States, while \u00a7 2232 is concerned primarily with the destruction or removal of property to prevent the seizure from occurring.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>are substantially different statutes with substantially different express terms,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which is sufficient to support our interpretation of the word \u201cforceably\u201d in \u00a7 2233 under <em>Bishop.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">There was no error in the jury instructions or in the refusal to grant a directed motion of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1310-17\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2233 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1310-18\">\u00a7 2233.

The deputy marshal who served the warrant on Spicer\u2019s Tug testified that it was a normal procedure of the Government to appoint the owner as master and custodian of the vessel, since it was necessary to have someone as master who had good knowledge of the vessel.

Section 2233 is thus akin to the common law crime of rescue <em>(see </em>77 C.J.S. <em>Rescue </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1-7, 14), which was either a felony or misdemeanor at the common law, while \u00a7 2232 is most like the common law crime of obstruction of justice (see 67 C.J.S. <em>Obstructing Justice </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2, 4), which, at common law, was indictable generally as a misdemeanor (see Id., \u00a7 1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1316-17\">. Without examining at this time exactly what \u00a7 2232 reaches, we are confident of our construction of \u00a7 2233 and, as in <em>Bishop </em>and <em>Pomponio, </em>the apprehension of wide open prosecutorial discretion is unavailing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
