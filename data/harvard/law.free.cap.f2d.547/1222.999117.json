We reject all of these contentions and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>The testimony at trial established the following. On the evening of May 13, 1974, defendant, driving a car, approached a border patrol checkpoint 16 miles south of Falfurrias, Texas, on U.S. Highway 281. The border patrol agent on duty noticed that the car was heavily loaded. When the car stopped, the agent made an inquiry into citizenship and he detected a strong odor of marijuana emanating from the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-5\">The agent then asked the defendant to pull to the side of the road and to open the trunk,' where a suitcase containing marijuana was found. A complete search of the car led to the discovery of the 292 pounds of marijuana in question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-6\">The Falfurrias checkpoint is a permanent checkpoint. <em>E. g., United States v. Torres, </em>537 F.2d 1299 (5th Cir. 1976). Stopping a vehicle at a permanent Border Patrol checkpoint to inquire into the occupant\u2019s citizenship does not offend the fourth amendment. <em>United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976); <em>Torres, supra. </em>The strong odor of marijuana gave the officer probable cause thereafter to search the vehicle. <em>Torres, supra, </em>537 F.2d at 1300; <em>United States v. Coffey, </em>520 F.2d 1103,1104 (5th Cir. 1975). We find no merit, therefore, in appellant\u2019s contention that the search was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-7\">During the charge to the jury, the court addressed the problem of determining the intent of the accused:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1305-8\">[Y]ou may infer the defendant\u2019s intent from the surrounding circumstances. You may consider any statements made or acts done or omitted by the defendant and all other facts and circumstantial evidence which indicates [sic] state of mind.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A39C\">Appellant urges that this portion of the charge \u201chad the effect of negating the Court\u2019s instruction with regards to the privilege against self-incrimination . . ..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-9\">In reviewing a trial judge\u2019s instructions, we must evaluate the charge as a whole, without isolating statements that may appear prejudicial outside the context in which they were made. <em>United States v. Gomez-Rojas, </em>507 F.2d 1213, 1223 (5th Cir. 1975). The district court\u2019s charge taken as a whole was complete and accurate. The court carefully explained to the jury the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent and, at the request of the government, reinstructed the jury about this right after the defendant objected to the quoted part of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-13\">We have examined the record in this case and reject the appellant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1305-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1304-28\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
