(\u201cTravel Caddy\u201d) appeals the order of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia denying its motion for a preliminary injunction. <em>Outside the Box Innovations, LLC v. Travel Caddy, Inc., </em>No. 1:05-cv-2482 (N.D.Ga. Mar. 27, 2007). Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Travel Caddy is unlikely to succeed in showing Outside the Box Innovations\u2019 (\u201cOTB\u201d) Electricians CarryAlls and Heavy-Duty ProTool bags infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,991,104 (\u201cthe '104 patent\u201d), we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">The '104 patent is drawn to a case for storing and carrying tools. Travel Caddy sought to enjoin OTB from making, selling, and offering for sale its Heavy-Duty Pro-Tool Bag (\u201cProTool\u201d) and Electrician CarryAlls Bag (\u201cCarryAlls\u201d), asserting they infringed the '104 patent. Specifically, Travel Caddy alleged that the ProTool infringed claims 19, 21, and 23 and that the CarryAlls infringed claims 26-28.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-12\">The relevant independent claims recite: 19. A case for carrying tools or other items comprising, in combination:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-15\">a planar, fabric covered first end panel having a generally rigid lower section with a bottom side edge, a front side edge and a back side edge, and an upper section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-16\">a second, planar, fabric covered end panel constructed substantially identical to the first end panel and having a configuration generally congruent with the first end panel and parallel to and spaced from the first end panel and, said second panel also including a bottom edge, a front side edge and a back side edge;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-17\">a planar, generally rigid, fabric covered, rectangular perimeter shaped, bottom panel <em>between </em>the first and second end panels to form a generally three sided, generally rigid, fabric covered box with the first and second end panels extending upwardly from the bottom panel, said bottom panel including a front edge, a back edge, and first and second side edges;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-18\">a first, <em>flexible, fabric </em>front <em>panel </em>having a top edge and <em>joined between </em>the front side edges of the first and second end panels;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-19\">a second, <em>flexible fabric </em>back <em>panel </em>having a top edge and <em>joined between </em>the backside edges of the first and second end panels; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-20\">a continuous, closed loop binding extending over fabric covering the bottom panel and the flexible panels, said binding stitched thereto along the side edges of the bottom panel and the side edges and top edges of the flexible panels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-21\">26. A case for carrying tools or other items comprising, in combination:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-22\">a planar, fabric covered first end panel having a generally rigid lower section with a bottom side edge, a front side edge and a back side edge, and an upper section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>a second, planar, fabric covered end panel constructed substantially identical to the first end panel and having a configuration generally congruent with the first end panel and parallel to and spaced from the first end panel and, said second panel also including a bottom edge, a front side edge and a back side edge; a planar, generally rigid, fabric covered, bottom panel <em>between </em>the first and second end panels to form a generally three sided, generally rigid, fabric covered box with the first and second end panels extending upwardly from the bottom panel, said bottom panel including a front edge, a back edge, and first and second side edges;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\">a first, <em>flexible, fabric </em>front <em>panel </em>having a top edge and joined between the front-side edges of the first and second end panels;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">a second, <em>flexible fabric </em>back <em>panel </em>having a top edge and <em>joined, between </em>the back side edges of the first and second end panels; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">a continuous, closed loop binding extending over fabric covering the bottom panel, the end panels and the flexible panels, said binding stitched thereto along the front and back edges of the bottom panel, the side edges of the flexible panels and the front and back side edges of the end panels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">'104 patent col. 8 11. 33-61; col. 9 1. 13-col. 10 1.12 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">The district court construed the term \u201cbetween\u201d as \u201cin the interval defined by two end points; here, the outer edge of the panels of the case\u201d and \u201cjoined between\u201d as \u201cfastened in and through the interval defined by two end points; here the outer edge of the end panels of the case.\u201d <em>Outside the Box Innovations, </em>No. 1:05-cv2482, slip op. at 7. Additionally, the district court construed the claim term \u201cflexible\u201d \u201cin the context of \u2018flexible fabric ... panel\u2019\u201d as \u201ca panel made of a fabric that is capable of being bent or flexed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">When reaching the merits of Travel Caddy\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, the district court found that Travel Caddy had not shown a likelihood of success for proving infringement of claim 19, because in the ProTool the bottom panel, as well as the front and back panels, extends beyond the edges of the end panels. <em>Id. </em>at 7. Turning to claim 26, the district court concluded that Travel Caddy had shown a likelihood of success in proving that the \u201cbetween\u201d limitation was present in the CarryAUs, because neither the bottom, front, nor back panel extended beyond the edges of the end panels. <em>Id. </em>at 8. However, the court determined that Travel Caddy ultimately had not shown a likelihood of success for proving infringement of claim 26, because the CarryAUs \u201cdoes not contain any flexible panels.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">Concluding that Travel Caddy was unlikely to succeed on its infringement claim, the district court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction. Travel Caddy appeals, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion. Var<em>co, L.P. v. Pason Sys. USA Corp., </em>436 F.3d 1368, 1372 (Fed.Cir.2006). However, we review a district court\u2019s claim construction de novo. <em>Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., </em>517 U.S. 370, 390, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577 (1996). Further, we have explained that an erroneous claim construction can be \u201clegal error, leading to an abuse of discretion in denying the motion for a preliminary injunction.\u201d <em>Bell &amp; Howell Document Mgmt. Prods. Co. v. Altek Sys., </em>132 F.3d 701, 707 (Fed.Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>ill</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">A claim term \u201cmust be read in view of the specification of which [it is] a part.\u201d <em>Phillips v. AWH Corp., </em>415 F.3d 1303, 1315 (Fed.Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., </em>52 F.3d 967, 979 (Fed.Cir.1995), <em>aff'd </em>517 U.S. 370, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577 (1996)). However, the specification cannot be used to read nonexistent limitations into a claim. <em>Prima Tek II, LLC v. Polypap, S.A.R.L., </em>318 F.3d 1143, 1148 (Fed.Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The district court concluded that \u201cnowhere in the patent claims, specification, or prosecution history is there intrinsic evidence to support a construction that allows for \u2018a bottom panel extending outwardly beyond the end panels.\u2019 \u201d <em>Outside the Box Innovations, LLC v. Travel Caddy, Inc., </em>No. 1:05-cv-2482, slip op. at 12 (Sept. 19, 2006) <em>(\u201cClaim Construction Order\u201d). </em>Thus, the court construed \u201cbetween\u201d as \u201c \u2018[i]n the interval defined by two end points; here, the outer edge of the end panels of the case\u2019 \u201d and \u201cjoined between\u201d as \u201c \u2018Hastened in and through the intei'val defined by two end points; here, the outer edge of the end panels of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Travel Caddy argues that the district court unnecessarily restricted the meaning of the claim term \u201cbetween\u201d and \u201cjoined between.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, Travel Caddy asserts that \u201cbetween\u201d should be construed so as to include an embodiment in which the bottom, front, and back panels extend beyond the end panels, an embodiment Travel Caddy argues is illustrated in Figure 10 of the T04 patent. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Travel Caddy is correct that the preposition \u201cbetween\u201d could be used to describe something that extends beyond the bounds of the objects of the preposition. For example, if person C sits to the right of person A and to the left of person B, C is said to sit \u201cbetween\u201d A and B. If person C then puts his right arm around B\u2019s shoulders and his left arm around A\u2019s shoulders, C could still be said to sit \u201cbetween\u201d A and B. However, the written description and drawings of the '104 patent do not support such a broad interpretation of the term \u201cbetween\u201d in the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">Considered in isolation, the '104 patent\u2019s Figure 10 appears to illustrate a bag having a portion that extends beyond the end panel. Travel Caddy argues that that portion is part of the bottom panel. However, the written description demonstrates that the areas seen to be extending beyond the end panels are simply the bindings connecting fabric layers. When referring to Fig. 10, the written description states \u201call of the described panels are fabric covered, preferably by two layers of fabric which are sewn together and retained along their edges by a binding.\u201d '104 patent col. 6 11. 11-13. The written description further notes that \u201cthe binding techniques, as well as the assembly techniques associated with the tool bag of FIGS. 10 and 11, is [sic] substantially similar to or the same as previously described with respect to the other embodiments of the invention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. 39-43. Finally, the written description states that while \u201cmodifications may be made to the construction[,] ... the use of binding 40 in a closed loop configuration as described enables such variations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. 59-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">The significance of these statements is apparent when examining Figure 4 of the '104 patent, the only figure depicting the binding of the claimed invention. <em>Id. </em>at col. 2 11. 27-28 (describing Figure 4 as \u201ca cross-sectional view of the binding con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>struction of the carrying case\u201d). The written description specifically refers to Figure 4 when describing Figures 1, 2, and 5, and the binding illustrated in Figure 4 is the only binding that can be considered \u201cpreviously described.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Figure 4 shows a rigid board or panel member, 24, covered by two fabric layers, 20 and 22. These elements encompass the fabric-covered bottom panel of the claims. Reference number 28 is one of the fabric end panels of the claims. A binding, 40, \u201cfolds over the edges of the layers of fabric 28, 22, and 20 and connects them one to the other by means of a single seam.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at col. 3 11. 45-47. Important to the present case, Figure 4 illustrates that the bottom fabric covered panel and the fabric end panel are <em>coterminous. </em>As explained above, this is the only representation of the binding of the panels, and the written description states that the binding used for the embodiment of Figure 10 \u201cis substantially similar to or the same as previously described with respect to the other embodiments of the invention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at col. 6 11. 39-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Thus, contrary to Travel Caddy\u2019s argument, the district court\u2019s construction of between does not exclude an embodiment of the invention contained in the written description.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Because we find no error in the district court\u2019s construction of the term \u201cbetween,\u201d and it is undisputed that the bottom, front, and back panels of the ProTool extend beyond the edges of the end panels, we agree with the district court that Travel Caddy has not shown a likelihood of success in proving that OTB infringes claim 19 of the '104 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">Travel Caddy also argues that the district court erred in applying the claim term \u201cflexible, fabric ... panel\u201d in the context of claim 26. Travel Caddy reargues on appeal that the addition of an unclaimed element, here a reinforcing member, does not mandate a finding of noninfringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">Claim 26 recites both \u201cflexible ... fabric panel[s]\u201d and \u201cfabric covered ... panel[s].\u201d The difference being that a \u201cflexible ... fabric panel\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is primarily a fabric panel, while a \u201cfabric covered ... panel\u201d includes a piece of material which is then covered by fabric. Claim 27 adds that a reinforcing member may be sewn into the \u201cflexible [fabric] panels.\u201d However, such a reinforcing member cannot be of the type that would turn a \u201cflexible [fabric] ... panel\u201d into a \u201cfabric covered ... panel,\u201d as this would render the distinction between the claim terms \u201cfabric covered ... panel\u201d and \u201cflexible ... fabric panel\u201d meaningless. Such a result would be inconsistent with our case law. <em>See CAE Screenplates, Inc. v. Heinrich Fiedler GmbH &amp; Co. KG, </em>224 F.3d 1308, 1317 (Fed.Cir.2000) (\u201cIn the absence of any evidence to the contrary, we must presume that the use of these different terms in the claims connotes different meanings.\u201d); <em>Applied Med. Res. Corp. v. U.S. Surgical Corp., </em>448 F.3d 1324, 1333 n. 3 (Fed.Cir.2006) (\u201c[T]he use of two terms in a claim requires that they connote different meanings.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">The reinforcing member in each of the panels of the CarryAUs appears to extend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>virtually the entire length and width of the fabric material. Thus, the panels of the CarryAlls are \u201cfabric covered ... panel[s]\u201d and are not \u201cflexible fabric ... panels.\u201d Therefore, the CarryAlls does not contain the \u201cflexible fabric ... panel\u201d limitations of claim 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Travel Caddy\u2019s argument that when the open transition term \u201ccomprising\u201d is used the addition of an unclaimed element does not mandate a finding of noninfringement is well taken. However, in this case the inclusion of an additional element changed the structure of the purported infringing object such that it could not infringe.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Accordingly, because the CarryAlls does not contain either of the claimed \u201cflexible fabric ... panel[s],\u201d we agree with the district court that Travel Caddy has not shown a likelihood in success for proving OTB infringes claim 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s determination that Travel Caddy has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its infringement claim. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Travel Caddy\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-9\">. Only the term \"between\u201d is addressed in this opinion, as Travel Caddy takes issue with the district court\u2019s construction of \"between\u201d and not \"joined.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\">. The district court construed \"flexible fabric ... panel\u201d as \"[a] panel made of fabric that is capable of being bent or flexed.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b347-9\">DYK, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AqJ\">concurring-in-part and dissenting-in-part.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the District Court correctly applied the claim term \u201cflexible fabric ... panel\u201d in claim 26 to the appellee\u2019s Electrician CarryAlls Bag (\u201cCarryAlls Bag\u201d) and correctly found that Travel Caddy will not likely succeed in proving that the CarryAlls Bag infringes claim 26. However, in my view, the majority incorrectly restricted the scope of claim 19 by construing the claim term \u201cbetween\u201d to mean \u201conly between\u201d and incorrectly approved the district court\u2019s finding that Travel Caddy will not likely succeed in proving that appellee\u2019s Heavy-Duty ProTool Bag (\u201cProTool Bag\u201d) infringes claim 19. I respectfully dissent from that aspect of the majority decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">The majority correctly recognizes that \u201cthe preposition \u2018between\u2019 could be used to describe something that extends beyond the bounds of the objects of the preposition.\u201d Maj. Op. at 319. In other words, a front panel, for example, could be \u201cbetween\u201d two end panels even if the front panel extends beyond the two end panels. However, the majority finds that the \u201cwritten description and drawings of the '104 patent do not support such a broad interpretation of the term \u2018between\u2019 in the claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319. I do not disagree with the majority\u2019s claim construction in this respect. The claim is satisfied if the front and back panels extend to each edge of the end panels; it does not require that the front and back panels extend beyond the edges of the end panels.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">The problem in my view is the next step in the majority\u2019s construction, which is to treat the \u201cbetween\u201d limitation as though it read \u201conly between.\u201d There is no support for such a reading in the claim language, the specification, or the prosecution history. Indeed, the claim\u2019s use of the term \u201ccomprising\u201d is directly inconsistent with such a construction. It is well established that \u201ccomprising\u201d is a \u201cterm of art used in claim language which means that the named elements are essential, but other elements may be added and still form a construct within the scope of the claim.\u201d <em>Genentech, Inc. v. Chiron Corp., </em>112 F.3d 495 (Fed.Cir.1997); Manual of Patent Examining Procedure \u00a7 2111.03 \u201cTransitional Phrases\u201d (8th ed., Rev. 5, 2006) (\u201cThe transitional term \u2018comprising\u2019 ... is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements.... \u201d). Here, the additional feature, extensions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>front and back panels beyond the end panels, is fully consistent with the \u201ccomprising\u201d formulation and does not render the accused bags non-infringing.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The majority\u2019s approach here is not unlike the approach we rejected in <em>Stiftung v. Renishaw PLC, </em>945 F.2d 1173 (Fed.Cir. 1991). In <em>Stiftung, </em>the claims were directed to a device for mounting a stylus in a position-determining apparatus and were written as \u201ccomprising\u201d claims. <em>Id. </em>at 1177-78. The district court had concluded that the accused device, though it included each of the claimed limitations, also included an additional signaling means, but that \u201c[tjhere is nothing in the specification in regard to any embodiment which describes a signalling device which is activated by a piezoelectric element or other means.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Stiftung v. Renishaw PLC, </em>740 F.Supp. 1038, 1046 (S.D.N.Y.1990)). That observation, we found, was irrelevant. <em>Id. </em>We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">The point is not whether the specification suggests the use of any means of signalling contact other than the kinematic mount claimed, but rather, whether the claim and specification in effect preclude any additional signalling means or otherwise require that the claim be limited to devices containing <em>only </em>the structures of the embodiments specifically described in the specification. Indeed, claim 2, which uses the term \u201ccomprising,\u201d is an \u201copen\u201d claim which will read on devices which add additional elements....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1178 (emphasis in original). We concluded that \u201cthe addition of another signalling means using a piezoelectric crystal does not avoid infringement.\u201d <em>Id. See also Free Motion Fitness, Inc. v. Cybex Int'l, Inc., </em>423 F.3d 1343, 1353 (Fed.Cir. 2005) (holding that an additional, undesirable prior art feature found in the infringing device did not preclude a finding of infringement).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Here, the accused ProTool Bag meets each limitation of claim 19 but includes the additional feature that the front and back panels extend beyond the end panels. The majority does not find that the patentee, in either the specification or the prosecution history, made an explicit disclaimer of claim scope in this respect. Because I think that claim 19 does not exclude bags that have front and back panels that extend beyond end panels, I would find that Travel Caddy has shown a likelihood of success with respect to the Pro Tool Bag. I would reverse that aspect of the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
