Jung<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> argues that the district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> did not have jurisdiction to decide the issue because the underlying ease had been on appeal for months. Christopher argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">We review questions of the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Community State Bank v. Strong, </em>485 F.3d 597, 604 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">When a party appeals a decision of the district court, jurisdiction over the aspects of the case involved in the appeal transfers to the appellate court. <em>Green Leaf Nursery v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co., </em>341 F.3d 1292, 1309 (11th Cir.2003). However, the district court may retain jurisdiction to consider motions that are collateral to the matters on appeal. <em>Mahone v. Ray, </em>326 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir.2003). For example, we have held that the district court may entertain a motion for attorney\u2019s fees after a notice of appeal has been filed in the underlying case. <em>Rothenberg v. Security Management Co., Inc., </em>677 F.2d 64, 65 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Because the issue of whether Jung was subject to sanctions was not before us in the appeal, we conclude that it was collateral to the issues on appeal. Therefore, the district court had jurisdiction to consider the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">We review a district court\u2019s order regarding sanctions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 for abuse of discretion. <em>Amlong &amp; Amlong, P.A. v. Denny\u2019s Inc., </em>457 F.3d 1180, 1188 (11th Cir.2006). Under the abuse-of-discretion standard, we must affirm unless the district court made a clear error of judgment or applied the wrong standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-14\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, the court may require an attorney who \u201cso multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously\u201d to pay any excess costs, expenses, or attorney\u2019s fees caused by the attorney\u2019s conduct. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. We have noted that \u00a7 1927 involves three essential requirements: (1) the attorney must engage in \u201cunreasonable and vexatious\u201d conduct, (2) the conduct must \u201cmultipl[y] the proceedings,\u201d and (3) the amount of the sanction must directly relate to the excess proceedings. <em>Amlong, </em>457 F.3d at 1190. An attorney\u2019s conduct \u201cmultiplies proceedings\u201d when \u201cit results in proceedings that would not have been conducted otherwise.\u201d <em>Peterson v. BMI Refractories, </em>124 F.3d 1386, 1396 (11th Cir. 1997). We have held that an attorney only \u201cunreasonably and vexatiously\u201d multiplies proceedings \u201cwhen the attorney\u2019s conduct is so egregious that it is tantamount to bad faith.\u201d <em>Amlong, </em>457 F.3d at 1190 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-15\">First, sanctions against Jung under \u00a7 1927 were not appropriate because none of his actions multiplied proceedings. In any event, assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Jung had multiplied proceedings while representing Kathryn, there is no evidence that any of his actions were undertaken in bad faith. Therefore, he did not act \u201cunreasonably and vexatiously,\u201d and it was not an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>abuse of discretion to deny sanctions against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Upon careful review of the record and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-11\">. Although Kathryn was the defendant, the motion for sanctions was directed towards Jung, rather than Kathryn. Accordingly, we attribute the responses to Jung.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-16\">. The parties consented to all proceedings being conducted by a magistrate judge, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c). For ease of reference, we refer to the magistrate as the \u201cdistrict court\u201d unless the context requires otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
