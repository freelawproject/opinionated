He filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging the sentence credit he was given for time served in state prison and the validity of his guilty plea and conviction. The district court rejected Hines\u2019s sentence-credit argument, and it found that his remaining claims were not cognizable under \u00a7 2241 and should have been brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-15\">Hines has abandoned his sentence-credit argument by failing to renew it on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). He has not shown that the district court erred in determining that his claims challenging his guilty plea and conviction were best construed as \u00a7 2255 claims. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Cox v. Warden, Fed. Detention Ctr., </em>911 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir.1990). Hines likewise has not shown that he should be permitted to proceed under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904, 906 n. 34 (5th Cir.2001). The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b690-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
