Thomas appeals the district court\u2019s order and asserts that the injunction is too broad. For the reasons that follow, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Federal courts have the authority to issue prefiling injunctions against vexatious litigants. <em>Cromer v. Kraft Foods N. Am., Inc., </em>390 F.3d 812, 817 (4th Cir. 2004). Courts, however, \u201cshould not in any way limit a litigant\u2019s access to the courts absent exigent circumstances, such as a litigant\u2019s continuous abuse of the judicial process by filing meritless and repetitive actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817-18 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The factors a district court should consider in deciding whether to issue a prefiling injunction are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">(1) the party\u2019s history of litigation, in particular whether he has filed vexatious, harassing, or duplicative lawsuits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">(2) whether the party had a good faith basis for pursuing the litigation, or simply intended to harass; (3) the extent of the burden on the courts and other parties resulting from the party\u2019s filings; and (4) the adequacy of alternative sanctions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 818 (citations omitted). After balancing these factors, if a court decides that a prefiling injunction is warranted, the court \u201cmust ensure that the injunction is narrowly tailored to fit the specific circumstances at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cA narrowly tailored injunction ... would address only filings in [a particular action] or related actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 819. We review the imposition of a prefiling injunction for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Having reviewed the record in light of the factors enunciated in <em>Cromer, </em>we agree with the district court that Thomas\u2019 lawsuits are duplicative and vexatious; he cannot have a reasonable expectation of prevailing; and he has caused needless expense and burdens to other parties and the court. We note that the district court\u2019s order does not indicate whether the court considered the adequacy of alternative sanctions before imposing the prefiling injunction. In any event, we conclude that the imposition of this particular injunction is defective for being overbroad. The prefiling injunction prohibits Thomas from filing further civil actions against government officials and their counsel without permission of the district court in unrelated actions. This language \u201chas no boundaries.\u201d <em>DeLong v. Hennessey, </em>912 F.2d 1144, 1148 (9th Cir.1990). Thus, the terms of the injunction are not \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to the circumstances giving rise to the injunction. <em>See Cromer, </em>390 F.3d at 819 (holding that prefiling injunction barring future filings in unrelated cases in district court constitutes overbroad and impermissible restriction).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">Accordingly, we are constrained to vacate the injunction imposed on Thomas and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
