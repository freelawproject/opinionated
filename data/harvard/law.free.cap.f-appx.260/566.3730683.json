Additionally, Rochester seeks recusal of various district court and Fourth Circuit judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-19\">Rochester mistakenly believes that there are outstanding motions in any of the three cases. In <em>Rochester v. South Carolina Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>No. 2:97-cv-03924-HMH (D.S.C.), the district court denied Rochester\u2019s motion to reopen by order entered on October 26, 2004. In <em>Rochester v. South Carolina Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>No. 2:98-00146-WBT (D.S.C.), the district court denied Rochester\u2019s motion to reopen by order entered on September 10, 2003. Finally, there is no record in the district court of Rochester\u2019s having filed any motion to reopen in <em>Rochester v. USA, </em>No. 2:03-cv-01736-HMH (D.S.C.). Rochester therefore is not entitled to mandamus relief with respect to the allegedly outstanding motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-20\">We note that Rochester failed to allege with any particularity the extrajudicial bias necessary to warrant recusal of any judge. <em>See In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 827 (4th Cir.1987). Accordingly, he is not entitled to the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-21\">Because Rochester is not entitled to the extraordinary remedy of mandamus, <em>see Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>(1976), we deny the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss the mandamus petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before us and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
