The district court dismissed in December 2005, concluding that, even if Green were able to identify the defendant and successfully amended his complaint with defendant\u2019s actual name, the amended complaint would not relate back to his original complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c); thus, the amended complaint would be time-barred by the applicable two-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Because there was specific information that should have made the identification of \u201cJohn Doe\u201d relatively easy, yet the district court denied Green\u2019s requests to conduct discovery before limitations had run, limitations has been equitably tolled. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. Whether Green is able to amend his original complaint is for the district court to decide in accordance with rule 15(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Green alleges that in June 2001, while he was incarcerated at the Goree Unit, an unidentified correctional officer ordered him to move a mattress despite Green\u2019s protestations that he was medically restricted from performing the task. Green claims that while moving the mattress he suffered a herniated disk. In July 2002, he sued under \u00a7 1983, alleging the officer had violated his constitutional rights by deliberately failing to consult his medical records before ordering him to lift the mattress. Because Green did not know the officer\u2019s name, he sued \u201cJohn Doe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">In August 2002 and January 2003, Green filed motions for discovery to identify the officer. The district court denied both motions and dismissed the case as frivolous in February 2003. Green appealed, and this court remanded because the record had not been sufficiently developed, rendering the dismissal premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">On remand, and following a hearing conducted under <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985), and <em>Cay v. Estelle, </em>789 F.2d 318 (5th Cir.1986), the district court ordered the state to give the court the name of the officer assigned to the area where Green was housed on the date of the alleged incident. There was some confusion over where exactly in the unit Green was housed, so the state provided a shift roster for the date in question. To assist it in identifying the officer, the district court directed Green to answer interrogatories regarding the identity of the officer. The court then ordered the state to provide the names of the officers assigned, on the evening in question, to the housing area Green had described in his response to the interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">The state submitted a list of names that was filed under seal and not made available to Green; the state advised that, of the officers assigned to the housing area Green had described, none fit Green\u2019s description. One of the officers matched Green\u2019s description of age and race but not his description of height and weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">The court then concluded that, even if Green were able to identify the correct officer, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c) would not permit him to amend his complaint and relate back to the original complaint. Because any new complaint he might bring would be time-barred, the court dismissed the claims against \u201cJohn Doe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">We review the denial of a motion to amend for abuse of discretion. <em>Moody v. FMC Corp., </em>995 F.2d 63, 65 (5th Cir.1993). That discretion, however, is limited by rule 15(a), which requires that \u201cleave shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d <em>Jacobsen v. Osborne, </em>133 F.3d 315, 318 (5th Cir.1998). Whether such an amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading is governed by rule 15(c). An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>amendment naming a different defendant will relate back if the claim asserted arose out of the same conduct set forth in the original pleading and the new defendant, within the time provided by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m), received notice of the filing of the original action so that he would not be prejudiced in presenting a defense on the merits, and the new defendant \u201cknew or should have known that, but for a mistake <em>concerning </em>the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against the [new] party.\u201d Rule 15(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">We conclude that Green does not need his amendment to relate back under rule 15(c)(3), because limitations has been equitably tolled by the abuse of discretion in denying his original motions for discovery. Thus, strict application of limitations would be inequitable, because the delay in determining the identity of \u201cJohn Doe\u201d is not attributable to Green. \u201cThe doctrine of equitable tolling preserves a plaintiffs claims when strict application of the statute of limitations would be inequitable.\u201d <em>Lambert v. United States, </em>44 F.3d 296, 298 (5th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Burnett v. N.Y. Cent. R.R., </em>380 U.S. 424, 428, 85 S.Ct. 1050, 13 L.Ed.2d 941 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Green filed motions for discovery twice before limitations expired. The district court denied both motions and subsequently dismissed the case as frivolous. Green appealed the dismissal to this court and raised the issue of the denial of discovery. We reversed and remanded for further development of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The district court followed our order and held a <em>Spears </em>hearing at which the issue of the identity of \u201cJohn Doe\u201d was raised. Following the hearing, the court attempted to facilitate the discovery of the identity of \u201cJohn Doe\u201d by ordering the state and Green to provide additional information. After this back-and-forth, the state identified one black male officer on duty at the time and place indicated by Green.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">This information could have been discovered if Green\u2019s initial motions for discovery had been granted. They were denied, he appealed the denials, and he won on appeal. There is nothing more he could have done to determine the identity of \u201cJohn Doe\u201d within the period of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">To deny Green the opportunity to amend his complaint where he has diligently sought to discover the identity of \u201cJohn Doe\u201d would be tantamount to eliminating the use of a \u201cJohn Doe\u201d in bringing any suit. The only reason to sue a \u201cJohn Doe\u201d is to conduct discovery backed by the authority of the court, but where the amendment cannot relate back and the court incorrectly denies discovery, the \u201cJohn Doe\u201d has become a nullity. Although the use of a \u201cJohn Doe\u201d is disfavored, it serves the legitimate function of giving a plaintiff the opportunity to identify, through discovery, unknown defendants. <em>See Colle v. Brazos County, Tex., </em>981 F.2d 237, 243 n. 20 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">Thus, although the district court correctly notes that in <em>Jacobsen, </em>133 F.3d at 321, we held that rule 15(c)(3) did not allow an amendment to replace a \u201cJohn Doe\u201d because the plaintiff had not made a \u201cmistake concerning the proper identity,\u201d but rather \u201clacked knowledge of the proper party,\u201d the instant case is different. In <em>Jacobsen, </em>there was no justification for equitable tolling; the delays that plagued the case were the fault of the plaintiff; the defendants sought to move discovery forward <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff had the assistance of discovery but failed to take advantage of that power and depose witnesses in a timely manner that would have allowed him to identify the \u201cJohn Doe\u201d and amend his complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 317-18. Green, in contrast, sued almost eleven months before the running of the statute and, given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>specificity of knowledge he had, if he had not been denied discovery he would have had sufficient time to identify the officer and amend his complaint under rule 15(a) without need to relate back under rule 15(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Finally, because the Texas statute of limitations is borrowed in \u00a7 1983 cases, this court also looks to Texas\u2019s equitable tolling principles. <em>See Rotella v. Pederson, </em>144 F.3d 892, 897 (5th Cir.1998). Texas permits the tolling of limitations where a plaintiffs legal remedies are precluded by the pendency of other legal proceedings. <em>See Holmes v. Tex. A &amp; M Univ., </em>145 F.3d 681, 684-85 (5th Cir.1998). Green\u2019s legal remedy was precluded by the erroneous denial of discovery and the subsequent dismissal of his suit as frivolous and by the refusal to provide the name of the officer ultimately identified by the state. Though the legal proceedings following the erroneous denial of discovery are not technically pendent proceedings, they are other proceedings that have precluded Green\u2019s pursuit of his claimed legal remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Green included state law claims against Physician Assistant Huff and Nurse Parker. When the district court dismissed the \u00a7 1983 claim against \u201cJohn Doe,\u201d it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Green\u2019s claims based on state law. Green did not assert in his original brief to this court that the court had erred in refusing to maintain jurisdiction over his state law claims after it dismissed his \u00a7 1983 claim. Though we liberally construe the briefs of <em>pro se </em>litigants, failure to brief an argument is abandonment. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Thus, Green has abandoned this argument, and the decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The judgment is AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part, and this matter is REMANDED for further proceedings as needed. We express no view on whether the underlying claim is frivolous, on whether Green should be allowed to amend, or on any other questions that may arise.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b743-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
