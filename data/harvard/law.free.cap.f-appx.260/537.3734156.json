(\u201cKing\u2019s\u201d), appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment and awarding damages and injunctive relief in favor of Discovery Licensing, Inc. (\u201cDiscovery\u201d), in this breach of contract action. We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal and find no reversible error in the court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment in Discovery\u2019s favor. To the extent King\u2019s contends that the affidavits submitted by Discovery in support of its summary judgment motion did not comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e), we find that King\u2019s has waived its challenge by failing to file a motion to strike the affidavits in the district court. <em>Jones v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., </em>69 F.3d 712, 718 (4th Cir.1995). We also find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of King\u2019s\u2019 request to extend discovery pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f), <em>see Ingle v. Yelton, </em>439 F.3d 191, 195 (4th Cir.2006) (stating standard of review), or in the court\u2019s refusal to appoint a special master, <em>see Meeropol v. Meese, </em>790 F.2d 942, 961 (D.C.Cir.1986) (stating standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-21\">Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court at the summary judgment hearing held on October 30, 2006, and in its subsequent written order. <em>Discovery Licensing, Inc. v. King\u2019s Int\u2019l Multimedia Co., Ltd., </em>No. 8:04-cv-04055-RWT (D. Md. filed Nov. 1, 2006 &amp; entered Nov. 3, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
