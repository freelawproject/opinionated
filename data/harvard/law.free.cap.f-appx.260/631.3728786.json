Ragins is serving concurrent 480-month prison sentences as to the cocaine-base convictions and a concurrent 60-month term as to the marijuana conviction. He filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion challenging his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Following the district court\u2019s denial of Ragins\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, this court granted Ragins a certificate of appealability with regard to whether trial counsel performed ineffectively by failing to interview and call as trial witnesses, Lewis Ragins, Ricardo Miller, and Jimmy Taylor, who allegedly could have testified that Ragins was not involved in the conduct for which he was convicted. The parties were advised to address whether Ragins was entitled to an evidentiary hearing as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">When reviewing the denial of habeas relief, the district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and issues of law are reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Faubion, </em>19 F.3d 226, 228 (5th Cir. 1994). We review mixed questions of law and fact, such as ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Ragins has not shown that there was a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different if these witnesses had testified and, therefore, he has not shown that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>Miller v. Dretke, </em>420 F.3d 356, 361 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Alexander v. McCotter, </em>775 F.2d 595, 602 (5th Cir.1985). Nor was Ragins entitled to an evidentiary hearing on this issue. <em>See United States v. Drummond, </em>910 F.2d 284, 285 (5th Cir.1990). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b657-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
