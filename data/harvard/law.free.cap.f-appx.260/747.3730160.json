Karim contends that the BIA erred because he satisfies the four conditions set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(ii), making his application for adjustment of status amenable to the immigration judge\u2019s (IJ) jurisdiction. The Government argues that the use of the definite article \u201cthe\u201d in \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(ii)(A)-(D) means that, while the IJ in Karim\u2019s case would have had jurisdiction over the adjustment application Karim filed before leaving for Pakistan and which was based on his former wife\u2019s (Angela Allen) 1-130 relative alien visa petition, the new adjustment application Karim has filed based on his current wife\u2019s (Nikki Herbst) 1-130 petition is not amenable to IJ jurisdiction. Under a plain reading of the regulation, the Government\u2019s argument is unassailable because the adjustment application that Karim wants an IJ to adjudicate is not <em>\u201cthe </em>previously filed application\u201d that was based on Allen\u2019s 1-130 alien relative visa petition. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(ii)(B) (emphasis added); <em>see S.D. ex rel. Dickson v. Hood, </em>391 F.3d 581, 595 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cWe have consistently held that a regulation should be construed to give effect to the natural and plain meaning of its words.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Karim argues that the BIA erred in its factual finding that he had not filed a new 1-485 adjustment application based on Herbst\u2019s 1-130 petition. He also argues that the BIA should administratively close his removal proceedings so that he can await the adjudication of his currently pending 1-485 adjustment application. After Karim filed his brief in this case, the BIA considered these arguments in the context of a reconsideration motion filed by Karim. In a decision dated June 13, 2007, the BIA acknowledged the factual error but maintained that it did not affect the BIA\u2019s February 2007 decision. The BIA also refused Karim\u2019s request to administratively close the removal proceedings. Karim has not challenged the BIA\u2019s June 2007 order addressing those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">For the foregoing reasons, Karim\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen his removal proceedings is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b773-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
