Suarez, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction of sentence. In 1991, a grand jury returned a superseding indictment against Suarez charging him, along with 14 codefendants, with one count of conspiracy to possess a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), and 846, and three counts of distributing a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. In 1993, a jury found Suarez guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">Before Suarez\u2019s sentence hearing, an updated presentence investigation report found that Suarez was responsible for 1,669 kilograms of cocaine and assigned him a base offense level of 36 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 (Nov.1988). The PSR then applied a two-level enhancement for behavior resulting in serious bodily injury, \u00a7 2D 1.1(a)(2), and a two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm during the commission of the offense, \u00a7 2D 1.1(b)(1), resulting in a total offense level of 40. With a criminal history category of I, and a total offense level of 40, Suarez\u2019s guideline range was 292 to 365 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">During Suarez\u2019s sentence hearing, on April 27, 2001, he raised an <em>Apprendi </em>objection based on the PSR holding him responsible for more cocaine than was admitted by him or found beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury. The district court denied the objection, based on its interpretation that <em>Apprendi </em>only applied when the guideline range exceeded the statutory maximum. Suarez also objected to both of the two-level enhancements. With the government\u2019s consent, the court sustained Suarez\u2019s objection to the enhancement for serious bodily injury, bringing Suarez\u2019s total offense level down to 38. The court then sentenced Suarez to 235 months imprisonment, a sentence at the low end of the guideline range. Suarez timely appealed, but he later filed a voluntary dismissal of the appeal, which was granted by this Court on August 14, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">In May 2006, Suarez filed with the district court a <em>pro se </em>motion for reduction of sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Suarez argued that the district court attributed to him a larger amount of cocaine than was admitted by him or found beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury, in violation of United States Sentencing Guidelines Amendment 591, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number><em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The district court denied the motion, holding that Amendment 591 applies to the court\u2019s selection of the defendant\u2019s offense guideline, and not to judicial findings of actual conduct. The court also noted that the amendment did not provide help to inmates trying to bypass the non-retroactivity of <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Suarez appealed, arguing that: (1) the district court erred by denying his \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion because the court violated Amendment 591, <em>Apprendi, </em>and <em>Blakely </em>by impermissibly calculating his offense level within U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, based on judicial findings regarding the amount of drugs attributed to him that were not admitted by him or found beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury; and (2) because of this error, he is entitled to be resentenced under <em>Apprendi.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We review a district court\u2019s decision not to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003). Additionally, \u201c[p]ro se pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Generally, \u201cthe court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). Section 3582(c)(2) \u201cdoes not grant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000). Instead, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) permits a district court to modify an imposed term of imprisonment only \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to [its Guidelines amendment power under] 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220 (\u201cSection 3582 only provides a district court with the discretion to reduce a sentence following the lowering of a sentencing range by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d); <em>United States v. Stossel, </em>348 F.3d 1320, 1322 n. 2 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is appropriate only where the defendant argues that \u201chis sentence should be modified based on a subsequent sentencing guideline amendment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">However, where a defendant has been sentenced pursuant to a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission, \u201cthe court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statement in this case is U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">Where a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c) below, a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>ment is authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). If none of the amendments listed in subsection (c) is applicable, a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment ... is not consistent with this policy statement and thus is not authorized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Amendment 591 modified U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1(a) by replacing the existing language with the following, concerning the very first step in calculating the appropriate guideline range: \u201cDetermine, pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.2 (Applicable Guidelines), the offense guideline section from Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) applicable to the offense of conviction. <em>See </em>1B1.2.\u201d U.S.S.G.App. C. The amendment became effective on November 1, 2000, <em>id., </em>and it may be applied retroactively by using a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(e); <em>United States v. Pelaez, </em>196 F.3d 1203, 1205 n. 3 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Suarez argues that the district court erred by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the court violated Amendment 591 by impermissibly calculating his offense level within U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, based on judicial findings regarding the amount of drugs attributed to him that were not admitted by him or found beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury. However, Amendment 591 was already in effect at the time of Suarez\u2019s April 2001 sentence hearing\u2014 Suarez admitted this fact in his motion to the district court, as well as in his opening and reply briefs. Therefore, Amendment 591 was not a \u201csubsequent sentencing guideline amendment,\u201d cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also Stossel, </em>348 F.3d at 1322 n. 2. Instead, Suarez\u2019s argument that the district court violated Amendment 591 by improperly calculating his guideline range\u2014an argument that was available to him at the time of his sentencing\u2014is an issue that he should have addressed in his direct appeal to his sentence, which he voluntarily dismissed. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[A]s was the case before <em>Booker, </em>the district court must calculate the Guidelines range accurately.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Suarez\u2019s argument that the district court erred by denying his motion because the district court violated <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>does not change this result. Under the plain language of the statute, only changes to the guidelines made by the Sentencing Commission after the defendant\u2019s sentence hearing, not Supreme Court decisions, can be used as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220 <em>(\u201cBooker </em>is a Supreme Court decision, not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment by the Sentencing Commission. Therefore, <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions.\u201d). Therefore, the district court correctly denied Suarez\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\">. Suarez also argues that <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217 (11th Cir.2005), is no longer good law in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker. </em>However, this argument is without merit, given that <em>Moreno </em>was decided after <em>Booker </em>and its predecessors and, in fact, discusses the implications of <em>Booker. See Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220-21.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
