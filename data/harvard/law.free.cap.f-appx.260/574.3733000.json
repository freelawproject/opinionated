We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-20\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court must calculate the appropriate guideline range, consider that range in conjunction with the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), and impose sentence. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). We review a post-Boo/cer sentence to determine whether it is \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range\u201d and reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 547. \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir. 2006). When conducting a reasonableness inquiry, we review \u201clegal questions, including the interpretation of the guidelines, de novo, while factual findings are reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, 547 </em>U.S. 1142, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Jones first contends that his sentence is unreasonable because he was erroneously found to be a career offender. Our review of the record satisfies us that he met the criteria for career offender status. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1(a) (2005). Jones was over eighteen when he committed the instant controlled substance offenses, and he had at least two prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. The fact that the majority of Jones\u2019 prior offenses were for misdemeanors is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Jones also argues that the district court did not adequately take his upbringing into consideration. To the contrary, the district court listened carefully to defense counsel\u2019s description of the circumstances in which Jones was raised, and described the situation as \u201ctragic.\u201d In imposing sentence, the court considered a number of factors, including Jones\u2019 background, his extensive criminal history, other \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the presentence report, which the court adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">We conclude that the arguments raised on appeal are without merit and that Jones\u2019 sentence, which falls within the properly calculated advisory guideline range, is reasonable. We accordingly affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
