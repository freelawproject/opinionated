Locust was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin, crack, and cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000); conspiracy to import heroin, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963 (2000); interstate travel in aid of racketeering, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952(a)(3) (2000) (three counts); conspiracy to commit money laundering, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h) (2000); money laundering, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(i), (B)(i) (2000) (ten counts); distribution of sixty-two grams of cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) (2000); using and carrying a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking activity, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000) (two counts); and being a felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) (2000). The district court sentenced Locust to two consecutive life terms plus twenty-five years. He noted a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-24\">Locust challenges only the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction, arguing that the witnesses who testified against him were not credible because they were all drug dealers and/or convicted felons. A defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence faces a heavy burden. Un<em>ited States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997). A jury\u2019s verdict must be upheld on appeal if there is substantial evidence in the record to support it. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). In determining whether the evidence in the record is substantial, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. Un<em>ited States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-25\">Here, the government presented overwhelming and uncontradicted evidence of Locust\u2019s extensive drug dealing and money laundering activities. Locust\u2019s sole challenge to the evidence is that the witnesses who testified against him were all drug dealers, drug users, and/or convicted felons. However, it is well settled that this court does not review witness credibility. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Locust\u2019s conviction. We deny Locust\u2019s motion to relieve his attorney and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
