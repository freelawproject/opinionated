We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-18\">We review the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2007); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Nibagwire v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 153, 156 (4th Cir.2006). A denial of a motion to reopen must be reviewed with extreme deference, since immigration statutes do not contemplate reopening and the applicable regulations disfavor motions to reopen. <em>M.A. v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc). In explaining the degree of deference given to the agency\u2019s discretionary review, this court has observed that the decision to deny a motion to reopen \u201cneed only be reasoned, not convincing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310 (quotation marks and citation omitted). We will reverse a denial of a motion to reopen only if the denial is \u201carbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Barry v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 741, 745 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1147, 166 L.Ed.2d 997 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-21\">We find the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b564-17\"> We note Folivi has not challenged the Board\u2019s decision not to allow him to file a successive asylum application. \"It is a well settled rule that contentions not raised in the argument section of the opening brief are abandoned.\u201d <em>United States v. Al-Hamdi, </em>356 F.3d 564, 571 n. 8 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
