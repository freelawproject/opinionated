Anderson alleged that he was the victim of constitutionally excessive force at the hands of correctional officer Thomas Wills.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-23\">We review findings of fact made following a bench trial for clear error and legal conclusions de novo. <em>Baldwin v. Stalder, </em>137 F.3d 836, 839 (5th Cir.1998). A review of the record, including the trial transcript, establishes that the district court\u2019s credibility findings are supported by the evidence. Additionally, the evidence supports the conclusion that although Anderson sustained more than a de minimis physical injury, the need for the use of force was legitimate, the threat perceived by Wills was reasonable given Anderson\u2019s noncompliance, and Wills adequately tempered the severity of the use of force. <em>See id. </em>at 838. Anderson has not shown that the district court\u2019s findings on his claims of excessive force were clearly erroneous. <em>See Canal Barge Co. v. Torco Oil Co., </em>220 F.3d 370, 375 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-24\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO EXPEDITE APPEAL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b769-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
