BMW moved to strike the additional documents as they were either not in evidence or not submitted to the magistrate judge. The district court granted the motion to strike, noting although it had the discretion to receive additional evidence in its review of the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation, doing so would not be appropriate because Allen did not offer any reason for not filing the documents earlier. This court reviews a district court\u2019s refusal to accept new evidence following the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation for abuse of discretion. <em>See Doe v. Chao, </em>306 F.3d 170, 183 (4th Cir.2002). Following a thorough review of the record, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion under <em>Doe </em>in declining to permit new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">As to his race discrimination claim, Allen argues that he presented a genuine issue of material fact regarding pretext, because BMW claimed to have fired him because he missed his doctor\u2019s appointment, even though he arrived at the appointed time, and because BMW did not require \u201chis similarly situated white counterpart\u201d to submit to the same examination. This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988). Summary judgment may only be granted when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">A plaintiff can establish a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge under Title VII by showing: (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; (3) at the time the employer took the adverse employment action, he was performing at a level that met his employer\u2019s legitimate expectations; and (4) the position was filled by a similarly qualified applicant outside the protected class or other employees who are not members of the protected class were retained under apparently similar circumstances. <em>Honor v. Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, Inc., </em>383 F.3d 180, 188 (4th Cir.2004). When a plaintiff makes a showing sufficient to support a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment action. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). If the employer produces a legitimate reason for the action, the burden once again shifts to the plaintiff to show that the employer\u2019s rationale is a pretext for discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 804, 93 S.Ct. 1817.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">After Allen complained to BMW of carpal tunnel syndrome, he saw Dr. Zimmerman, who examined him for carpal tunnel syndrome. Dr. Zimmerman placed Allen on work restrictions, and Allen did not work another shift for BMW.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">Allen was then referred to Dr. Lencke, who examined Allen and did not find phys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>ical evidence of his condition. BMW scheduled another appointment for Alien with Dr. Lencke to assess whether Allen could return to work and, if so, what restrictions were necessary. Allen did not attend this appointment. BMW scheduled a second appointment and sent Allen a letter notifying him that BMW would pay for the exam and BMW would consider his employment voluntarily terminated if he did not keep the appointment. Allen arrived at Dr. Lencke\u2019s office for his second appointment, but refused to be examined. Dr. Lencke informed BMW that Allen refused to be tested but nonetheless requested the doctor excuse him from work. BMW sent Allen a letter informing him his employment was terminated because he did not participate in the exam.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">We conclude BMW stated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the termination. Because Allen refused to be examined, the fact that he went to the doctor\u2019s office at the allotted time does not demonstrate that BMW\u2019s explanation was a pretext for discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Regarding Allen\u2019s allegedly similarly situated white counterpart, James Fulcher, Allen contends BMW treated Fulcher differently because it did not require him to submit to a similar evaluation for carpal tunnel syndrome. This conclusory allegation is belied by Fulcher\u2019s deposition. Fulcher stated he saw the doctors at BMW numerous times before receiving his diagnosis and that he saw a private physician to be tested for carpal tunnel syndrome upon BMW\u2019s instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Regarding his retaliation claim, Allen argues only that summary judgment is \u201cas a rule, inappropriate to the very fact-specific allegations of retaliation by an employer.\u201d As legal support, Allen cites \u201cthe abundance of cases ... in which the courts have refused to grant such motions.\u201d As this court has repeatedly affirmed summary judgments on retaliation claims, this argument has no merit. <em>See, e.g., Hux v. City of Newport News, </em>451 F.3d 311 (4th Cir.2006); <em>Baqir v. Principi, </em>434 F.3d 733, 748 (4th Cir.2006); <em>Honor, </em>383 F.3d at 188-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting the motion to strike, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, and awarding BMW summary judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
