The Board cross-applies, seeking enforcement of its order. Because we find no abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s backpay order, we grant enforcement and deny Parts Depot\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">In 2000, the Board found that Parts Depot violated sections 8(a)(1), (3) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNLRA\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a)(1), (3) and (5), when it laid off 14 employees in 1994 without first bargaining with Unite Here, the designated collective bargaining representative of Parts Depot\u2019s employees. The Board ordered Parts Depot to provide backpay and offer reinstatement, and that order was enforced by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. <em>See Parts Depot, Inc., </em>332 NLRB 670 (2000) and 332 NLRB 733 (2000), <em>enforced, </em>24 Fed. Appx. 1 (D.C.Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The Board then initiated the present backpay proceedings. A hearing was held before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), and the Board ultimately awarded backpay to claimants Isabel Martinez, Aundria McGregor, Angela Wilson, and Atonia Wright. In this petition, Parts Depot challenges all four awards on due process grounds and the awards to Martinez, McGregor, and Wilson for lack of substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">Section 160(c) of the Act expressly grants the Board the authority to award backpay as a means to restore the situation \u201cas nearly as possible, to that which would have obtained but for\u201d an employer\u2019s illegal conduct. <em>Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, </em>313 U.S. 177, 194, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271 (1941). Because \u201cbackpay is within the \u2018empiric process of administration\u2019 Congress has entrusted to the expertise of the Board,\u201d we review the Board\u2019s backpay order for an abuse of the discretion lodged in the Board. <em>Coronet Foods, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>158 F.3d 782, 798 (4th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Phelps, </em>313 U.S. at 194, 61 S.Ct. 845). In doing so, we must affirm the Board\u2019s interpretations of the NLRA if they are \u201crational and consistent with the Act,\u201d and we must affirm the Board\u2019s factual findings if they are \u201csupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Medeco Sec. Locks, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>142 F.3d 733, 742 (4th Cir.1998)(internal citations and quotations omitted). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consol. Diesel Co. v. NLRB, </em>263 F.3d 345, 351 (4th Cir.2001) (internal quotation and citation omitted). If substantial evidence exists, we must uphold the Board\u2019s decision \u201ceven though we might have reached a different result had we heard the evidence in the first instance.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Daniel Const. Co., </em>731 F.2d 191, 193 (4th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b635-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-15\">Parts Depot\u2019s first argument on appeal is that it was denied due process by several evidentiary and procedural rulings of the ALJ. Parts Depot identifies five rulings it contends deprived it of due process: (1) the ALJ\u2019s restriction of Parts Depot\u2019s questioning of the Board\u2019s Compliance Officer; (2) the ALJ\u2019s restriction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Parts Depot\u2019s questioning of the claimants; (3) the ALJ\u2019s exclusion of certain aspects of the testimony of Parts Depot\u2019s expert witness; (4) the ALJ\u2019s refusal to fully enforce Parts Depot\u2019s subpoenas; and (5) the ALJ\u2019s refusal to allow Parts Depot to amend its answer after the start of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">ALJs are accorded significant discretion in controlling the hearing and the development of the factual record in cases before them. <em>See, e.g., Victor\u2019s Cafe 52, Inc., </em>338 NLRB 753, 756-57 (2002). The record before us supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that the ALJ\u2019s evidentiary rulings properly restrained Parts Depot from pursuing arguments without basis in Board law and served to limit the presentation of cumulative, irrelevant, and superfluous testimony. Likewise, the ALJ was within his discretion to restrict enforcement of Parts Depot\u2019s subpoenas to matters relevant to the issue of backpay and to decline to permit Parts Depot to amend its answer after the start of the hearing to assert a new affirmative defense in the absence of a showing that Parts Depot could not have pled this defense earlier. These rulings did not deprive Parts Depot of due process and provide no basis for refusing to enforce the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Parts Depot next argues that the Board\u2019s backpay awards to Martinez, McGregor, and Wilson are not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Parts Depot makes two primary arguments concerning Martinez. First, it argues that there is no substantial evidence that Martinez exercised reasonable diligence in seeking a job after being laid off. <em>See NLRB v. Pepsi Cola Bottling Co. of Fayetteville, </em>258 F.3d 305, 311 (4th Cir.2001) (\u201cWhere an employer demonstrates that an employee did not exercise reasonable diligence in his or her efforts to secure interim employment, then it has established that the employee has not properly mitigated his or her damages.\u201d) (internal quotation and citation omitted). We find that the work and interim earnings reports submitted by Martinez and her testimony at the hearing constitute substantial evidence in support of the Board\u2019s conclusion that she was either employed or diligently seeking employment throughout the backpay period.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">Second, Parts Depot argues that all of Martinez\u2019s backpay should have been disallowed because she concealed earnings from her job at the Night and Day Laundry. <em>See Ad Art, Inc., </em>280 NLRB 985, 986 (1986) (\u201cdenial of backpay in all cases of willful concealment most forcefully and effectively selves to promote the integrity of the Board\u2019s compliance processes\u201d) (Chairman Dotson, concurring). Instead of denying all backpay, the Board denied Martinez backpay for each quarter that she concealed her income, an approach consistent with Board precedent. <em>See Am. Navigation Co., </em>268 NLRB 426, 428-29 (1983). The Board has \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in selecting remedies, even when an award accrues to the benefit of a claimant who has testified falsely in a Board proceeding. <em>See ABF Freight Sys., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>510 U.S. 317, 325, 114 S.Ct. 835, 127 L.Ed.2d 152 (1994). Because the Board\u2019s decision not to disallow all of Martinez\u2019s backpay was within its broad discretion, we decline to set it aside on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">Parts Depot next argues that McGregor\u2019s backpay award cannot be sustained because he unjustifiably quit several jobs during the backpay period. A claimant\u2019s willful loss of earnings is an affirmative defense to backpay liability. <em>See Pepsi Cola, </em>258 F.3d at 310. However, a claimant is not required to accept or retain interim employment that is substantially more onerous than the job he was laid off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>from, is unsuitable, or threatens to become so. Nor is a claimant required to accept or retain interim employment that entails greater exposure to environmental hazards or hardships that were not present in his previous job. <em>See, e.g., Chem Fab Corp., </em>275 NLRB 21, 24 (1985) <em>enforced, </em>774 F.2d 1169 (8th Cir.1985). The Board concluded that because each <em>of the </em>jobs <em>McGregor </em>quit involved conditions more onerous than his warehouse job with Parts Depot, he was not required to accept them in the first place, and therefore his resignation from those jobs was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">We hold that the Board\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence. The record demonstrates that McGregor quit his job at Florida Smoked Fish because the job required him to work with fish and \u201cconstantly be[ ] in water.\u201d J.A. 273. He also left a job with Jamo, Inc., a concrete company, because he was \u201cinhaling the chemicals that were used to make the cement\u201d and because he was \u201chaving problems getting [the chemicals] off [his] skin.\u201d J.A. 291, 293. He left his job with Carnival Fruit Company because it required him to work at \u201czero temperature\u201d with the result that he had frequent colds. J.A. 299. Having been unlawfully laid off by Parts Depot, McGregor was not required to accept or remain in these less desirable employment conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Finally, Parts Depot challenges the backpay award to Wilson, claiming that Wilson unjustifiably quit a job at Unicco Service Company because it required overnight hours and at GP Plastics Corporation because it was too much work. Parts Depot did not make these arguments before the Board, and therefore we lack jurisdiction to consider them. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">Because we find no abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s supplemental order, we deny Parts Depot\u2019s petition for review and grant the Board\u2019s cross-application for enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">\n<em>PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED; CROSS-APPLICATION FOR ENFORCEMENT GRANTED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-11\">. Backpay due the other ten laid-off employees is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\">. Parts Depot also argues that the Board's method for calculating the claimants' interim earnings was unreasonable. The Board took annualized statements of each claimant\u2019s earnings and divided these by four to produce quarterly interim earnings, which it then deducted from quarterly gross backpay to determine net backpay. Parts Depot argues that the Board was required to calculate more accurately the quarterly earnings of the claimants during the backpay period by determining interim earnings on a quarterly basis. The Board determined that Parts Depot\u2019s suggested method would be impractical in cases like this one, where exact employment dates over a ten-year period cannot be precisely determined. J.A. 128 n. 8. We find no abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s conclusion or method of calculating backpay.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
