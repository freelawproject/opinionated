Rogers appeals his sentence, contending that the district court erred in following <em>United States v. Smith, </em>359 F.3d 662 (4th Cir.2004), to determine that he was an armed career criminal; that <em>Smith </em>was incorrectly decided; and that his prior Virginia conviction for grand larceny from a person was not a violent felony within the meaning of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-20\">A defendant is an armed career criminal under \u00a7 924(e)(1) if he has three previous convictions for violent felonies that occurred on separate occasions. A \u201cviolent felony\u201d is defined in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) as one that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-21\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-22\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involved use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-23\">Rogers had prior Virginia felony convictions for grand larceny from a person <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> in 1988, for robbery in 1990, and for maiming in 1994. In the district court, Rogers conceded that his prior maiming and robbery convictions were violent felonies, but argued that a conviction for grand larceny from a person does not involve a serious potential risk of injury to another, and that the district court should not rely on <em>Smith </em>because <em>Smith </em>dealt with a career offender sentence. The district court concluded that <em>Smith </em>was not directly on point, but \u201cclose enough that its reasoning needs to be followed.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-24\">Whether Rogers\u2019 Virginia conviction for grand larceny from a person qualifies as a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e) is a legal issue which we review de novo. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 283 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1005, 126 S.Ct. 1463, 164 L.Ed.2d 250 (2006). In <em>Smith, </em>we held that larceny from a person is a crime of violence because it \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 359 F.3d at 664 (internal quotation omitted). We observed that \u201c[t]he offense recognizes an enhanced societal concern for conduct that implicates at least a potential for personal assault, conduct that involves the person of the victim and jeopardizes his personal security.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 665 (quoting <em>Garland v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 706, 446 S.E.2d 628, 630 (1994)). Although <em>Smith </em>interpreted the \u201cotherwise\u201d clause in <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) (2002), because the language at issue in <em>Smith </em>is identical to the pertinent language in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), the district court correctly followed <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Rogers argues that <em>Smith </em>was wrongly decided. However, <em>Smith </em>is controlling law in this circuit because \u201ca decision of a panel of this court becomes the law of the circuit and is binding on other panels unless it is overruled by a subsequent en banc opinion of this court or a superseding contrary decision of the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Simms, </em>441 F.3d 313, 318 (4th Cir.) (internal quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 233, 166 L.Ed.2d 184 (2006). Consequently, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b607-17\"> Rogers was initially charged with robbery, but was convicted in a bench trial of grand larceny from a person in violation of Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-95 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
