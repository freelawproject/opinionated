Bista challenges only the determination that he is ineligible for withholding of removal. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986). Bista maintains: the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s rejection of his claim-that, if he returned to Nepal, he had a well-founded fear of persecution because of his political opinions\u2014was not supported by substantial evidence; the Maoists are known generally for \u201cdealing harshly\u201d with individuals who publish critical articles; the Maoists have persecuted his family members because of Bista\u2019s political opinions; and the IJ focused incorrectly on Bista\u2019s family\u2019s lack of problems to support finding Bista failed to show the requisite clear probability of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s findings, except to find that Bista had published articles since the initiation of removal proceedings, we review the decision of the IJ. <em>See Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 437 (5th Cir.2006). Substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Bista failed to show a clear probability of future persecution if he returned to Nepal. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Ozdemir v. INS, </em>46 F.3d 6, 7 (5th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Bista also seeks to have this court take judicial notice of the current political situation in Nepal, as documented in a series of internet articles listed by Bista. The means for seeking further fact-finding is through a motion to reopen. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>440 F.3d 678, 680 n. 1 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">Because Bista has failed to establish a clear probability of persecution upon return to Nepal, the evidence does not compel the conclusion that Bista\u2019s fear of persecution is well-founded. <em>See Roy, </em>389 F.3d at 138. Accordingly, the conclusion of the BIA is substantially reasonable. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-13\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b779-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
