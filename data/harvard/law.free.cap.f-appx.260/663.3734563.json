As the magistrate judge stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-22\">[Plaintiff] is obviously upset with the circumstances surrounding his employment with defendant, as evidenced by the lawsuits he filed in 1998 and 2002 against the Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration [footnote omitted]. Plaintiffs conclusory allegations and legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions, however, cannot suffice to prevent defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-23\">After reviewing the briefs and pertinent parts of the x-ecord and the applicable law, we affirm, essentially for the reasons stated by the magistrate judge in her comprehensive Report and Recommendation signed on January 12, 2007. We also conclude that Arizpe\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s ruling is legally invalid because it listed Maria Ci\u00f1o as Acting Secretary of Transpoi\u2019tation, rather than Mary Peters as Secretary of Transpoi\u2019tation, is frivolous. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(d) (\u201c[A]ny misnomer not affecting the parties\u2019 substantial rights must be disregarded.\u201d). Arizpe\u2019s other arguments are equally unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b689-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
