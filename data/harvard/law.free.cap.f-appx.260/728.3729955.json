The district court dismissed Dixon\u2019s suit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii) concluding, in part, that Dixon\u2019s claim was untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Dixon argues that, under Louisiana law, his complaint was timely filed because it did not accrue until September 2006. However, \u201cfederal law determines when a \u00a7 1988 claim accrues.\u201d <em>Jacobsen v. Osborne, 13</em>3 F.3d 315, 319 (5th Cir.1998). The standard for when a \u00a7 1983 claim accrues is when \u201cthe plaintiff is in possession of the \u2018critical facts that he has been hurt and who has inflicted the injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lavellee v. Listi, </em>611 F.2d 1129, 1131 (5th Cir.1980) (citation omitted). Dixon\u2019s argument that he could not file his suit sooner because he did not know the warden\u2019s name to name him as the defendant is meritless. There are countless cases, like <em>Lavellee, </em>in which a plaintiff has brought suit against John or Jane Does when the defendant\u2019s name is unknown, but the defendant\u2019s position is known. <em>E.g., id at 1129; Bivens v. Six Unknown, Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Dixon\u2019s claims accrued in September 2005, when he learned of the injury that formed the basis of his suit. Dixon did not file his suit until December 2006, after the one year deadline had expired. <em>See Jacobsen, </em>133 F.3d at 319. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing Dixon\u2019s suit. Dixon\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Dixon\u2019s complaint counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Dixon received two strikes as a result of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint in <em>Dixon v. Hubert, </em>No. 07-30343, and our dismissal of that appeal. Dixon is therefore barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">AFFIRMED; MOTIONS DENIED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b754-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
