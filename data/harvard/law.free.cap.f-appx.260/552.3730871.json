We dismiss the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-23\">Under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) (West 2005), we have no jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude or an aggravated felony. We only have jurisdiction to review the factual determinations that trigger the applicability of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), <em>Ramtulla v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 202, 203 (4th Cir.2002), and to resolve constitutional claims or questions of law raised in the petition for review. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (West 2005); <em>Mbea v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 276, 276 n. 1 (4th Cir.2007). In removal proceedings, Ben-Carew conceded he was removable as an alien who was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, and we conclude that \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-24\">Even in light of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), we find we lack jurisdiction to consider any claim raised in Ben-Carew\u2019s petitions for review, because he failed to properly exhaust his available administrative remedies by rais<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>ing the claims before the Board. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (West 2005); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir. 2004). Ben-Carew does not challenge the Board\u2019s order summarily dismissing his appeal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E) (2005) because of his failure to file a brief or statement in support of his appeal after indicating that he would do so. He does, however, allege his counsel was ineffective for having failed to file any brief. Before we may consider this issue, Ben-Carew must exhaust his administrative remedies by timely moving to reopen before the Board. <em>See Galvez Pineda v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 833, 837-38 (10th Cir.2005). Since the administrative record before the court does not establish that he has done so, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Accordingly, we dismiss the petitions for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">\n<em>PETITIONS DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
