Solano-Briseno concedes that the district court imposed a sentence within a properly calculated Sentencing Guidelines range, but she argues that the sentence was an unreasonable sentence considering the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). When the district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated guideline range and gives proper weight to the Guidelines and \u00a7 3553 factors, this court \u201cwill give great deference to that sentence\u201d and \u201cwill infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). A discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2466-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">On appeal, Solano-Briseno argues that the nature and circumstances of the offense, the seriousness of the offense, the need to promote respect for the law, the need to protect the public from harm, the need to provide her with education or training, and the need to avoid sentencing disparity all weigh in favor of a lesser sentence. Solano-Briseno raised these issues at sentencing and the district court engaged in a thorough discussion of the reasons for the sentence. Although Solano-Briseno has put forward cogent arguments to support her weighing of the \u00a7 3553 factors, she has not shown that the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553 factors was not proper and resulted in an unreasonable sentence. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519-20. Solano-Briseno\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b702-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
