The district court sentenced Crane to forty-one months\u2019 imprisonment. Crane timely appealed and contends the district court erroneously calculated his criminal history category by including an unserved state sentence and abused its discretion by denying his Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 motion for a new trial. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-26\">We will affirm the sentence imposed by the district court as long as it is within the statutorily prescribed range and reasonable. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005). In sentencing a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>dant, the district court must: (1) properly calculate the guidelines range; (2) determine whether a sentence within that range serves the factors under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006); (3) implement mandatory statutory limitations; and (4) explain its reasons for selecting the sentence, especially a sentence outside the advisory range. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 455-56 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1156, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). Crane contends the district court\u2019s calculation of his sentencing guidelines range was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) recommended a total offense level of sixteen and a career history category of III, resulting in a range of twenty-seven to thirty-three months\u2019 imprisonment. The PSR\u2019s criminal history calculation did not include a state sentence of five to eighteen years\u2019 imprisonment for a 1989 aggravated robbery conviction (\u201cNo.89-F-19\u201d); owing to an administrative error, Crane never served this sentence. Had No. 89-F-19 been reflected in the PSR\u2019s recommendation, Crane\u2019s criminal history category would have been IV and his sentencing guidelines range would have been thirty-three to forty-one months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1) (2006), which instructs courts to depart upward based on inadequacy of criminal history if \u201creliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes,\u201d the district court appropriately departed upward to a criminal history category of IV in light of Crane\u2019s unserved prior sentence. <em>See also </em>USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(1) (defining \u201cprior sentence\u201d as \u201cany sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere, for conduct not part of the instant offense\u201d); <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>349 F.3d 724, 730 (4th Cir.2003) (\u201cSection 4A1.3 was drafted in classic catch-all terms for the unusual but serious situation where the criminal history category does not adequately reflect past criminal conduct or predict future criminal behavior.\u201d). We therefore conclude Crane\u2019s sentence was properly calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Crane also contends the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 33 motion was improper. We review the denial of this motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Russell, </em>221 F.3d 615, 619 (4th Cir.2000). A new trial may be appropriate when the jury\u2019s verdict is inapposite to the weight of the evidence and it would be unjust to enter judgment on that basis. <em>See Tibbs v. Florida, </em>457 U.S. 31, 38 n. 11, 44 n. 20, 102 S.Ct. 2211, 72 L.Ed.2d 652 (1982). Crane\u2019s contention amounts to an attack on witness credibility, however, and we will not upset on appeal the jury\u2019s assessment of credibility. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989). We therefore find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Crane\u2019s Rule 33 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Crane\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
