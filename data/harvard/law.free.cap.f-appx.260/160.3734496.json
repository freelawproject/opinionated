After review, we dismiss in part and deny in part Alvarado\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b187-18\">Alvarado, a native and citizen of Colombia, arrived in the United States on February 11, 1999. On July 5, 2002, Alvarado filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT relief. In his application, Alvarado claimed that he was persecuted by the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (\u201cFARC\u201d) in Colombia on account of his religion. On February 10, 2005, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) issued a notice to appear, charging Alvarado with removability under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), for remaining in the United States longer than permitted. At his initial hearing, Alvarado admitted the charges and conceded removability.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-20\">According to Alvarado\u2019s application and hearing testimony, Alvarado worked as a missionary with the Cumberland Presbyterian Church (\u201cCPC\u201d), a church that operates in both Colombia and the United States. Six times a year Alvarado would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>go on a mission to work with Colombia\u2019s Indians in remote areas of the country. During one of these trips in September 1998, Alvarado was speaking to a group of young people when he was approached by the FARC. The FARC guerillas verbally harassed him and accused him of being a spy for the \u201cgringos\u201d and using the CPC as his front. One of the guerillas hit Alvarado in the head with his gun, leaving Alvarado unconscious. During this same month, Alvarado received a threatening telephone call from a FARC member who accused Alvarado of being a spy disguised as a missionary and warned Alvarado not to go on any more missions.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">In November 1998, Alvarado traveled as part of a group of missionaries to a remote Indian village. FARC guerillas detained the missionary group. The FARC let the other members of the missionary group go after two days, but held Alvarado captive for another four days. During that time, the FARC kept Alvarado locked up, threatened him with their weapons and interrogated him continuously and accused him of being a spy. The FARC finally let Alvarado go and told him to carry a message to the CPC that the FARC would not allow any more missions into the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">After Alvarado was released, he received more threatening telephone calls from FARC members and was told he was a \u201cmilitary objective.\u201d Alvarado left for the United States after he received another threatening call in January 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Alvarado testified that, if he returned to Colombia, his life would be in danger because the FARC has designated him to be a military objective. Alvarado stated that the FARC believe that his \u201ctrue mission\u201d was to conduct intelligence tests in the region where his missions took place and that, even if he ceased his missionary work, the FARC would still come after him because they consider him to be a spy who was gathering information.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Alvarado submitted as evidence the 2004 Country Report for Colombia, which stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that among the FARC\u2019s primary targets are religious leaders, but that although it sometimes killed, threatened or harassed religious leaders and activists, this was usually done for political rather than religious reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">The IJ denied Alvarado all relief. The IJ found that Alvarado\u2019s asylum application was untimely. As to the withholding claim, the IJ found that Alvarado had failed to show that it was more likely than not that Alvarado was persecuted or would be persecuted on account of his religion given that the FARC targeted Alvarado because it thought he was a spy. The IJ also denied CAT relief because Alvarado had failed to show that it was more likely than not that a government official or someone acting under an official would consent to Alvarado\u2019s torture if he returned to Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">Alvarado appealed to the BIA, challenging only the IJ\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal rulings. The BIA dismissed Alvarado\u2019s appeal, finding, inter alia, (1) that the incidents Alvarado described did not rise to the level of persecution; and (2) that Alvarado had not shown that any alleged persecution was on account of one of the five protected grounds because the FARC\u2019s interest in Alvarado was based on its perception that Alvarado was a spy and not a true evangelist. The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s finding that Alvarado did not face a \u201cclear probability of persecution\u201d if returned to Colombia, and therefore he did not merit withholding of removal. The BIA noted that Alvarado\u2019s wife remained \u201capparently unharmed\u201d in Colombia. Finally, although Alvarado had not challenged the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Alva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>rado failed to demonstrate that he more likely than not would be tortured in Colombia. Alvarado filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">On appeal, Alvarado challenges the denial of withholding of removal and CAT relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We lack jurisdiction to review the merits of Alvarado\u2019s CAT claim because he failed to raise it before the BIA. <em>See Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003) (concluding that the exhaustion requirement in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d) is jurisdictional and bars review of claims not raised before the BIA); <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding that when a petitioner fails to raise an argument in either his notice of appeal or brief before the BIA, the petitioner has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies even if the BIA addressed the issue sua <em>sponte); see also </em>INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). Thus, we address the merits of only Alvarado\u2019s withholding of removal claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">An alien is entitled to withholding of removal if he can show that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). To qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must show that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted or tortured upon his return to the country in question. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 1212, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987); <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. The alien can meet this burden by showing either: (1) \u201cpast persecution in his country based on a protected ground,\u201d in which case a rebuttable presumption is created that his life or freedom would be threatened if he returned to his country; or (2) \u201ca future threat to his life or freedom on a protected ground in his country.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287; <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">Here, the BIA concluded that Alvarado failed to establish that any past persecution or feared future persecution was \u201con account of\u2019 his religion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>review, we conclude that the record does not compel a finding to the contrary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">It is undisputed that the FARC singled out Alvarado while he was doing missionary work with the Indians in Colombia because it believed Alvarado was a spy working for the United States, and not because of Alvarado\u2019s religious beliefs. In fact, Alvarado testified that the FARC disbelieved that Alvarado was a missionary and thought that Alvarado was using his missionary work as a cover to conduct intelligence tests in the region. Furthermore, Alvarado testified that if he returned to Colombia, even if he ceased his missionary work, he would continue to be persecuted because of the FARC\u2019s belief that he is a spy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s findings that Alvarado failed to establish a sufficient nexus between the FARC\u2019s targeting of him and his religion and that Alvarado is statutorily ineligible for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-7\">. Alvarado does not challenge the IJ and the BIA\u2019s determinations that his asylum claim was untimely. Therefore, we do not address this claim further. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 3 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\">. Because the BIA issued its own decision and did not expressly adopt the IJ's decision as to Alvarado's claim of withholding of removal, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review legal determinations de <em>novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). We review the BIA's factual determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) (en <em>banc). </em>Under this highly deferential test, to reverse the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cwe must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b189-14\">. For the first time on appeal before this Court, Alvarado contends that he was also persecuted \u201con account of\u201d his membership in a particular social group. We agree with the government that Alvarado did not properly exhaust this claim for several reasons. First, Alvarado's application for asylum and withholding of removal indicated that he was claiming persecution based solely on his <em>religion, </em>and Alvarado did not argue to the IJ that he was persecuted on account of his membership in a particular social group.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-15\">Second, Alvarado's brief before the BIA stated in a one-sentence conclusion that Alvarado had a well-founded fear of \"persecution based on membership in a protected class.\u201d However, Alvarado\u2019s BIA brief did not contain any substantive argument or discussion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>as to persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group and did not identify any particular social group of which he was a member. Alvarado's conclusoiy reference to being a member of a \"protected class\u201d was insufficient to raise a claim that he was persecuted on account of his membership in a particular social group. Because Alvarado did not raise his social group claim before either the IJ or the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to review this claim. <em>See Sundar, </em>328 F.3d at 1323.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b190-22\">. Because we conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Alvarado failed to show that any alleged past persecution was, or any feared future persecution would be, \"on account of\u201d his religion, we do not address whether the FARC\u2019s actions rise to the level of persecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"AA6\">. Alvarado does not now and never has argued that the FARC\u2019s belief that he was a spy constituted an imputed political opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
