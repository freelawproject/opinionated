The BIA concluded that, because Sillero had a prior aggravated felony conviction, Sillero was ineligible for relief pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(h)(2), as well as 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5). Because Sillero has challenged the determination that he was convicted of an aggravated felony, a question pertinent to both issues, and because he generally argues entitlement to \u00a7 212(c) relief, we will address the merits of both bases of the BIA\u2019s decision. With respect to \u00a7 1212.3(h)(2), the only argument that can be construed as pertinent to this provision is that Sillero was not convicted of an aggravated felony. Each of the reasons proffered lacks merit. First, Sillero\u2019s contention that because the sentence imposed was suspended, there was no conviction, was not raised before the BIA. Thus, we do not consider it. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 136 (5th Cir.2004). In any event, Sillero is incorrect because a sentence or term of imprisonment includes any sentence of confinement regardless of suspension or all or part of the sentence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-20\">Sillero also failed to exhaust his argument that sexual abuse of a minor was not a deportable offense at the time of his plea on June 28, 1996. <em>See Roy, </em>389 F.3d at 136. In any event, the argument lacks merit because the amended definition of aggravated felony, which includes sexual abuse of a minor, applies retroactively. <em>See Garrido-Morato v. Gonzales, </em>485 F.3d 319, 324 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-21\">Finally, for the first time in his reply brief, Sillero asserts that for purposes of \u00a7 1212.3(h)(2), it is the date of the plea, not the date of the conviction, that controls. Sillero did not make this argument in his opening brief, and this court need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>not consider it. <em>See United States v. Hoster, </em>988 F.2d 1374, 1383 (5th Cir.1993) (appeals court need not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief). Moreover, the record shows that the plea was entered on June 28, 1996, within the relevant period. Sillero\u2019s argument thus lacks merit. Sillero has shown no error in the BIA\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 1212.3(h)(2) precludes relief. Thus, we need not reach the BIA\u2019s alternative holding that \u00a7 1212.3(f)(5) also precludes relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Sillero\u2019s argument that the BIA lacked authority to enter an order of removal in the first instance also lacks merit. <em>See Avilez-Granados v. Gonzales, </em>481 F.3d 869, 872 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201cthe BIA has authority to issue an order of removal in the first instance once the IJ has determined that an alien is removable\u201d). Finally, we need not remand this case to the BIA to consider Sillero\u2019s request for adjustment of status. Sillero already has presented this request to the BIA, and the BIA already has rejected it because, as discussed above, \u00a7 1212.3(h)(2) precludes him from obtaining the necessary waiver. <em>See Avilez-Granados, </em>481 F.3d at 872-73 (remanding because BIA had not previously considered adjustment of status).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b698-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
