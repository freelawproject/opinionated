We treat the immigration judge\u2019s reasoning as that of the Board\u2019s in our review. <em>Haoua v. Gonzales, </em>472 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Aholou challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that her testimony was not credible and that she otherwise failed to meet her burden of proving her eligibility for asylum. We will reverse this decision only if the evidence \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution,\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), and we uphold credibility determinations if they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Tewabe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision and find that substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding and the ruling that Aholou failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution as necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2007) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacanas, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). Moreover, as Aholou cannot sustain her burden on the asylum claim, she cannot establish her entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum\u2014even though the facts that must be proved are the same\u2014an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3) [ (2000) ].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">We also find that substantial evidence supports the finding that Aholou fails to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2007). Upon reviewing the administrative record, we find that the immigration judge applied the proper standard to assess the evidence, and that Aholou failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
