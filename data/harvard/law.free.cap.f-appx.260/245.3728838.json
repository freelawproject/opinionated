After the court ordered Shipp to pay the filing fee of $350, Shipp moved for leave to proceed IFP under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, asserting that he had $320 in his prison account and no other assets. A copy of the prison trust fund statement, however, showed a balance of five cents.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>The court summarily denied the motion in an order citing \u00a7 1915 and ordered the fees by paid out of the prison account as the funds became available. Shipp moved to alter or amend judgment, which the court denied. Shipp then filed a notice of appeal from the order denying his motion for leave to proceed IFP, and moved to proceed IFP on appeal. The district court denied leave to proceed IFP on appeal, which this court subsequently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for leave to proceed IFP under \u00a7 1915 for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Martinez v. Kristi Kleaners, Inc., </em>364 F.3d 1305, 1306 (11th Cir.2004). Although the trial court \u201chas wide discretion\u201d in denying an application to proceed IFP, and in civil cases seeking damages, \u201cthe courts should grant the privilege sparingly,\u201d in denying such applications the court \u201cmust not act arbitrarily. Nor may it deny the application on erroneous grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1306-1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">When considering a motion filed pursuant to \u00a7 1915(a), \u201c[t]he only determination to be made by the court ... is whether the statements in the affidavit satisfy the requirement of poverty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1307. Such an affidavit will be held sufficient if it represents that the litigant, because of his povei\u2019ty, is unable to pay for the court fees and costs, and to support and provide necessities for himself and his dependents. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion for two reasons. First, Shipp submitted a good faith affidavit to establish indigency using the form provided by the Middle District of Florida. He explained that he was unable to pay the filing fee, he specified the nature of his action, and he attached the balance sheet from his inmate account showing a balance of five cents in his prison trust account and no other assets. <em>See Martinez, </em>364 F.3d at 1307-1308. Thus, Shipp was unable to make even partial payment under \u00a7 1915(b)(1)(B). The statute provides that \u201cin no event shall a prisoner be prohibited from bringing a civil action or appealing a civil or criminal judgment for the reason that the prisoner has no assets and no means by which to pay the initial partial filing fee.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(4). Therefore, the court abused its discretion in denying leave to proceed IFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">Second, the district court did not explain its reasons for denying leave to proceed IFP. <em>Martinez, </em>364 F.3d at 1307. The only indication from the court is its citation to \u00a7 1915. Without more, the court\u2019s order does not enable meaningful appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Accordingly, we VACATE and REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-6\">. The relevant provisions of \u00a7 1915 are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">(a) any court of the United States may authorize the commencement ... of any suit ... without prepayment of fees or security therefor, by a person who submits an affidavit that includes a statement of all assets such prisoner possesses that the person is unable to pay such fees or give security therefor. Such affidavit shall state the nature of the action, defense or appeal and affiant's belief that the person is entitled to redress. A prisoner seeking to bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding without prepayment of fees or security therefor, in addition to filing the affidavit ..., shall submit a certified copy of the trust fund account statement (or institutional equivalent) for the prisoner for the 6-month period immediately preceding the filing of the complaint or notice of appeal ... (b) if a prisoner brings a civil action or files an appeal in forma pauperis, the prisoner shall be required to pay the full amount of a filing fee. The court shall assess and, when funds exist, collect, as a partial payment of any court fees required by law, an initial partial filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)-(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
