McDaniel contends that we should vacate his sentence and remand this case to the district court because (1) the district court misrepresented U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(3)(A), and (2) his sentence was unreasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-17\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), McDaniel met \u201cC\u201d in an internet chatroom. McDaniel was 19 years old when he met \u201cC,\u201d and he knew that she was 12 years old. McDaniel later learned that \u201cC\u201d was a rape victim. For about a year and a half, McDaniel and \u201cC\u201d communicated via chatrooms, e-mails, and cellular telephones. Eventually, their contact became romantic in nature, and McDaniel arranged to travel from Texas to Florida to have sexual activity with \u201cC.\u201d \u201cC\u201d \u2019s father discovered that McDaniel was communicating with his daughter, so he contacted McDaniel, informed him that his daughter was 14 years old, and asked him to stay away from her. McDaniel said he would leave \u201cC\u201d alone, yet he continued with his plans to meet \u201cC.\u201d Subsequently, McDaniel flew from Texas to Florida to meet \u201cC.\u201d Eventually, he took her to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>hotel room where McDaniel and \u201cC\u201d had sexual contact, but not intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">According to the PSI\u2019s offense level calculation, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G1.3, the base offense level for McDaniel was 24. Under \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(3)(A), there was a two-level enhancement because the offense level involved the use of a computer to induce the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(4)(A), there was a two-level enhancement because the offense involved sexual contact. McDaniel qualified for a two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a) for acceptance of responsibility, and a one-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(b) for notifying the government of his intention to plead guilty. With a total offense level of 25 and a criminal history category of I, the probation officer determined that the applicable guideline range was 57 to 71 months imprisonment. The statutory imprisonment range was 0 to 30 years. The district court sentenced McDaniel to 120 months imprisonment. McDaniel challenges the reasonableness of his sentence on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Sentences imposed under an advisory guideline system are reviewed for \u201cunreasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (brackets omitted). However, before deciding whether a sentence is reasonable, the court first decides whether the district court correctly interpreted and properly applied the guidelines to calculate the appropriate guidelines range. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005). We review de novo the question whether the district court misapplied the guidelines range. <em>United States v. McVay, </em>447 F.3d 1348, 1353 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we first conclude that the district court correctly calculated the advisory guidelines range. The applicable guideline requires a two-level enhancement if the offense involved the use of a computer or an interactive computer service to persuade or induce a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. McDaniel\u2019s argument that the guideline applied only if the computer is used to persuade or induce the minor to travel to engage in prohibited sexual conduct is contrary to the plain language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(3). Even if, however, we concluded that the district court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G1.3(b)(3) was erroneous, the error would be harmless because the district court announced that it would impose the same sentence even without the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">Finally, we conclude that McDaniel\u2019s sentence was reasonable even though it was a 49-month upward variance from the top of the guideline range. We base our conclusion on the fact that the district court (1) explicitly considered many of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors; (2) found that the properly-calculated advisory guideline range was inadequate because it did not adequately reflect the seriousness of the crime, the need to provide adequate deterrence, and the need to promote respect for the law; and (3) imposed a sentence 20 years below the statutory maximum for the offense, which was 30 years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm McDaniel\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-11\">. In an order filed on November 2, 2007, we directed the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing the reasonableness of McDaniel's sentence. The parties complied with our order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
