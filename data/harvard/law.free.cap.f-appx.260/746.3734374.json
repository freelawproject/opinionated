Salazar contends that the district court clearly erred in denying him a minor role adjustment to his offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The record demonstrates that Salazar not only took care of the house where the drugs and firearms were kept, but also assisted others in weighing and packaging the drugs for distribution. Even though Salazar\u2019s role might have been only one part of the distribution scheme, his participation was clearly \u201ccoextensive with the conduct for which he was held accountable,\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 598-99 (5th Cir.2001), and not merely peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity, <em>United States v. Miranda, </em>248 F.3d 434, 446-47 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Salazar\u2019s conviction and sentence are</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b772-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm.
