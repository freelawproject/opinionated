Talley appeals the district court\u2019s grant of the motion to dismiss his complaint he filed against Defendants Alabama Department of Public Safety and W.M. Coppage. Talley filed a bankruptcy adversary proceeding against the Defendants after they suspended his driver\u2019s license because of his nonpayment of traffic tickets. Talley alleges the Defendants violated his bankruptcy stay by suspending his license after his bankruptcy petition was filed. The bankruptcy court concluded the traffic fine was a continuation of criminal proceedings permitted by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(b)(1). The district court affirmed. After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned opinion of January 29, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
