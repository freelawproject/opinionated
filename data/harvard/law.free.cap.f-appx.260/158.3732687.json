After review, we affirm Perez-Cordova\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-26\">On appeal, Perez-Cordova argues that the district court erred in denying him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>safety-valve relief based on Perez-Cordova\u2019s failure to provide complete and truthful information about his offenses to the government.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The safety-valve provision requires a district court to calculate the advisory guidelines range of certain drug offense defendants without regard to any mandatory-minimum sentence if the district court finds that the defendant meets the five criteria set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f); <em>United States v. Quirante, </em>486 F.3d 1273, 1275 (11th Cir.2007). In addition, a defendant who meets the safety-valve criteria is entitled to a two-level reduction in his offense level. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(11).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Of the five criteria, the only one at issue in this appeal requires the defendant \u201cnot later than the time of the sentencing hearing\u201d to provide truthful and complete information concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or a common scheme or plan. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5). \u201cThe question of whether the information [that the defendant] supplied to the government ... was truthful and complete ... is a factual finding for the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Brownlee, </em>204 F.3d 1302, 1305 (11th Cir. 2000). \u201c[L]ies and omissions do not, as a matter of law, disqualify a defendant from safety-valve relief so long as the defendant makes a complete and truthful proffer not later than the commencement of the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant bears the burden of proving the truthfulness of his proffer. <em>United States v. Milkintas, </em>470 F.3d 1339, 1345 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Espinosa, </em>172 F.3d 795, 797 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s safety-valve ruling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Perez-Cordova did not satisfy his burden of proving that his safety-valve statement truthfully provided the government with all of the information he had concerning his offense conduct. The government disputed whether Perez\u2019s oral statement, which was given to the government outside the presence of the district court and was never reduced to writing, was truthful. In response, PerezCordova proffered his testimony at the sentencing hearing. This testimony, which related to his role in the drug conspiracy, was inconsistent with other evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">First, Perez-Cordova\u2019s sentencing testimony was inconsistent with the facts to which he stipulated at his change of plea hearing. Specifically, Perez-Cordova admitted at his change of plea hearing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>he asked one of the co-conspirators, Ramon Otero-Montijo, to drive from Orlando to Fort Lauderdale and instructed Otero-Montijo to be the driver for a third co-conspirator, Amador Suarez, who was completing a drug transaction. At sentencing, however, Perez-Cordova testified that it was Suarez, rather than himself, who asked Otero-Montijo to come to Fort Lauderdale from Orlando to be Suarez\u2019s driver and told Otero-Montijo about the upcoming drug transaction. Perez-Cordova did not attempt to reconcile these inconsistencies or explain which version of events was the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Second, Perez-Cordova\u2019s testimony at sentencing was inconsistent with the testimony of Otero-Montijo as to whether Perez-Cordova recruited him to join the drug conspiracy during a barbeque in Texas. Perez-Cordova did not demonstrate that his testimony, as opposed to Otero-Montijo\u2019s testimony, was the truth. Finally, Perez-Cordova\u2019s testimony that he had nothing further to do with the drug deal or with the government\u2019s confidential informant after his wife was hospitalized in Texas was inconsistent with the taped telephone conversations submitted by the government at the sentencing hearing. For all of these reasons, the district court did not clearly err in discrediting Perez-Cordova\u2019s testimony when it concluded that Perez-Cordova was not \u201cbeing completely candid\u201d about his role in the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">While earlier lies and omissions do not, as a matter of law, disqualify a defendant from safety-valve relief, here, Perez-Cordova failed to provide any explanation for his inconsistencies at sentencing. These inconsistencies and the fact that PerezCordova\u2019s sentencing testimony attempted to portray him as playing a more limited role in the drug conspiracy provided a sufficient basis for the district court to conclude that Perez-Cordova did not provide complete and truthful information and to deny Perez-Cordova safety-valve relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\">. \"When reviewing a district court's safety-valve decision, we review for clear error a district court's factual determinations and de <em>novo </em>the court\u2019s legal interpretation of the statutes and sentencing guidelines.\" <em>United States v. Poyato, </em>454 F.3d 1295, 1297 (11th Cir.2006) (alterations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b185-9\">. We reject Perez-Cordova's contention that the district court's safety-valve ruling is insufficient to permit meaningful appellate review. The district court made an explicit finding that Perez-Cordova did not qualify for safety-valve relief because he did not truthfully provide all of the information and evidence that he had concerning the offenses and that Perez-Cordova was not being completely candid about his role in the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">Furthermore, we reject Perez-Cordova\u2019s argument that the district court merely deferred to the government\u2019s assessment of the truthfulness of Perez-Cordova's statement. The record demonstrates that, after reviewing tire transcripts of the taped conversations with the government\u2019s informant and hearing testimony from both Perez-Cordova and his co-conspirator, Ramon Otero-Monlijo, the district court made independent safety-valve findings, specifically noting that its safety-valve determination was \"based on what [it] heard\u201d from Perez-Cordova at the second sentencing hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
