On appeal, he argues that his sentence was unreasonable and that the district court abused its discretion by sentencing him to the statutory maximum sentence, when his advisory guideline range was two to eight months\u2019 imprisonment. He further contends that the court improperly relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>criminal conduct, for which he had not been convicted, in imposing his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">We review final sentences for reasonableness, and the defendant has the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we held that, in imposing a sentence, the district court first must accurately calculate the defendant\u2019s guideline range and, second, must consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine a reasonable sentence. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. The sentencing court\u2019s factual findings may be based upon facts admitted in the guilty plea, undisputed statements in the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), or evidence presented at the sentencing hearing. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>884 F.2d 1355, 1356 (11th Cir.1989). Failure to object to the PSI\u2019s factual allegations admits those facts for sentencing purposes. <em>United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2096, 167 L.Ed.2d 816 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">In determining whether a sentence is reasonable, the district court should be guided by the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. The relevant factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">(2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014 (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed [treatment];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">(3) the kinds of sentences available;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-11\">(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-12\">(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-13\">(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 259-61, 125 S.Ct. at 764-66. However, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Rather it is sufficient, under <em>Booker, </em>for the district court to acknowledge that \u201cit has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. We have upheld, as reasonable, sentences above the high end of a defendant\u2019s advisory guideline range. <em>See United States v. Eldick, </em>443 F.3d 783 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 251, 166 L.Ed.2d 196 (2006); <em>United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">The district court correctly calculated the guideline range, and proceeded to explicitly address several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. The court emphasized the rapidity of Lopex-Parada\u2019s return after deportation, his immediate arrests for violent and non-violent crimes, and his former membership in one of the most dangerous gangs in the United States. Reasoning that Lopez-Parada\u2019s quick return to the United States and crime indicated he did not \u201cget the message\u201d the last time, the court concluded that a more lengthy sentence would be necessary to protect the public, prevent more crimes and get Lopez-Parada\u2019s attention. In addition, the court did not err by considering the conduct underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>more recent criminal charges because these factors were never objected to, and thus were deemed admitted. <em>See Wade, </em>458 F.3d at 1277. In sum, because the court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining that a guideline range sentence was inadequate, and did not impose a sentence greater than the statutory maximum, Lopez-Parada\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-18\">.
