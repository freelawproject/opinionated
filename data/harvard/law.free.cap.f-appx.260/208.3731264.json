We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">Whether the district court erred in concluding that appellant\u2019s following ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims were procedurally defaulted because he did not raise them in state court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">(a) counsel pursued an insanity defense against his wishes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\">(b) counsel failed to present witnesses on his behalf;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-11\">(c) counsel failed to provide him with an adequate defense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-12\">(d) counsel failed to present evidence on his behalf; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-13\">(e) counsel failed to object to the admission of similar transaction evidence</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">The district court found these claims to be procedurally defaulted based on Spear\u2019s purported failure to raise them in state court. However, as Spear correctly argues, and the state concedes, Spear did adequately raise these claims in state court, and the district court is therefore in error. Because the district court erred in finding that Spear procedurally defaulted the five ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims specified in the COA, we vacate the decision of the district court as to these claims and remand the \u00a7 2254 petition for further consideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-17\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-15\">. We do not address the merits of these claims because the district court has not yet had an opportunity to do so first and because a merits analysis is outside the scope of the COA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
