Buesgens seeks to appeal the transfer of his pending 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) action from the District of Maryland to the Western District of Texas. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). It is well-settled that transfers under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) (2000) are not appealable final orders. <em>See In re Canrefirst of Md., Inc., </em>305 F.3d 253, 262 (4th Cir.2002); <em>Gower v. Lehman, </em>799 F.2d 925, 927 (4th Cir.1986). We therefore lack jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. Accordingly, we deny Buesgens\u2019 motions for production of documents and for \u201cJoinder of Civil Actions.\u201d We also deny Buesgens\u2019 \u201cMotion for relief from Judge Sam Sparks\u2019 order closing Civil No. 1:07cv00444SS.\u201d We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-16\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
