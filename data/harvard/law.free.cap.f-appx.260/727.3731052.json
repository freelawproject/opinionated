The district court dismissed Dixon\u2019s suit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) concluding, in part, that Dixon\u2019s claim was untimely filed. The district court also denied Dixon leave to appeal in forma pauperis (IFP), certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Dixon seeks leave from this court to proceed IFP. By doing so, he challenges the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number><em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 203 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Dixon has failed to demonstrate that his complaint was timely filed. \u201c[Fjederal law determines when a \u00a7 1983 claim accrues.\u201d <em>Jacobsen v. Osborne, </em>133 F.3d 315, 319 (5th Cir.1998). The standard for when a \u00a7 1983 claim accrues is when \u201cthe plaintiff is in possession of the \u2018critical facts that he has been hurt and who has inflicted the injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lavellee v. Listi, </em>611 F.2d 1129, 1131 (5th Cir.1980) (citation omitted). Dixon\u2019s argument that he could not file his suit sooner because he did not know the warden\u2019s name to name him as the defendant is meritless. There are countless cases, like <em>Lavellee, </em>in which a plaintiff has brought suit against John or Jane Does when the defendant\u2019s name is unknown, but the defendant\u2019s position is known. <em>E.g., id </em>at 1129; <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown, Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Dixon\u2019s claims accrued in September 2005, but he did not file his suit until December 2006, after the one year deadline had expired. <em>See Jacobsen, </em>133 F.3d at 319. Dixon has not demonstrated that he is entitled to proceed IFP on appeal, and his motion for leave to appeal IFP is denied. Dixon has also moved for appointment of counsel and for leave to file an amended brief. These motions are denied. As it is plain that any appeal would be frivolous, we dismiss the appeal sua sponte pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 42.2. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">The dismissal of this appeal and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Dixon\u2019s complaint each count as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Dixon received a strike for the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint. <em>See Dixon v. Cooper, </em>No. 07-30440. Dixon is therefore barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS DENIED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b753-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
