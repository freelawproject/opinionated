Nieto contends that the IJ erred in determining that his inadmissibility under INA \u00a7 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I), for which there is no waiver, rendered him ineligible to adjust his status from that of an illegal alien physically present in the United States to that of a lawful permanent resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-20\">We have previously upheld as reasonable the BIA\u2019s interpretation that compliance with the requirements of \u00a7 1255(i) does not cure inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I). The BIA did not act arbitrarily in determining that because Nieto was inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I), he was ineligible for an adjustment of status under \u00a7 1255(i). <em>See Mortera-Cruz v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 246, 255-56 (5th Cir.2005). Consequently, the BIA\u2019s decision is entitled to deference. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-21\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b697-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set fordt in 5th Cir.
