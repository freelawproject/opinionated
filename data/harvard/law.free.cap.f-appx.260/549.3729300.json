Oakes reserved the right to challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress the evidence seized from his truck during a traffic stop. He asserts that officers violated his Fourth Amendment rights by detaining him -without reasonable suspicion. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-22\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error, and the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>484 F.3d 267, 280 (4th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)). When a suppression motion has been denied, this court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>United States v. Uzenski, </em>434 F.3d 690, 704 (4th Cir.2006). A routine and lawful traffic stop permits an officer to detain the motorist to request a driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration, to run a computer check, and to issue a citation. <em>United States v. Brugal, </em>209 F.3d 353, 358 (4th Cir.2000) (en banc). To further detain the driver requires a reasonable suspicion on the part of the investigating officer that criminal activity is afoot. <em>Id.; see Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 498, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983). In determining whether there was reasonable suspicion, the court must look at the totality of the circumstances. <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 125-26, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000); <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 8, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989). With these standards in mind, we have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal and conclude that the district court did not err in denying Oakes\u2019 motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
