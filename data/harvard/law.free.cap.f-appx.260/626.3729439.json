Tombuela claims substantial evidence does not support the Board\u2019s decision denying withholding from removal or withholding under the CAT.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>She further claims the Board failed to consider relevant evidence, resulting in the denial of due process. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">To be eligible for withholding of removal, an alien must show a clear probability that her \u201clife or freedom would be threatened\u201d on a protected ground if she were to be removed to her native country. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A) (2000); <em>see Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 370 (4th Cir. 2004). A \u201cclear probability\u201d means it is more likely than not that the alien would be subject to persecution. <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 429-30, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). \u201cThe burden of proof is on the applicant for withholding of removal ... to establish that his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b) (2007). A showing of such a threat in the past creates a rebuttable presumption that the threat would recur upon removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1)(I); <em>Camara, </em>378 F.3d at 370. Withholding of removal is mandatory if the alien satisfies the standard of proof. <em>INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 419, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999). Factual findings by the Board or the immigration judge \u201care conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000). The Board\u2019s decision denying withholding of removal is conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">We find the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. We further find the record does not compel a different result with respect to the Board\u2019s finding that Tombuela failed to show past persecution based on a protected ground. We also find her due process challenge is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">In addition, we are precluded from reviewing her challenge to the denial of relief under the CAT because she did not raise this claim on appeal to the Board. <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004). We further find Tombuela\u2019s claim that she was entitled to humanitarian relief even if she failed to show that it is likely she will be a victim of persecution is without merit. <em>See Bucur v. INS, </em>109 F.3d 399, 405 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b652-12\"> Tombuela does not challenge the Board\u2019s decision that her asylum application was untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
