Barnett argues that the district erred in increasing his base offense level by two levels for unduly influencing a minor because the \u201cminor\u201d was actually an adult undercover law enforcement officer. Barnett does not contest that the enhancement was authorized by our holding in <em>United States v. Root, </em>296 F.3d 1222 (11th Cir.2002); rather, he argues that <em>Root </em>was wrongly decided and is due to be overturned by this Court <em>en banc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-16\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Kinard, </em>472 F.3d 1294, 1297 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006). Further, a panel of this Court is bound by the precedent of a prior panel \u201cunless and until it is overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>342 F.3d 1245, 1246 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-17\">The guidelines provide for a base offense level of 24 for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b), along with a two-level increase if \u201ca participant otherwise unduly influenced a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2G1.3(a), (b)(2)(B) (2006). To that end, the application notes define a \u201cminor\u201d as, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201can undercover law enforcement officer who represented to a participant that the officer had not attained the age of 18 years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at cmt. (n.1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, the commentary instructs that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-18\">In determining whether subsection (b)(2)(B) applies, the court should closely consider the facts of the case to determine whether a participant\u2019s influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor\u2019s behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>In a case in which a participant is at least 10 years older than the minor, there shall be a rebuttable presumption, for the purposes of subsection (b)(2)(B), that such participant unduly influenced the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. In such a case, some degree of undue influence can be presumed because of the substantial difference in age between the participant and the minor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5S\"><em>Id. </em>at cmt. (n.3(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">In <em>Root, </em>we addressed a similar two-level enhancement that applied where \u201ca participant otherwise unduly influenced the victim to engage in prohibited sexual conduct,\u201d and where the definition of \u201cvictim\u201d included \u201can undercover law enforcement officer who represented to a participant that the officer had not attained the age of 16 years.\u201d 296 F.3d at 1232 (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2(b)(2)(B) and application notes).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A rebuttable presumption of undue influence also applied when the offender was \u201cat least 10 years older than the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1233. First, we held that \u201c[a] real victim is not needed under \u00a7 2A3.2(b)(2)(B) when an undercover agent is involved, as the focus is on the offender\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1234. Second, we held that sentencing courts \u201cmay also employ the rebuttable presumption of undue influence ... when there is a 10-year difference between the offender\u2019s age and the age of the child portrayed by the undercover agent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Upon consideration of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no error. Here, Barnett does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that the presumption of undue influence applied, i.e., that he was at least 10 years older than the fictional age of the undercover officer, nor does he challenge the court\u2019s finding that he failed to rebut the presumption of undue influence such that the two-level enhancement applied. These findings were correct under <em>Root, </em>and, in response to Barnett\u2019s claim that <em>Root </em>was wrongly decided and should be reversed, we are bound by that precedent \u201cunless and until it is overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>342 F.3d at 1246. Accordingly, we affirm Barnett\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-14\">.
