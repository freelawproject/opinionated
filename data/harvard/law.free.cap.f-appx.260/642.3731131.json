INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-22\">Bekteshi argues that the IJ\u2019s determination that his expert witness\u2019s testimony was not credible is in error because the inconsistencies relied on by the IJ did not exist and, therefore, cannot provide the basis for an adverse credibility determination. Bekteshi has not demonstrated that the record compels a conclusion contrary to that of the IJ and therefore has not provided a basis for this court to replace the IJ\u2019s determinations concerning credibility or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations with its own determinations. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 905 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-23\">Review of the record reveals that the IJ\u2019s determination that Bekteshi failed to demonstrate that he is entitled to asylum is supported by substantial evidence. The burden of proof for withholding of removal is a higher standard than asylum. Failure to satisfy the less demanding asylum standard is, a fortiori, a failure to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 906. The Convention Against Torture does not require persecution; it requires that an applicant prove that it is more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>likely than not that he will be tortured if removed. <em>Id. </em>at 906-07. Bekteshi has not demonstrated that he is entitled to relief on these alternative grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The petition for review is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b668-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
