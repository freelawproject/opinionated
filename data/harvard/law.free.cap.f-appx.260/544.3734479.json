Crump appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaint. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Crump v. Christie, </em>No. 3:07-cv-00244-JRS, 2007 WL 2301562 (E.D.Va. Aug. 7, 2007). We deny Crump\u2019s motion to recuse judges of this court that smoke from this case. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
