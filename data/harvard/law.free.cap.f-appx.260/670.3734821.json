He argues that his sentence violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and is unreasonable. The presumption of reasonableness afforded a sentence within a properly calculated advisory guideline range is consistent with <em>Booker. See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The record reflects that the distinct court considered Bunch\u2019s arguments, statements from Bunch and his family, the recommendation of the presentence report, the applicable guideline range, and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-24\">Because the district court exercised its discretion to impose a sentence within a properly calculated guideline range, the sentence is presumptively reasonable, and we may infer that the district court considered all the facts for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462-70; <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005). Bunch asserts that he has re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>butted the presumption of reasonableness because of various mitigating factors. There is nothing to indicate that the district court improperly failed to consider sentencing factors entitled to significant weight, gave significant weight to improper factors, or erred in balancing the factors to such a degree that the sentence was not reasonable. <em>See United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b696-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
