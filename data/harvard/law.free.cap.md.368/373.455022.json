Following an evidentiary hearing, Judge Allison concluded that respondent violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 8.1(b), and 8.4.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Respondent filed exceptions to Judge Allison\u2019s findings, and Bar Counsel excepted to Judge Allison\u2019s failure to find that respondent violated MRPC 1.5.

During a telephone conversation with Michael Windsor, respondent agreed to meet with Michael, but he did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-12\">8. In subsequent calls made by Michael Windsor to respondent, respondent\u2019s telephone was disconnected and Michael could not reach respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-13\">9. Michael Windsor requested his mother, Mary Windsor, attempt to reach respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-14\">10. Mary Windsor attempted to telephone respondent in advance of the August 16, 1999 healing date and the telephone was disconnected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>11.

Respondent wrote on a legal pad the name of one of the Parole Commission employees with whom he spoke, but did not retain the legal pad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">16. Respondent could not remember the name of the Parole Commission employees with whom he spoke.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">17.

Respondent did not inform Michael or Mary Windsor or Michael\u2019s girlfriend that he would not be present at the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-13\">21. Prior to the August 16, 1999 hearing date, respondent held the opinion that Michael would be released after the hearing, but he did not communicate that opinion to Michael or Mary Windsor or to Michael\u2019s girlfriend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-14\">22. Respondent was on vacation on August 16, 1999, and did not attend the parole revocation hearing for Michael Windsor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>23.

Michael and Mary Windsor and Michael\u2019s girlfriend received no explanation or communication from respondent despite Ms. Windsor\u2019s October 1, 1999 letter to respondent requesting an explanation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">28. Glenn M. Grossman, Bar Counsel, wrote to respondent on November 2 and 29, 1999 regarding the complaint filed by Mary Windsor. Respondent responded by letter received on December 13,1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">29. By letters dated December 14, 1999; January 12, 2000; and January 24, 2000, Bar Counsel requested further information from respondent, but respondent did not answer Bar Counsel\u2019s request for further information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">Conclusions of Law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-12\">Matter of the Representation of Terrelle Hartley</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-13\">Respondent violated the following rules of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct in his representation of Ter-relle Hartley.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-14\">Rule 1.1 Competence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>1. Respondent violated Rule 1.1 when respondent failed to undertake the preparation reasonably necessary for the representation of Terrelle Hartley\u2019s case by failing to interview his client and by failing to undertake any investigation from the date respondent entered his appearance, July 2 or 3, 1999, until the date of the second hearing, September 17,1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-4\">Rule 1.3 Diligence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">2. Respondent violated Rule 1.3 when respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness when he failed to interview his client or undertake any investigation from the date respondent entered his appearance, July 2 or 3, 1999, until the date of Terrell\u2019s second hearing, September 17, 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">3. Respondent violated Rule 1.3 when respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness when he failed to make any effort to ascertain the date of Terrelle Hartley\u2019s hearing from the date respondent entered his appearance, July 2 or 3, 1999, until the date of Terrelle\u2019s second hearing, September 17,1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">Rule 1.4 Communication</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">4. Respondent violated Rule 1.4(a) when respondent failed to keep Terrelle or Joyce Ann Hartley informed of the status of Terrelle\u2019s case from the date respondent entered his appearance, July 2 or 3, 1999, until the date of Terrelle\u2019s second hearing, September 17,1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">5. Respondent violated Rule 1.4(b) when respondent failed to explain Terrelle\u2019s matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Terrelle and Joyce Ann Hartley to make informed decisions regarding Terrelle\u2019s case and by neglecting to conduct any substantive discussions with Ter-relle Hartley or Joyce Ann Hartley at anytime from the date respondent entered his appearance, July 2 or 3, 1999, until the date of Terrelle\u2019s second hearing, September 17, 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>6. Respondent violated Rule 1.4(a) when he failed to respond to Joyce Ann Hartley\u2019s repeated attempts to contact him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\">Rule 8.1(b) Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">7. In failing to respond to the inquiries of Bar Counsel dated October 20,1999; November 10, 1999; and December 3, 1999, respondent knowingly failed to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority in violation of Rule 8.1(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">Rule 8.4 Misconduct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">8. Respondent engaged in conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4 by 1) failing to be present at the August 18 and September 17, 1999 hearings for Terrelle Hartley; and 2) by failing to respond to Master Richard J. Gilbert\u2019s request for information regarding the respondent\u2019s failure to appear at Terrelle Hartley\u2019s August 18,1999 hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">Matter of the Representation of Michael Windsor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aar\">Rule 1.4 Communication</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">9. Respondent violated Rule 1.4(a) when respondent 1) failed to inform Michael Windsor or Mary Windsor that he would not appear at Michael\u2019s hearing on August 16, 1999; 2) failed to inform them that the hearing was scheduled for August 16, 1999; 3) failed to respond to Mary Windsor\u2019s letter of October 1,1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\">10. Respondent violated Rule 1.4(b) when respondent failed to meet with Michael Windsor, as he represented he would, prior to the August 16, 1999 parole revocation hearing and thus failed to explain Michael\u2019s circumstances with him to the extent reasonably necessary for Michael to make informed decisions regarding his parole revocation matter and hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-11\">11. Respondent violated Rule 1.4(b) when respondent failed to counsel Michael regarding respondent\u2019s opinion that Michael would be released following the revocation hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Rule 1.3 Diligence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">12. Respondent violated Rule 1.3 when respondent failed to 1) meet with his client; 2) to appear at his client\u2019s August 16,1999 parole revocation hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">Rule 8.1(b) Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">13. In failing to respond to the inquiries of Bar Counsel dated December 14, 1999; January 12, 2000; and January 24, 2000, respondent knowingly failed to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority in violation of Rule 8.1(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">Rule 8.4 Misconduct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">14. Respondent engaged in conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4 by failing to appear at Michael Windsor\u2019s parole revocation hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">Respondent\u2019s Motion to Dismiss</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\">At the close of the evidentiary hearing, respondent argued that the charges against him should be dismissed for the reason that he had requested a postponement of the proceedings before the Inquiry Panel to obtain substitute counsel, but was denied. Bar Counsel argued that the Circuit Court did not have the authority to grant the relief requested. No testimony was taken on the motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-12\">This court has concluded that it does not have jurisdiction to entertain respondent\u2019s motion for two reasons. First, Rule 16-710 governing hearings specifically provides at section \u2018b\u2019 that hearings of charges shall not be challenged \u2018by reason of any procedural defects alleged to have occurred prior to the filing of charges.\u2019 Although respondent has couched his argument as one of Constitutional dimension, it is more appropriately considered, if considered at all, as a pre-charge procedural defect not cognizable in this forum. Second, the Court of Appeals\u2019 charge to this court under Rule 16-709 pertains specifically to the \u2018charges contained in the pleadings attached hereto\u2019 and no motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>dismiss was filed by the respondent or attached to the Court of Appeals\u2019 order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">For these reasons, the court has given no consideration to the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Both parties filed exceptions to the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law set forth by the hearing judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">This Court has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney disciplinary proceedings. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 73, 753 A.2d 17, 26 (2000). Factual findings of the hearing judge will not be disturbed if they are based on clear and convincing evidence. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Jaseb, </em>364 Md. 464, 475, 773 A.2d 516, 522 (2001); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Fezell, </em>361 Md. 234, 253, 760 A.2d 1108, 1118 (2000). The hearing judge may \u201cpick and choose which evidence to rely upon.\u201d <em>Fezell, </em>361 Md. at 253, 760 A.2d at 1118. We make an independent review of the record to determine whether the findings of the hearing judge are based on clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">We shall first address respondent\u2019s exceptions. Respondent excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in both the Hartley matter and the Windsor matter. In the Hartley matter, he excepts to the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-11\">\u201cthat Ms. Hartley was prepared to pay respondent on August 18, 1999; that when Ms. Hartley called respondent, he told her it was too soon to discuss Terrelle\u2019s case; that Ms. Hartley attempted to call respondent repeatedly and was unable to reach him; that respondent never communicated to Ms. Hartley that he would withdraw his representation of Terrelle and she never told him she wanted him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>withdraw his appearance; that respondent failed to return Ms. Hartley\u2019s telephone calls after the August 18, 1999 hearing; and that respondent failed to substantively communicate with Ms. Hartley regarding Terrelle\u2019s case from July 2, 1999 to September 17,1999.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">In the Windsor matter, he excepts to the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">\u201cthat respondent was retained to meet with Michael at the correctional facility and to represent him at the revocation hearing; that Michael learned of his hearing date from the correctional authorities; that respondent did not communicate the August 16, 1999 date to Michael and he did not communicate to Michael he had arranged the hearing until after the complaint was filed; that respondent did not inform Michael that he would not be present at the hearing; and that respondent did not communicate to Michael his opinion that Michael would be released after the hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Respondent argues the hearing judge should have accepted his version of the events and rejected the testimony of Ms. Hartley and the Windsors. He maintains that Ms. Hartley \u201ccould not distinctly remember relevant facts, nor could she precisely narrate the details thereof.\u201d In sum, his position is that Ms. Hartley was not credible. In the Windsor matter, respondent\u2019s argument is essentially the same \u2014 that the hearing judge should have believed his version of the events and not that of the Windsors.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Judge Allison held an evidentiary hearing on April 9, 2001, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Glenn Grossman represented Bar Counsel and respondent appeared <em>pro se. </em>Master Richard Gilbert, Mary Windsor, Michael Windsor, Joyce Hartley and respondent testified at the hearing. As is often the case, the primary issue was credibility. It is clear from the findings and conclusions of Judge Allison that she accepted the testimony presented by Bar Counsel and rejected respondent\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Based upon an independent review of the record, we must determine whether the findings of the hearing judge are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>based on clear and convincing evidence. <em>Jaseb, </em>364 Md. at 475, 773 A.2d at 522. Judge Allison heard the witnesses testify and chose to believe the testimony of witnesses other than respondent. The hearing judge is in the best position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and to decide which one to believe and, as we have said, to pick and choose which evidence to rely upon. The judge was free to disregard the testimony of respondent if the judge believed the evidence was not credible. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kerpelman, </em>288 Md. 341, 363, 420 A.2d 940, 950 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 970, 101 S.Ct. 1492, 67 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The witnesses\u2019 testimony relied upon by the hearing judge was not so contradictory or inherently incredible to require a conclusion, as respondent argues, that they were unworthy of belief. We find that clear and convincing evidence exists to support Judge Allison\u2019s findings. Respondent\u2019s exceptions are without merit and accordingly, are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">We turn now to Bar Counsel\u2019s exceptions. Bar Counsel excepts to Judge Allison\u2019s failure to find that respondent violated MRPC 1.5 in connection with his representation of Michael Windsor. Bar Counsel did charge respondent with a violation of MRPC 1.5 in the Windsor matter, and argued that respondent\u2019s conduct constituted a violation of the Rule. The hearing judge made no finding in her report with respect to that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The sole argument Bar Counsel presents before this Court is that because respondent substantively failed to represent his client, and in light of the violations found by Judge Allison to have occurred, respondent\u2019s fee was more than unreasonable; it was unconscionable. Respondent argues that in charging a total fee of $1000.00, he charged a fair fee and that he \u201csucceeded heroically\u201d for Mr. Windsor.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">MRPC 1.5 provides that a lawyers fee must be reasonable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Rule provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>\u201c(a) A lawyer\u2019s fee shall be reasonable. The factors to be considered as guides in determining the reasonableness of a fee include the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-4\">(1) The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>(2) The likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\">(3) The fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">(4) The amount involved and the results obtained;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">(5) The time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">(6) The nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">(7) The experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">(8) Whether the fee is fixed or contingent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">The rule sets forth a nonexclusive list of factors to be considered in determining whether a fee meets the test of \u201cunreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">At the hearing before Judge Allison, respondent maintained that the $1000.00 fee he received from Mary Windsor was merely to get a parole hearing date scheduled for Michael. Bar Counsel maintained, and the hearing judge so found, that Ms. Windsor paid respondent the $1000.00 as a flat fee to represent Michael and to meet with him at the correctional facility in Maryland, to obtain a date for Michael\u2019s revocation hearing, and to represent Michael at the hearing. Based on the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, it is clear that the judge concluded that respondent provided little to none of the promised services, and that he, at most, made a few phone calls to get a parole hearing date scheduled. A determination of unreasonableness ordinarily requires a factual hearing and findings of fact. <em>See Med. Mut. Liab. Ins. Soc\u2019y v. Evans, </em>330 Md. 1, 32, 622 A.2d 103, 118 (1993). In the instant case, however, it is immaterial that the hearing judge did not determine if the actual fee charged by respondent was unreasonable in light of the factors set out in MRPC 1.5, because she found respondent performed minimal work for the client and failed to perform as promised.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number> In reality, Bar Counsel is arguing that the fee in the Windsor matter was <em>unearned. </em>Courts do not attempt to draw a bright line as to what constitutes a reasonable attorney fee, nor are courts in the practice of setting attorney fees. Nonetheless, this Court <em>is </em>required to protect the public from lawyer misconduct. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hines, </em>366 Md. 277, 293, 783 A.2d 656, 665 (2001); <em>In re Dorothy, </em>605 N.W.2d 493, 498 (S.D.2000) (stating that because the court is required to protect the public from lawyer misconduct, the issue of attorney fees warrants serious discussion). A fee charged for which little or no work was performed is an unreasonable fee. <em>See In re O\u2019Brien, </em>130 N.M. 643, 29 P.3d 1044, 1048 (2001) (stating that \u201cany fee is excessive when absolutely no services are provided\u201d); <em>In re Martinez, </em>108 N.M. 252, 771 P.2d 185, 188 (1989)(noting that even though the fees charged by an attorney would be more than modest for the agreed upon services had the attorney actually performed them, when an attorney takes even a minimal fee from a client and does little or no work on the client\u2019s case, that fee is excessive); <em>People v. Nutt, </em>696 P.2d 242, 246-47 (Colo.1984) (finding a fee excessive where an attorney billed a client for work not done or work unrelated to the client\u2019s case).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Dietz, </em>331 Md. 637, 629 A.2d 678 (1993), the hearing judge found, and this Court agreed, that Dietz violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.16(b), violations similar to the violations committed by respondent in the instant case. Bar Counsel excepted to the failure of hearing judge to find that Dietz violated MRPC 1.5. In that case, Bar Counsel did not contend that the fee, as initially set, was unreasonable. Bar Counsel argued only that Dietz\u2019s other violations<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> made it unreasonable for him to retain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>$500.00 paid to him. This Court agreed with Bar Counsel and held that the entire fee became excessive. <em>Id. </em>at 647, 629 A.2d at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Respondent violated MRPC 1.1,1.3,1.4, 8.1(b), and 8.4. Although the fee may have been reasonable for the services that Judge Allison found were to be provided, respondent did little or no work for Mr. Windsor. Accordingly, we hold that the hearing judge was clearly erroneous in failing' to find respondent charged an unreasonable fee in violation of MRPC 1.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Having determined that respondent has violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 8.1(b), and 8.4, we turn to the sanction. Bar Counsel recommends respondent be disbarred. Respondent suggests a public reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">It is well settled that the purpose of disciplinary proceedings against an attorney for violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct is to protect the public, to preserve public confidence in the legal profession, and to deter members of the Bar from acting in a similar fashion. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Jaseb, </em>364 Md. 464, 480-81, 773 A.2d 516, 525 (2001). It is not to punish the lawyer or to provide a basis upon which to impose civil liability. <em>See Post v. Bregman, </em>349 Md. 142, 168, 707 A.2d 806, 819 (1998) (stating that disciplinary rules are not designed to be a basis for civil liability); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kent, </em>337 Md. 361, 384, 653 A.2d 909, 921 (1995); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kolodner, </em>316 Md. 203, 208, 557 A.2d 1332, 1334 (1989). We have stated that \u201cthe public is protected when sanctions are imposed that are commensurate with the nature and gravity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>the violations and the intent with which they were committed.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997). The appropriate sanction to be imposed depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Myers, </em>333 Md. 440, 447, 635 A.2d 1315, 1318 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">As stated above, Bar Counsel recommends disbarment. Citing Standard 9.22(g) of the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> ABA/BNA Lawyer\u2019s Manual on Professional Conduct, No. 119, at 1:838 (1992), in support of its recommendation, Bar Counsel contends that disbarment is appropriate because \u201crespondent\u2019s attitude that his actions were fair and ethical in the face of the clear and convincing evidence against him constrains the petitioner to seek the sanction herein.\u201d In determining the appropriate sanction, evidence of remorse has been considered a mitigating factor, and lack of remorse as an aggravating factor. In this case, however, respondent\u2019s exceptions were based on his version of the facts, which were rejected by the hearing judge. The mere filing of the exceptions in the exercise of an attorney\u2019s right under the Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Rules does not equate to lack of remorse. Nor does it support a finding that the attorney does not acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct. As we said in the context of a criminal case, \u201cit is improper to conclude that a decision ... not to plead guilty ... is a factor which ought to, in any way, influence the sentencing judge to the detriment of the accused.\u201d <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>274 Md. 536, 542-43, 336 A.2d 113, 116 (1975). A similar rationale applies in the context of attorney discipline matters. We will not consider the fact that an attorney exercised his or her right to file exceptions under the Maryland Rules as an aggravating factor in imposing a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Bar Counsel also points out, appropriately, that respondent has a prior reprimand issued by the Review Board on March 9, 2000 for violation of MRPC 1.15(a) and 8.1(b), Maryland Rules 16-603 and 16-604, and Maryland Code (1957, 2000 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.) \u00a7 10-306 of the Business and Occupations and Professions Article. Prior disciplinary actions against an attorney are an appropriate consideration in arriving at an appropriate sanction. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Myers, </em>333 Md. 440, 447, 635 A.2d 1315, 1318 (1994). In fashioning an appropriate sanction, we shall take into consideration the prior reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Having found that the respondent violated MRPC 1.1,1.3,1.4,1.5, 8.1(b), and 8.4, it is now the duty of this Court to assess an appropriate sanction. In this analysis, we examine the nature of the misconduct, the lawyer\u2019s state of mind which underlies the misconduct, actual or potential injury flowing from the misconduct, the duty of this Court to preserve the integrity of the profession, the risk to the public in allowing the respondent to continue in practice, and any mitigating or aggravating factors. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 484, 671 A.2d 463, 480 (1996). The public interest is served when this Court imposes a sanction that demonstrates to members of the legal profession the type of conduct that will not be tolerated. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bridges, </em>360 Md. 489, 516, 759 A.2d 233, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>247-48 (2000) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brown, </em>353 Md. 271, 295, 725 A.2d 1069, 1080 (1999)). The severity of the sanction imposed depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Dechowitz, </em>358 Md. 184, 192, 747 A.2d 657, 661 (2000). We also consider sanctions this Court previously imposed in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">We recently reiterated, in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hayes, </em>367 Md. 504, 789 A.2d 119, 2002 Md. Lexis 8, at *1 (2002), the guiding principles this Court applies when considering whether disbarment is the appropriate sanction. We stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">\u201cStandard 5.11 of the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1986), provides that: Disbarment is generally appropriate when: (a) a lawyer engages in serious criminal conduct a necessary element of which includes intentional interference with the administration of justice, false swearing, misrepresentation, fraud, extortion, misappropriation, or theft; or the sale, distribution or importation of controlled substances; or the intentional killing of another; or an attempt or conspiracy or solicitation of another to commit any of these offenses; or (b) a lawyer engages in any other intentional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation that seriously adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABO\"><em>Hayes, </em>367 Md. 504, 789 A.2d at 124, 2002 Md. Lexis 8, at *11 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Considering all the facts, circumstances, and our recent decisions involving similar offenses, we conclude that an indefinite suspension rather than disbarment is more appropriate. Fortunately, neither client was seriously or permanently harmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">We believe that the appropriate sanction is an indefinite suspension with the right to apply for reinstatement after the expiration of 180 days and the requirement that, as a condition of his reinstatement, respondent repay to Ms. Windsor the fee charged in that matter. In light of the violations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>committed by respondent in that matter, this Court has the discretion to' order repayment of the fee as a condition of reinstatement. <em>See Florida Bar v. Carlon, </em>\u2014 So.2d -, -. 2001 WL 1166349, at *7, Fla. Lexis 1925, at *22 (Fla. 2001); <em>Florida Bar v. Della-Donna, </em>, 583 So.2d 307, 311 (Fla.1989) (holding that in disciplinary pi*oceedings, restitution can be tied to reinstatement or readmission to the practice of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. David, </em>331 Md. 317, 628 A.2d 178 (1993), the attorney\u2019s representation of four clients was marked by serious neglect and inattention. The attorney\u2019s conduct was remarkably similar to the respondent\u2019s conduct in the instant matter. Attorney David failed to return a fee which was unearned for a period of nine months; he failed to timely remit funds he received on behalf of a client; he failed to communicate with his clients; and he failed to respond to Bar Counsel. We suspended the attorney indefinitely from the practice of law, with the right to apply for reinstatement after six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 753 A.2d 17 (2000), the attorney violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 5.1, 5.3, and 8.4. by failing to: appear in court, communicate with his client, file appropriate motions, manage his office staff properly, and properly subpoena witnesses and obtain records. This Court imposed an indefinite suspension, with the right to apply for reinstatement after ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Cohen, </em>361 Md. 161, 760 A.2d 706 (2000), respondent violated MRPC 1.1,1.3,1.4, 8.1(a), and 8.4(c) and (d). We imposed an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply in six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Alison, </em>349 Md. 623, 709 A.2d 1212 (1998), we also imposed an indefinite suspension upon an attorney who committed misconduct under MRPC 8.4(d) and, like respondent, did not respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s investigatory requests in violation of MRPC 8.1(b). In that opinion, we noted that Alison previously had been suspended by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Finally, in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Hallmon, </em>343 Md. 390, 681 A.2d 510 (1996), we suspended the attorney for violating MRPC 8.1(b), as well as assisting in the unauthorized practice of law in violation of MRPC 5.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">In the case before this Court, respondent was not charged with violating MRPC 8.4(c). As in <em>Hayes, </em>there is neither a finding that the respondent violated a disciplinary rule necessarily implicating his honesty or integrity, nor a finding by the hearing judge that the respondent\u2019s actions were taken with a dishonest or fraudulent intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">It is hereby ordered that:</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">1.

MRPC 1.5 replaced DR 2-106 in 1986. Although the language is somewhat different, the focus of MRPC 1.5 is still on excessive fees. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Eisenstein, </em>333 Md. 464, 482, 635 A.2d 1327, 1336 (1994)(stating that \"[t]he focus of MRPC 1.5 is clearly upon excessive fees\u201d).
