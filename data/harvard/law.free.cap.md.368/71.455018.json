At the time of initiation of the condemnation action, the Property was owned by J.L. Matthews, Inc., Petitioner, which recently had obtained the requisite approvals and permits from Montgomery County to develop eight townhouses on the Property. After filing the complaint for condemnation, Respondent filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, and later a motion for a preliminary injunction, to prevent Petitioner \u201cfrom carrying out construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>activity on the property\u201d until the case was tried. The Circuit Court granted each motion on 17 March 2000 and 27 March 2000, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">In its answer, filed on 6 April 2000, Petitioner argued that the issuance of the temporary restraining order and the preliminary injunction prevented the construction and marketing of the eight townhouses on the Property, and sought $200,000 in injunction damages in excess of any fair market value condemnation award. In response, the Commission filed two motions <em>in limine </em>requesting that Petitioner be prohibited from presenting certain evidence relating to the injunctions. On 12 June 2000, the first day of the condemnation trial, the Circuit Court granted Respondent\u2019s motions <em>in limine. </em>As to the first motion, the court prohibited Petitioner from presenting evidence of \u201clost profits, costs, and expenses ... being requested over and above the ... fair market value of the property at th[e] time [of the proceeding].\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the second ruling, the court \u201cpreclude[d] any evidence ... with respect to any damages suffered by [Petitioner] as a result of the preliminary injunction.\u201d In addition, the Circuit Court granted Respondent\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the question of public necessity. Following the trial, the jury inquisition awarded Petitioner $320,000 as just compensation for the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">On 12 July 2000, Petitioner filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Pertinent to this case, Petitioner specifically challenged the Circuit Court\u2019s orders granting Respondent\u2019s motions for injunctive relief and its ruling precluding Petitioner from offering certain damages evidence in the condemnation trial. In an unreported decision, the Court of Special Appeals found no abuse of discretion and affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. According to the Court of Special Appeals, the Circuit Court acted within its discretion in granting the injunction and, similarly, did not err in excluding Petitioner\u2019s proposed evidence of the impact of the injunctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>on fair market value at trial. We granted Petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, <em>J.L. Matthews, Inc. v. Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park and Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>365 Md. 472, 781 A.2d 778 (2001), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">I. Whether the Circuit Court erred in granting the Commission\u2019s requests for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction prohibiting J.L. Matthews, Inc., from developing its property prior to the condemnation trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">II. Whether the Circuit Court erred in granting the Commission\u2019s second motion <em>in limine </em>excluding evidence of damages incurred by J.L. Matthews, Inc., as a result of the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">\n<em>A. Relevant Factual Record</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">In 1990, Petitioner, J.L. Matthews, Inc.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> purchased a 29,238 square foot parcel of land containing a single family home, located at the intersection of Orchard Avenue and Sligo Mill Road in the then Prince George\u2019s County portion of the City of Takoma Park (\u201cthe City\u201d). At the time, the City was divided between Montgomery County and Prince George\u2019s County. After the purchase, Petitioner \u201cpursued the requisite development approvals from\u201d Respondent (a bi-county governmental entity serving Prince George\u2019s and Montgomery Counties) and Prince George\u2019s County to develop and construct eight townhouses on the Property. In 1994, Petitioner obtained those approvals, but put the development on hold because the housing market was \u201cin a slight slump at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">In 1997, Petitioner was \u201cready to pull [its] building permit and begin construction.\u201d On 1 July 1997, however, the City became unified under the jurisdiction of Montgomery County. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>As a result, the portion of the City in which the Property was located became part of Montgomery County.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner, therefore, had to undergo another development review and permit approval process in Montgomery County in order to proceed with its construction plans.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This included, in part, \u201cgetting exceptions to comply with Montgomery County setbacks,\u201d \u201cgoing through a re-subdivision process to divide ... one site into two lots,\u201d and submitting a landscape plan.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADB\">On 22 July 1999, Respondent\u2019s Montgomery County Planning Board approved Petitioner\u2019s preliminary plan of subdivision for the Property. Following that approval, Petitioner obtained sewer connection approvals from the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission and paid the necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>sewer connection fees for the proposed townhouses. Then, in September 1999, Mr. William Gries, a land acquisition specialist for Respondent, contacted Petitioner and informed it that Respondent \u201chad an interest in acquiring [the Property]\u201d for development of a neighborhood park and that Respondent was having the Property appraised.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Two months later, on 14 December 1999, Mr. Gries sent a letter to Petitioner offering $802,250 for the Property, reflecting \u201cthe average of [Respondent\u2019s] two appraisal reports, less an amount for the estimated demolition costs associated with the old improvement on the property.\u201d The letter indicated that \u201cfunds w[ould] not be available to complete this acquisition until after July 1, 1999,\u201d but that Respondent was \u201cprepared to enter a Land Purchase Contract ... to establish! ] a settlement date no later than July 31, 2000.\u201d Petitioner, on 5 January 2000, declined Respondent\u2019s offer, citing its \u201cinitial costs\u201d in obtaining permits first in Prince George\u2019s County and later in Montgomery County and its \u201cexpected profit from the project of about 10% over and above the value of the land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">On 4 February 2000, Mr. Gries sent another letter to Petitioner \u201cincreasing [the] original ... offer of $302,250 to $337,700,\u201d and advising Petitioner that if it did not accept the offer by February 10th, he would \u201creport to the Montgomery County Planning Board\u201d and would \u201cask the Board to decide whether or not it wants to use its eminent domain authority to acquire t[he][P]roperty.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Petitioner declined that offer as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>well and informed Mr. Gries that it had applied for a building permit for the Property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">On 10 February 2000, after Petitioner declined Respondent\u2019s second offer, the Montgomery County Planning Board of the Commission, in a closed executive session, voted to declare the Property \u201ca desirable property for the purpose of extending the Orchard Avenue Local park ...[,] approved the staff recommendation to proceed with condemnation to acquire the property, and authorized staff to continue negotiations, authorizing up to a maximum of $350,000.00.\u201d Despite the increased authorized acquisition price, however, Mr. Gries made no further offers to Petitioner following the closed session.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Two weeks later, on 24 February 2000, Petitioner applied for and was issued a building permit for the Property by the Montgomery County Department of Permitting Services. Af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>ter obtaining the permit, Petitioner began \u201cto comply with the requirements to build,\u201d including trenching the land and erecting silt fencing, having gravel delivered, and communicating with its excavator and its \u201cconcrete foundation people.\u201d While this was on-going, in March 2000, the Montgomery County Planning Board published its Draft Takoma Park Master Plan, in which it recommended the \u201cacquisition of the Property for a future playground, basketball court, and neighborhood gathering space in the Pinecrest area of Takoma Park.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\n<em>B. Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">On 15 March 2000, Respondent filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for condemnation of the Property. Respondent next filed on 17 March 2000 a motion for temporary restraining order or, in the alternative, motion for preliminary injunction. In that motion, Respondent sought to \u201cprevent [Petitioner] from carrying out construction activity on the Property.\u201d According to Respondent, if Petitioner were allowed to continue with the construction activity, it would \u201cdestroy the existing trees and vegetation on the site\u201d and might require Respondent to \u201cexpend additional public funds to reimburse [Petitioner] for the increased fair market value of the Property, ... [to] remove any improvements constructed, or to replace any vegetation cleared.\u201d If Respondent were \u201crequired to expend additional public funds,\u201d it maintained that it would not \u201cbe able to devote those additional funds to acquire and/or develop other parkland within the County for the citizens of Montgomery County.\u201d On 17 March 2000, the Circuit Court granted Respondent\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order and enjoined Petitioner \u201cfrom carrying out any construction activity, including clearing, grading or construction of any kind, on the Property\u201d for a 10 day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">On 27 March 2000, a hearing was held in the Circuit Court on Respondent\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction. At that hearing, Respondent maintained that the circumstances of this case met the four factors commonly applied in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>whether an injunction should issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Additionally, Respondent argued, \u201c[t]he fact that the Commission does not have ... quick take authority in fact is what makes it so imperative that [itj obtain a preliminary injunction....\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Petitioner, on the other hand, argued that \u201cfiling a condemnation affords no rights in any way superior to the property owner,\u201d and maintained the court should protect Petitioner\u2019s \u201cconstitutional property right\u201d by not issuing the injunction. At the close of the argument, the trial judge explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-4\">Lwjhat appears to me to be at the crux of the issue is that if [Petitioner] were permitted to go forward with the construction, in essence the site would no longer be available to [Respondent].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">And that to me does constitute irreparable injury to the plaintiff, because the site, by virtue of the proposed construction and the additional building, I do believe based upon the evidence that I have heard, would result in significant additional cost to [Respondent] and then would, therefore, result in this site becoming unavailable for its intended use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Based on these findings, the Circuit Court granted Respondent\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction and enjoined Petitioner from \u201ccarrying out any construction activity, including the clearing, grading or construction of any kind on the Property ... until such time as there is a final judgment entered\u201d in the condemnation suit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">In its answer filed on 6 April 2000, Petitioner argued that the issuance of the \u2022 temporary restraining order and the preliminary injunction prevented the construction and marketing of the eight townhouses on the Property, and sought $200,000 in damages in excess of any condemnation award \u201cfor injunction damage and harm over and above any award for the land taken.\u201d Following Petitioner\u2019s answer and request for damages, Respondent filed a motion <em>in limine </em>asking the court both to prohibit Petitioner from presenting evidence of \u201clost profits\u201d and to issue an order directing Petitioner not to introduce evidence of Petitioner\u2019s \u201ccost and expenses associated with obtaining regulatory approvals.\u201d Petitioner filed a response to that motion arguing that it was entitled to \u201cdamages for the taking ... [and] damage from [Respondent\u2019s] injunction which shut down the . .. real estate development project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">On 1 June 2000, Respondent filed a motion to strike or, in the alternative, second motion <em>in limine, </em>requesting that the court prohibit evidence of Petitioner\u2019s \u201calleged damages as a result of the issuance of the injunction.\u201d Petitioner again filed an opposition maintaining that in condemnation proceedings \u201cthe [c]ourt has the power ... to see that all issues bearing on the issue of just compensation are preserved and presented to the jury for determination.\u201d Finally, on 3 June 2000, Respondent filed a motion for partial summary judgment as to the question of \u201cpublic necessity.\u201d Petitioner opposed that motion as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>At the start of the trial on 12 June 2000, the trial judge heard arguments on both motions <em>in limine </em>and on the motion for partial summary judgment. The judge granted Respondent\u2019s first motion <em>in limine, </em>precluding \u201cadditional evidence with respect to lost profits, costs, and expenses that are being requested over and above ... the fair market value of the property at this time,\u201d and granted Respondent\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of public necessity. Of consequence to our consideration of this case, the judge also granted Respondent\u2019s second motion <em>in limine, </em>stating, \u201c[a]ll right, I am going to grant the second motion <em>in limine </em>as well and preclude any evidence at this proceeding with respect to any damages suffered by the defendant [(Petitioner)] as a result of the preliminary injunction.\u201d After three days of trial on the fair market value of the Property, the jury returned the inquisition, awarding Petitioner $320,000 as just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Petitioner argued the Circuit Court erred in \u201cgranting [Respondent\u2019s] Motion for Injunctive Relief,\u201d \u201cgranting [Respondent\u2019s] Motion for Summary Judgment,\u201d and \u201cprecluding [Petitioner] from offering damage evidence in the condemnation trial and/or the injunction hearing.\u201d Petitioner also maintained the court erred in its \u201cruling on the issue of public necessity for the taking\u201d and in its \u201cruling precluding [Petitioner\u2019s] appraisal and engineering witnesses from testifying in the condemnation trial<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In an unreported decision, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. In so doing, it held that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in granting the injunction and agreed that, \u201c[a]lthough [Petitioner\u2019s] injury was its inability to construct eight townhomes on the property, [Respondent] and the public would have suffered irreparable harm through the clearing, grading, excavation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>removal of existing vegetation, and the possible demolition costs had [Petitioner] not been enjoined.\u201d The court also found that the lower court did not err in granting both of Respondent\u2019s motions <em>in limine, </em>and cited <em>Smith v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., </em>236 Md. 51, 202 A.2d 604 (1964), for the proposition that speculative damages are not appropriate in condemnation actions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Likewise, the Court of Special Appeals concluded \u201cthat the trial court properly granted summary judgment on the issue of public necessity\u201d and determined that \u201cthere was ample evidence before the jury upon which to base an adequate damages award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">On 13 September 2001, we issued a writ of certiorari to consider (1) whether the Circuit Court erred in granting the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, and (2) whether the Circuit Court erred in granting Respondent\u2019s second motion <em>in limine </em>excluding evidence of damages incurred by Petitioner as a result of the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">As a prelude to considering the issues before us, it is useful to revisit some well-settled principles of eminent domain law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>to briefly consider the pertinent statutory elements of condemnation law, and, most importantly, to make clear what is the scope of Respondent\u2019s condemnation authority. This will stand as a point of reference in our later consideration of the trial court\u2019s grant of the injunction and preclusion of certain evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Eminent domain, in its simplest terms, is the \u201cinherent power of a governmental entity to take privately owned property ... and convert it to public use.... \u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 541 (7th ed.1999). The \u201c \u2018mode and manner of the exercise of the power\u2019 \u201d of eminent domain, however, \u201c \u2018is exclusively vested in the judgment and discretion of the Legislature,\u201d\u2019 <em>Utilities, Inc. of Md. v.

Baltimore City, </em>119 Md. 567, 574, 87 A. 909, 912 (1913)), and is not without its limitations. Article III, \u00a7 40 of the Maryland Constitution, together with the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, limit that power by requiring that the taking of private property by governmental entities \u201cbe for public use and that just compensation be paid.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Utilities, Inc., </em>362 Md. at 45-46, 763 A.2d at 133 (citing <em>Green v.

In addition, many eminent domain statutes also limit the power they bestow on condemning authorities by \u201cproviding] that there be' a \u2018necessity\u2019 for the taking.\u201d <em>Utilities, Inc., </em>362 Md. at 46, 763 A.2d at 133 (citing <em>Green, </em>346 Md. at 72, 695 A.2d at 129).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">As noted at <em>supra </em>note 6, Respondent\u2019s eminent domain power is provided for in Md.Code (1957, 1997 Repl.Vol.), Art. 28, \u00a7 5-105. That section authorizes Respondent to initiate condemnation proceedings to acquire property it has deemed \u201cnecessary\u201d for \u201cparks, parkways, forests, roads, streets, boulevards, or highways, ground or spaces, or for the purposes of recreation\u201d if it fails to reach a purchase agreement with the owner of that property. <em>See </em>Art.. 28, \u00a7 5-105. It also mandates that those condemnation proceedings adhere to Title 12 of the Real Property Article of the Maryland Code.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Because this title contains the statutory scheme applicable to Respondent, we will delineate its requirements within our more general consideration of the condemnation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">In a condemnation case, a jury is responsible for determining the amount of just compensation due to the property owner, while \u201c[i]ssues relating to other possible elements, such as the right to condemn, public purpose, or necessity, are exclusively for the judge.\u201d <em>Utilities, Inc., </em>362 Md. at 48, 763 A.2d at 135. <em>See also Dodson v.

As we explained at <em>supra </em>note 14, \u201cjust compensation\u201d is traditionally equated with \u201cfair market value.\u201d Under \u00a7 12-105(b), \u201cfair market value\u201d is defined as \u201cthe price as of the valuation date for the highest and best use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>of the property which a vendor, willing but not obligated to sell, would accept for the property, and which a purchaser, willing but not obligated to buy, would pay, excluding any increment.\u201d In rendering its inquisition, the jury may consider a number of elements that \u201cinfluence market value,\u201d including, \u201cimprovements on the land,\u201d the \u201csales of comparable lands,\u201d \u201cevidence of reasonable probability of rezoning,\u201d and \u201c \u2018any special features which may enhance [the property\u2019s] marketability....\u2019\u201d <em>Dodson, </em>294 Md. at 495, 451 A.2d at 320 (quoting <em>Brack v.

If a governmental entity has been given \u201cregular\u201d condemnation authority, a taking occurs when the entity \u201cpays the judgment and costs\u201d assessed in the condemnation trial.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u00a7 12-102(2). <em>See also King v.

Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 40A-40C (granting \u201cquick-take\u201d authority, for different purposes, to Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Montgomery County, Cecil County, the State Roads Commission, and the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission); <em>King, </em>298 Md. at 86, 467 A.2d at 1035 (\u201c \u2018Quick-take\u2019 condemnation proceedings are authorized in limited circumstances by \u00a7\u00a7 40A through 40C of Art. Ill of the Constitution of Maryland.\u201d). Under that authority, \u201cthe condemning authority takes possession of the property prior to trial upon payment into court of its estimate of the value of the property taken.\u201d <em>King, </em>298 Md. at 86, 467 A.2d at 1035. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 12-102(1) (\u201c[Pjroperty is deemed to be taken ... [when] the required payment has been made to the defendant or into court, any required security has been given, and the [condemning authority] has taken possession of the property and actually and lawfully appropriated it to [its] public purposes .... \u201d). Hence, although a jury determines the fair market value of the property at trial, it bases its determination on the value of the property on the date of taking, rather than on the date of the trial. <em>See </em>\u00a7 12-103 (\u201c[T]he value of the property sought to be condemned ... shall be determined as of the date of the taking, if taking has occurred.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In addition to the difference between \u201cregular\u201d and \u201cquick-take\u201d condemnation authority as to the date of taking and date of valuation of property, there is a difference affecting a governmental entity\u2019s respective post-condemnation proceeding powers. Specifically, under \u00a7 12-109, entities exercising \u201cregular\u201d condemnation authority \u201cretain[ ] the right to abandon the proceedings up until the actual taking of the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>or 120 days after the entry of judgment, unless an appeal is taken.\u201d <em>Utilities, Inc., </em>362 Md. at 47, 763 A.2d at 134. In contrast, an entity exercising \u201cquick-take\u201d condemnation authority may not abandon a condemnation proceeding after judgment is rendered because it already has taken possession of the property.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See </em>\u00a7 12-109(d) (\u201cNo condemnation proceeding may be abandoned ... [a]fter taking has occurred .... \u201d). Therefore, regardless of the fair market value a jury in a condemnation proceeding places on condemned property, a condemning authority exercising \u201cquick-take\u201d power remains obligated to pay that amount. An authority relying only on its \u201cregular\u201d power, however, may utilize its option to abandon the condemnation and thereby avoid payment of that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Finally, it is important to note that we have \u201cunderscore[d] the principle that condemnation actions are exclusive special statutory actions for the exercise of the eminent domain power.\u201d <em>Utilities, Inc., </em>362 Md. at 49 50, 763 A.2d at 135 (citing <em>Sollins v. Baltimore County, </em>253 Md. 407, 252 A.2d 819 (1969)). Thus, the statutory scheme delineating Respondent\u2019s condemnation authority informs our consideration of the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Appellate review of a trial court ruling on the admissibility of evidence often is said to be based on the standard that such a ruling is \u201cleft to the sound discretion of the trial court,\u201d so that \u201cabsent a showing of abuse of that discretion, its ruling[ ] will not be disturbed on appeal.\u201d <em>Farley v.

State, </em>324 Md. 626, 636-37, 598 A.2d 187, 192 (1991)). Application of that standard, however, depends on whether the trial judge\u2019s ruling under review was based on a discretionary weighing of relevance in relation to other factors or on a pure conclusion of law. When the trial judge\u2019s ruling involves a weighing, we apply the more deferential abuse of discretion standard.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> On the other hand, when the trial judge\u2019s ruling involves a legal question, we review the trial court\u2019s ruling <em>de novo. See Walter v. Gunter, </em>No. 41, 367 Md. 386, 788 A.2d 609, 2002 Md.

The lower court found that the presentation of evidence of what Petitioner could have done, but for the injunction, and how that might have affected fair market value was not permissible in a condemnation trial. Because it was based on the trial judge\u2019s interpretation of the scope of condemnation proceedings, it constituted a legal conclusion. <em>See infra </em>Part III.D. (discussing the propriety of the trial court\u2019s grant of Respondent\u2019s second motion <em>in limine). </em>Therefore, we review the trial court\u2019s ruling <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Likewise, although the decision to issue or not issue injunctive relief obviously implicates a court\u2019s equitable powers, for which an abuse of discretion standard would be applied ordinarily on appellate review of the exercise of that power <em>(see Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Cmty. Assoc., Inc., </em>361 Md. 371, 394, 761 A.2d 899, 911 (2000)), the nature of the underlying cause of action in the present case <footnotemark>19</footnotemark>, the collateral role played by the injunctive relief in the action<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>purely legal question presented by the clash between Petitioner\u2019s constitutionally-grounded rights to just compensation and to make a lawful use of its property and Respondent\u2019s attempted substitution of injunctive relief for its inability to use \u201cquick-take\u201d condemnation authority, lead us to conclude that <em>de novo </em>review is the proper standard to apply to Petitioner\u2019s threshold question.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Petitioner asserts the trial court erred in granting Respondent\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, and that it subsequently erred in granting Respondent\u2019s second motion <em>in limine </em>excluding evidence that the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction affected the fair market value of the Property as of the trial. According to Petitioner, the injunctive relief obtained by Respondent \u201cfroze the value of the subject property\u201d prior to the date of trial and therefore, \u201cconflict[ed] with the statutory scheme adopted by the General Assembly\u201d which grants Respondent only \u201cregular\u201d condemnation authority. Although Petitioner acknowledges that injunctive relief may be appropriate in some circumstances in a condemnation matter, it maintains that \u201cit [i]s not appropriate in this case where the primary purpose was to preserve the physical condition of the property and freeze the fair market value of the land to avoid additional expense.\u201d Likewise, Petitioner also argues that by \u201cgranting the motion <em>in limine,\u201d </em>the lower court denied it \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>right to present testimony as to what the fair market value of the ... [PJroperty would have been on the date of trial, the statutorily prescribed valuation date.\u201d Petitioner contends that it was denied its constitutional right to just compensation for the taking of the Property by the \u201cmanipulation of] the valuation date via injunctive relief\u2019 and the \u201cexclu[sion of] evidence it incurred as a result thereof.\u201d Therefore, Petitioner urges' us to reverse the judgments of the courts below.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Respondent, on the other hand, maintains that it \u201chad full authority under the Maryland Rules\u201d to seek an injunction in this case. It also argues the record below provides \u201cample evidence to demonstrate\u201d that Petitioner\u2019s intended actions would constitute \u201c \u2018destruction, misuse, or alienation\u2019 \u201d of the land justifying a preliminary injunction under <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Nash, </em>284 Md. 376, 396 A.2d 538 (1979).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Regarding the preclusion of evidence, Respondent contends that the motion <em>in limine </em>\u201conly precluded evidence related to damages arising out of the injunctions, and did not limit evidence with respect to fair market value.\u201d (Emphasis omitted). According to Respondent, Petitioner \u201csimply failed to present this testimony at trial,\u201d and hence, should not be able to \u201cuse this separate measure of damages to compensate for [its] failure to produce expert testimony with respect to valuation at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">We agree with Petitioner that the Circuit Court erred in granting the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. We also agree that the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of Respondent\u2019s second motion <em>in limine </em>wrongfully precluded Petitioner from presenting evidence that may have affected the jury\u2019s assessment of the fair market value of the land at the time of trial. Therefore, we reverse the judgments of the Court of Special Appeals and the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Prior to commencement of the condemnation trial in this case, the Circuit Court granted Respondent\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order, and later for a preliminary injunction, prohibiting Petitioner \u201cfrom carrying out any construction activity ... on the Property.\u201d The injunction expired by operation of its facial terms on 15 June 2000, the day final judgment was entered on Respondent\u2019s complaint for condemnation. Because the injunction expired well prior' to this case coming before us, the. propriety of the injunction ordinarily would be a moot issue. <em>See Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Levitsky, </em>353 Md. 188, 200, 725 A.2d 1027, 1033 (1999) (\u201cA question is moot \u2018if, at the time it is before the court, there is no longer an existing controversy between the parties, so that there is no longer any effective remedy which the court can provide.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Attorney Gen. v.

In this case, Respondent maintains that because it does not have \u201cquick-take\u201d authority, it is entitled to injunctions prior to condemnation proceedings to \u201cprotect the <em>status qvio </em>of real estate.\u201d Respondent relies on <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Nash, </em>284 Md. 376, 396 A.2d 538 (1979), to support that contention and to support the grant of the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction under the facts and circumstances of this case. Respondent\u2019s arguments necessitate that we consider and comment again on the use of injunctions by condemning authorities lacking \u201cquick-take\u201d power.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Recent history indicates that condemning authorities interested in obtaining \u201cquick-take\u201d authority consistently have been denied that objective by the voters.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Because of these failed attempts, there may be a lingering appetite among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>condemning authorities lacking \u201cquick-take\u201d power to seek injunctions as a substitute, as Respondent did here. Thus, it is \u201cimperative and manifest\u201d that we review the propriety of the injunctions here in order to offer some guidance to other condemning authorities how to operate within the breadth of their \u201cregular\u201d authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Respondent, at trial, maintained that the lower court\u2019s determination whether to issue the preliminary injunction should be based on four traditional factors often applied in determining whether an interlocutory injunction is appropriate. <em>See supra </em>note 8 (listing the factors of the likelihood that the plaintiff will succeed on the merits, the \u201cbalance of convenience,\u201d whether the plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction is granted, and the public interest). Our decision in <em>Nash, </em>however, made clear that a court should not rely solely on those factors in cases where a condemning authority seeks injunctive relief to prevent a property owner from developing his, her, or its property prior to a condemnation trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">In <em>Nash, </em>the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (\u201cthe WSSC\u201d) initiated condemnation proceedings to obtain a privately-owned tract of land on which it planned to build a sludge composting facility. Prior to the WSSC filing the petition for condemnation, however, the property owner contracted with a third party for the removal and sale of the standing timber on the property. Upon filing its petition, the WSSC did not \u201cattempt to take the property immediately through a \u2018quick take\u2019 procedure,\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> but sought an injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>to prevent the third party buyer from cutting or removing any of the trees on the land. <em>Nash, </em>284 Md. at 378, 396 A.2d at 539. The Circuit Court refused to grant the injunction and we subsequently affirmed the denial on appeal.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">We first noted that a taking had not occurred, under either \u201cquick-take\u201d or \u201cregular\u201d powers.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>Nash, </em>284 Md. at 380, 396 A.2d at 540. Hence, we explained, the \u201cmere filing of the condemnation petition gave [the WSSC] no rights in the land,\u201d and the property owner \u201cwas still free to use the land, enjoy it or dispose of it as before.\u201d <em>Nash, </em>284 Md. at 381, 396 A.2d at 541. In our view, imposing the injunctive relief would have caused Nash and the third party buyer to \u201csuffer severe interferences ... [,] tantamount to deprivations of their use and enjoyment of the property,\u201d and would have allowed the WSSC to \u201cobtain [the] substantial rights and benefits it would receive under a \u2018quick take,\u2019 ... without incurring any of the obligation incident to that procedure.\u201d <em>Nash, </em>284 Md. at 382, 396 A.2d at 541. After considering the \u201cprecise scheme for the acquisition of land and interests in land\u201d provided for in the Maryland Constitution, the Maryland Code, the Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Rules of Procedure, and other relevant codes, we also observed that the public and the Legislature \u201cwere especially cautious\u201d that the taking power \u201cbestowed [on the WSSC] be so restricted that the rights of owners thus deprived of their property would be adequately safeguarded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, because the injunction would \u201chave effectively thwarted the carefully devised scheme\u201d for the acquisition of land by the WSSC, we affirmed its denial. <em>Nash, </em>284 Md. at 382-83, 396 A.2d at 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><em>Nash </em>made clear that in a \u201cregular\u201d condemnation proceeding, a property owner is free to use his or her land in any lawful manner prior to a condemning authority\u2019s taking of the land and that, therefore, an injunction to the contrary ordinarily is inappropriate in such circumstances. In a footnote at the end of the opinion, however, we provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">it does not necessarily follow from our holding on this appeal, which is predicated on the particular circumstances here existent, that injunctive relief would not be available in any case to prevent the destruction, misuse, or alienation of land or an interest therein to the detriment of the condem-nor. Whether such relief would be appropriate is to be determined on a case to case basis upon a balancing of the rights of the condemnor with the rights of the condemnee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZM\"><em>Nash, </em>284 Md. at 383 n. 5, 396 A.2d at 541 n. 5. In <em>Nash, </em>however, the removal of standing timber from a property intended to become a sludge-composting facility failed to meet the standard of \u201cdestruction, misuse, or alienation of land.\u201d The record in the present case must be reviewed against that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">In its argument to the Circuit Court, Respondent pointed to a number of general effects Petitioner\u2019s intended development of the Property could have, including the \u201cdestruction to the trees and vegetation,\u201d increased costs of acquisition due to the \u201ccost of the improvements,\u201d and increased costs due to the \u201ccost of their demolition.\u201d Respondent now maintains that those effects constitute \u201cprecisely the factual circumstances that would justify injunctive relief as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>contemplated in footnote five of <em>Nash.\u201d </em>We disagree. Even if the trial court had applied the conditions discussed in the footnote in <em>Nash </em>in considering the injunction request, instead of erroneously relying on the factors cited by Respondent in granting the injunction, <em>see supra </em>note 8, the factual findings in this case and Respondent\u2019s proof would not qualify for the injunctive relief exception contemplated in <em>Nash.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Specifically, in Respondent\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction, Respondent explained that \u201cif [Petitioner] is not restrained from carrying out construction activity on the Property, the construction activity will destroy the existing trees and vegetation on the site ... [which] will cause the Commission and the citizens of Montgomery County irreparable harm.\u201d At the hearing on Respondent\u2019s request for preliminary injunction, however, Respondent\u2019s witness, Mr. William E. Gries, acknowledged that Respondent did not \u201chave specific plans\u201d regarding the Property and did not know \u201chow many trees on the site, if any, would be preserved if and when the [P]roperty\u201d was developed. Although Mr. Gries indicated that Respondent intended to put \u201ca basketball court,\u201d \u201ca playground ... for the nearby residents,\u201d and \u201can attractive gathering space\u201d on the Property, he admitted there were no plans, beyond \u201cconceptual plans,\u201d regarding where the facilities would be located on the Property. According to Mr. Gries, the \u201c[M]aster [P]lan for Takoma Park,\u201d which recommended the \u201cacquisition of the Property for a future playground, basketball court, and neighborhood gathering space in the Pinecrest area of Takoma Park,\u201d <em>see supra </em>page 82, had not yet \u201cbeen adopted.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Based on the evidence offered by Respondent, we fail to see how, \u201cupon a balancing of the rights\u201d of Respondent with the rights of Petitioner <em>(Nash, </em>284 Md. at 383 n. 5, 396 A.2d at 541 n. 5), Respondent satisfied the threshold standards of the <em>Nash </em>footnote. Petitioner\u2019s right to develop the Property and to just compensation greatly outweighs Respondent\u2019s speculative showing as to its interest in retaining the affected trees and vegetation on the Property. Respondent admittedly had only a \u201cconceptual\u201d plan of \u201cwhat it intends to do with the [Pjroperty,\u201d and that was only in \u201cdraft form.\u201d The terms of the <em>Nash </em>footnote were not designed to protect condemning authorities from the effect of \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d and \u201cmaybes.\u201d Moreover, it is not within the province of the courts to postulate as to the effect Petitioner\u2019s development <em>might </em>have on Respondent\u2019s unsettled plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Curiously, at the' 27 March 2000 hearing on the preliminary injunction request, the trial judge stated that he \u201cwas not persuaded that the loss of trees and the loss of vegetation would be something that would be irreparable.\u201d Yet, in the 27 March order issuing the injunction, the court contradictorily concluded that \u201cthe destruction of the natural vegetation on the Property\u201d constituted an immediate, substantial and irreparable harm. Although we may conceive of circumstances in which the removal of natural vegetation may qualify as the \u201cdestruction, misuse, or alienation of land,\u201d the record of the present case fails to demonstrate the level of extraordinary or exceptional circumstances implied by the <em>Nash </em>footnote.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">As to the alleged increased costs to Respondent which might result from Petitioner\u2019s construction activities on the Property, Respondent, in its motion for preliminary injunction, maintained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">if [Petitioner] is not restrained from carrying out construction activity on the Property, [Respondent] <em>may </em>be required to expend additional public funds to reimburse [Petitioner] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>for the increased fair market value of the Property, and <em>may </em>also be required to expend additional public funds to remove any improvements constructed, or to replace any vegetation cleared, on the Property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">If [Respondent] is required to expend additional public funds [for those costs] ..., Respondent will not be able to devote those additional funds to acquire and/or develop other parkland within the County for the citizens of Montgomery County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">(Emphasis added). At the hearing on the injunction, however, Mr. Gries acknowledged that Respondent did not know \u201cwhat the costs w[ould] be.\u201d In addition, Mr. Gries was also unable to \u201cpoint to\u201d other \u201cspecific parks\u201d that Respondent would \u201cbe precluded from acquiring or developing if it h[ad] to spend some money\u201d on the Property. According to Mr. Gries, the \u201cirreparable and substantive injury or harm\u201d which Respondent would suffer if Petitioner proceeded with its development plans was losing potentially \u201cthe opportunity to provide a park at a location that [Respondent] feel[s] is important for serving th[e] community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Regarding Respondent\u2019s assertion of increased costs, we again are unable to find that the proof in this case rises to the level of the exceptional or extraordinary circumstances intended under the <em>Nash </em>footnote. The unquantified increased acquisition costs that <em>might </em>be incurred by Respondent, attributable to the <em>potentially </em>increased fair market value, the costs of removing any construction Petitioner completed that <em>might </em>be inconsistent with Respondent\u2019s intended park use of the Property, and the costs of replacing vegetation that <em>may </em>be desired in Respondent\u2019s park plans, do not justify holding Respondent\u2019s rights superior to those of Petitioner. The \u201cdestruction, misuse, or alienation of land,\u201d as provided in <em>Nash, </em>contemplates more than a potential increased out-of-pocket expense to a condemning authority. Respondent\u2019s speculative evidence regarding the costs it \u201cmay\u201d incur and monies it \u201cmight\u201d be required to expend falls far short of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>degree of specificity required to come within the <em>Nash </em>footnote.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Additionally, according to Respondent, \u201cthe fact that [it] does not have ... quick-take authority ... is what makes it so imperative that [it] obtain a preliminary injunction\u201d to \u201cprotect the <em>status quo </em>of real estate.\u201d Respondent\u2019s lack of \u201cquick-take\u201d authority,- however, is <em>precisely </em>what mandates that it generally <em>not </em>be granted preliminary injunctions in condemnation cases. A condemning authority is not entitled to utilize injunctive relief as a means of preserving its financial valuation of private property. To permit otherwise in a typical condemnation case, such as the present one, would wholly circumvent the Legislature\u2019s \u201cprecise scheme for the acquisition of land,\u201d <em>Nash, </em>284 Md. at 382, 396 A.2d at 541, which grants Respondent only \u201cregular\u201d condemnation authority.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>See supra </em>note 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In conclusion, <em>Nash </em>provides that a condemning authority with \u201cregular\u201d condemnation power possibly may obtain a temporary restraining order and/or a preliminary injunction in exceptional or extraordinary circumstances to prevent the detrimental \u201cdestruction, misuse, or alienation of land.\u201d The circumstances here do not meet the high bar imposed by the exception outlined in <em>Nash; </em>therefore, the Circuit Court erred in granting the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>D.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Because the impropriety of the long-expired injunctive relief is moot and, therefore, we are not able to fashion direct relief for that error, we shall proceed to consider Petitioner\u2019s second issue, the asserted erroneous grant of Respondent\u2019s second motion <em>in limine. </em>Had the trial judge denied that motion, the prejudicial effect of the improper injunctions would have been mitigated. If we conclude the court erred in granting that motion, it is nonetheless possible to grant Petitioner some relief under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Prior to determining whether the Circuit Court erred, we first must ascertain exactly what evidence the trial judge precluded by his ruling. After hearing arguments on the second motion <em>in limine, </em>the trial judge stated, \u201c[a]ll right, I am going to grant the second motion <em>in limine </em>as well and preclude any evidence at this proceeding with respect to any damages suffered by the defendant [(Petitioner)] as a result of the preliminary injunction.\u201d Respondent maintains this ruling \u201cwent only to the issue of injunctive damages\u201d and \u201cdid NOT limit evidence with respect to fair market value.\u201d Petitioner, on the other hand, makes no such distinction and argues the ruling precluded it from presenting \u201cevidence as to how far [it] would have been in the construction phase,\u201d but for the injunction. According to Petitioner, it should \u201chave been permitted to present evidence of the effect of the improvements (even if incomplete) on the fair market value of the property as of the date of trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Under the trial judge\u2019s ruling, it is clear that Petitioner\u2019s inability to develop the Property during the period between 17 March and 15 June (some 3 months) was a direct \u201cresult of\u2019 the injunction. We find no language in the ruling, however, indicating that such evidence, even though a \u201cresult of\u2019 the injunction, was exempt from the scope of the court\u2019s preclusion. Therefore, we agree with Petitioner that the ruling fairly could be construed, and in fact was taken to mean, that Petitioner was precluded from presenting evidence of what it would have done on the Property, but for the injunction, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>how that development may have influenced the Property\u2019s fair market value at the time of the jury assessment.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Upon holding that the trial judge\u2019s ruling precluded a category of evidence that might bear the fair market value of the Property as affected by the injunction, we now must determine whether the trial court erred in precluding that evidence at trial. For the following reasons, we agree with Petitioner that, to ensure it received just compensation for the Property, it should have been permitted to present such evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">As we explained in <em>supra </em>Part II., until Respondent paid \u201cthe judgment and costs\u201d determined by the jury at trial, Petitioner retained title to the Property, and, as its owner, was permitted to do with the Property whatever it lawfully could. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 12-102(2), 12-108(a). In this case, however, the grant of the temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction prevented Petitioner from exercising that right, specifically from continuing its development of the Property. As a result, the Property\u2019s fair market value was determinable as of the date of the initial injunction (17 March 2000), not the date of trial (15 June 2000). The jury determination of the Property\u2019s fair market value was constrained to the value of the Property as of the date of the initial injunction. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Under both the Maryland Constitution and the United States Constitution, Petitioner is entitled to just compensation for property taken by Respondent. In those circumstances, just compensation is equal to the fair market value of the property and is determined by a jury at the conclusion of the condemnation trial. <em>See supra </em>page 90. By obtaining the injunction in this case, however, Respondent was able to control Petitioner\u2019s lawful action on the Property, and by extension, was able artificially to constrain determination of the fair market value of the Property. Although the jury determination of fair market value was made <em>at </em>trial, it was based on the value of the Property as set by conditions (not agreed to by Petitioner) on a date <em>before </em>trial. That is in direct contravention of Petitioner\u2019s rights and is wholly inconsistent with the scope of Respondent\u2019s condemnation authority-</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">If the injunction had not been granted in this case, the jury\u2019s determination of just compensation for the Property at trial would have included and reflected any development Petitioner had completed on the Property. <em>See Dodson, </em>294 Md. at 495, 451 A.2d at 320 (\u201cThe jury may properly consider various elements that influence market value at the time of the taking in its determination of damages ... [including] improvements on the land ....\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Pumphrey, </em>175 Md. at 506, 2 A.2d at 671-72 (explaining that \u201cin determining the fair market value of the land\u201d the \u201cimprovements thereon [is a] relevant fact[ ] to be weighed and considered\u201d). Petitioner\u2019s right to just compensation in this case, therefore, necessitated that it be permitted to present similar evidence at trial. Respondent should not have been permitted to utilize the effect of the injunction to override Petitioner\u2019s constitutional and statutory right to just compensation for the Property. Therefore, although the injunction prevented Petitioner from proceeding with its development of the Property, it was entitled to produce evidence before the jury of what lawful improvements it would have made on the Property, but for the injunction, and how those improvements may have increased the Property\u2019s fair market value on the date of trial</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>As we explained in <em>supra </em>Part III.C., Respondent has not been accorded \u201cquick-take\u201d condemnation authority in our Constitution, which would permit it to \u201ctake\u201d property prior to establishment of its valuation, <em>see </em>\u00a7 12-102(1), and cannot use an injunction as a surrogate for that power. Our holding here reflects that declaration by counteracting Respondent\u2019s attempt to fix prematurely the fair market value of the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">It is also worth noting that we have adopted a similar rationale in a number of cases concerning the use of amendments to zoning ordinances by governmental entities to depress property value prior to condemnation proceedings.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Mayor of Baltimore v. Kelso Corp., </em>281 Md. 514, 520, 380 A.2d 216, 220 (1977); <em>Carl M. Freeman Assocs., Inc. v. State Roads Comm\u2019n of Md., </em>252 Md. 319, 329-30, 250 A.2d 250, 255 (1969). In those cases, we held that an entity could not \u201cuse zoning to depress land values so as to reduce the damages paid by the sovereign when it otherwise validly invoke[d] its power to condemn.\u201d <em>Kelso Corp., </em>281 Md. at 520, 380 A.2d at 220 (citing <em>Arnold v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>270 Md. 285, 294-95, 311 A.2d 223, 228-29 (1973); <em>Hoyert v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>262 Md. 667, 672-74, 278 A.2d 588, 591-92 (1971); <em>Carl M. Freeman Assocs., Inc., </em>252 Md. at 329-30, 250 A.2d at 255; <em>Krieger v. Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>224 Md. 320, 323-24, 167 A.2d 885, 887 (1961); <em>Cong. Sch. of Aeronautics, Inc. v. State Roads Comm\u2019n of Md., </em>218 Md. 236, 241, 146 A.2d 558, 560 (1958)). \u201c[T]he date of valuation set by statute,\u201d we explained, \u201ccannot be used to deprive a property owner of the just compensation he is entitled to receive under\u201d.the Maryland Constitution. <em>Kelso Corp., </em>281 Md. at 519, 380 A.2d at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>In addition, we also noted that, \u201c[t]he property owner must be protected from prejudicial evidence as to value based on restrictions on the use of his property unconstitutionally impressed as part of a design to freeze or depress its value.\u201d <em>Carl M. Freeman Assocs., Inc., </em>252 Md. at 329-30, 250 A.2d at 255. Therefore, we found a property owner is \u201centitled to show, if it can, the probability that the land would be rezoned within a reasonable time after the condemnation\u201d to a higher value, and \u201cthe effect of such a probability upon the property\u2019s value at the time of taking.\u201d <em>Kelso Corp., </em>281 Md. at 520, 380 A.2d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Our reasoning here follows the analysis set forth in the \u201cdownzoning\u201d cases. As we explained at <em>supra </em>page 108, the injunction prevented Petitioner from doing what it lawfully was entitled to do on the Property through the date of trial. That prohibition thereby may have depressed wrongfully the Property\u2019s value, as potentially would a rezoning classification, compared to what it would have been, but for the injunction. Thus, \u201cin light of the constitutional right of the property owner to receive just compensation for [its] property,\u201d we must confirm Petitioner\u2019s ability to present evidence regarding the fair market value of the Property as affected by the injunction. <em>Carl M. Freeman Assocs., Inc., </em>252 Md. at 329, 250 A.2d at 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the facts of this case do not amount to the extraordinary or exceptional circumstances we contemplated as authorizing an injunction in the footnote in <em>Nash. </em>The Circuit Court, therefore, erred in granting Respondent\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction prior to the condemnation hearing. Similarly, because the injunction in this case hindered Petitioner\u2019s statutory and constitutional right to seek just compensation for its property, we also hold that the Circuit Court erred in prohibiting Petitioner from presenting evidence at trial of what it would have done on the Property, but for the injunction, and how that development may have increased the Property\u2019s fair market value at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE IN PART AND AFFIRM IN PART THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AND TO REMAND THIS CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL AS TO THE AMOUNT OF JUST COMPENSATION; RESPONDENT TO PAY THE COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">RAKER, J., dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-6\">.

Absent such a comparison, it would seem he would have no basis to testify with greater specificity as to the effect of Petitioner\u2019s plans on Respondent's future intentions as to the Property. Apparently Respondent\u2019s plans for the Property were in the \"conceptual,\u201d rather than \"specific,\u201d stage of development. Moreover, Mr. Gries did not identify any specific trees or vegetation that may have been subject to removal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>under Petitioner\u2019s approved plans as being of specimen quality, unique, rare, or otherwise notable examples of their kind.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\">. As noted at <em>supra </em>pages 89-90, Respondent's \u201cregular\u201d condemnation authority mandates that, in all condemnation cases involving Respondent, the fair market value of subject property be assessed by the jury <em>as of the date of trial, </em>and provides that Respondent does not \"take\u201d condemned property until it pays the judgment and costs assessed in the trial. Up until that time, a property owner is free to use the property as he, she, or it normally would, including making improvements and developments on the land. By obtaining an injunction in this case, however, Respondent prevented Petitioner from exercising those rights prior to the condemnation proceeding and, therefore, artificially set the fair market value of the Property as of the date of the injunction. That act is in total contravention of the tenets of established condemnation law. See discussion at <em>infra </em>Part III.D.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b168-6\">. Respondent's argument that Petitioner \"could have\u201d put on such evidence is not persuasive. It is well-established that after the judge\u2019s preclusion of the evidence in question, Petitioner was not required to proffer that evidence at trial. <em>See Reed v. State, </em>353 Md. 628, 637-38, 728 A.2d 195, 200-01 (1999) (\u201c '[W]hen the effect of the ruling [on a motion <em>in </em>limine] is to exclude the evidence, and the trial judge intends that ruling to 'be the final word on the matter, a contemporaneous objection made at the time of the ruling ordinarily preserves the issue for appellate review.'...

In the \"dezoning,\u201d or \"downzoning,\u201d cases, governmental entities rezoned subject property to classifications with substantially lower market values prior to the filing of condemnation actions.

Nash, </em>284 Md. 376, 396 A.2d 538 (1979), a condemning authority with \u201cregular\u201d condemnation power may obtain a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction only under exceptional circumstances, I believe that such circumstances are present in this case. Although preservation of the fair market value of the subject property was not an appropriate justification for granting the preliminary injunction, the removal of the existing trees and vegetation from the proposed park site would have constituted the detrimental \u201cdestruction, misuse, or alienation\u201d of the land for the use for which it was intended. <em>See id. </em>at 383 n. 5, 396 A.2d at 541 n. 5. While removal of standing timber from a property intended to become a sludge-composting facility failed to meet this high standard, the destruction of the natural vegetation on a proposed park and the erection of improvements in its place constitute precisely the type of irreparable harm that would justify injunctive relief as contemplated in <em>Nash. </em>In addition, there is no reason to require, as a condition of obtaining injunctive relief, that the plant specimens removed from the property be \u201cunique, rare, or notable examples of their kind.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>maj. op. at 101-02 n. 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>I also agree with the majority that, in order to ensure that petitioner received just compensation for the property, it should have been permitted to present evidence of what it would have done to the property, absent the injunction, and how that development would have influenced the property\u2019s fair market value at the time of trial, the statutorily prescribed valuation date for determining just compensation for the taking of the property. Where I disagree is with the majority\u2019s contention that, by granting the motion <em>in limine, </em>the lower court denied petitioner the right to present testimony as to what the fair market value of the property, including improvements, would have been at the time of the jury assessment. The motion <em>in limine, </em>by its own terms, only precluded evidence relating to damages <em>resulting from the injunction </em>and did not limit evidence with respect to fair market value. Petitioner simply failed, of its own volition, to present expert testimony with respect to valuation at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Moreover, under our well-established precedent, in order to preserve its objection to the granting of the motion <em>in limine, </em>petitioner was required to make a proffer of the evidence at trial. <em>Prout v. State, </em>311 Md. 348, 356, 535 A.2d 445, 449 (1988), recognizes an exception to this requirement where the trial judge \u201cclearly determin[es] that the questionable evidence will <em>not </em>be admitted, and ... instructfs] counsel not to proffer the evidence again during trial ...\u201d leaving the proponent of the evidence \u201cwith nothing to do at trial but follow the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356, 535 A.2d at 448. That is not what happened in this case. The case <em>sub judice </em>is a perfect example of why the proponent of the disputed evidence must proffer the evidence at trial. If there was a misunderstanding as to the trial court\u2019s ruling, it could have been clarified, and the precise scope of the judge\u2019s ruling would have been clear. Under my reading of the trial court\u2019s ruling, petitioner would have been permitted to offer the evidence. This is not a <em>Prout </em>case, in which the trial court clearly determined that the questionable evidence would not be admitted and instructed petitioner not to offer it. Petitioner simply failed to offer the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>evidence as it was required to do and failed-to preserve the issue for appellate review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> '</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-5\">. The majority also cites <em>Reed v. State, </em>353 Md. 628, 728 A.2d 195 (1999), which affirmed the continuing viability of the contemporary objection rule. <em>Reed </em>is inapposite.
