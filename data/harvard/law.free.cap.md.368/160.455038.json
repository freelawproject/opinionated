The Circuit Court, on 15 December 1999, granted Petitioner\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability, holding that, under Maryland Code (1996 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.), Environment Article, \u00a7 9-276, Respondents were strictly liable as the property owners of the land at the point in time the MDE took its remedial action. Following a trial on a determination of those expenditures, the Circuit Court assessed damages against Respondents in the amount of $ 1,015,299.72, plus court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">On 18 February 2000, Respondents filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals vacated the judgment of the Circuit Court and remanded the case for further proceedings. According to the Court of Special Appeals, Respondents were entitled to assert equitable defenses at trial and, therefore, the Circuit Court erred in granting summary judgment on liability in favor of Petitioner. We granted Petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari and Respondents\u2019 conditional cross-petition, <em>Maryland Dep\u2019t of the Env\u2019t v. Underwood, et al., </em>364 Md. 534, 774 A.2d 408 (2001), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajd\">1. Whether Maryland Code (1996 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.), Environment Article, \u00a7 9-276 imposes strict liability on a property owner for costs incurred by the Maryland Department of the Environment in removing illegally stored or disposed of scrap tires on that person\u2019s property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>2. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding a property owner is entitled to assert equitable defenses on his or her behalf under Maryland Code (1996 RepLVol., 2001 Supp.), Environment Article, \u00a7 9-276.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\n<em>A. Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">On 24 October 1994, Respondents, George Underwood and Carl Breeden, purchased for $6,000 from Ms. Janet Morgan<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the right to redeem approximately 17 acres of land located in Hughesville, Maryland. On 23 May 1995, after foreclosing the equity of redemption, Respondents acquired the property by deed from Charles County, Maryland. Prior to and at the time of their purchase of the property, Respondents were aware that a scrap tire pile, containing an estimated 720,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>tires, was located on the land.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Respondents, however, had no direct contact with Petitioner, the MDE, regarding the scrap tire pile prior to or at the time of their purchase.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Following the purchase, Petitioner sent a letter to Respondents, dated 4 August 1995, informing them that it had \u201cbeen conducting an ongoing investigation in regards to the storage of scrap tires at the Site,\u201d and that, as a \u201ccurrent property owner,\u201d Respondents were \u201cresponsible for the removal of improperly stored scrap tires at th[e] Site.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The letter requested Respondents \u201ccontact the Department to set up a meeting to discuss [their] options for the removal of the scrap tires. ...\u201d It also indicated that Petitioner had \u201cthe authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>to conduct the cleanup\u201d if Respondents did not \u201cintend to proceed with a removal action in the very near future,\u201d and informed Respondents that they would remain liable for all costs associated with that cleanup.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">On 15 August 1995, representatives of Petitioner met with Respondents to determine if Respondents would grant Petitioner access to the property to remove the scrap tires. At that time, Respondents refused to grant Petitioner access because they wanted \u201cto confer with [their] attorney about it.\u201d On 29 September 1995, after receiving no communication from Respondents, Petitioner sent a letter to Respondents informing them that it was filing a complaint \u201cto obtain access to the Site.\u201d The letter also provided that the complaint could \u201cbe resolved by [Respondents] granting the Department access to conduct the necessary removal or remedial action.\u201d Upon receipt of that letter, Respondents, on 2 October 1995, granted Petitioner access to the property \u201cfor the purpose of taking any and all actions necessary for the removal of [the] scrap tires that [we]re stored there,\u201d but did not \u201cadmit liability for the expenses associated with\u201d that removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">After receiving access to the property, Petitioner contracted with the Maryland Environmental Service (\u201cthe MES\u201d) to remove the scrap tires. The MES and its subcontractors completed the scrap tire removal and remediation of the land on or about 10 September 1996. On 21 November 1997, Petitioner sent a letter to Respondents informing them that \u201c[p]ursuant to \u00a7 9-276 of the Environment Article\u201d they were \u201crequired to reimburse the Department for all costs associated with the removal\u201d of the tires.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The letter requested Respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>dents contact Petitioner within fifteen days \u201cto discuss [their] reimbursement plans\u201d for the $1,004,453 expended in the scrap tire cleanup. Respondents refused this request and took no action to reimburse Petitioner for the cleanup costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\n<em>B. Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">On 5 February 1998, Petitioner filed a complaint against Respondents in the Circuit Court for Charles County \u201cseeking recovery of money expended to cleanup and remediate\u201d the scrap tire pile located on Respondents\u2019 property. The complaint alleged that \u201c[a]s [Respondents] are the owners of the Site in question, they are liable,\u201d under \u00a7 9-276, \u201cfor all expenditures including legal fees and costs from the State Used Tire Cleanup and Recycling Fund for the storage, removal and restoration or remedial action of the scrap tires from the Site.\u201d In their answers to Petitioner\u2019s complaint, filed on 1 June 1998 and 23 December 1998, both Respondents denied the claims asserted by Petitioner and demanded a trial by jury. Petitioner, in response to those answers, filed a motion to strike demand for jury trial, maintaining \u201c[t]he relief sought ... is reimbursement, which is equitable in nature and does not give rise to a jury trial.\u201d The Circuit Court struck the jury prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In addition, Respondents, on 20 April 1999, filed a motion for summary judgment arguing they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law because they \u201cdid not cause the tires to be stored\u201d on the property. Petitioner also filed a motion for partial summary judgment maintaining that Respondents, as \u201cthe owners of the site, [we]re liable to [Petitioner] for the costs incurred in the clean up of the scrap tires\u201d under \u00a7 9-276. Therefore, Petitioner argued, it should be \u201cawarded Summary Judgment on the issue of liability as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">On 15 December 1999, the Circuit Court denied Respondents\u2019 motion and granted Petitioner\u2019s motion. In its Opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>and Order regarding these rulings, the Circuit Court considered the language and legislative history of \u00a7 9-276 and held the statute imposed strict liability on Respondents. In so doing, the Circuit Court rejected Respondents\u2019 interpretation of the statute making \u201cresponsibility or fault ... an element of the reimbursement requirement.\u201d It read the language of \u00a7 9-276, which provides that reimbursement be made to the MDE \u201cby the owner or operator of the site or any other person who caused the tires to be stored or disposed of at the site ...,\u201d as placing liability on an owner or operator regardless of culpability.. According to the Circuit Court, \u201cthe phrase \u2018any other person who caused the tires to be stored or disposed of at the site\u2019 should be read as a stand alone clause, thereby creating an additional category of liable persons distinct from the owner or operator of the site.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Subsequently, a trial on a determination of costs was held. Respondents again argued that their case was one \u201cat law,\u201d rather than \u201cat equity,\u201d and that they were entitled to a trial by jury. Alternatively, Respondents maintained that, if their case was \u201cat equity,\u201d they were entitled to raise equitable defenses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Circuit Court, however, did not agree with Respondents. It denied Respondents\u2019 motion to reconsider the striking of the jury prayer and agreed with Petitioner that the equitable defense of laches could not be raised against the State.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thereafter, on 1 February 2000, the Circuit Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>found Petitioner\u2019s costs were \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d and assessed damages against Respondents in the amount of $1,015,299.72, plus court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Respondents argued the Circuit Court erred in granting partial summary judgment in favor of Petitioner because, by \u201c[ujtilizing the rules of statutory construction to ascertain legislative intent,\u201d it is \u201cclear that \u00a7 9-276 was not enacted so as to impose strict liability.\u201d In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals explained that the Circuit Court \u201cimposed strict liability without fault, based on its conclusion that the language in \u00a7 9-276 is \u2018essentially similar to the federal statutory language of CERCLA.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See generally </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607 (1994 &amp; Supp.1999) (\u201cCERCLA \u00a7 9607\u201d). According to the Court of Special Appeals, however, tires \u201cdo not constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>hazardous materials or hazardous substances as defined in either federal law [ (CERCLA) ] or Title 7 of the Environment Article.\u201d Therefore, the intermediate appellate court held the Circuit Court erred in prohibiting Respondents from asserting equitable defenses and in granting Petitioner\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment. Because Respondents \u201cwere entitled to assert whatever equitable defenses [as may be] applicable,\u201d the Court of Special Appeals vacated the judgment of the Circuit Court and remanded the case for further proceedings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">In reviewing a grant of a summary judgment motion, we are \u201cmost often concerned with whether a dispute of material fact exists.\u201d <em>Lippert v. Jung, </em>366 Md. 221, 227, 783 A.2d 206, 209 (2001). <em>See also Grimes v. Kennedy Krieger Inst., Inc., </em>366 Md. 29, 71, 782 A.2d 807, 833 (2001); <em>Pence v.

Sussex, Inc., </em>332 Md. 247, 255, 630 A.2d 1156, 1160 (1993). Where there is no dispute of material fact, however, this Court has stated that the \u201c \u2018standard of review for a grant of summary judgment is whether the trial court was legally correct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lippert, </em>366 Md. at 227, 783 A.2d at 209 (quoting <em>Goodwich v. Sinai Hosp. of Balt., Inc., </em>343 Md. 185, 204, 680 A.2d 1067, 1076 (1996)). <em>See also Grimes, </em>366 Md. at 72, 782 A.2d at 833; <em>Pence, </em>363 Md. at 279, 768 A.2d at 645; <em>J. Roland Dashiell &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>358 Md. at 94, 747 A.2d at 606 (\u201c \u2018In reviewing the propriety of a summary judgment, it is our responsibility to determine whether there was any issue of fact pertinent to the ruling and, if not, whether the substantive law was correctly applied .... Thus, to be upheld, the summary judgment under review must withstand scrutiny on both its factual and legal foundations.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Bloomgarden v. Coyer, </em>479 F.2d 201, 206-07 (D.C.Cir.1973)) (alteration in original). We review the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions in rendering summary judgment <em>de novo.

Woods, </em>353 Md. 425, 434, 727 A.2d 358, 362 (1999)). In the present case, there are no genuine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>disputes as to the material facts; therefore, our review is limited to whether the Circuit Court was correct legally in granting Petitioner\u2019s partial motion for summary judgment on liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Petitioner asserts that \u00a7 9-276 imposes strict liability on Respondents, as property owners, for the cleanup costs incurred by the MDE in the removal of the scrap tire site from Respondents\u2019 property. Petitioner bases its argument on the plain language of \u00a7 9-276, corroborated by the legislative history regarding the statute, and further through a comparison of \u00a7 9-276 to CERCLA \u00a7 9607. Additionally, Petitioner argues that the Court of Special Appeals \u201cerred when it remanded the case to the circuit court to allow the Property Owners to assert \u2018applicable\u2019 equitable defenses\u201d because, according to Petitioner, \u201cthere are no such defenses that can be asserted with respect to \u00a7 9-276.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Respondents, on the other hand, maintain the Court of Special Appeals \u201ccorrectly determined that [they] were entitled to raise equitable defenses as to the claim brought under \u00a7 9-276.\u201d Respondents argue that \u201c[a]s used in \u00a7 9-276, the word \u2018reimbursed\u2019 is analogous to restitution\u201d and that such an action \u201cseeking a return to the status quo ... constitutes an equitable remedy.\u201d Respondents also maintain that the Legislature did not intend \u00a7 9-276(a) to \u201cbe a strict liability statute\u201d because \u201cinnocent owners were not intended to be responsible persons.\u201d Therefore, according to Respondents, they were entitled to assert equitable defenses at trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>We agree with Petitioner that the Circuit Court was legally correct in finding that \u00a7 9-276 imposed strict liability on Respondents for the reimbursement of costs for the removal of the scrap tire pile from Respondents\u2019 property. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, and hold further that Respondents were not entitled to assert equitable defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">In 1989, the Maryland State Used Tire Cleanup and Recycling Fund, Md.Code (1996 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.), Environment Article, \u00a7\u00a7 9-273-9-278, was enacted as an emergency bill in response to the \u201cpotential catastrophic environmental risk\u201d constituted by the \u201cstockpiling of used tires.\u201d <em>Bill Analysis, House Bill 491, </em>Reports of the Senate Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee, at 1 (1989). <em>See also Floor Report on House Bill 491, </em>Reports of the Senate Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee, at 1(1989). The statutory enactment was designed to provide the MDE \u201cwith the statutory authority to regulate th[at] risk on a statewide basis\u201d and to \u201cprovide a coordinated effort to cleanup the growing number of stockpiles around the State.\u201d <em>Bill Analysis, House Bill 491, </em>at 1. It also was intended to \u201cencourage individuals to recycle used tires and [to] rehabilitate sites currently used to store used tires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the statute provided \u201cfinancing for the [State Used Tire Cleanup and Recycling] Fund,\u201d provided for \u201cthe use of the Fund,\u201d and provided for \u201cthe reimbursement of certain moneys expended from the Fund by certain persons.\u201d Chapter 667, Acts of 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Section 9-276, at issue in this case, was included in the original enactment of the State Used Tire Cleanup and Recycling Fund to provide for the \u201c[Reimbursement of costs.\u201d Chapter 667, \u00a7 1 of the Acts of 1989. As codified today, it reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, all expenditures from the State Used Tire Cleanup and Recycling Fund made by the Department under \u00a7 9-275(a)(l) of this subtitle in response to the storage or disposal of used tires at a particular site shall be reimbursed to the Department for the State Used Tire Cleanup and Recycling Fund by the owner or operator of the site or any other person who caused the tires to be stored or disposed of at the site in violation of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">(b) <em>Action for failure to make reimbursement. </em>\u2014 In addition to any other legal action authorized by this subtitle, the Attorney General may bring an action to recover costs and interest from any person who fails to make reimbursement as required under subsection (a) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">(c) <em>Recovery of costs. </em>\u2014 The Department may recover costs incurred by the Department under \u00a7 9-275(a)(l) of this subtitle whether or not the discarded tires were disposed of or stored at the site before July 1,1989.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">(d) <em>Applicability of section. </em>\u2014 This section does not apply to expenditures of $10,000 or less related to removal, restoration, or remedial action in response to the disposal or storage of scrap tires in violation of this subtitle if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">(1) The owner of the site acquired the property containing the scrap tires prior to January 1, 2000 by inheritance or bequest at the death of the transferor; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">(2) The tires were stored or disposed of prior to January 1, 2000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">In the present case, our focus is on the scope of liability imposed by \u00a7 9-276(a), which mandates that the \u201cowner or operator of the site or any other person who caused the tires to be stored or disposed of at the site in violation of this subtitle\u201d is responsible to the MDE for reimbursement of cleanup costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">In their arguments to this Court and in the courts below, Petitioner and Respondents focus on the similarities and differences between \u00a7 9-276 and CERCLA \u00a7 9607 in an attempt to glean the intended scope of liability under \u00a7 9-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>276(a). <em>See supra </em>note 10 (discussing the reliance of Petitioner and Respondents on CERCLA in interpreting \u00a7 9-276). As we have stated, however, the \u201ccardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature,\u201d <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995) (citing <em>Fish Mkt. Nominee Corp. v. G.A.A., </em>337 Md. 1, 8, 650 A.2d 705, 708 (1994)), and the \u201c \u2018primary source of legislative intent is, of course, the language of the statute itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Pagano, </em>341 Md. 129, 133, 669 A.2d 1339, 1340-A1 (1996) (quoting <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73, 517 A.2d 730, 731 (1986)). <em>See also Oaks, </em>339 Md. at 35, 660 A.2d at 429. Therefore, where the words of a statute are \u201cclear and unambiguous, we will give effect to the statute as written,\u201d <em>Oaks, </em>339 Md. at 35, 660 A.2d at 429, and will construe it \u201c \u2018without forced or subtle interpretations designed to extend or limit the scope of its operation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Giant Food, Inc. v. Dept. of Labor, </em>356 Md. 180, 189, 738 A.2d 856, 861 (1999) (quoting <em>Tucker, </em>308 Md. at 73, 517 A.2d at 732). In this case, the language of \u00a7 9-276 is both clear and unambiguous. Therefore, it is unnecessary for us to look to a comparison of \u00a7 9-276 to CERCLA \u00a7 9607 in order to ascertain its meaning. <em>Id. </em>(\u201c \u2018[W]here statutory provisions are clear and unambiguous, no construction or clarification is needed or permitted ....\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Section 9-276(a) imposes liability for reimbursement on the \u201cowner or operator of the site or any other person who caused the tires to be stored or disposed of at the site in violation of this subtitle.\u201d Respondents\u2019 interpretation of this section would have the clause \u201cwho caused the tires to be stored or disposed of at the site in violation of this subtitle\u201d modify all three categories of potential responsible parties described in the statute, i.e. the \u201cowner,\u201d the \u201coperator,\u201d and \u201cany other person.\u201d That interpretation, however, ignores the clear meaning of the structure and relationship of the words as they appear in the statute and does not acknowledge the \u201cgenerally recognized rule of statutory construction that a qualifying clause ordinarily is confined to the immediately preceding words or phrase \u2014 particularly in the absence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>comma before the qualifying phrase.... \u201d <em>Sullivan v.

In consideration of that principle, we are unable to adopt Respondents\u2019 interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The language of \u00a7 9-276 does not contain commas setting apart the three categories of potential responsible parties and the modifying clause (e.g. \u201cthe owner or operator of the site, or any other person, who caused the tires to be stored ...\u201d), nor does it explicitly apply the modifying clause to all three parties. In the absence of such context, it is clear that the modifying clause \u201cwho caused the tires to be stored ...\u201d was intended to apply <em>only </em>to \u201cany other person.\u201d Consequently, the language of \u00a7 9-276(a) mandates that liability for reimbursement to the MDE may be placed on any of 3 categories of persons who violate the subtitle: (1) an owner of a site containing used tires; (2) an operator of a site containing used tires; or (3) any other person who caused the used tires to be stored or disposed of at the site.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 9-276(a) imposes strict liability on an owner of a used tire site for the reimbursement of monies expended in cleaning up the property, regardless of the owner\u2019s or operator\u2019s culpability in placing or allowing the tires on the property. Had the legislature intended otherwise, it would have indicated as such by clearly setting apart the categories and modifying clause or by explicitly applying the responsibility requirement to all three categories.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">We now must determine whether Respondents were entitled to assert equitable defenses on their own behalf at trial.

Specifically, Petitioner argues that because a majority of the federal courts have held that equitable defenses are not available under CERCLA \u00a7 9607, we should likewise hold those defenses ar.e not available under \u00a7 '9-276. <em>See generally Office of the State Prosecutor v. Judicial Watch, Inc., </em>356 Md. 118, 138, 737 A.2d 592, 603 (1999) (\u201c \u2018Where the purpose and language of a federal statute are substantially the same as that of a later state statute, interpretations of the federal statute are ordinarily persuasive.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Faulk v.

Although we stop short of complete acceptance of Petitioner\u2019s argument due to the differences in language and scope between the two stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>utes, an examination of the federal case law surrounding CERCLA \u00a7 9607 is useful in our analysis for illustrative purposes. For the reasons stated herein, we agree with Petitioner that Respondents, as liable parties under \u00a7 9-276, were not entitled to assert any defenses, including those that are equitable in nature, on their own behalf at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">As noted earlier, CERCLA \u201cgives the federal government broad power to combat contamination of the environment.\u201d <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb, Inc. v.

To effectuate that end, CERCLA \u00a7 9607 imposes strict liability on owners and operators of facilities for the reimbursement of all cleanup costs incurred in responding to hazardous substances on their property. <em>See </em>\u00a7 9607(a).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In addition, it also specifically enumerates defenses available to otherwise liable parties under the statute, including an act of God, an act of War, or an act or omission of a third party. <em>See </em>\u00a7 9607(b). According to the majority of federal circuits interpreting CERCLA \u00a7 9607, otherwise liable parties under the statute are limited to raising <em>only </em>those enumerated defenses on their behalf. <em>See, e.g., Axel Johnson, Inc. v. Carroll Carolina Oil Co., Inc., et al., </em>191 F.3d 409, 413 (4th Cir.1999) (\u201c[PJotentially responsible persons ... are strictly liable for cleanup costs subject only to the statute\u2019s limited defenses.\u201d); <em>Westfarm Assocs.

Litton Indus. Automation Sys., </em>920 F.2d 1415, 1418 (8th Cir.1990) (\u201cCERCLA is a strict liability statute, with only a limited number of statutorily-defined defenses available.\u201d); <em>U.S. v. Atlas Minerals and Chems., Inc., et al., </em>797 F.Supp. 411, 417 (1992) (\u201c[T]he statute itself is explicit in stating that the defenses enumerated in \u00a7 9607(b) are the only defenses to liability under \u00a7 9607(a).\u201d). Those parties, therefore, are not entitled to raise any equitable defenses on their behalf. <em>See, e.g., Town of Munster, Ind. v. Sherwin-Williams Co., Inc., </em>27 F.3d 1268, 1270 (1994) (holding that \u201cCERCLA does not permit equitable defenses to [\u00a7 9607] liability\u201d); <em>Atlas Minerals and Chems., Inc., </em>797 F.Supp. at 417 (\u201c[The] introduction [of equitable defenses] into the liability phase of a CERCLA case is improper.\u201d); <em>U.S. v. W. Processing Co., Inc., </em>734 F.Supp. 930, 939 (1990) (\u201cThe listed defenses are the only defenses which are available to avoid liability.... There should be no other defenses, including equitable defenses, that defeat liability....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Pertinent to the present case, the mass of federal case law surrounding CERCLA \u00a7 9607 and the language of the statute itself elucidate the notion that strictly liable parties generally are <em>not </em>entitled to raise any defenses on their behalf, unless such defenses are recognized within the statute itself. Specifically, by expressly enumerating the available defenses in CERCLA \u00a7 9607, the drafters of that statute confirmed that all other defenses were not available normally to strictly liable persons. If they were otherwise available, such an enumeration by the legislature would be both unnecessary and superfluous. By logical extension, therefore, it has been demonstrated that in order to raise equitable defenses to rebut statutorily imposed strict liability, such defenses must be explicitly provided for in the statute itself. <em>See, e.g., U.S. v. DWG Trust Holding Co., </em>No. HAR 93-2859, 1994 WL 395730, at *2, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10545, at *6 (D.Md. July 22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>1994) (holding that the \u201cabsence of any reference to equitable defenses to liability in the statute therefore precludes them\u201d). If they are not provided for in the statute imposing strict liability, then, due to the absolute liability imposed by the statute, they are not available as a defense to liability or damages at trial. <em>Id. </em>In our opinion, that rationale is equally applicable to the statute at hand in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Although \u00a7 9-276, at the times relevant to the present case, did not enumerate defenses available to strictly liable parties under the statute, their absence does not signify that defenses, specifically equitable defenses, are thus available to otherwise liable parties. Rather, as demonstrated by CERCLA \u00a7 9607, unless the use of equitable defenses is specifically provided for in a strict liability statute, a liable party under that statute is <em>not </em>entitled to assert them at trial. In this case, the legislature did not enumerate any defenses to strict liability under \u00a7 9-276. Therefore, due to the strict liability imposed on Respondents by \u00a7 9-276, they were not entitled to raise any defenses, including those recognized as equitable in nature, on their behalf at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">In the courts below, Respondents maintained, as an alternative argument, that they were entitled to a trial by jury in this matter. Essentially, Respondents'did not care whether they prevailed on their equitable defenses theory or their jury trial argument. To decide the former in their favor, however, necessarily avoided or decided the latter against them, and vice versa. The two arguments were mutually exclusive and, thus, truly asserted in the alternative. Accordingly, because we hold that the Court of Special Appeals erred in ruling in Respondents\u2019 favor as to the availability of equitable defenses to the statutory strict liability present in this case, we must extend our analysis to consider the other side of the coin, whether Respondents\u2019 views as to a right to a jury trial are in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>any way correct.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Petitioner maintained below that \u201creimbursement,\u201d as provided in \u00a7 9-276, was \u201cequitable\u201d relief and therefore, \u201cd[id] not give rise to a jury trial.\u201d In so doing, Petitioner urged the courts to \u201ctum[ ] to federal case law [regarding CERCLA] to determine the scope of Maryland\u2019s jury trial right,\u201d and noted that \u201cfederal courts.have held uniformly that there is no right to a jury trial in an environmental cost recovery action.\u201d On the other hand, Respondents argued that the State \u201ccan\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d According to Respondents, the case was \u201ceither a law case,\u201d hence providing a right to a jury trial, or they \u201c[we]re entitled to raise equit[able] defenses.\u201d Although we do not adopt totally Respondents\u2019 arguments on this point, for the following reasons we agree that Respondents were entitled to a jury trial on the issue of the appropriate amount of the reimbursement in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">In a proceeding initiated by the State to obtain reimbursement for cleanup costs under \u00a7 9-276, two determinations must be made, specifically, whether the persons sued come within the classes of persons made liable by the statute and the amount of reimbursement due. On the issue of liability, it is clear that Respondents are not entitled to a jury trial because no disputes of material fact exist on this record. The question remains, however, whether such liable parties are entitled to a jury trial on the issue of the amount of the reimbursement, particularly whether the expenditures for which reimbursement is sought by the State are fair and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>reasonable in light of the purposes of the statute and the particular facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights provides, \u201cthe right of trial by jury of all issues of fact in civil proceedings in the several Courts of Law in this State, where the amount in controversy exceeds the sum of $10,000 shall be inviolably preserved.\u201d It is well-established, however, that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"atb-dedup-0\">[t]he constitutional guarantee of a trial by jury extends only to the type of cases in which the right of a trial by jury existed at the time of the adoption of the constitution.

Additionally, due to the absence of recognition of any enumerated equitable defenses in \u00a7 9-276, we hold that the Court of Special Appeals erred in remanding this case to the Circuit Court to allow Respondents to assert equitable defenses.

If, as Petitioner asserts, \u00a7 9-276 imposes strict liability on property owners, then, in answer to Respondents\u2019 question, it would do so regardless of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>culpability, due to its status as a strict liability statute. Therefore, these two questions require us only to determine whether \u00a7 9-276(a) imposes strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Any confusion surrounding this question appears fostered by Petitioner's and Respondents' differing interpretations of the Court of Special Appeals's holding regarding \u00a7 9-276. Respondents, in their brief to this Court, argue that the Court of Special Appeals \"incorrectly determined that [\u00a7 9-276] was an enactment of strict liability as to ...

As discussed in <em>infra </em>note 11, we have interpreted the decision of the Court of Special Appeals as holding Respondents were entitled to assert equitable defenses because \u00a7 9-276 does <em>not </em>impose strict liability on property owners for cleanup costs. Based on that interpretation, Respondents' argument misstates the holding of the Court of Special Appeals regarding strict liability. Notwithstanding that confusion, we will answer both Petitioner\u2019s and Respondents' penultimate question\u2014 whether \u00a7 9-276 imposes strict liability on property owners for reimbursement of cleanup costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b226-9\">.

Murtha, </em>840 F.Supp. 180, 186, 190 (D.Conn.1993)). <em>See generally B.F. Goodrich v. Betkoski, </em>99 F.3d 505, 516 (2nd Cir.1996) (\"In short, it makes no difference that the specific wastes disposed of ... were not themselves listed as hazardous substances, because so long as their component parts were listed as hazardous substances there may be CERCLA liability.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">It should be noted, however, that the Circuit Court's decision regarding the motions for summary judgment was based on the language and legislative history of \u00a7 9-276, not on a comparison of \u00a7 9-276 to CERCLA. The portion of the Circuit Court opinion quoted by the Court of Special Appeals, specifically that \u00a7 9-276 is \" \u2018essentially similar to the federal statutory language of CERCLA,' \u201d was contained in a summary of Petitioner's arguments within the Circuit Court opinion. It was not relied upon or adopted by the Circuit Court in its analysis. The Circuit Court, however, did compare \u00a7 9-276 to CERCLA in its order assessing damages. Even that comparison was not utilized for purposes of determining whether \u00a7 9-276 imposed strict liability. Rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>it was employed 1o determine whether reimbursement of \u201ccosts,\u201d under \u00a7 9-276, includes both direct and indirect costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b234-6\">. Respondents maintain the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that \u00a7 9-276 imposes strict liability, but that it correctly allowed equitable defenses. This suggests that Respondents interpret the intermediate appellate court\u2019s holding regarding equitable defenses as being wholly unrelated to the court's holding that \u00a7 9-276 imposed strict liability. To the contrary, we interpret the intermediate appellate court's holding allowing equitable defenses as necessarily related to the court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 9-276. Specifically, we find the court allowed equitable defenses <em>because </em>it deemed \u00a7 9-276 as <em>not </em>imposing strict liability. As discussed in <em>supra </em>note 2, however, even though Respondents appear to have misstated the holding of the Court of Special Appeals, the critical questions before us remain the same, i.e. whether \u00a7 9-276 imposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>strict liability on Respondents and whether, under \u00a7 9-276, Respondents were entitled to assert equitable defenses at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b238-5\">. We are not called upon in this case to address what rights Respondents may have to seek contribution or indemnification from any person or entity who also may be liable for remediation of the scrap tire pile.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b238-6\">. Because the language of \u00a7 9-276 is clear, it is not necessary for us to examine the legislative history surrounding the section. <em>See Maryland Div. of Labor and Indus. v. Triangle Gen. Contractors, Inc., </em>366 Md. 407, 421-22, 784 A.2d 534, 542 (2001) (\u201cWhen the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, ... we normally do not look 'beyond the words of the statute itself to determine legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Giant Food, Inc. v. Dept. of Labor, </em>356 Md. 180, 189, 738 A.2d 856, 861 (1999)). We note, however, that, having looked nonetheless, we found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>no evidence in the legislative history indicating the General Assembly intended to exempt any property owners from responsibility for reimbursement under \u00a7 9-276. The legislative file reveals that the General Assembly received testimony prior to the enactment of \u00a7 9-276 suggesting the provision be clarified \"to give protection to innocent parties,\u201d <em>Testimony of the Rubber Manufacturers Association on House Bill 491 Before the Maryland House of Delegates Committee on Environmental Matters, </em>at 2 (2 February 1989), but subsequently chose not to modify the language of \u00a7 9-276. <em>See </em>Chapter 667, \u00a7 1 of the Acts of 1989 (indicating no alterations in the pertinent portion of \u00a7 9-276(a) between the first and final readings of the bill). In our mind, the legislative determination to maintain the original language of \u00a7 9-276 after entertaining the potential application to \"innocent parties\u201d clearly indicates that the Legislature intended \u00a7 9-276 impose strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Additionally, a recent amendment to \u00a7 9-276 exempts property owners from responsibility for reimbursement of \"expenditures of $10,000 or less related to removal, restoration, or remedial action in response to\u201d scrap tires on their land if those owners \"acquired the property containing the scrap tires prior to January 1, 2000 by inheritance or bequest ... [,] and . ..

This amendment provides further indication that the Legislature did not intend previously to exclude <em>all </em>innocent property owners from liability under \u00a7 9-276. If the Legislature had so intended, it would have been unnecessary and redundant in 2000 to amend \u00a7 9-276 to provide for the limited exception now contained in the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\">.

Similar to the language of \u00a7 9-276, CERCLA \u00a7 9607 also imposes liability for \"all costs of removal or remedial action\u201d on, among others, \"the owner and operator of a ... facility.\u201d \u00a7 9607(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In contrast to each other, however, CERCLA \u00a7 9607 is part of an extensive federal environmental act applying to \"hazardous substances,\u201d whereas \u00a7 9-276 is an element of a more narrowly focused state environmental fund applying only to \"used tires.\u201d CERCLA \u00a7 9607(b) also enumerates defenses available to an otherwise liable party, specifically if \"the release or threat of release of a hazardous substance and the damages resulting therefrom were caused solely by\u2014 (1) an act of God; (2) an act of War; (3) an act or omission of a third party ...; or (4) any combination of the foregoing paragraphs,\u201d whereas \u00a7 9-276 does not.

Because we view Respondents\u2019 alternative arguments as two-sides of the same coin, it was not necessary for them to preserve it for our consideration by framing it separately in their conditional cross-petition for certiorari. As they were wholly victorious in tire Court of Special Appeals on the availability of equitable defenses, it was unnecessary to mention this issue in the conditional cross-petition, given the nature of the alternative arguments in this case. See <em>Montrose Christian Sch. Corp., et al. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>363 Md. 565, 577 n. 3, 770 A.2d 111, 118 n. 3 (2001) (\" 'It is established as a general principle that only a party aggrieved by a court\u2019s judgment may take an appeal and that one may not appeal or cross-appeal from a judgment wholly in his favor.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Offutt v.

Notwithstanding the above statutory interpretation ground for recognizing Respondents' right to a jury trial on the issue of the amount of reimbursement under \u00a7 9-276, it is worth noting that we have adopted a similar analytical approach in public nuisance abatement situations. In <em>Martin v. Howard County, </em>349 Md. 469, 488-89, 709 A.2d 125, 135 (1998), we distinguished a complaint seeking \"to terminate or reduce the activity\u201d constituting a public nuisance on property with a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>plaint requesting <em>\"a </em>court order 'ousting' from the property the person in possession\u201d of it. In so doing, we noted generally that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">[w]ith respect to actions against defendants who are allegedly engaging in activity constituting a nuisance, the relief sought will determine the nature of the action. If the relief requested is an order requiring the defendant to stop engaging in the activity, the action is equitable. If the plaintiff requests money damages, or if a plaintiff not in possession requests an order ousting a tenant from possession of the property, the actions are legal, and there is a constitutional right to a jury trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-7\"><em>Martin, </em>349 Md. at 489, 709 A.2d at 136. This rationale is equally applicable to the case at hand. Had Petitioner requested an injunction to compel Respondents to clean up their property, the action would have been equitable and Respondents would not be entitled to a jury trial. Because, however, Petitioner sought money damages as reimbursement for the State performing the cleanup (as the statute permitted), the action is a legal one and Respondents retain their right to a trial by jury as to the amount of the reimbursement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
