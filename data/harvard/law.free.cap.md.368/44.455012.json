We shall hold that a policy provision providing for such reduction is not authorized by the statutes and is, therefore, invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The basic facts of the case have been stipulated to by the parties. On December 31, 1994, Barry W. Lewis was driving his 1993 Chevrolet automobile on Belle Grove Road, at the intersection with Gibbons Avenue, in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, when Lewis\u2019s Chevrolet was struck by a vehicle driven by Karl W. Reiser. According to Lewis, he was lawfully and carefully driving his automobile at the time, and Reiser negligently drove through a stop sign on Gibbons Avenue, thereby causing the collision. As a result of the accident, Lewis sustained personal injuries and incurred medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Reiser was an uninsured motorist, and Lewis\u2019s vehicle was insured by Allstate Insurance Company. The Allstate policy issued to Lewis included the statutorily required liability, personal injury protection, and uninsured motorist coverages. The policy also contained an optional medical payments endorsement, for which Lewis paid a separate premium, providing medical payments coverage in addition to that encompassed by the personal injury protection coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>In light of his injuries resulting from the accident, Lewis filed claims with Allstate under the medical payments endorsement and the uninsured motorist coverage of his policy. The parties settled the medical payments claim for $5,000.00, which Allstate paid to Lewis, but they were unable to settle the uninsured motorist claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Lewis and his wife then filed in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County a three-count complaint seeking monetary damages from the uninsured motorist Reiser and from Allstate. Count one was a tort action in which it was alleged that the accident was caused by Reiser\u2019s negligence, and count two was an action for loss of consortium. The third count was a breach of contract claim against Allstate, based upon the uninsured motorist provisions of the insurance policy. A default order, and later a default judgment, was entered against Reiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The breach of contract action against Allstate was tried before a jury which rendered a verdict against Allstate totaling $11,154.00. The jury\u2019s verdict specified the damages as follows: past medical bills \u2014 $2,910.00; past lost wages\u2014 $6,244.00; non-economic damages \u2014 $2,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Thereafter, Allstate filed a motion to revise the judgment by reducing it to $6,154.00. According to Allstate, the reduction was justified because of the $5,000.00 which Allstate had previously paid under the medical payments endorsement in the policy. Allstate relied on a policy provision in the uninsured motorist coverage which stated that uninsured motorist</p>\n<blockquote id=\"af-dedup-0\">\u201cdamages payable will be reduced by ... all amounts payable under any workers compensation law, disability benefits law, or similar law, automobile medical payments, or any similar automobile medical payments coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">In response to Allstate\u2019s motion, Lewis argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the above-quoted policy provision was void under the Maryland statutes regulating automobile insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The Circuit Court granted Allstate\u2019s motion and reduced the judgment to $6,154.00. Lewis appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Court then granted Lewis\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. <em>Lewis v. Allstate, </em>357 Md. 190, 742 A.2d 520 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">As we have pointed out on several occasions, the Maryland statutory provisions regulating motor vehicle insurance are comprehensive. These statutes mandate compulsory motor vehicle insurance or approved self-insurance, require that motor vehicle insurance policies contain particular coverages in specified minimum amounts, require that certain other coverages be offered to insureds, prohibit various practices by motor vehicle insurance companies, and create administrative procedures for resolving controversies between insureds and insurers. With regard to coverages which are either required or which insurers must offer to their insureds, the statutory provisions expressly authorize certain limitations, conditions, exceptions and exclusions. For more detailed discussions of the comprehensive Maryland statutory scheme regulating motor vehicle insurance, <em>see, e.g., Dutta v. State Farm, </em>363 Md. 540, 547-555, 769 A.2d 948, 952-956 (2001); <em>MAIF v. Perry, </em>356 Md. 668, 670-676, 741 A.2d 1114, 1115-1118 (1999); <em>Enterprise v. Allstate, </em>341 Md. 541, 549-551, 671 A.2d 509, 514-515 (1996); <em>Van Horn v. Atlantic Mutual, </em>334 Md. 669, 679-684, 641 A.2d 195, 200-202 (1994); <em>Forbes v. Harleysville Mutual, </em>322 Md. 689, 695-700, 589 A.2d 944, 947-949 (1991); <em>Lee v. Wheeler, </em>310 Md. 233, 236-242, 528 A.2d 912, 914-917 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Furthermore, any portions of motor vehicle insurance policies which are inconsistent with this statutory scheme are void. <em>Bishop v. State Farm, </em>360 Md. 225, 234-235, 757 A.2d 783, 788 (2000) (\u201cTo the extent that applicable insurance regulatory statutes require broader or different coverage than the wording of an insurance policy, \u2018the statutory language would prevail over the insurance policy language,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>West American v. Popa, </em>352 Md. 455, 465 n. 2, 723 A.2d 1, 6 n. 2 (1998)). <em>Staab v. American Motorists, </em>345 Md. 428, 436-437, 693 A.2d 340, 344 (1997); <em>Gable v. Colonial Ins. Co., </em>313 Md. 701, 703, 548 A.2d 135, 136 (1988) (\u201cif the policy provision ... is contrary to the Insurance Code, the provision is unenforceable\u201d), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>In light of the comprehensive nature of the statutory provisions regulating motor vehicle insurance, and the various limitations, conditions, exceptions and exclusions expressly authorized by the Legislature, this Court has consistently \u201cheld invalid insurance policy limitations, exclusions and exceptions to the statutorily required coverages which were not expressly authorized by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Van Horn v. Atlantic Mutual, supra, </em>334 Md. at 686, 641 A.2d at 203. <em>See also Dutta v. State Farm, supra, </em>363 Md. at 552, 769 A.2d at 955 (\u201c \u2018exclusions from statutorily mandated insurance coverage not expressly authorized by the Legislature generally will not be recognized,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>West American v. Popa, supra, </em>352 Md. at 475, 723 A.2d at 10-11); <em>Enterprise v. Allstate, supra, </em>341 Md. at 547, 551, 671 A.2d at 512, 515 (\u201cWhere the Legislature has mandated insurance coverage, this Court will not create exclusions that are not specifically set out in the statute. * * * [T]he purpose of the compulsory insurance law \u2018would be frustrated to a significant extent\u2019 if we were to allow an exclusion from the required security that is not specifically provided by statute\u201d); <em>Larimore v. American Ins. Co., </em>314 Md. 617, 622, 552 A.2d 889, 891 (1989); <em>Gable v. Colonial Ins. Co., supra, </em>313 Md. at 704, 548 A.2d at 137 (\u201cwhere the Legislature has required specified coverages in a particular category of insurance, and has provided for certain exceptions or exclusions to the required coverages, additional exclusions are generally not permitted\u201d); <em>Lee v. Wheeler, supra, </em>310 Md. at 239, 528 A.2d at 915 (\u201cwe will not imply exclusions nor recognize exclusions, beyond those expressly enumerated by the legislature\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Specifically with regard to the monetary amounts of insurance coverages which are required or must be offered by insurers, the statutory provisions extensively set forth mandated minimum amounts as well as permissible offsets and reductions in the coverages. <em>See, e.g., </em>the following sections of the Insurance Article: \u00a7 19-504 (minimum liability coverage); \u00a7 19-505(b) (minimum personal .injury protection benefits); \u00a7 19-507(b) (authorizing nonduplication policy provisions where there are both personal injury protection and medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>insurance benefits); \u00a7 19-509(e) (delineating the minimum amount of uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage); \u00a7 19-512(a) (authorizing deductibles, in specified amounts, under collision coverage); \u00a7 19-513(d) (permitting certain deductions from uninsured/underinsured motorist benefits under limited special circumstances); \u00a7 19-513(e) (authorizing a reduction in personal injury protection and uninsured/underinsured motorist benefits by the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits previously received).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Since the General Assembly has in detail expressly authorized certain offsets from or reductions in the statutorily mandated monetary amounts of insurance, this Court has steadfastly refused to recognize other offsets or reductions not expressly authorized by statute. For example, \u00a7 19-513(e) of the Insurance Article authorizes a reduction in personal injury protection (PIP) and uninsured/underinsured motorist benefits by the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits that the recipient has previously received. In <em>Gable v. Colonial Ins. Co., supra, </em>313 Md. 701, 548 A.2d 135, we held that a provision in an insurance policy, authorizing a reduction in PIP benefits by the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits to be received in the future, was void. The Court in <em>Gable </em>stated (313 Md. at 704, 548 A.2d at 136-137):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">\u201cThe language of \u00a7 [19-513(e)] shows a legislative intent to provide offsets only for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits actually received and not for future benefits. The subsection provides for a deduction only for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits that the claimant \u2018has recovered.\u2019 The General Assembly drew a sharp distinction between workmen\u2019s compensation benefits which have been received and those benefits which have not. To allow a deduction for unrecov-ered benefits would insert an additional exception to the provision mandating PIP coverage. As a matter of statutory construction, where the Legislature has required specified coverages in a particular category of insurance, and has provided for certain exceptions or exclusions to the required coverages, additional exclusions are generally not permitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Later, in <em>Larimore v. American Ins. Co., supra, </em>314 Md. at 624, 552 A.2d at 892, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-5\">\u201cSince the General Assembly has extensively considered the relationship between collateral source benefits and the mandatory minimum motor vehicle insurance coverages, and has determined what reductions and exclusions in the compulsory insurance benefits are allowable because of collateral source payments, this Court has been most reluctant to uphold additional set-offs or exclusions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-6\"><em>See, e.g., Dutta v. State Farm, supra, </em>363 Md. at 552 553, 769 A.2d at 955-956 (PIP benefits may not be reduced by amounts which an HMO had paid to a hospital on behalf of an insured, as the Legislature had not authorized such reduction); <em>Revis v. Automobile Ins. Fund, </em>322 Md. 683, 687, 589 A.2d 483, 484 (1991) (\u201c[I]t is ... clear that the General Assembly did not intend to prohibit duplication of all benefits. Thus, ... a recipient of UM [uninsured motorist] benefits is also entitled to recover under the PIP provisions of his or her policy\u201d); <em>Maryland Auto. Ins. Fund v. Stith, </em>277 Md. 595, 356 A.2d 272 (1976) (prohibiting reduction of uninsured motorist benefits when not authorized by statute). <em>Cf. State Farm Mut. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>283 Md. 663, 670-676, 392 A.2d 1114, 1117-1120 (1978) (reduction in PIP benefits was required where statute expressly mandated the reduction).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">As previously mentioned, the General Assembly has provided for reductions from uninsured/underinsured motorist benefits under limited special circumstances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The present case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>however, does not fall within those special circumstances. No statutory provision authorized a reduction in Lewis\u2019s uninsured/underinsured motorist benefits by the amount which had been paid to Lewis under his medical payments endorsement. Consequently, under our cases discussed above, the reduction was not permitted, and the insurance policy language providing for the reduction is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Moreover, not only was the reduction in this case statutorily unauthorized, but it was inconsistent with the Legislative purpose of requiring uninsured/underinsured motorist benefits in specified minimum amounts. Section 19-509(e) of the Insurance Article requires that every motor vehicle insurance policy contain uninsured/underinsured motorist benefits in the same minimum amounts as the required liability insurance ($20,000/$40,000). In addition, unless waived in writing by the insured, \u00a7 19 \u2014 509(e)(2) mandates that the uninsured/underin-sured motorist coverage \u201cshall equal the amount of liability coverage provided under the policy.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See West American v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number><em>Popa, supra, </em>352 Md. at 477-478, 723 A.2d at 11-12; <em>Staab v. American Motorists, supra, </em>345 Md. at 435-437, 693 A.2d at 343-344.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">This Court has repeatedly stated that these uninsured/un-derinsured provisions of \u201cthe Insurance Code provide an injured insured with resources equal to those which would have been available had the tortfeasor carried liability coverage equal to the amount of uninsured motorist coverage which the injured insured purchased from his own insurance company.\u201d <em>Waters v. USF &amp; G, </em>328 Md. 700, 714, 616 A.2d 884, 890 (1992). <em>See also, e.g., Clay v. GEICO, </em>356 Md. 257, 265, 739 A.2d 5, 9-10 (1999); <em>Forbes v. Harleysville Mutual, supra, </em>322 Md. at 697-698, 589 A.2d at 948; <em>Hoffman v. United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>309 Md. 167, 172, 522 A.2d 1320, 1322 (1987); <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. v. Webb, </em>291 Md. 721, 737, 436 A.2d 465, 474 (1981). We have held invalid insurance policy limitations on uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage which were \u201cinconsistent with the purpose of placing the insured in the same position as he would have been if the tortfeasor had been insured,\u201d <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. v. Webb, supra, </em>291 Md. at 737, 436 A.2d at 475. In the case at bar, if the tortfeasor Reiser had carried liability insurance, his liability insurer would have been required to pay the full amount of the $11,154.00 judgment which Lewis had obtained. Under this hypothetical, the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer would not have been able to have the $11,154.00 reduced by any medical payments insurance benefits received by Lewis. <em>See Kremen v. MAIF, </em>363 Md. 663, 770 A.2d 170 (2001), and cases there discussed. Accordingly, Lewis\u2019s uninsured motorist insurer, standing in the place of a tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer, should also not be able to have the judgment reduced because of medical insurance payments under separate policy provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY FOR ENTRY OF A JUDGMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY THE RESPONDENT ALLSTATE INSURANCE COMPANY.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-8\">.
