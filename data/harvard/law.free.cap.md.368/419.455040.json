In this petition, Bar Counsel asserted one complaint in connection with Respondent\u2019s representation of Jimmy Park in two separate, but related, legal matters, alleging violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC) 1.1 (competence); 1.3 (diligence in representation); 1.4(a) and (b) (communication with clients); 1.16(a)(2) and (d) (declining or terminating representation); 8.1(b) (disciplinary matters); and 8.4(c) and (d) (misconduct). This Court referred the matter to Judge Michael D. Mason of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Md. Rules 16-709(b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 16-711(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On 25 June 2001, Respondent was served with the Petition for Disciplinary Action, Order and Writ of Summons consistent with Md. Rule 16-709(d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Respondent, however, failed to file a timely answer to the petition as required by Md. Rule 16-709(e)(2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further, the Respondent did not respond to Petitioner\u2019s interrogatories, request for production of documents, and request for admission of facts and genuineness of documents. An Order of Default was entered on 27 July 2001, and an evidentiary hearing was scheduled for 6 September 2001. Respondent did not move to vacate the Order of Default.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>At the evidentiary hearing, at which Respondent was not present, Petitioner presented evidence<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in support of the charges. In addition, Petitioner submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the hearing judge. Judge Mason reviewed and adopted Petitioner\u2019s submission, concluding, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.16(a)(2) and (d), 8.1(b), 8.4(c) and (d), relating to his representation of Mr. Park. Respondent has not filed with this Court any exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law. Petitioner filed with this Court a recommendation for sanction, urging Respondent\u2019s disbarment. Respondent did not appear at oral argument before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">From the evidentiary record, Judge Mason made the following findings of facts pertaining to Respondent\u2019s conduct regarding his representation of Mr. Park.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">In September 1998, Jimmy Park obtained a judgment against Rising Star, Inc., Hae Y. Chi and Don S. Chi in the amount of $105,000 in compensatory damages, $7,962.50 in prejudgment interest and $75,000 in punitive damages. After the judgment was entered, the Chis filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy in October 1998. Mr. Park retained Respondent on November 27, 1998 to pursue the collection of his judgment through the Chis\u2019 bankruptcy and paid Respondent a $1,500 retainer. Respondent undertook to represent Mr. Park as a creditor in the Chis\u2019 bankruptcy proceeding. The Chis\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding on or about February 10, 1999. Thereafter on February 16, 1999 a notice was sent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>the creditors advising that the deadline to file a complaint to determine dischargeability of certain debts was May 9,1999. Although Respondent received the February 16, 1999 notice and advised Mr. Park that he would file a complaint to determine the non-dischargeability of his debt, he failed to do so by the deadline of May 9, 1999. Even though the Chis\u2019 counsel had indicated to Respondent that she would consent to the relief requested, Respondent did not file a complaint on behalf of Mr. Park. Respondent failed to advise Mr. Park that he had not timely filed the complaint. Furthermore, when Mr. Park requested status of the matter, Respondent advised him not to worry and that he would take care of it. Respondent never sought to re-open the matter. Moreover Respondent never advised Joseph F. Cunningham, Esquire, [an] attorney who continued to represent Mr. Park regarding the non-bankruptcy aspects of his claim against the Chis, that such action might be possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\">Mr. Park, through Mr. Cunningham, filed a malpractice action against the attorney, Tntak Lee, who had represented Mr. Park in the underlying transaction with the Chis. Mr. Lee filed for bankruptcy in January 1999. Mr. Park retained Respondent to move the bankruptcy court to lift the automatic stay in order to pursue recovery through the malpractice action from Mr. Lee\u2019s malpractice insurance carrier. Mr. Park paid Respondent a retainer of $500 to handle the matter. Respondent failed to file a motion even though Mr. Lee\u2019s counsel had indicated to Respondent that he would consent to re-opening the bankruptcy and lifting the automatic stay. Respondent failed to respond to requests for status from Mr. Cunningham and another bankruptcy attorney consulted by Mr. Park. Thereafter, on October 18, 1999, Mr. Park made a complaint to the Attorney Grievance Commission concerning Respondent\u2019s inac-tions in handling the two bankruptcy matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">The Attorney Grievance Commission[,] seeking an explanation from Respondent concerning Mr. Park\u2019s complaint, wrote to him on October 18, 1999, November 12, 1999, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>December 30, 1999 and January 19, 2000. Respondent failed to respond to those letters. On February 8, 2000, Michael H. Peregoy an Investigator for the Attorney Grievance Commission, contacted Respondent who acknowledged receipt of those letters. Respondent promised that he would submit a response to the Attorney Grievance Commission by February ,11, 2000. Respondent failed to provide a response. Thereafter Mr. Peregoy made another visit Respondent\u2019s office on April 7, 2000 to obtain Respon-. dent\u2019s response and \u00e1 copy of his file.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Based upon these findings of fact, the hearing judge concluded, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent had violated the MRPC through his following actions:</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">A. <em>Violation of MRPC 1,1</em></p>\n<p id=\"AHY\">Rule 1.1. Competence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Judge Mason concluded that Respondent incompetently represented Mr. Park in both the Chi and Lee bankruptcy matters in violation of Rule 1.1 \u201cby not exhibiting the thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation by his failure to prepare and file the complaint in the Chis\u2019 matter by May 9,1999 and by his failure to move to have the automatic stay lifted in the Lee matter even though opposing counsels in those two matters were not opposed to the relief sought.\u201d The hearing judge concluded that Respondent further violated MRPC 1.1 by failing to cooperate and assist Mr. Cunningham, Mr. Park\u2019s attorney who continued to represent Mr. Park in the non-bankruptcy aspect of his claims against the Chis.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>B. <em>Violation of MRPC 1.3</em></p>\n<p id=\"AFM\">Rule 1.3. Diligence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\">A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Finding that \u201cRespondent\u2019s failure to file the appropriate documents in the Chi and Lee bankruptcy matters demons-trat[ed] a lack of diligence,\u201d the hearing judge concluded that Respondent was in violation of Rule 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">C. <em>Violation of MRPC 1.4(a) and (b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Rule 1.4. Communication.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">(a) A lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessaiy to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">The hearing judge concluded that Respondent violated Rule 1.4(a) and (b) by \u201cfailing to communicate with Mr. Park and keep him informed of the status of the two matters despite Mr. Park\u2019s requests for status,\u201d and by his failure to \u201ccommunicate with Mr. Park\u2019s attorney, Mr. Cunningham, in the Lee matter.\u201d Moreover, the hearing judge concluded that Respondent further violated Rule 1.4 by \u201cfailing] to respond to requests for status updates from Mr. Cunningham and from another bankruptcy attorney consulted by Mr. Park.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">D. <em>Violation of MRPC 1.16(a)(2) and (d)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">Rule 1.16. Declining or terminating representation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-13\">(a) [A] lawyer shall not represent a client or, where representation has commenced, shall withdraw from the representation of a client if: . ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-14\">(2) the lawyer\u2019s physical or mental condition materially impairs the lawyer\u2019s ability to represent the client;....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>(d) Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client\u2019s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned. The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent permitted by other law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Observing that \u201c[a]t no time during the representation did Respondent advise Mr. Park that he could not handle the representation or was not going to follow through with the representation,\u201d Judge Mason concluded that Respondent was in violation of Rule 1.16(a)(2). Moreover, with regard to Respondent\u2019s representation of Mr. Park in the Chi bankruptcy, he found that after Respondent missed the deadline to file a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the Chis\u2019 debt to Mr. Park, he never sought to re-open the matter, nor did he advise Mr. Cunningham that such action might be possible. Similarly, the chancellor found that Respondent failed to file a motion to lift the automatic stay so that Mr. Park could pursue recovery in a malpractice action from Mr. Lee\u2019s malpractice insurance carrier, and then failed to respond to requests from Mr. Cunningham, and another bankruptcy attorney consulted by Mr. Park, for status updates. Judge Mason concluded that \u201cRespondent\u2019s abandonment of Mr. Park in the two matters\u201d was a violation of Rule 1.16(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">E. <em>Violation of MRPC 8.1(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Rule 8.1. Bar admission and disciplinary matters.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">An applicant for admission or reinstatement to the bar, or a lawyer in connection with a bar admission application or in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">(b) fail to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in the matter, or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority, except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>that this Rule does not require disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Finding that Respondent knowingly failed to respond to Petitioner\u2019s repeated attempts to ascertain from Respondent what explanation he had concerning Mr. Park\u2019s complaint, including four separate occasions of mailed correspondence as well as a personal visit from Petitioner\u2019s investigator, the hearing judge concluded that Respondent violated Rule 8.1 by \u201chis wilful failure to respond to Petitioner\u2019s letters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">F. <em>Violation of MRPC 8.4(c) and (d)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Rule 8.4. Misconduct</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">(e) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-10\">(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Judge Mason concluded that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(c) by \u201cmisrepresenting to Mr. Park the status of the Chi matter,\u201d when Respondent advised Mr. Park not to worry, that he would take care of it, when in fact, \u201che had not timely filed the complaint.\u201d Moreover, the hearing judge concluded that Respondent\u2019s \u201cutter lack of action in completing the two matters on behalf of Mr. Park was prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">This Court has original jurisdiction over all attorney disciplinary proceedings. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Snyder, </em>368 Md. 242, 253, 793 A.2d 515, 521 (2002); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Harris, </em>366 Md. 376, 388, 784 A.2d 516, 523 (2001); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 16-709(b) (stating \u201c[c]harges against an attorney shall be filed on behalf of the [Attorney Grievance] Commission in the Court of Appeals.\u201d). The hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>ing judge\u2019s findings of fact \u201care <em>prima facia </em>[sic] correct and will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Goldsborough, </em>330 Md. 342, 347, 624 A.2d 503, 505 (1993). As to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, \u201cour consideration is essentially <em>de novo.\u201d Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Thompson, </em>367 Md. 315, 322, 786 A.2d 763, 768 (2001) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bris-coe, </em>357 Md. 554, 562, 745 A.2d 1037, 1041 (2000)). After a review of the record, we hold that the findings of fact of Judge Mason are not clearly erroneous, and the conclusions of law are supported by clear and convincing evidence. As noted earlier, Respondent did not file any exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law. We turn now to the appropriate sanction for Respondent\u2019s violations of the MRPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">We most recently considered the purpose behind the attorney grievance process and the role and appropriateness of sanctions to be imposed in that process in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Wallace, </em>368 Md. 277, 289, 793 A.2d 535, 543 (2002), when we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">\u2018It is well-settled that the purpose of disciplinary proceedings is to protect the public rather than to punish the erring attorney.\u2019 \u2018The public interest is served when this Court imposes a sanction which demonstrates to members of this legal profession the type of conduct that will not be tolerated.\u2019 \u2018By imposing such a sanction, this Court fulfills its responsibility to insist upon the maintenance of the integrity of the Bar and to prevent the transgression of an individual lawyer from bringing its image into disrepute.\u2019 \u2018Therefore, the public interest is served when sanctions designed to effect general and specific deterrence are imposed on an attorney who violates the disciplinary rules.\u2019 \u2018Of course, what the appropriate sanction for the particular misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>is, in the public interest, generally depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-6\"><em>Wallace, </em>368 Md. at 289, 793 A.2d at 542-43 (internal quotations omitted) (citations omitted). <em>See also Harris, </em>366 Md. at 405, 784 A.2d at 532-22; <em>Zdravkovich, </em>362 Md. at 31-32, 762 A.2d at 966 (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 96, 753 A.2d 17, 38 (2000) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Citing the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (ABA Standards) \u00a7 4.41(b) (1986 and 1992 Amendments), Bar Counsel contends here that \u201cfdjisbarment is generally appropriate when ... (b) a lawyer knowingly fails to perform services for a client and causes serious or potentially serious injury to a client;.... \u201d Petitioner argues that Respondent\u2019s actions in the instant case warrant disbarment in light of his \u201cabandonment of Mr. Park\u2019s two legal matters and his misrepresentation to Mr. Park concerning the status of the Chi matter.\u201d Petitioner notes that this matter is further aggravated by Respondent\u2019s failure to respond to the Attorney Grievance Commission in the course of its investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Petitioner also reminds us that Respondent has been disciplined on two prior occasions. In the first case, on 29 March 1996, Respondent received a private reprimand for his violation of MRPC 1.3, 1.4, 1.15, and 8.1, relating to his lack of diligence; his failure to communicate with his client; his failure to account for his client\u2019s funds when the representation of this client was terminated; and his failure to respond to requests of Bar Counsel in a matter. Less than two years latter, on 25 February 1998, Respondent received a sixty day suspension (by consent) with regard to two unrelated complaints. In the first complaint, which related to the March 1996 complaint for which Respondent received a private reprimand, Respondent was found to have \u201cfailed to promptly remit funds which he had collected [for] the client\u201d in violation of MRPC 1.3 and 1.15(a),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as well as failing to \u201crespond to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>requests for information by Bar Counsel\u201d in violation of MRPC 8.1. The second complaint was a reciprocal discipline case from the District of Columbia,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in which Respondent was determined to be in violation of MRPC 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), and 8.4(a) and (d) for \u201cfailing] to act with reasonable diligence and fail[ing] to keep his client reasonably informed,\u201d and which said conduct resulted in his client being subjected to a \u201cdefault judgment as well as contempt proceedings.\u201d Respondent\u2019s sixty day suspension was implemented on the condition that his practice be monitored for a period of two years, and that he continue with psychological counseling for two years. The monitoring of Respondent\u2019s practice ended in February 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In our consideration of the appropriate sanction in an attorney disciplinary action, this Court may consider, as a nonexclusive list, the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">\u2018[Ajbsence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-7\"><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Jaseb, </em>364 Md. 464, 481-82, 773 A.2d 516, 526 (2001) (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 488-89, 671 A.2d 463, 483 (1996) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Considering all of the circumstances in this case, we conclude that the appropriate sanction to be imposed in this matter is disbarment. Respondent\u2019s immediate violations, coupled with the relative currency of his prior disciplinary record for much the same or similar misconduct, indicate a persistent pattern of behavior. Moreover, Respondent\u2019s continuing disregard for the attorney grievance process, his apparent indifference to the tenets of his chosen profession, the dereliction of his duties to his client, and his ostensible lack of remorse for his misconduct, warrant a sanction of this severity. Respondent offers this Court no circumstances to mitigate or extenuate his neglect of Mr. Park\u2019s two legal matters. Respondent\u2019s misconduct is particularly troublesome in light of his client\u2019s limited ability to speak and understand English,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> necessitating heightened reliance upon Respondent to assist him in navigating an unfamiliar legal system. We recognize by our action here the need to protect the public from further victimization by a recalcitrant attorney and to motivate other attorneys \u201cto adopt appropriate practices in the future,\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. David, </em>331 Md. 317, 323-24, 628 A.2d 178, 181 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Similar to Respondent\u2019s misconduct in the present matter, in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Wallace, </em>368 Md. 277, 288, 793 A.2d 535, 542 (2002), an attorney was determined to be in violation of the MRPC El, 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 1.5(a),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 1.15(a) and (b),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 1.16(a)(2) and (d), 3.2,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 8.1(b), and 8.4(c) and (d), in connection with six complaints. Even though that attorney did not have a prior disciplinary record, this Court stated nevertheless that his \u201clack of diligence, his lack of preparation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>his failure to communicate with his clients, his charging of unreasonable fees, his failure to account for and return monies, his misrepresentations,\u201d and his repeated failure to comply with Bar Counsel\u2019s requests required \u201cthe most severe sanction of disbarment.\u201d <em>Wallace, </em>368 Md. at 293, 793 A.2d at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Manning, </em>318 Md. 697, 569 A.2d 1250 (1990), disbarment was warranted where it was found that the attorney failed to diligently pursue his clients\u2019 interests, failed to communicate with his clients, and repeatedly failed to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information in connection with four complaints. . At the time of the hearing, the attorney was serving a suspension in connection with similar misconduct stemming from four complaints in a prior disciplinary action. The charges under review in the second proceeding occurred during the same time period as the previous complaints. In reviewing the appropriate sanction in the second proceeding, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">In recent years, ... we have noticed too many instances when lawyers have agreed to represent clients and accepted fees, in part or in whole, only to completely neglect these same legal problems, causing the same clients emotional distress, financial loss, or other varying kinds of inconvenience. More often than not, these situations have been exacerbated by the .lack of respect and attention extended to the courts, as evidenced by the failure to file timely pleadings or to make appearances as scheduled before the court to enable proceedings to be conducted.
