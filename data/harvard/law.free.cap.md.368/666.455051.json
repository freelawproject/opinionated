This relationship, absent constitutional amendments, cannot be unreasonably abrogated by federal or state statutes, federal or state regulations, administrative practices, by the need to qualify for federal or state funds, or by the \u201csafer course doctrine.\u201d These rights are the same where parents or children are alleged to be disabled. Under our Constitutions, the poor and the disabled are no less citizens entitled to the full range of constitutional protections. The Constitutions apply in the social welfare area as fully as in any other area of American life. There is a strong presumption in matters relating to termination of parental rights cases, that the \u201cbest interests\u201d of a child, generally, are met by not terminating the parental rights of natural parents. In termination of parental rights cases, it is this presumption that most insures the proper deference to a parent\u2019s fundamental and constitutional right to parent. It is from this perspective that we commence our review of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">I. Parenting as a Fundamental Right</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Certain fundamental rights are protected under the Constitutions. Among those rights is the right to child rearing, <em>i.e., </em>parenting. Supreme Court case law has consistently reaffirmed parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">We recently stated in <em>Boswell v. Boswell, </em>352 Md. 204, 217-20, 721 A.2d 662, 668-69 (1998), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-10\">\u201cA parent has a fundamental right to the care and custody of his or her child. The United States Supreme Court has upheld the rights of parents regarding the care, custody, and management of their children in several contexts, including child rearing, education, and religion. <em>See Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>15 (1972) (overturning a mandatory schooling law in the face of Amish claims of parental authority and religious liberty); <em>Stanley v.

The United States Supreme Court has long avowed the basic civil right encompassed by child rearing and family life. <em>See Troxel v.

Maryland, too, has declared a parent\u2019s interest in raising a child to be so fundamental that it \u2018cannot be taken away unless clearly justified.\u2019 <em>Boswell v.

Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982), the Supreme Court of the United States reaffirmed the rights of parents when there are allegations of neglect and they are involved in a proceeding to terminate their parental rights. Prior to <em>Santosky, </em>some states had terminated parental rights based upon a minimal standard of a \u201cfair preponderance of the evidence.\u201d In <em>Santosky, </em>the Supreme Court held that, \u201cthe \u2018fair preponderance of the evidence\u2019 standard ... violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 768, 102 S.Ct. at 1402, 71 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>L.Ed.2d at 616. The Court concluded that in order to terminate a parent-child relationship, a \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard of proof was needed. Before the Court addressed the prop\u00e9r standard to use in termination proceedings, it again recognized the weight given to parental rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABJq\">\u201cThe fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the State. Even when blood relationships are strained, parents retain a vital interest in preventing the <em>irretrievable </em>destruction of their family life. If anything, persons faced with forced dissolution of their parental rights have a more critical need for procedural protections than do those resisting state intervention into ongoing family affairs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 753, 102 S.Ct. at 1394-95, 71 L.Ed.2d at 606 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The applicable State laws, in order to meet the requirements of the Federal Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, contain certain protections for parents. First, Maryland law presumes that reunification with the natural parent is in the child\u2019s \u201cbest interest.\u201d Additionally, Maryland\u2019s law requires that the court must consider the nature and extent of services offered by the child placement agency to facilitate reunion of the child with the natural parent prior to a termination of parental rights. Specifically, Maryland Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), section 5-313 of the Family Law Article, the section at issue in this case, bolsters Maryland\u2019s already stringent statutory standards that must be satisfied before termination of parental rights can occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Not only have Maryland courts long recognized this notion of the fundamental right to rear a child, but the courts have emphasized that this fundamental right may not be terminated unless clearly justified. In <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. 99, 105, 642 A.2d 201, 204 (1994), we noted: \u201cMaryland receives considerable federal funds pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>this [federal] Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Maryland General Assembly has enacted legislation to comply with the federal requirements.\u201d \u201cOne of the most important purposes of this law was to eliminate foster care drift by requiring states to adopt statutes to facilitate permanent placement for children as a condition to receiving federal funding for their foster care and adoption assistance programs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104, 642 A.2d at 204. Nonetheless, we held that: \u201cFirst and foremost, the department must consider returning the child to the child\u2019s natural parents or guardians.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105, 642 A.2d at 204-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Kathleen A. Bailie, <em>The Other \u201cNeglected\u201d Parties in Child Protection Proceedings: the Parents in Poverty and the Role of the Lawyers Who Represent Them, </em>66 Fordham L.Rev. 2285, 2293-2331 (May, 1998) notes problems with the application by local agencies of the Act\u2019s provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">\u201c[T]he [Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997(ASF) ], which shortens the time that families have to work toward reunification and speeds up the termination of parental rights and adoption processes, was passed largely in reaction to the most terrible cases of child abuse<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in our nation. While concern for the safety and well-being of the nation\u2019s children is a laudable goal, the ASF may actually harm some children in the process: Because this new piece of federal legislation mainly contemplates cases of severe child abuse and maltreatment, poor families who are in the child welfare system because of suspected neglect may soon be ignored.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">Cases that involve poverty as neglect are perhaps the most compelling candidates for family preservation and reunification services. Unfortunately, poverty is also a deeply-rooted problem and, thus, one that cannot be alleviated quickly. As such, the ASF\u2019s new time lines for child protective cases may actually work to tear apart families <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>who would otherwise have succeeded in rebuilding their lives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">Finally, charges of neglect effectively render poor parents powerless. The strain of having one\u2019s children taken away is extremely distressing for parents in poverty, who are often undereducated and unworldly. This stressful situation weakens parents and, therefore, further exacerbates the imbalance of power that already favors the state in child protection proceedings. The state is clearly in control in neglect proceedings, for not only does it present the case to the court, but its \u2018adversary,\u2019 the parent, is unfamiliar with the intricacies of the legal proceedings. As such, parents are often unable to effectively assert their rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">The newest piece of federal legislation affecting the child welfare system \u2014 The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 \u2014 may continue to disserve poor and needy families. Intended to make children\u2019s health and safety the primary focus of child protective proceedings, the ASF forces child welfare officials to give up on parents sooner than before. Because indigent parents may have difficulty correcting their families\u2019 situations with the speed with which the federal government now requires, the ASF may actually work to hurt children by dissolving loving, salvageable families.\u201d [Alterations in original.] [Endnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Additionally, although we need not decide its applicability in the present case, Congress has also recognized that the rights of the disabled are no less protected. The Americans With Disabilities Act is an expression of federal public policy in all areas.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Chris Watkins, <em>Beyond Status: The Americans with </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number><em>Disabilities Act and the Parental Rights of People Labeled Developmentally Disabled or Mentally Retarded, </em>82 Cal.L.Rev. 1415, 1469 (1995), notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">\u201cTitle II essentially protects all qualified individuals with a disability from discrimination in the programs and activities of all public entities, including state legislatures and courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">There is nothing in the regulatory language to suggest that this directive should not apply to legislatures enacting laws, or to judges making decisions about parental rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Accordingly, when attempting to comply with the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, agencies and the courts, must, at the least, recognize that Congress has also expressed a concern that extra steps be taken to insure that the disabled are not subject to discrimination, however inadvertent it may be in a given case.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Due to the importance and role of the federal and state statutes generally and in this case specifically, and because it is also within the context of the federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 and Title 5 of the Maryland Family Law Article that we address the case <em>sub judice, </em>we include a portion of <em>In re: Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. 99, 103-06, 642 A.2d 201, 203-05 (1994). Judge Karwacki, writing for the Court, comprehensively addressed the state and federal statutory scheme relating to child adoption, which can lead, as it did here, to the potential termination of parental rights. Judge Karwacki stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-9\">\u201cThe Maryland General Assembly has enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme to address those situations where a child is at risk because of his or her parents\u2019 inability or unwillingness to care for him or her. Title 5 of the Family Law Article of the Maryland Code (1984, 1991 RepLVol.) (hereinafter \u2018F.L.\u2019) governs the custody, guardianship, adoption and general protection of children who because of abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>or neglect<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> come within the purview of the Department of Human Resources....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\">During the 1970\u2019s, nationwide concern grew regarding the large number of children who remained out of the homes of their biological parents throughout their childhood, frequently moved from one foster care situation to another, thereby reaching majority without belonging to a permanent family. This phenomenon became known as \u2018foster care drift\u2019 and resulted in the enactment by Congress of Public Law 96-272, the \u2018Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980,\u2019 codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 610-679 (1998). One of the importance purposes of this law was to eliminate foster care drift by requiring states to adopt statutes to facilitate permanent placement for children as a condition to receiving federal funding for their foster care and adoption assistance programs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">Under the federal act, a state is required, among other things, to provide a written case plan for each child for whom the state claims federal foster care maintenance payments. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671(a)(16). The case plan must include a description of the home or institution into which the child is placed, a discussion of the appropriateness of the placement, and a description of the services provided to the parents, child and foster parents to facilitate return of the child to his or her own home or to establish another permanent placement for the child. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675(1). The state must also implement a case review system that provides for administrative review of the case plan at least every six months and judicial review no later than eighteen months after placement and periodically thereafter. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675(5)(B) and (C). The purpose of the judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>review is to \u2018determine the future status of the child\u2019 including whether the child should be returned to its biological parents, continued in foster care for a specified period, placed for adoption, or because of the child\u2019s special needs or circumstances, continued in foster care on a long term basis. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 675(5)(C).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-4\">Maryland receives considerable federal funds pursuant to this Act. Accordingly, the Maryland General Assembly has enacted legislation to comply with the federal requirements. Under Maryland\u2019s statutory scheme, for those children committed to a local department of social services the department is required to develop and implement a permanency plan that is in the best interest of the child. F.L. \u00a7 5-525.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">In developing the permanency plan, the department is required to consider a statutory hierarchy of placement options in descending order of priority. F.L. \u00a7 5-525(c). First and foremost, the department must consider returning the child to the child\u2019s natural parents or guardians. If reunification with the biological parents is not possible, the department must consider placing the child with relatives to whom adoption, guardianship, or care or custody, in descending order of priority, are planned to be granted. If placement with relatives is not possible, then the department must consider adoption by a current foster parent or other approved adoptive family....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">... If the circuit court finds by clear and convincing evidence, after considering the statutorily enumerated factors, that it is in the best interest of a child previously adjudicated a CINA for parental rights to be terminated, the circuit court has authority to grant the department\u2019s petition for guardianship. Such award carries with it the right for the department to consent to the adoption of the child. F.L. \u00a7\u00a7 5-311 and 5-317(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">The overriding theme of both the federal and state legislation is that a child should have permanency in his or her life.... Thus, Title 5 of the Family Law Article seeks to prevent the need for removal of a child from its home, to return a child to its home when possible, and where re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>turning home is not possible, to place the child in another permanent placement that has legal status.\u201d [Some citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">We now turn to the facts of the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">II. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">On July 10, 1997, the Carroll County Department of Social Services (CCDSS) filed a Petition for Guardianship with the Right to Consent to Adoption or Long-Term Care Short of Adoption of Mr. F.\u2019s (petitioner) minor children, Tristynn D. (Tristynn) and Edward F. (Edward), and for the termination of petitioner\u2019s parental rights as to the minor children. The children\u2019s natural mother, Ms. H., consented to the termination of her parental rights as to both children prior to the filing of the petition. The termination of parental rights (TPR) hearing began on June 23, 1998 and took a total of five days over the course of more than a year.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On August 22, 2000, following the conclusion of the hearings, the Circuit Court for Carroll County issued a Memorandum and Order terminating petitioner\u2019s parental rights and granting CCDSS guardianship of the minor children with the right to consent to adoption and/or long-term care short of adoption. Petitioner noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from that Order. In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">On June 11, 2001, petitioner filed a Petition for Certiorari and the Public Justice Center filed a Petition and Memorandum in Support thereof and asked to participate as amici curiae. We granted both petitions on August 15, 2001. Peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>tioner presents, in his brief to this Court, the propriety of the trial court\u2019s termination of his parental rights. For the reasons stated herein, we reverse the orders of the trial court and intermediate appellate court that terminated petitioner\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">III. Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The oldest of the two sons, Tristynn, was born on June 18, 1995 to petitioner and Ms. H. who were never married and their relationship at the time of the births of both children was apparently volatile. Petitioner testified that he has permanently terminated his relationship with Ms. H. and avoids contact with her. There was no evidence in the record to the contrary. Mrs. H. ultimately abandoned the children and consented to termination of her parental rights. In consolidated cases J-96-10436 and J-96-10624, each child was adjudicated to be in need of assistance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">For approximately six months after his birth, Tristynn lived with petitioner and Ms. H. Tristynn subsequently came into the care of CCDSS on December 28, 1995, at the age of six months, when petitioner went to CCDSS and asked for help in caring for his child. Petitioner testified that there was no electricity in the apartment where the family had been living at the time he brought Tristynn to CCDSS and that he had no food to feed Tristynn. There was no other evidence bearing on the issue of neglect and no evidence of abuse. Petitioner stated that \u201c[I] thought [I] was going to get [my] kids back once [I] got [my] electricity turned back on.\u201d When his children were not returned to him, an adversarial relationship between petitioner and CCDSS came into existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">CCDSS placed Tristynn in foster care, and on April 25,1996 Tristynn went to live with his maternal aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. W. Eventually, on April 30, 1997, Mr. and Mrs. W. told CCDSS that they could no longer care for Tristynn; he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>was then placed with petitioner\u2019s aunt and uncle, who were licensed foster care parents.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">On May 30, 1996, Edward was born and he tested positive at birth for amphetamines and had severe medical problems. Edward was treated for two weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Edward\u2019s mother abused alcohol, over the counter medication, and marijuana during her pregnancy, but it is not certain whether her behavior caused Edward\u2019s medical conditions. Edward entered the care of CCDSS on June 18, 1996 when he was three weeks old, at which time he was immediately placed in foster care with non-relatives Mr. and Mrs. M.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The initial permanency plan for both children was to return them to the home of either parent. On May 13,1997, petitioner was informed that CCDSS\u2019s permanency plan had changed from a plan of reunification to guardianship with the right to consent to adoption. That plan was adopted by the court on June 10,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">The adequacy of the reunification services provided to petitioner by CCDSS are disputed. CCDSS claims that the services provided to petitioner were adequate and ultimately unsuccessful. We shall hold that they were not adequate. Specifically, CCDSS states that shortly after Tristynn entered foster care, CCDSS began arranging for him to have supervised visits with petitioner,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and CCDSS claims that they had scheduling problems with petitioner from the beginning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>visitation. CCDSS testified that the initial visitation schedule had to be changed frequently to accommodate petitioner\u2019s work schedule and that on at least one occasion petitioner cancelled a visit at the last minute. Further, CCDSS claims that during his early visits with the children, petitioner demonstrated trouble in caring for the children, was unable to remember child care techniques repeatedly shown to him by the social worker, had difficulty in choosing age-appropriate toys for the children, and was not able to help Tristynn with his beginning verbal skills. Moreover, CCDSS states that in later supervised visits when petitioner started seeing Tristynn and Edward together, petitioner needed supervision and direction to understand how to properly care for the two children, how to give them both proper attention when the children are together, and to understand the special medical and dietary needs of Edward.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Additionally, CCDSS states that other than visitation, petitioner did not request additional services from CCDSS, and went so far as to deny his need for services. The social worker assigned to assist petitioner claimed petitioner was not cooperative, was not truthful, and provided inadequate information.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Finally, unlike CCDSS\u2019s usual practice of entering into a new service agreement every six months with those seeking assistance, CCDSS entered into only one Social Services Agreement with petitioner (on July 3, 1996) that had the goal of reunification. The agreement required petitioner to obtain electricity in his apartment, attend parenting classes, complete a domestic violence program, complete an alcohol and drug evaluation, submit to random urine analysis, confirm in advance his intent to keep scheduled visits, be completely truthful with the CCDSS, and remain drug and alcohol free.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Petitioner attended parenting classes, as well as a parents anonymous group, but the social worker believed that petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>er made very little progress. Petitioner finished the first phase of a domestic violence program, but allegedly could not complete the second phase due to his alleged cognitive limitations. Also, petitioner completed a drug and alcohol evaluation, with the evaluator concluding that he did not need treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">A social worker also noted that petitioner never prepared a household budget, presumably for when reunification occurred, or came up with a plan for child care other than suggesting that a family member living close by could care for them. According to CCDSS, petitioner has a reduced mental capacity that renders him incapable of parenting the children on his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Insofar as we have been able to discern from the record, CCDSS never offered any specialized services designed to be particularly helpful to a parent with the intellectual and cognitive skill levels CCDSS alleges are possessed by petitioner. We are informed by the amicus brief that such services are available. They include, according to petitioner\u2019s expert witness, Mr. Hardesty:<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201ccase management services,\u201d \u201cfamily and individual support services,\u201d \u201ccommunity supported living arrangement services,\u201d \u201cdrop in services,\u201d and \u201cDivision of Vocational Rehabilitation\u201d services. Other witnesses testified that financial advising services, family support services, and other programs were available from various entities such as Chance, Flying Colors to Success, Target, various Association Retarded Citizens (ARC) entities, and numerous other entities, private and public. None of these services were utilized by CCDSS.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, the record does not reflect that CCDSS sought to utilize services that might be available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>through the Developmental Disabilities Administration, even though it was relying in its drive toward termination on the fact that in the opinion of its workers, petitioner was disabled by reason of mental impairment. (Their term, not ours.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We emphasize that a person of one particular intelligence quotient level may be different from another, but neither of them is impaired or enhanced. He or she is simply what they are. There are no inherently lesser beings in the eyes of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Petitioner counters the allegations of CCDSS that they provided him with sufficient services by claiming that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>services offered by CCDSS to him were minimal, inadequate, and inappropriate for his particular situation. Moreover, petitioner proffers that he has completed his education, obtained a driver\u2019s license, has secured employment, and maintains his own residence, indicating that he can, in fact, parent his own children.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Specifically, petitioner claims that while CCDSS did refer him for parenting classes, asked for him to complete a domestic violence program, and referred him for a drug and alcohol evaluation, CCDSS failed to offer petitioner services in a significant manner- \u2014 in a manner reasonable for him. In other words, CCDSS did not offer reunification services tailored to address petitioner\u2019s alleged needs. Petitioner asserts that CCDSS did not fulfill its role as a social service department by seeking out programs specific to petitioner\u2019s parenting deficiencies, programs that would aid in the primary and ultimate goal of reunification. The failure, it is argued, of CCDSS to address its services to his specific need has a discriminatory impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">We note that CCDSS apparently did not even offer petitioner services to assist him with literacy, even after petitioner signed the July 3,1996 Social Services Agreement and fulfilled the obligations it set forth. Petitioner emphasizes how, even after CCDSS changed from a plan for reunification to a plan for guardianship with the right to consent to adoption, he continued to attend parenting classes, participate in Parent\u2019s Anonymous, and continued all that he had been doing, including visiting on a regular basis.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Additionally, until the decision by the Court of Special Appeals, petitioner visited with both children consistently, for roughly two hours per week. He was doing all he was asked to do, and proffers that he was not being offered participation in numerous programs that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>should have been offered to the type of person he was alleged to be by CCDSS.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Additionally, there was evidence that in the fall of 1997, at CCDSS\u2019s request, Neil Blumberg, M.D., conducted a psychiatric evaluation of petitioner. Dr. Blumberg reported <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that petitioner suffered from a serious intellectual impairment and categorized petitioner as disabled and unfit to parent. Dr. Blumberg noted that standard testing was not and could not be completed because of petitioner\u2019s inability to read well.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">CCDSS\u2019s and the lower court\u2019s reliance on the specific report and testimony of Dr. Blumberg in this case to support their assessment of petitioner\u2019s mental capabilities was inappropriate. Dr. Blumberg\u2019s testimony was, admittedly, conjectural and speculative. A parent\u2019s right to parent should rarely, if ever, be terminated based upon conjectures and speculation. The record even reflects that there was little basis for the conjectures and speculation furnished by Dr. Blumberg. Additionally, Dr. Blumberg also failed to furnish his opinions to any degree of medical probability. We presume he was called to testify as a medical expert as that is his apparent field of expertise.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>When responding to questions as to why he did not perform tests on petitioner that are sometimes utilized to measure intelligence quotient and adaptability levels, Dr. Blumberg testified: \u2018Well I would <em>probably </em>categorize his intellectual impairment as \u2014 a disability. I mean, it really does hamper him; he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2014he cannot read, his judgment is very limited.\u201d (Emphasis added.) He also testified: \u201cUsually, I\u2019ll give an individual the Minnesota Multi-facet Personality Inventory\u2014 MMPI \u2014 but, Mr. F. was unable to read, so the test couldn\u2019t be administered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">We are informed by the amicus brief that the MMPI is not used to measure mental \u201cretardation.\u201d Moreover, the application and use of the MMPI are not limited only to people that can read. The extent to which Dr. Blumberg relies on a person\u2019s inability to read in order to find mental \u201cimpairment\u201d or \u201cretardation\u201d is troubling, especially when it is used in proceedings to determine whether to terminate parental rights. There remain, regrettably, large portions of our population that are described as illiterate. In the past, major portions of our population have been illiterate. Many newcomers to our country may not be literate in languages understood by experts who do not speak their language. We would also suspect that illiteracy is disproportionately present among the poor. While literacy, when present, is a very positive aspect of parenting, it is not the only, or even the predominant, factor in being a parent. It is only one of many.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Ultimately, Dr. Blumberg proffered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">\u201cQ. [Petitioner] is intellectually impaired enough that he couldn\u2019t be a fit parent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">A. I think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">Q. Okay. Could you be wrong?'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-11\">A. That certainly is a possibility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">Dr. Blumberg\u2019s speculation is of insufficient evidentiary value for all of the reasons stated above. Moreover, a parent should not, normally, be deprived permanently of his or her fundamental parental rights upon a response to such a question of, \u201cI think so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>In contrast, C. Michael Hardesty, an expert in developmental disabilities, who was petitioner\u2019s employment supervisor at United Cerebral Palsy, testified on petitioner\u2019s behalf. Mr. Hardesty testified to petitioner\u2019s strong work ethic, and to petitioner\u2019s duties as a house counselor for United Cerebral Palsy. Specifically, Mr. Hardesty stated that petitioner\u2019s duties had included providing assistance like toileting, dressing, and feeding to persons with profound disabilities, such as quadriplegia.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Some CCDSS caseworkers<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> overseeing petitioner\u2019s file and sitting in on supervised visitations of petitioner and his children testified that petitioner did, in fact, need a high amount of supervision at the visitation sessions to care for the children, and that, in their view, unsupervised visitation would endanger the safety of the children. The caseworkers, however, did recognize that petitioner attempted to bring food, albeit food Edward was not always able to eat, engaged the children in play, and demonstrated an ability to learn and improve his parenting skills through his progress in paying attention to and caring for the children. For instance, petitioner acted appropriately during the visits and sought to teach the children to wash their hands and share. Also, the caseworkers testified that Tristynn called petitioner \u201cDada\u201d and was happy to see petitioner, and while the visits with Edward were more difficult for petitioner, Edward would at times seek petitioner for comfort. Finally, a social worker observing some of the visits testified that when petitioner needed assistance with the children during the visits he knew to ask for help, and that while, in her view, he was not currently ready for unsupervised visitation, given the opportunity, petitioner could learn the necessary skills. In essence, even CCDSS testified to a certain degree that reunification in the future was reasonably possible, if not probable.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Petitioner is a thirty-eight-year-old African-American male. He graduated from high school in 1982 and has maintained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>steady employment as a maintenance/cleaning person, a cook, and for six years as a house counselor \u2014 all since his graduation from high school. Petitioner has acknowledged his difficulty with reading and he has enrolled, voluntarily and without prompting from CCDSS, in remedial reading classes to improve his reading ability. He has attended parenting classes two times per week for approximately three and a half years and he has attended Parents Anonymous. Petitioner has little history of drug or alcohol abuse, and no history of child abuse or willful neglect. He now lives in a two bedroom townhouse, which includes a bedroom for himself and one which would be shared by the boys were they to be allowed to live with him. He testified that his parents live close to his home and that if he were to encounter problems with the children while in his care, he would know to call his parents or CCDSS for help. Finally, petitioner contends that the short visits under supervised conditions, which is all that CCDSS now permits, render it nearly impossible to establish any regularity with the children, but that with assistance from the appropriate sources he can successfully parent his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Since the childrens\u2019 placement in foster care, the record reflects that the children are both adjusting well to, and doing well in, their foster homes. Tristynn had several placements during his first sixteen months in foster care. On April 30, 1997, Tristynn was placed with petitioner\u2019s aunt and uncle (Mr. and Mrs. F.). He is still under their care. Although showing some developmental delays, Tristynn is described as happy and is comfortable with his foster parents, but shows affection for petitioner and displays no negative reactions after visits. Mr. and Mrs. F. wish to adopt Tristynn, but expect Tristynn to continue his relationship with petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Edward, upon his release from the hospital at about two weeks old, was placed with Mr. and Mrs. M., licensed foster parents with training to care for special needs children. Despite his medical problems, which require regular monitoring because of a cyst on his brain and food and environmental allergies, he has adjusted well in foster care. Mr. and Mrs. M. want Edward to know his father, but stated that Edward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>has had difficulty in visiting with petitioner and seems irritable after visits. Mr. and Mrs. M. wish to adopt Edward at the end of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">IV. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">a. Adoption \u2014 Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Maryland Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), section 5-313 of the Family Law Article (FL)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> mandates that the trial court follow the standard set forth therein when determining whether parental rights are to be terminated. That section reads, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">\u201c(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 A court may grant a decree of adoption or a decree of guardianship, without the consent of a natural parent otherwise required by \u00a7\u00a7 5-311 and 5-317 of this subtitle, if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that it is in the best interest of the child to terminate the natural parent\u2019s rights as to the child and that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-9\">(2) in a prior juvenile proceeding, the child has been adjudicated to be a child in need of assistance, a neglected child, an abused child, or a dependent child;

It is only when clear and convincing evidence exists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>that the child\u2019s best interests are served by termination, may a parent\u2019s constitutional right to parent his child be permanently foreclosed. In our view, in the instant case, considering the allegations made by CCDSS as to petitioner\u2019s mental capacity, the parenting and reunification services offered to petitioner were not sufficient and not sufficiently tailored to his alleged specific situation to support a finding that, with sufficient and properly tailored services, he could not maintain a parental relationship with his children. (Sec.5 \u2014 313(c) (2)(i)). There was evidence of only one reunification agreement between the natural parent and CCDSS. The agreement that petitioner was required to enter into, was, as we have said, deficient in its specific application to his needs. Even then, the evidence supports that petitioner made a major effort to fulfill his obligations under that agreement, albeit limited somewhat by his then reading level. While there may be no easily ascertainable levels of assistance that must be offered when the termination of parental rights of a \u201cdisabled\u201d parent is involved, that level is far above the minimal services CCDSS offered in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Additionally, on his own, petitioner sought help in improving his reading ability and thus his level of literacy. (Sec.5-313(c)(2)(ii)). The children had bonded well with foster parents, but also appeared to display feelings and some bonding with petitioner. (Sec.5 \u2014 313(c)(2)(iii)).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The children, while apparently well adjusted to their foster parents and foster homes, also appeared comfortable with petitioner when he was permitted to be with them. Neither child was in school and there was no evidence as to any community adjustment. (Sec.5 \u2014 313(c) (2) (iv)).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>There was uncontradicted evidence that petitioner had made extensive and extraordinary efforts to further reunification with his children. He had, to the best of his ability, attempted to do almost everything asked of him, and more, in order to become a capable parent. Additionally, he currently had steady employment, and had been steadily employed for extended periods of time. He had living facilities that included a bedroom for the children. There is no evidence that the facility, itself, was presently unsuitable. There were relatives nearby that could offer assistance upon request. His employment had consisted of assisting disabled persons in assisted care living situations. (Sec.5-313(c)(2)(v)). In so far as the record reflects, he maintained as regular a contact with his children as CCDSS would permit. (Sec.5-313(c)(2)(v) 1). There is little evidence to which we have been directed in the record that he has declined to contribute to the payment of the expenses of his children, or, for that matter, that he is at the present time unable to contribute to their support. (Sec.5-313(c)(2)(v) 2). The record reflects that petitioner has attempted to maintain regular contact with his children but that, to some degree, he has been stymied in his attempts by the position taken by CCDSS. (Sec.5-313(c)(2)(v) 3). The evidence is unclear as to whether additional services, specific to petitioner\u2019s needs, would bring about lasting parental adjustments facilitating reunification. Nevertheless, it is clear that only regular services hav\u00e9 been offered under a single reunification program. It is asserted by petitioner, and by his expert witness, and amicus curiae that additional services that are particularly appropriate for someone in petitioner\u2019s situation are available, but have never been offered to him. It is thus unclear, and certainly not to a clear and convincing standard, that proper additional services could not bring about an adjustment that would permit reunification in the reasonable future. Until such services are offered, and petitioner avails or does not avail himself of such services, it is not clear that reunification is unforeseeable. (Sec.5-313(c)(2)(v) 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Equally, we do not believe that the evidence presented below satisfies the clear and convincing standard as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>conditions or acts under section 5-313(d). As we indicate elsewhere, there is little evidence, as opposed to conjecture, that petitioner was inherently disabled to such an extent that he would be unable to care for the needs of the children for considerable periods of time. (Sec.5-313(d)(l)(i)). He had, in fact, cared for the needs of other disabled persons as a part of his steady employment. He could not adequately read, but was taking classes to address that deficiency. He was a high school graduate. He had adequate living facilities. There was no scientific evidence that he was mentally impaired \u2014 that was an assumption that was made by CCDSS and Dr. Blum-berg, who apparently presumed that he was, but undertook no tests to establish the extent, if any, of such impairment. Dr. Blumberg was of the perhaps mistaken opinion that the tests to determine the extent of impairment could not be given to someone who could not read. There was no evidence that petitioner had ever committed acts of abuse or willful neglect in respect to the children. In fact, when he was unable to care for Tristynn for a temporary period he approached CCDSS seeking assistance. (Sec.o \u2014 313(d)(l)(ii)). There is no evidence that the petitioner <em>\u201crepeatedly\u201d </em>failed to give his children adequate food, shelter, etc. The only evidence in the record is that on the one occasion when he was unable to care for a child, he went to CCDSS seeking assistance. Since that moment, he has not had custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">One of the children was apparently bom with health problems related to the drug addiction of the mother, not the petitioner. There is little evidence that the petitioner had, or has, any alcohol or drug problems. Nonetheless, he attended all drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs to which he was referred, only to have those programs conclude that he had no such problems. (Sec.5 \u2014 313(d)(l)(iv)(l) and (2). There is no evidence that the petitioner ever subjected either of the children to torture, chronic abuse, or sexual abuse. The only time that there was any evidence of neglect it was not chronic or life-threatening, and, in fact, petitioner sought assistance from CCDSS. One is not neglecting children when he seeks assistance from CCDSS. (Sec.5-313(d)(l)(v)(l). There is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>evidence that the petitioner has ever been convicted of any criminal offense. (Sec.5 \u2014 313(d)(1)(v)(2). Other than the children at issue in the instant case, there is no evidence that petitioner has ever lost parental rights of the children\u2019s siblings. (Sec.5-313(d)(1)(v)(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">This law clearly establishes that the relevant standard in TPR proceedings is to be by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d and what is in \u201cthe best interest of the child.\u201d In <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 705-06, 782 A.2d 332, 343 (2001), we recently reiterated the importance of the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard within the context of the Family Law Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-6\">\u201cPursuant to the doctrine of <em>parens patriae, </em>the State of Maryland has an interest in caring for those, such as minors, who cannot care for themselves. <em>See Boswell, </em>352 Md. at 218-19, 721 A.2d at 669. We have held that \u2018the best interests of the child may take precedence over the parent\u2019s liberty interest in the course of a custody, visitation, or adoption dispute.\u2019 <em>Boswell, </em>352 Md. at 219, 721 A.2d at 669; <em>see also In re Adoption No. 10941, </em>335 Md. at 113, 642 A.2d at 208 (stating that \u2018the controlling factor ... is ... what best serves the interest of the child\u2019). That which will best promote the child\u2019s welfare becomes particularly consequential where the interests of a child are in jeopardy.... As we stated in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. A91-71A </em>334 Md. 538, 640 A.2d 1085 (1994), the child\u2019s welfare is \u2018a consideration that is of \u201ctranscendent importance\u2019 \u201d....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">In determining whether it is in the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the children, here Tristynn and Edward, to terminate completely a natural parent\u2019s relationships with his children, the court (the Circuit Court for Carroll County) was required to consider the factors listed in section 5-313(c) that we have extensively discussed above. We are well aware that the trial court \u201cis in the unique position to marshal the applicable facts, assess the situation, and determine the correct means of fulfilling a child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 707, 782 A.2d 332, 343-44 (2001). CCDSS argues in its brief how the Circuit Court in making its determination neither abused its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>discretion nor made findings that were clearly erroneous, and that the Court of Special Appeals supported the Circuit Court\u2019s findings and found the Circuit Court not to have abused its discretion. The Court of Special Appeals opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEG\">\u201cThe Circuit Court conducted hearings in the instant matter.... The court concluded that it was in the best interests of the children to terminate Mr. F.\u2019s parental rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">Based on the evidence, reviewed below, we cannot say that the Circuit Court was clearly erroneous in its factual determinations or that it abused its discretion by terminating Mr. F.\u2019s parental rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-6\"><em>In re Adoption/Guardianship Nos. J9610436 and J9711031, </em>No. 1579, slip op. at 4 (Court of Special Appeals May 11, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Upon our review of the record in this case, it is evident that there was not clear and convincing evidence in the record of this case sufficient to overcome the presumption that the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the children rest in the retention, generally, of petitioner\u2019s parental rights, <em>although at the present time actual custody may not he appropriate. </em>There was a failure to rebut by a clear and convincing standard the strong presumption that a child\u2019s \u201cbest interest\u201d is served by retaining legal relationships with his or her natural parents. The trial court erred in finding otherwise and abused its discretion in terminating petitioner\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">We hold that the trial court, in considering the factors under section 5-313(c) and 5-313(d), reached an erroneous conclusion that those factors had been sufficiently satisfied so as to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the best interests of the children would be better served by now terminating petitioner\u2019s fundamental constitutional right to be a parent to his children. We shall reverse the decisions of the intermediate court and the Circuit Court. In this case, when considering section 5-313 alone, and within the context of Title 5 of the Family Law Article as a whole, there was not ample <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>evidence to properly conclude that Mr. F.\u2019s disability, even if it exists, renders him permanently incapable of caring for his children in an unsupervised setting. Nor is there sufficient evidence that CCDSS has made adequate reunification efforts to improve petitioner\u2019s parenting skills. Certainly, there was not clear and convincing evidence to warrant a present termination of his parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">b. Decisions Below</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">A majority of the intermediate appellate court upheld the ruling of the Circuit Court for Carroll County that it was in the best interests of the children to not be returned to Mr. F.\u2019s home. In so doing, the Court of Special Appeals cited in its discussion a body of out of state case law addressing termination of parental rights cases with facts analogous to the facts in the case <em>sub judice. </em>There is case law elsewhere where parents, who were eager to keep and care for their children and participate in treatment plans, were stripped of parental rights because of one or both parent\u2019s m\u00e9ntal retardation, mild mental retardation, mental limitations, or mental deficiencies \u2014 despite the parent\u2019s lack of wrongdoing and presumed love. Relying on these cases,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s majority rejected Mr. F.\u2019s principal contention that he has not been given a sufficient opportunity to demonstrate that he is capable of reunification in the future and that it would be in the best interests of the children to continue efforts at improving his parenting skills with the goal of reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Additionally, the Circuit Court stated at one point: \u201cFurthermore, the Court finds that Tristynn and Edward have continuously been out of the custody of Mr. F. and in the custody of CCDSS for more than one year.\u201d In cases such as this, parents who undeniably love their children, as does Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>F., and seek assistance when assistance is needed, are placed at great risk of losing their children altogether. If they go to the Department of Social Services for help and if the Department places their children, even on a temporary basis, with foster parents with whom they bond (and that is the type of foster parents one hopes are found), the natural parent runs the very real risk of later having that bonding in the foster home, created, in part, by CCDSS and court forced inaccessibility to his own children, be a major factor used by the same court to later terminate his parental rights. In other words, if one seeks help, the removal of one\u2019s children may be forced upon him or her, setting in progress an ongoing situation that, day by day, week by week, year by year, through the passage of time, lessens the parent\u2019s bonds with the children and, through that de-bonding process, lessens chances of reunification. In such a process, a process that appears to inherently exist, parents risk the thing most dear to them when they seek assistance from the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The trial court also erroneously found that Mr. F.\u2019s mental limitations constituted a disability<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> that as section 5-813(d)(i) states, \u201crenders the natural parent consistently unable to care for the immediate and ongoing physical or psychological needs of the child for long periods of time.\u201d There was not sufficient evidence, meeting the clear and convincing standard, to support the trial court\u2019s determination that the complete termination of petitioner\u2019s parental rights was appropriate based upon a mental disability. The termination of fundamental and constitutional parental rights is a \u201cdrastic\u201d measure, and should only be taken with great caution, after extensive consideration of each of the relevant statutory considerations set forth in section 5-313. Our holding today reflects the idea that fundamental constitutional rights, <em>i.e., </em>the child rearing rights at issue here, can only be completely terminated upon the clearest and most convincing evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>that the parent, however poor, uneducated, or disabled, cannot and will not, even with proper assistance, be able to sufficiently parent his children in the reasonable future.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">In termination cases, the \u201cbest interests\u201d analysis should not be automatically interpreted to be a search for a perfect, or more perfect, or even a better situation for any particular child. Life is not perfect. Children are born into different circumstances \u2014 some into wealth and other advantage, some not.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Under the facts of the case <em>sub judice, </em>petitioner\u2019s parental rights should not have been terminated. Specifically, considering the insufficiency of clear and convincing evidence that petitioner was mentally disabled, CCDSS\u2019s non-conformance with its duties under section 5-313 to offer more fully tailored services to a parent it deemed mentally disabled, and the inherent pressure on a social service agency to seek adoption as a permanent situation when the agency\u2019s receipt of federal funds discourages extensive reunification efforts and encourages adoption, when compared with all the efforts petitioner has made to be a better parent, and with what petitioner can offer to the child \u2014 a termination of parental rights is presently unjustified and improperly strips Mr. F. of constitutionally guaranteed rights. There were significant failures in this case by CCDSS under section 5-313 with regard to petitioner, and such failures ultimately undermined the best interests of Tristynn and Edward, which is still presumed to be reunification with a natural parent desirous of reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Primarily, CCDSS failed petitioner, and did not adequately perform its statutorily mandated duties under section 5-313(c)(2), by failing to provide a timely and sufficiently extensive array of available programs for petitioner, who, while perhaps hampered by some cognitive limitations, is eager and may well be able, with properly tailored services, to care for his children. From the moment petitioner came to ask for help, CCDSS, as far as we can discern, provided only untai-lored reunification services. CCDSS should have, instead of providing services for which there was little or no need, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>provided more specific services for petitioner who consistently displayed a willingness and genuine desire to cai*e for his children. CCDSS had at its disposition better suited services for petitioner.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">\n<em>As was stated many times by the range of witnesses both for and against petitioner, no one ever posited the possibility that petitioner regain immediate unsupervised control of his children if CCDSS\u2019s petition for guardianship and adoption ivere to be denied. We are, thus, not concerned in this case with the immediate complete reunification and custody of the children with the petitioner. We merely hold that on the evidence in this record, termination was not warranted.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Moreover, CCDSS\u2019s main contentions of petitioner\u2019s perceived inabilities to parent Tristynn and Edward in the immediate future do not lead to the conclusion that petitioner \u201chas a disability that renders [him] consistently unable to care for the immediate and ongoing ... needs of the child for long periods of time\u201d under section 5-313(d)(l)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Petitioner is, according to the record before us, able, even with his \u201ccognitive limitations\u201d (if they exist), to now financially provide for Tristynn and Edward\u2019s care and maintenance. Since high school, petitioner has consistently been employed. Petitioner has demonstrated a relatively dedicated work ethic. He has a better work history than many fathers who are not alleged to be mentally impaired. Petitioner has also demonstrated this work ethic while dealing and caring successfully for those at the United Cerebral Palsy Center with severe disabilities. This ability to care for those with severe disabilities might be an indication that petitioner\u2019s immediate parenting problems, if they exist, would dissipate within the near <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>time, with the aging of the children, and petitioner\u2019s continued growth in his parenting skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The judgment of the Court of Special Appeals is reversed, and the case shall be remanded to that court for it to reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Carroll County.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

The dissents misconstrue the primary issue before the Court. This is not a case involving the parent\u2019s right to the immediate custody of the children. The Court does not dispute the lower court\u2019s holding, as stated in the dissent \u201c[Tjhat Mr. F. was not a fit custodial parent at the time of the hearings.\u201d This is, instead, a case involving the right of the State, through its agencies, to forever terminate the rights of parents to be parents, when those parents have engaged in no willful conduct that would justify the taking away of important and fundamental constitutional rights. We noted above \"although at the present time actual custody may not be appropriate,\u201d and \u201d[a]s was stated many times by the range of witnesses both for and against petitioner, no one ever posited the possibility that petitioner regain immediate unsupervised control of his children.... We merely hold that on the evidence in this record, termination was not warranted.\u201d Our holding is that in view of the fact that the parent in this case was not abusive and did not willfully neglect the only child that has been in his custody and, in light of the basic and fundamental and important constitutional rights involved, termination, on the record now extant in this case, was not presently warranted. We have abundantly made clear that we are not addressing the issue of present custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Judge Harrell\u2019s dissent criticizes the Court, stating: \"I fault the Majority of this Court, however, for listening to the music, but not the words.\u201d What we have done is to consider the status of the parent\u2019s intentions and efforts, and determined that nothing in this case warrants the present termination of his parental rights.

I write separately because 1 am concerned not just about the decision that the Court reaches but also about the tenor of the majority Opinion. This case does <em>not </em>involve discrimination against disabled parents or poor parents. It does <em>not </em>involve any trampling upon the legitimate parental rights of Mr. F. It does <em>not </em>involve any fuzzy-headed social engineering designed simply to move children into a more affluent environment. It does <em>not </em>involve any legislative or executive transgression on basic Constitutional rights. It is simply a case in which (1) nearly six years ago, two children were found to be in need of assistance by the juvenile court, (2) no appeal from or attack on those decisions has ever been made, (3) efforts were made to reunify the children with their father, but (4) the conclusion was drawn, based on evidence that the trial court found persuasive, that Mr. F. was not in a position, and was not likely to be in a position in the foreseeable future, to be able to care properly for the children, who have special needs, and (5) there <em>are </em>prospective adoptive parents willing and able to care for the children on a permanent basis. Everyone seemed to agree that if an adoption proceeds, it should be an open one, in which Mr. F. may maintain contact with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Although parents do have a Constitutional right to raise their children, if they are able to do so, the law allows a court to terminate parental rights, under specified circumstances, when the welfare of the children would best be served by that course of action. In order to justify such a decision, the court must make a series of findings on issues stated in the statute, and the court did so in this case. These are often very difficult and heart-rending cases, tears flowing on all sides, but it is the safety and welfare of the children that must govern. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>It is for the trial judge, not for us, to weigh and consider the evidence, and the mere fact that we might have judged the evidence differently than the trial judge or have arrived at a different conclusion altogether does not warrant reversing the judgment. These are simple and well-established principles of both substantive and procedural law that, in my view, have gotten lost in the Court\u2019s opinion. The Court has thrown appellate restraint to the wind, and, in doing so, has not only subordinated the welfare of these two children to its incorrect view of how 'far the parent\u2019s rights extend but has also injected considerable uncertainty into termination proceedings generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Judges RAKER and HARRELL have authorized me to state that they join in this dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Dissenting Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AJc\">HARRELL, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYP\">in which RAKER and WILNER, JJ., join.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">I respectfully dissent. Some time ago it was observed that \u201chard cases make bad law.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is such a case. Giving proof to that aphorism, the Majority opinion in this case engages in appellate fact-finding in an effort to justify its desired result, heedless of the need for disciplined appellate review of the record in this extraordinarily difficult termination of parental rights case.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Mr. F is a compelling petitioner. No party, no attorney, no witness, and least of all not the trial judge, expressed any doubt that Mr. F is other than \u201ca hard-working, sincere man who loves his children and seeks to promote their well-being.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This same cast of characters essentially agrees, however, that Mr. F is intellectually impaired. Although the extent of his impairment was not quantified neatly in a numerical expression, I think it must be conceded on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>record (Mr. F\u2019s own opinion notwithstanding), that it was proven, and the trial judge so found, that Mr. F was not a fit custodial parent at the time of the hearings below. The evidence supporting that conclusion was more than anecdotal or speculative, as dismissed by the Majority opinion. The real dispute was whether his impairment was of such a degree that, in order to maximize his potential to become a fit parent to Tristynn and Eddie (and giving due regard to Eddie\u2019s extraordinary medical needs) in the foreseeable future, Mr. F required only \u201cdrop-in\u201d external support<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or virtually full-time support. Mr. F\u2019s witnesses expressed confidence that he could become, within 6-12 months, a fit custodial parent with only drop-in types of services. The trial judge did not credit that testimony, however, and, on the evidence that was before him, concluded instead that there was little likelihood that Mr. F\u2019s shortcomings as a custodial parent would be remedied in the near future. The trial judge terminated Mr. F\u2019s parental rights, as opposed to continuing the children in foster care limbo, in the face of the unlikelihood of reunification in the foreseeable future and the presence of two sets of ready, willing, and able adoptive \u201cparents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The Majority opinion\u2019s analysis, as invited to do so by Petitioner and Amicus, fixates on two essentially evidentiary issues: (1) the quality of, and weight to be given, Dr. Blum-berg\u2019s opinion as to Mr. F\u2019s parental fitness; and (2) asserted shortcomings in the services offered by the Carroll County Department of Social Services (DSS) to Mr. F to facilitate reunion of the children with him. The Majority glosses-over the evidence as to Mr. F\u2019s condition and how it would affect his ability to rear his children if they were returned to his care and custody, now or in the foreseeable future. To the extent the trial judge considered and gave weight to Dr. Blumberg\u2019s opinion (occupying but a paragraph of the judge\u2019s 12 page Memorandum and Order of 23 August 2000), it was as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>required factor of FL \u00a7 5-318(d)(1)(i)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u201cwhether ... the following continuing or serious condition[ ] ... exist[s]: (i) the natural parent has a disability that renders the natural parent consistently unable to care for the immediate and ongoing physical or psychological needs of the child[ren] for long periods of time\u201d), and confined to \u201cmental retardation\u201d as further defined in \u00a7 7-101(Z) of the Md.Code (2000 Repl.Vol.), Health-Gen. Art. (\u201ca developmental disability that is evidenced by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning and impairment in the adaptive behavior of an individual.\u201d). The judge\u2019s conclusion that Mr. F suffered from such a disability, however, was not dependent on Dr. Blumberg\u2019s opinion alone. The judge noted that he considered the other witnesses called by DSS, as well as those called by Mr. F, each of whom also acknowledged, in various ways, Mr. F\u2019s intellectual limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The issue in this case is not whether Mr. F was and is disabled. More precisely, it was how much support it would take to determine if that disability could be mitigated to the degree that a fact-finder could conclude that there was a reasonable probability that Mr. F, in the foreseeable future, could become a fit parent for two small children, one of whom has extraordinary medical needs. Mr. F claims it was DSS\u2019s job to supply, or direct him to, services tailored to overcome his disability, to the degree possible, insofar as it made him less than a fit parent. DSS asserts it had no such obligation or, alternatively, that it would take around-the-clock supervision of Mr. F and the children and other assistance which it does not (nor can) offer and, on this record, no other governmental agency or organization has been shown adequately to be able to offer to Mr. F in these circumstances, i.e., a <em>specific </em>mentally-disabled, single parent seeking to raise and care for <em>these </em>two small children.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An examination of the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>before the trial judge reveals that his fact-finding was not clearly erroneous and his conclusions were supported, to a clear and convincing standard, by the facts in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Dr. Blumberg performed a forensic psychiatric evaluation of Mr. F in October 1997 in order to determine his parental fitness.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In preparation to meet with Mr. F, Dr. Blumberg reviewed the extensive written case file provided by DSS. His clinical examination of Mr. F took place at meetings of two hours duration on 15 October 1997 and one hour on 21 October 1997.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Dr. Blumberg concluded that Mr. F, \u201calthough well-meaning and well-intentioned, has significant intellectual limitations, and it\u2019s those limitations that, I think, seriously handicap!. 1 his ability to take care of children ... especially so with his youngest child having a number of medical problems and complications.\u201d Mr. F, according to Dr. Blumberg, was \u201cin complete denial of any difficulties, and, apparently, [even with] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>supervised visits [with the children] needed considerable assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Dr. Blumberg equated Mr. F\u2019s intellectual impairment with a disability that compromised his parenting ability. As examples of how this disability would manifest itself, the witness explained that, because Mr. F\u2019s judgment range was \u201cvery limited,\u201d he likely would: (a) fail to anticipate or recognize the signs of impending medical problems; and, (b) be unable to set limits for the children, help with school work, or address their emotional problems as they grew older. It was not, for Dr. Blumberg, a question of Mr. F being abusive or deliberately harmful, but that he would be unintentionally neglectful or unable to respond appropriately to the children\u2019s needs because he did not appreciate what those needs were or might be. Mr. F\u2019s response to Dr. Blumberg presenting such issues to him during the examination was essentially that all the children needed was love and that would be enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Factored into his opinion, Dr. Blumberg acknowledged that Mr. F probably could improve his reading skills to achieve a very basic, primary level of comprehension, but that it would be difficult for him ever to learn to read, for example, a newspaper. Although he believed Mr. F could learn some additional, fundamental parenting skills, Dr. Blumberg did not think he would be able to learn the number of skills necessary to parent properly these two children, one of whom has special needs himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">After receiving Dr. Blumberg\u2019s written report into evidence,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the trial judge asked Dr. Blumberg if he saw any probability that there would be an improvement in Mr. F\u2019s ability to be a fit parent for these children in the future. Dr. Blumberg responded in the negative, explaining that Mr. F\u2019s intellectual impairment was a permanent condition with which he was born and would continue throughout his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Deborah Ramelmeier, a former employee of the DSS who had been the caseworker assigned to Mr. F\u2019s children\u2019s cases <em>from </em>their inception until November 1997, testified about the children\u2019s physical conditions. Both children were developmentally delayed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Eddie had a brain cyst which, together with related fluid build-up, required daily monitoring to identify and ward-off serious health implications. Eddie also suffered from persistent pulmonary hypertension and serious reactions to environmental allergies.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Ms. Ramelmeier next explained the general course of DSS\u2019s efforts to work with Mr. F. Although one service agreement was executed, on 3 July 1996,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Mr. F rejected two subsequent proposed agreements, one offered on 13 December 1996 and another <em>on 23 </em>April 1997.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is unclear whether Mr. F <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>rejected the proposed agreements on his own volition or on the advice of counsel. It was after the last proposed agreement was rejected by Mr. F on 6 May 1997 that DSS notified him on 13 May 1997 that it was changing its plans for the children from attempts at reunification with Mr. F to a permanency plan of termination of his parental rights and possible adoption. She summarized the Department\u2019s thinking regarding the change in the permanency plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-5\">The struggle that we\u2019ve been dealing with is that, although Mr. F desperately wants to care for his children and he loves his children, <em>we feel very strongly that he doesn\u2019t have the ability, regardless of what services we could provide for him. We are never going to be able to provide services enough to make him able to care for his children, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Although cataloguing some logistical and veracity problems with Mr. F during the time she worked with him (such as missing appointments to visit the children due to his erratic work schedule, forgetting to call and re-schedule, not telling her the truth about whether and how he had electricity at his dwelling, and other matters relative to his status), Ms. Ramel-meier noted that the main and continuing problem over the eighteen months she worked with Mr. F and observed his numerous supervised visitations with his children was the high degree of supervision he needed in order to identify and remember the most fundamental parenting skills, such as feeding, changing diapers, playing with the children, and teaching them to talk. Although Mr. F improved his parenting skills somewhat over this period of time, he nonetheless required constant reminders and supervision, lest a child be choked by inattentive feeding, overwhelmed by the number of toys offered, or failing to receive proper teaching (exemplified by Mr. F\u2019s desire to teach the alphabet to a 10 month old, before teaching him how even to utter intelligible sounds). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Ms. Ramelmeier also noted that Mr. F had unrealistic notions of what activities were appropriate for children of such tender ages, such as his desire, expressed shortly after Eddie was born, to take both children to Hershey Park and to go swimming at a public pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The caseworker who replaced Ms. Ramelmeier, Ms. Helga Anderson, testified next. She supervised the children\u2019s cases until March 1998. She narrated a series of examples, gleaned from her interactions with Mr. F and monitoring of his visitations with the boys, how Mr. F continued to have difficulties dividing his time appropriately between the two children, his inappropriate notions of field trips he proposed to take the children on (such as an Orioles night game), and other problems. Of potential greatest consequence, and representative of Mr. F\u2019s lack of reading skills combined with an unrealistic, simplistic approach to looking out for the best interests of the children, Ms. Anderson recounted how Mr. F brought a gift in May 1998 to Eddie, age two at the time, that bore a warning on the box that, due to a potential choking hazard, it was inappropriate for children under the age of three. When asked whether he had checked the box to see if the toy was appropriate for children under three, Mr. F responded he had checked the box and that it was an appropriate toy for Eddie.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Asked certain ultimate questions, Ms. Anderson responded thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\">Q. Based on your observation, would Mr. F be able to have unsupervised visitation with the boys at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-8\">A. 1 really don\u2019t believe so. I have concern for the safety of the children. If he\u2019s unable to determine when a toy is inappropriate because of choking hazard, he \u2014 I\u2014I have concerns if he would be able to give medication appropriately, if he would recognize warning signs if the boys become ill. And, again, he \u2014 he does not seem willing to turn to the Agency for help, and I would have concerns as to whether or not the boys would get adequate supervision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-9\">\n<em>Q. Are there any other services that the Department could provide to Mr. F at this time?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>\n<em>A. Not to my knoivledge.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-5\">Q. Since you\u2019ve been involved in the case, has Mr. F made efforts to adjust his circumstances?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">A. I think Mr. F has tried very hard. It\u2019s very obvious that he loves his children, that he would like to have his children with him, that he would like to have a chance to be a father to his children. I think he has done everything within his capability. I don\u2019t believe, unfortunately, that that\u2019s enough to provide for the safety of the children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Al_\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The Court interjected itself in the questioning of Ms. Anderson to inquire about special requirements for Eddie and his ongoing medical care needs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-8\">THE COURT: We\u2019ve \u2014 let me interrupt for a second: From the testimony of Mrs. Miller [Eddie\u2019s foster mother], I get the impression that Eddie has a lot more problems than Tristynn does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-9\">THE WITNESS: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-10\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-11\">THE WITNESS: Tristynn does still have some developmental delays, ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-12\">THE COURT: I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-13\">THE WITNESS: ... but not enough to warrant services from the Infant and Toddler Program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-14\">THE COURT: Right. So, Eddie, because of his past medical problems and probably future medical problems, really needs some \u2014 someone caring for him who is going to devote practically .full-time to him. I mean, that\u2019s the impression that I get from Mrs. Miller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-15\">THE WITNESS: I \u2014 I think that he has \u2014 because of his sensitive skin, he had gastro reflux ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-16\">THE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-17\">THE WITNESS: ... when he was younger, still has some problems with vomiting. I do believe he needs someone who\u2019s very sensitive to the warning signs ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-18\">THE COURT: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>THE WITNESS: ... as to when to get him medical attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-5\">\n<em>THE COURT: From your contacts ivith his father, Mr. F, do you feel that, at the present or anytime in the future, that Mr. F could provide that level of special care that Eddie needs?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-6\">THE WITNESS: I do not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">Resuming her re-direct examination, DSS\u2019s trial counsel completed her interrogation of Ms. Anderson by establishing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ana\">Q. As a follow-up, do you believe that Mr. F will possess adequate parenting skills to parent Tristynn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-9\">A. I \u2014 I don\u2019t believe so. 1 \u2014 I think the issue of being able to give medication and recognize warning signs and appropriate toys and appropriate food by knowing the expiration dates is important, no matter what the age of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aoc-dedup-0\">Q. Is Mr. F financially able to care for the boys\u2019 needs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay4\">A. He has not \u2014 although he has a Child Support Order, he has not been paying regularly. He made a payment on February 10th of '98 and then did not make another payment until June 5th of 1998, so he has not regularly been paying child support, which would, from my point of view, call into question his financial ability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">Dana Pflugrad, the current DSS caseworker responsible for Tristynn and Eddie, testified next. She, citing specific examples, reinforced the point that Mr. F, even with the improved parenting skills he had attained, continued to have difficulties keeping up with the changing and evolving needs of his sons, who were ages four and three at that time. As one example, Mr. F, given an opportunity to teach Tristynn that certain conduct he was engaging in should be discontinued promptly or he would be placed in a \u201ctime-out\u201d chair, simply started counting out loud, without telling Tristynn how long he was going to count or what the consequences would be if the conduct did not cease before the counting, at whatever number, stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>In response to cross-examination by Mr. F\u2019s trial counsel as to why DSS had not offered Mr. F specialized services in view of his intellectual impairment and failed to inquire where such services could be found outside of those offered by DSS, Ms. Pflugrad explained \u201cbecause it\u2019s my belief that Mr. F would need twenty-four hour/one-on-one help with the children if they were placed in his home, and I don\u2019t believe that that service exists. There may be some places that would offer some limited services, but I\u2019m not aware of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Mr. F testified on his own behalf. Rather than attempt to characterize his testimony, I set it forth verbatim, at least in pertinent part, and note occasionally by footnote in what respects it was contradicted by other witnesses (including those who testified in support of Mr. F):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-6\">THE WITNESS: Yes, my name is Edward F____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-7\">DIRECT EXAMINATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-8\">Q.

He also seemed to contradict his earlier testimony regarding DDA not offering around-the-clock support services to developmentally disabled persons,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> yet he appeared to concede that his current employer, Flying Colors of Success, offered its services only to adults without children.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Redirected to his criticism of Dr. Blum-berg\u2019s task and opinion, Mr. Hardesty, grudgingly admitting that Dr. Blumberg was not asked to perform a \u201cdevelopmental disability analysis, but a psychological and parenting assessment,\u201d maintained that Mr. F may have tested higher or better had Dr. Blumberg interviewed him in a more familiar setting to Mr. F.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Invited to opine on a time line for the prospects of Mr. F becoming a fit custodial parent, Mr. Hardesty explained during cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-5\">Q. Okay. Now, with regard to that, the issue of why Mr. F wasn\u2019t referred for additional services, if Mr. F were referred to any other organization for additional services, how long do you think it would take him to become an appropriate parent for his children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">A. I don\u2019t know what an appropriate parent is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-7\">Q. Well, I don\u2019t know what an appropriate parent is either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-8\">If additional services were given to \u2014 to Mr. F, is it likely that he\u2019ll be able to provide for the needs of his children within say a three-to-six month period?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-9\">A. I\u2019m thinking three to six months is an awful quick period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-10\">Quick. I mean, that\u2019s a short period of time. I \u2014 you know, I think that if [Mr. F] could access the supports available within six months to a year, he could develop a number of the skills. The \u2014 the supports that \u2014 that are funded through D.D.A. are ongoing supports. Usually you get into their system. They don\u2019t just forget about you after six months or a year, you know. There\u2019re \u2014 there\u2019re folks that may receive a Thousand or Two Thousand Dollars in supports across the whole year. That may be somebody stopping in to check on them once a week, or something like that. D.D.A. has the resources for these kinds of things and if [Mr. F] needs ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-12\">Q. Do you \u2014 do you think that Mr. F would need somebody to come into his home twenty-four hours a day or what kind of services, based on your observations of Mr. F \u2014 what kinds of services would he need?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-13\">A. I would believe that [Mr. F] would need some supports that are of a drop-in nature, maybe ten/fifteen hours a week, you know, check on [Mr. F] to see if he needs any supports with anything, if he\u2019s got questions, if one of the children is displaying this kind of behavior or a symptom or something, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>this happens or that happens at school or at day care, or whatever, and [Mr. F\u2019s] unsure about it ... There \u2014 there would be a resource person with \u2014 with things that he may not know about, but that resource could also be for [Mr. F] to help him with shopping to make sure he\u2019s making good nutritional decisions for the \u2014 for the kids when he\u2019s shopping. It could be helping [Mr. F] with his personal finances. It could be helping [Mr. F] with any entitlements for himself or the children. Drop-in supports can address any number of issues that \u2014 that [Mr. F] would \u2014 would need some \u2014 some assistance with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-4\">Q. Do you think that this is something the Department of Social Services would normally provide to someone with developmental delays?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-5\">A. I\u2019m not familiar with what DSS does. Generally, there\u2019s a pretty significant separation between DSS, DHR, and the Developmental Disabilities Administration. We \u2014 I mean, we \u2014 we work with DSS for entitlements for people that are in our program but, by and large, we don\u2019t access any other services available through DSS. [Mr. F], if he was in the DDA funding system, [he] would have a services coordinator or case manager assigned to him who is, basically, an expert in developmental disabilities. [He] would receive support through an agency and he would also receive periodic follow-up from people at the regional office of DDA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Ms. Peggy Roland testified next for Mr. F. By work and family experience, Ms. Roland had become a special education teacher and advocate for developmentally disabled persons. Although she met Mr. F initially several years earlier while performing volunteer work with Special Olympics, her current and relevant exposure to him, and his children, came as a result of being asked by a DSS caseworker to consult on Mr. F\u2019s and his children\u2019s situation.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Asked what services she provided to Mr. F over the last 2-3 months,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> she replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>I have, I hope, helped Mr. F by becoming an advocate for him on my own time, I\u2019m doing this strictly on. a personal basis, and helping him to find services within the community, also to help him with some of his reading, to understand and interpret documents, information that he would need\u2014 excuse me \u2014 also, to develop some skills \u2014 some life skills, that he may be able to use to maintain his personal life better, using a calendar, getting other supports, financial service, advising, that kind of thing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">She thought her efforts resulted in Mr. F not being so hesitant in asking for help and information when he needed it. She described in a positive light her observations of two of Mr. F\u2019s most recent visitations with his sons at DSS (a combined time of less than 3 hours).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Asked by Mr. F\u2019s trial counsel to describe what kind of programs were available in the \u201ccommunity at large\u201d to help Mr. F if he were to gain custody of his children, Ms. Roland responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-6\">I\u2019m not sure that I can give a very, very informed answer, fortunately, that\u2019s not something I\u2019ve gotten into in my personal life yet, my daughter is not a parent yet.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> But, I do know that financial advising-type services are available, any of the family support programs, independent living programs available through different agencies, Change, Flying Colors to Success, Target, ARC, and they are constantly developing new and different support services for custodial parents that would require, I\u2019m sure, a lot of intense services. But, I believe that the questions could easily be asked, but I know that support is available for Mr. F as an individual in the community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">When asked on cross-examination, however, whether the \u201cintense services\u201d she referred to were \u201ctwenty-four hour super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>vision kind of services,\u201d she stated she could not answer the question if the object were to support a custodial parent. She acknowledged she was unable to address what actual parenting services might be available. Probing further regarding the availability of other support services in the Westminster area, the following exchange occurred during cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-5\">Q. Okay. Are you aware, does \u2014 does the ARC \u2014 the Association For Retarded Citizens, do they offer parenting classes specifically addressed to \u2014 to developmental^ delayed parents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-6\">A. I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t answer the question. But, I do know that, within the Westminster community, there are several families where one parent or the other is developmentally disabled ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-7\">Q. And \u2014 and, they need ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-8\">A .... and they are ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-9\">Q ... .\u2022 \u2014 those families would offer assistance to other families?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-10\">A. Oh, I think that\u2019s a very strong possibility, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-11\">There\u2019s a \u2014 if I may \u2014 there\u2019s a \u2014 a program within several of the agencies, I know of at least two, it\u2019s called Community Supported Living Assistance, and that\u2019s a program designed to help a person with disabilities maintain their level \u2014 appropriate level of independent living, and the program is designed to meet the needs of the individual, and I think that \u2014 I strongly believe that Change, Target, Flying Colors, and ARC would all be very interested and would do whatever they could, financially, as \u2014 as well as staff-wise, to develop a program to support a parent in their attempt to be a parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">Even the Majority opinion, op. at 694, apparently acknowledges that the best that can be said for Mr. Hardesty\u2019s and Ms. Roland\u2019s testimony is that \u201c[t]he evidence is unclear as to whether additional services, specific to petitioner\u2019s needs, would bring about lasting parental adjustments facilitating reunification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Although unqualifiedly optimistic, on a personal level, regarding Mr. F\u2019s future ability to acquire additional or more refined living skills and, with support, cope successfully with the emerging needs of his growing children, Ms. Roland was less optimistic that he was ready to assume custody presently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA3t\">Q. Ms. Roland, do you believe that, were Mr. F to be permitted to have unsupervised visitation with his children, would he be able to understand and address the children\u2019s medical needs if there \u2014 if there were medical problems?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyF\">A. At this point in time, it\u2019s something I\u2019ve talked to Mr. F about, I do not think that would be advisable for unsupervised visits because of the possibility of hurt children and knowing what to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-4\">Q. All right. So \u2014 so, at this time, you don\u2019t believe that Mr. F has the judgment to address medical needs for the children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">A. No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Mr. F\u2019s final witness, Margaret F., his aunt and Eddie\u2019s foster mother, testified that she would like to adopt Eddie, and Tristynn if given the chance. She expressed her intention to allow Mr. F, as well as Mr. F\u2019s family, to play a role in the children\u2019s lives so they would know their heritage.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Asked by the court whether she thought Mr. F could handle the boys by himself, Margaret F., who has known Mr. F for 28-29 years, replied, \u201cI think, at this time, he\u2019s kind of unstable ... You know, if he starts to do things ... functions where he can learn a little bit more with his abilities, I think, you know, that he would be a better person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">This is the record that was before the trial judge. On appeal, Mr. F\u2019s appellate counsel and Amicus seek informally to supplement that record through their briefs, and understandably so. The limited attack mounted on Dr. Blumberg\u2019s opinion in the circuit court has ballooned into a legal question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>beyond all proportion to the objection actually made below. The availability of support services asserted on appeal has taken on a crystalline clarity and certainty that belies what the trial judge was told below. Essentially unargued statutes and laws have become the foundation for legal arguments, augmented by law review articles,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> to the end that we should reverse the judgment below on points of law not placed fairly before or decided by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">I do not blame Mr. F\u2019s appellate counsel or Amicus for trying. The zeal of their advocacy is admirable and understandable. The client is appealing and, obviously, the arguments are beguiling. Perhaps, if Mr. F\u2019s appellate and Ami-cus counsel had tried the case in the trial court, we would have the record before us they argue in their briefs, from which the Majority opinion borrows heavily. Unfortunately, the case they argue is not the record before us, nor was it before the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">I fault the Majority of this Court, however, for listening to the music, but not the words. The Majority opinion succumbs to the siren call of the Amicus brief, in particular, and becomes a bully pulpit for the promotion of select societal, moral, and legal truths and values (most of which reasonable people, whether judges or not, recognize as self-evident), but which is not justified by an objective reading of the record nor implicated by the reasons DSS sought, and the circuit court granted, termination of Mr. F\u2019s parental rights. Tristynn and Eddie originally were declared children in need of assistance (an adjudication that was not appealed) because Mr. F was unable to care properly for them. DSS presented a wealth of evidence why that situation was unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The trial judge was unpersuaded by Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>F\u2019s evidence to the contrary. The Majority opinion, however, at various points, implies, in digressive homilies, that DSS\u2019s \u201cdrive toward termination\u201d (Maj. op. at 683) may have been influenced by Mr. F being considered \u201cpoor\u201d (Maj. op. at 669, 673-674, 686, 700), and/or \u201cilliterate\u201d (at 686); or that DSS was paying blind ob\u00e9isance to federal regulatory or funding requirements (at 669, 700);<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> or that the trial court and DSS avoided a proper weighing of Mr. F\u2019s rights and the best interests standard because they feared the uncertainties inherent in ever returning the. children to him (the \u201csafer course\u201d doctrine) (at 669). Nor does the termination of Mr. F\u2019s parental rights, on this record, constitute an intentional or inadvertent diminution of the rights of the developmentally disabled as a class of our citizenry (Maj. op. at 669, 674-675, 683-684). This case involves an appraisal of a particular developmentally disabled parent, his particular children, and on a particular record.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The Majority opinion ignores much of what our job is about. It cherry-picks certain facts, ignores others, and finds a few new ones as suits its objective. It, in at least one instance, strategically edits an authority<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> to avoid a principle, previous7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>ly acknowledged by this Court, that cuts against the Majority\u2019s reasoning. It disdains even to state the issues framed by Mr. F, upon which certiorari was granted, in favor of its own unstated conceptualization of the \u201cquestions\u201d it would like to answer.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Finally, it strives to make out of this record something that is not present in this case, the trampling of a parent\u2019s right to raise his child.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">The trial judge\u2019s conclusions were supported by clear and convincing evidence, as recounted <em>supra. </em>Clear and convincing evidence, as explained in <em>Berkey v. Delia, </em>287 Md. 302, 318, 413 A.2d, 170, 177-78 (1980), involves \u201ca degree of belief greater than ... a preponderance of the evidence, but less than ... proof beyond a reasonable doubt.... It has been said that [such] proof must be \u2018strong, positive and free from doubt\u2019 and \u2018full, clear and decisive.\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted). DSS met that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>The Majority opinion directs, in essence, a \u201cdo-over\u201d and justifies that result by engaging in its own fact-finding.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The transparency of the Majority opinion\u2019s supplantation of the trial judge\u2019s fact-finding role is not concealed adequately by its digressive legal discourses on the unchallenged legal principles applied in a termination of parental rights case. Of course, what makes this case inherently challenging is that it involves a developmentally disabled parent. It is difficult to imagine how the tensions between the legal principles of the best interests of the children and the constitutional right to raise one\u2019s children could be heightened further. This is precisely why disciplined appellate analysis is so critically necessary lest we become swept up in the rhetoric.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>The trial judge was correct as to the applicable law and he applied that law to the facts as he found them to be. Neither he nor DSS violated Mr. F\u2019s parental rights, except insofar as it may be said the law permits when the \u201cbest interest of the child may take precedence over the parent\u2019s liberty interest in the course of a custody, visitation, or adoption dispute.\u201d <em>In Re Mark, </em>365 Md. 687, 706, 782 A.2d 332, 343 (2001); <em>Boswell v.

The only objection noted by Mr. F\u2019s trial counsel to the testimony of Dr. Blumberg, who was accepted without objection as an expert in psychiatiy, was one lodged technically and without argument or support. In context, it could be argued from the context of the point' in the proceedings when the objection was raised that it amounted to a challenge to Dr. Blumberg's training and experience to express such an opinion; however, if that were the case, the record demonstrates the objection to be baseless. As to his specific experience and training, Dr. Blumberg testified that he had performed six parental fitness evaluations for the Supreme Bench for Baltimore City (now the Circuit Court for Baltimore City) during his forensic fellowship at the University of Maryland Medical School and an additional 20-30 such evaluations in the course of his subsequent private practice, mostly in cases in the Circuit Courts for Carroll and Harford counties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b769-9\">. Dr. Blumberg stated he could not administer the usual Minnesota Multi-Facet Personality Inventory (MMFI) to Mr. F because Mr. F was unable to read well enough. Mr. F\u2019s trial counsel, unlike his appellate counsel and Amicus, mounted no contention that the MMFI could have been administered nonetheless. In any event, the lack of an MMFI test result has not been argued, in and of itself, to invalidate Dr. Blumberg's opinions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b770-7\">. Mr. F's trial counsel noted that its receipt was \"only subject to my prior objection,\u201d which, as we noted <em>infra </em>at n. 6, was largely unarticu-lated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b771-6\">.

Another DSS caseworker witness, Dana Pflugrad, testified to Eddie\u2019s last affliction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b771-8\">. The one service agreement entered into with Mr. F included that he undergo a drug and alcohol evaluation. According to Ms. Ramelmeier, he told the evaluator that he never drank alcohol and did not use drugs. Accordingly, the evaluator rated Mr. F a non-user and no further action was thought necessary by the evaluator. Indeed, when Mr. F testified below, he asserted he drank only one time in his life and that was two beers on his previous birthday, 25 April 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">Ms. Ramelmeier, however, testified that, upon learning of Mr. F's alcohol evaluation result, she questioned Mr. F because he had acknowledged to her in an earlier meeting that alcohol played a larger part in his life than he had stated in the evaluation. She asked that he submit to another evaluation, which he initially slated that he would do, but never followed-up on having another evaluation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b771-10\">. Of passing interest because Mr. F complains vehemently of the lack of services offered him by DSS, I note that, in his trial counsel's closing argument before the trial judge at the end of the exceptions hearing on 23 June 1998 regarding the Master\u2019s recommendation as to visitation, counsel stated \"[sjince [turning the children over to DSS], he\u2019s [Mr. F] gotten a lot. of services.\u201d Ms. Ramelmeier confirmed this in her testimony at that hearing as she did not \"recall that [Mr. F] asked for any other services.\u201d When one considers that Mr. F apparently was represented by counsel (not the same one as represents him on appeal) at least as of the time he rejected tire April 1997 proposed services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>agreement, a failure to complain then about the services offered makes the related arguments mounted during the trial and appellate stages of this matter appear somewhat less genuine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b778-25\">. There was doubt that this assessment was entirely accurate. Ms. Ramelmeier testified previously that on one occasion she gave ,Mr. F a Dr. Seuss book, \u201cAre You My Mother,\u201d to read to Eddie, but Mr. F was unable to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b778-26\">. Charles M. Hardesty, the person who hired Mr. F to work at United Cerebral Palsy and who testified in support of Mr. F, indicated that Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>F \u201cwouldn\u2019t have been responsible for [administering medication]\u201d to the clienls.

As noted in the Majority opinion (slip op. at 11), Tristynn was brought by Mr. F to DSS on 28 December 1995. Eddie had not yet been born at that time. When Eddie was born on 30 May 1996, he went directly from the hospital into foster care, through DSS.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b781-19\">. Mr. F\u2019s feelings towards DSS appear to wax and wane. As his appellate counsel emphasizes, and to a certain degree Mr. F later portrays in his testimony, he was suspicious and distrustful of DSS (and with cause, it is argued). Yet, at this juncture in his testimony, he professed a willingness to call upon DSS if he \"had any problem\u201d which impliedly his parents could not address. The trial judge, however, was not obligated to believe that Mr. F viewed DSS as a resource.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b781-20\">. DSS records and its witnesses refute this categorical claim. Nonetheless, DSS conceded that, after a while, Mr. F's visits became regular and frequent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b782-22\">. As Ms. Anderson\u2019s testimony revealed, it was questionable whether Mr. F, although apparently aware of this particular educational and disciplinary technique, was able consistently to apply it effectively to its intended ends.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b784-16\">.

She and Mr. F were not married.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b784-17\">. <em>See </em>n. 17, <em>supra </em>at 19, at-.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b787-16\">. Ms. Ramelmeier testified previously that she had \"extensive conversations\u201d with Mr. F about Eddie\u2019s health issues, but that he showed no interest in Eddie's medical care at those times.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b787-17\">. I infer this to be a reference to \"one-on-one\u201d attention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b789-23\">. Mr. F testified earlier he could not afford to have a telephone in his townhouse. Thus, there may have existed for the trial judge just cause to doubt the certitude of Mr. F\u2019s apparent conviction that he could \u201cget\u201d and maintain a car.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b790-7\">. He was unaware of any developmentally disabled adults, married or single, living in the Westminster area .who had children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b790-8\">. Mr. Hardesty was unaware that Dr. Blumberg also had received and reviewed DSS\u2019s extensive files on Mr. F and the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b790-9\">. Mr. Hardesty was accepted by the court as an expert on \u201cdevelopmental disabilities\u201d for purposes of his critique of Dr. Blumberg\u2019s methodologies and opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b791-6\">.

Ms. Roland was a DSS employee herself at the time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b793-8\">. Her testimony was given on 20 July 1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b794-8\">. She conceded on cross-examination that there had been \"a hundred to two hundred\u201d such visitations, but she had observed only two of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b794-9\">. Ms. Roland\u2019s daughter, 22 years old at the time of the hearings below, is developmentally disabled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b796-8\">. At some point in the proceedings below, Mr. F\u2019s trial counsel had advanced an alternative that Margaret F. and her husband could adopt both boys, a possibility Mr. F might accept. This notion did not bear fruit ultimately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b797-6\">. Some of which may be, in, academic and experiential parlance, more learned than others. For example, a piece from a 1995 California Law Review, cited and quoted by the Majority (from the Amicus brief) op. at 674-675 and 685, n. 17, appears to have been authored by a law student.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b797-7\">. The Majority appears to extend the relevant temporal time frame for consideration under FL \u00a7 5 \u2014 313(d)(i) (the impact of the parent's dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>ability on child care must endure \"for long periods of time\u201d) when it concludes, op. at 697-698, that \"there was not ample evidence to properly conclude that Mr. F\u2019s disability, even if it exists, renders him <em>permanently </em>incapable of caring for his children in an unsupervised setting.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b798-7\">. It seems fairly clear, at least from the trial court\u2019s perspective, that federal funding and oversight requirements were not driving its consideration of this case. At a 29 January 1999 hearing, when DSS\u2019s counsel proffered for the record various reasons why the petition was \"long overdue in being ruled upon,\u201d so that the \"federal auditors\u201d would know \u201cthat the delays are appropriate in this case,\u201d the trial judge commented, \u201d[w]ell, I could care less about the federal auditors.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b798-8\">. In the Majority opinion's extensive block quote (Maj. op. at 675-678) from the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>In re: Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. 99, 103-06, 642 A.2d 201, 203-05 (1994), the following highlighted sentence is omitted (op. at 677-678):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-9\">The overriding theme of both the federal and state legislation is that a child should have permanency in his or her life. <em>The valid premise </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number><em>is that it is in the child's best interest to be placed in a permanent home and spend as little time as possible in foster care. </em>Thus, Title 5 <em>of the </em>Family Law Article seeks 1o prevent the need for removal of a child from its home, to return a child 1o its home when possible, and where returning home is not possible, to place the child in another permanent placement that has legal status. [Some citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap7\">Of course, the omitted language is exactly the principle served by the trial court's decision in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b799-6\">. Mr. F's certiorari petition framed and argued one question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">Whether the lower court was clearly erroneous in its finding that petitioner\u2019s intellectual limitations required termination of his parental rights, absent a determination of abandonment, abuse, or neglect. In his brief to the Court, Mr. F presented and argued two questions:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">I. Whether the trial court erroneously found that the [petitioner] had a disability that rendered him consistently unable to care for the immediate and ongoing physical or psychological needs of the children[?]</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">II. Whether the trial court erred in finding that the appellee provided [petitioner] with timely and adequate services to facilitate reunification <em>of </em>[petitioner] <em>and </em>his childrenf?]</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">Obviously, Mr. F conceived his appellate challenges as attacking the sufficiency of the evidence. The Majority's omission of these questions from its opinion becomes significant in light of Petitioner's and Ami-cus's supplementation of the record and the Majority's tendencies toward appellate fact-finding and substituting its weighing of testimony and documents for that of the trial judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b800-5\">. Examples of the Majority opinion's factual embellishments and substituted judgment conclusions include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-6\">(a) The Majority opinion, op. at 19-20 and again at 686 and again at 694-695, states that the application and use of the Minnesota Multi-Facet Personality Inventory test, which Dr. Blumberg did not administer to Mr. F because he could not read adequately, \"are not limited to people that can read.\u201d There is no evidence in the record to support this conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-7\">(b) Extrapolating apparently from the facts that Mr. F earns $6.50 per hour from his present job, rents a 2 bedroom townhouse (but is unable to afford a telephone in it), and possesses a bicycle, the Majority concludes he is \u201cable ... to now financially provide for Tristynn and Edward's care and maintenance.\u201d (op. at 701).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-8\">(c) The Majority seems to attribute to DSS, op. at 701-702, testimony \"that reunification in the future was reasonably possible, if not probable.\u201d It fails to note, however, that this was not DSS's position in this matter, but rather that of one of Mr. F\u2019s witnesses, Peggy Roland (see Dissent, <em>supra, </em>at 698-701, for discussion of Mr. Roland\u2019s views).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-9\">(d) Of greatest significance, the Majority opinion states certain major factual conclusions at 700 (\"[Mr. F] may well be able, with properly tailored services, to care for his children.\u201d), 700 (\"CCDSS had at its disposition better suited services for petitioner\u201d), and 701 (\"[Mr. F\u2019s] ability to care for those with severe disabilities [while employed at United Cerebral Palsy in the early 90\u2019s] might be an indicator that petitioner\u2019s immediate parenting problems, if they exist, would dissipate within the near time, with the aging of the children and petitioner\u2019s continued growth in his parenting skills.\u201d). For the Majority to reach these conclusions necessarily requires it to place itself in the shoes of the fact-finder and elect to credit Mr. F's evidence, rather than that adduced by DSS. These are prime examples of impermissible appellate fact-finding.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
