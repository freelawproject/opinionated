The unexplained presence of the defendant\u2019s horse, harnessed to a wagon, in the act of running away, and unattended by the owner or other person, and on the sidewalk of the public highway-breaking through the plaintiff\u2019s show window, raises, a <em>prima facie </em>presumption of negligence upon the part of the defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b99-7\">2. Evidence tending' to show that the defendant\u2019s horse and wagon had been left by his servant untied and entirely unattended on the public highway; that theretofore both the defendant and his servant had knowledge of the propensity of the horse to run away when left untied and unattended, justifies a finding by a jury, or by the trial judge sitting without a jury, of liability of the defendant for damages caused by the horse when it ran away \u2018 by reason of being left untied and unattended.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-9\">On appeal from the District Court of the city of Hoboken.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b99-10\">Before Justices Garrison, Trenciiard and Black.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-11\">For the appellant, <em>A.

The evidence, at the time the motion was denied, disclosed the unexplained presence of the defendant\u2019s horse, harnessed to a wagon, in the act of running away, and unattended by the owner or other person, and on the sidewalk of the public highway breaking through the plaintiff\u2019s show window. This evidence raised a <em>prima facie </em>presumption of negligence upon the part of the defendant. <em>Dennery </em>v. <em>Great A. &amp; P. Tea </em>Co., 82 <em>N. J. L. </em>517.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Also, we think there was no legal error in the refusal of the motion for judgment in favor of the defendant based upon the same ground. At the time this motion ivas denied the evidence tended to show that the defendant\u2019s horse and wagon had been left by his servant untied and entirely unattended in the public highway; that' theretofore both the owner and his servant had knowledge of the propensitjr of the horse to run away when left untied and unattended, and it was therefore open to a jury, or to the trial judge sitting without a jury, to find the defendant liable for damage done to the plaintiff\u2019s property by the horse when it ran away by reason of having been left untied and unattended. <em>Belles </em>v. <em>Kellner, </em>67 <em>N. J. L. 255.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The judgment below will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
