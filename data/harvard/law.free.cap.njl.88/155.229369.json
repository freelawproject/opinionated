Upon the plaintiff resting his case, counsel for the defendant moved for a nonsuit on the ground that section 4 of the Landlord and Tenant act requires the tendering of rent not exceeding one year\u2019s rent to the landlord before any execution or other process can be \u2022executed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-10\">\u201cThe facts are these:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-11\">\u201cThat in June, 1914, one Lambrose, the tenant, executed a chattel mortgage to the plaintiff, Joseph J. Bodell, for $350, covering the goods and chattels on the premises; prior to that time there were several months! rent due, and in October, 1914, the landlord issued a distress warrant and the constable sold all the right, title and interest of the tenant in and to the goods on the premises for $25, the goods having been previously appraised at $260; the chattel mortgagee, the plaintiff in this action, contends that this sale was made subject to the chattel mortgage, and that demand having been made on the defendant in this case for the possession of the goods, and refusal of the same having been made, plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>in .this action, the chattel mortgagee, is entitled to damages for conversion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-5\">\u201cThis raises the question as to which is prior in law, a chattel mortgage or the lien of the landlord for rent, which in turn raises the question as to when the lien of the landlord attaches.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-6\">\u201cIn the case of <em>Woodside </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>40 <em>N. J. L. </em>417, the court held as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-7\">\u201c\u2018A landlord has no lien on the goods and chattels of his tenant for the payment of his rent, except such as is given by the statute. As against an officer seizing under execution, attachment or other process against the tenant, he may claim all rent due, not exceeding one year\u2019s rent, which shall have accrued before the removal of the goods from off the premises. lie may also subject goods and chattels, the property of the tenant, to distress and sale as a means of obtaining satisfaction for his rent; but his lien under the warrant to dis-train will relate to the time of actual seizure under the process of distress. In the meantime, the goods remain the property of the tenant, who may consume or use them or sell them at his pleasure. A chattel mortgage is, in law, a sale of the goods, and passes tire title to them for the purpose for which it was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-8\">\u201c \u2018The statute which authorizes a distress for rent expressly limits the right of distress to the goods and chattels of the 'tenant, \u201cand no other person.\u201d * * * The chattel mortgage in this case having been made and delivered before the distress warrant was executed, the right of the mortgagee is superior to that of the landlord.\u2019.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-10\">\u201cThe only difference between the case of Woodside <em>v. </em>Adams, and the case in question, is that in tire former ease the chattel mortgage was placed on the goods before rent accrued, whereas in the case in question, some rent had accrued before the chattel mortgage was placed on r\u00e9cord. Fo denial has been made as to the validity of tire chattel mortgage. In my opinion, the landlord\u2019s lien under the distress warrant relates only to the time of the actual seizure under the process of distress, and the chattel mortgage in this ease having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>on record for some three or four months prior to the actual seizure of these goods under the distress warrant, the lien of the chattel mortgage is prior to the lien of the landlord, and I deny the motion of the defendant for nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-5\">\u201cCitarles B.
