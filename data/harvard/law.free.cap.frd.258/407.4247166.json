O\u2019HARA, United States Magistrate Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">In this multidistrict litigation, plaintiffs claim defendants are liable under various state law theories because defendants sell motor fuel for a specified price per gallon without disclosing or adjusting for temperature expansion. Currently before the undersigned U.S. Magistrate Judge, James P. O\u2019Hara, are three related discovery motions that raise First Amendment issues: (1) plaintiffs\u2019 motion (doc. 668) to compel defendants to respond to plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests related to defendants\u2019 communications with trade associations, weights and measures organizations, and governmental agencies; (2) plaintiffs\u2019 motion (doc. 738) to compel the Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Store Association of Kansas (PMCA-KS), a trade association, to fully respond to plaintiffs\u2019 subpoena to produce documents; and (3) defendants\u2019 motion (doc. 999) to quash subpoenas that plaintiffs served on five other trade associations.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-18\">Defendants, acting both in their individual capacities and as members of the trade associations served with subpoenas, objected to plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests and subpoenas on the ground that the information sought is privileged pursuant to the First Amendment right of free association. On May 13, 2009, the court heard oral arguments from the parties and from one of the involved trade associations, The National Association of Truck Stop Operators (NATSO), on the complex First Amendment issues raised in the motions. Having carefully considered the parties\u2019 thorough written submissions and helpful oral arguments, the court is ready to rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-19\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b458-20\">On June 24, 2008, plaintiffs served their second set of interrogatories and first set of requests for production of documents on defendants. A number of these discovery requests sought information about defendants\u2019 communications with trade associations, weights and measures associations, and state or federal agencies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In response to these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>discovery requests, defendants objected, in whole or in part, on the ground that the information sought was subject to a First Amendment privilege.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">On September 19, 2008, plaintiffs served a subpoena on PMCA-KS, requesting that it produce thirty-six categories of documents.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> PMCA-KS did not object to the subpoena requests and arranged a date on which to produce responsive documents. However, two hours before the document production was scheduled to begin, counsel for some defendants expressed concern to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel that some of the documents were privileged under the First Amendment. Plaintiffs allowed defense counsel to review the documents that PMCA-KS was offering for production. The parties agreed that documents defendants deemed privileged would be sequestered until defendants\u2019 objections were resolved. Defendants prepared a privilege log, asserting First Amendment privilege over about three-fourths of the documents produced by PMCA-KS.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-21\">Between October 16, 2008, and March 27, 2009, plaintiffs served subpoenas on five other third-party trade associations (collectively, \u201cthe trade associations\u201d),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> requesting production of forty-two categories of documents similar to those sought from PMCA-KS.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-22\">Plaintiffs now seek an order from the court compelling defendants to fully respond to plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests and to produce PMCA-KS documents over which defendants have asserted a First Amendment privilege.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendants seek an order quashing the subpoenas served on the trade associations be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>cause the subpoenas are unduly burdensome and seek documents that are related to core associational activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">II. Defendants\u2019 Standing to Object on Behalf of Trade Associations</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">As an initial matter, the court must determine whether defendants have standing to assert privilege objections on behalf of PMCA-KS and the trade associations. Members of a trade association have standing to assert the First Amendment rights held by the association.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defense counsel represent that various defendants are members of PMCA-KS and the trade associations. Moreover, PMCA-KS has filed a brief (doc. 987) joining defendants\u2019 briefing related to plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel (doc. 738), and the trade associations have filed briefs (docs. 1003, 1016, 1020, &amp; 1032) joining defendants\u2019 briefing related to defendants\u2019 motion to quash (doc. 999). On this record, the court holds that defendants have standing to assert the privileges at issue in the instant motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">III. The First Amendment Protection</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">of Free Association</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The First Amendment protects \u201ca right to associate for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First Amendment \u2014 speech, assembly, petition for the redress of grievances, and the exercise of religion.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the seminal case of <em>NAACP v. Alabama, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that the First Amendment right to associate creates a qualified privilege from disclosing information in discovery that would chill exercise of that right.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-16\">Effective advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association, as this Court has more than once recognized by remarking upon the close nexus between the freedoms of speech and assembly.... Of course, it is immaterial whether the beliefs sought to be advanced by association pertain to political, economic, religious or cultural matters, and state action which may have the effect of curtailing the freedom to associate is subject to the closest scrutiny.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFP\">When a party refuses to produce information on the ground the information is protected by the associational privilege, \u201c \u2018district courts have generally employed a burden-shifting analysis.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> First, the party asserting the privilege must make a prima facie showing that the privilege applies.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Second, if the party asserting the privilege meets its burden, then the burden shifts to the party seeking disclosure to demonstrate its interests in obtaining the information outweigh the other party\u2019s interests in not disclosing the information.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-17\">A. Prima Facie Showing that the Privilege Applies</p>\n<p id=\"b460-18\">Defendants, as the parties asserting First Amendment protection over the documents at issue, have the initial burden to make out a prima facie showing of privilege. Defendants must show that disclosure of the documents would arguably chill freedom of association, i.e., that it would likely affect the ability of the trade associations to advocate the associations\u2019 beliefs by inducing members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>to withdraw from the associations, or dissuading others from joining the associations, because of fear that exposure of their beliefs would subject them to economic reprisal or other public hostility.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Courts have applied a presumption of privilege to information that goes to the core of a group\u2019s assoeiational activities, finding that disclosure of such information would very likely chill freedom of association.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Defendants argue that plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests and trade association subpoenas seek three types of core associational information that should be presumed privileged: (1) membership lists of trade associations (including lists of all trade associations in which each defendant has been a member), (2) financial contributor lists of trade associations, <em>and (3) </em>information related to the past political activities of defendants, including documents related to the lobbying and legislative affairs of the trade associations of which defendants are members.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">To the extent that plaintiffs\u2019 propounded discovery and subpoenas seek confidential membership lists and financial contributor lists of trade associations, the court easily finds this information goes to the core of the associations\u2019 activities and is prima facie privileged. Since <em>NAACP v. Alabama, </em>a number of courts have recognized this confidential associational information is presumed privileged,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> such that the party seeking protection will be deemed to have satisfied its prima facie burden.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> To the extent, however, that defendants seek protection of associational membership lists or financial contributor lists that have been publicly disclosed, the court finds that a chilling effect caused by additional disclosure cannot be presumed, nor has it been proved by defendants. Thus, such publicly available information may not be withheld based on a First Amendment privilege.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">The meat of the parties\u2019 arguments on the pending motions addresses the third category of documents over which defendants have asserted a First Amendment privilege \u2014 information related to the trade associations\u2019 legislative affairs and lobbying efforts. While some courts have espoused a general recognition that the \u201cpast political activities\u201d of associations and their members are core associational activities entitled to a presumption of privilege,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> caselaw provides little guidance on the type of information that might fit under the past-political-activity umbrella. Of course, even if the requested information is not presumed privileged, defendants may still satisfy their prima facie burden by demonstrating that disclosure of the information would chill the associations\u2019 First Amendment rights.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">The court determines that confidential communications concerning the associations\u2019 legislative affairs and lobbying efforts on the matter of automatic temperature compensation (ATC) for retail motor fuel is prima facie privileged. The court finds U.S. Magistrate Judge Donald W. Bostwick\u2019s opinion in <em>Heartland I </em>instructive in reaching this decision. In <em>Heartland I, </em>which was decided in the context of antitrust litigation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>the plaintiff sought to compel production of documents from the Kansas Hospital Association (KHA), a non-party association of which certain defendant hospitals were members, related to KHA\u2019s lobbying on issues concerning specialty hospitals. Applying <em>NAACP v. Alabama </em>and its progeny, Judge Bostwick determined that KHA had met its prima facie burden of showing that production of such material would have a chilling effect. Judge Bostwick determined that requiring production of \u201c \u2018evaluations of possible legislation and legislative strategy is the type of action that would appear to interfere with KHA\u2019s internal organization and with its lobbying activities, and therefore have a \u2018chilling effect\u2019 on the organization and its members.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The court finds the reasoning in <em>Heartland I </em>applies equally well in this case. As in <em>Heartland I, </em>the trade associations\u2019 internal communications and evaluations about advocacy of their members\u2019 positions on contested political issues, as well as their actual lobbying on such issues, \u201cwould appear to be a type of political or economic association that would ... be protected by the First Amendment privilege.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It is undisputed that a primary purpose of each of the trade associations is to advocate on behalf of its collective members. In other words, the members of the trade associations have joined \u2019 together \u201cto pursue their collective effort to foster beliefs which they admittedly have the right to advocate.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> If the trade associations were forced to disclose confidential communications exchanged in conjunction with pursuing their right to advocate, there is a reasonable probability<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> that such disclosure would interfere with the core of the associations\u2019 activities by inducing members to withdraw from the associations, or dissuading others from joining the associations, because of fear that exposure of their beliefs would subject them to economic reprisal or other public hostility.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">The court is not persuaded, as suggested by plaintiffs, that this likely harm could be eliminated by protecting the identities of the associations\u2019 members. Current or potential members of an association could reasonably fear that exposure of their beliefs expressed in private legislative strategy sessions or lobbying could subject them, as members of the motor fuel industry as a whole, to economic reprisal or public hostility.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Moreover, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>undisputed the trade associations \u2014 and defendants as members \u2014 are engaged in current congressional debates over temperature-adjusted retail sale of motor fuel. Disclosure of the associations\u2019 evaluations of possible lobbying and legislative strategy certainly could be used by plaintiffs to gain an unfair advantage over defendants in the political arena. The court therefore concludes that defendants have met their burden of showing the production of trade association strategic lobbying documents and evaluations of legislation would have a chilling effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In addition to documents containing information that would disclose the trade associations\u2019 internal evaluation of lobbying strategies, positions on legislation, and actual lobbying, however, defendants have withheld documents with a much more tenuous connection to the \u201cpast political activities\u201d of the associations and their members. For example, defendants have objected to providing information about <em>any </em>communication that they have had with trade associations regarding the subject of temperature adjustment in retail sales of motor fuel. Defendants also assert a privilege over documents shared among multiple trade associations.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Likewise, as defense counsel stated at the May 13, 2009, oral argument, defendants contend that <em>all </em>internal communications of trade associations, regardless of whether the communications relate to lobbying or legislative strategies, are subject to the associational privilege.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The court wishes to make clear that defendants have met their prima facie burden only with respect to the associations\u2019 internal evaluations of lobbying and legislation, strategic planning related to advocacy of their members\u2019 positions, and actual lobbying on behalf of members. Any other communications to, from, or within trade associations are not deemed protected under the First Amendment associational privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">In summary, defendants have satisfied their burden of showing that confidential membership and financial contributor lists of trade associations, as well as internal information related to trade associations\u2019 legislative affairs and lobbying efforts, are prima facie privileged under the First Amendment right of free association. The burden thus shifts to plaintiffs \u201cto show how the balancing of factors weighs in support of compelling disclosure of the information covered by the First Amendment privilege.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">B. The Balancing Test</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">At the second step of the burden-shifting analysis, plaintiffs have the opportunity to prove that their interests in obtaining the information outweigh defendants\u2019 interests in not disclosing the information. In conducting this balancing of interests, the court must consider the following factors: \u201c(1) the relevance of the evidence; (2) the necessity of receiving the information sought; (3) whether the information is available from other sources; and (4) the nature of the information.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">Under the first factor, the relevancy standard for purposes of First <em>Amendment </em>analysis is more exacting than the general relevancy standard for discovery under Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1). \u201cThe Tenth Circuit has described this as \u2018certain relevance,\u2019 which means that the information must go to the \u2018heart of the matter.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>The second factor, necessity of the information, \u201cis correlated to its relevance; that is, the more relevant the information, the greater the need for disclosure.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> \u201cHowever, where the danger to associational activity is great, the district court is more likely to uphold a claim of privilege, notwithstanding the inquiring party\u2019s need.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Finally, if the privileged information is sought from an association that is not a party to the lawsuit, that fact \u201cweighs against compelling disclosure.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> After examining the four above-described factors, the court must \u201cdecide whether the privilege must be overborne by the need for the requested information.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">As an initial matter, the court rules that the trade associations need not respond to the subpoenas issued by plaintiffs. As noted, the fact that the trade associations are not parties in this case weighs against compelling disclosure by them. The trade associations have presented cogent evidence that the burden of responding to the subpoenas (as currently written) would severely interfere with their abilities to advocate on behalf of their members \u2014 a key First Amendment right. The undue burden that would be suffered by the trade associations is discussed in detail in Section IV below.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">With respect to privileged information responsive to the discovery requests served on defendants, plaintiffs assert that the balance of the factors tips in their favor because the information \u201cgoes to the heart of the matter,\u201d i.e., to defendants\u2019 affirmative defenses about the availability, feasibility, and legality of temperature compensation; and to plaintiffs\u2019 conspiracy claims. The court will apply the balancing test to each of the three types of information sought by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">First, as to the identities of the trade associations\u2019 anonymous members, plaintiffs argue that the membership lists go to the heart of them conspiracy claims. Plaintiffs state that they need to establish through discovery those defendants that joined trade associations through which and by which they conspired to block the implementation, availability, and use of ATC at retail. Plaintiffs assert that this information is only available from defendants and the trade associations. Plaintiffs further assert that, because there is no indication defendants would be harmed if their identities are revealed, plaintiffs\u2019 need outweighs defendants\u2019 interest in privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-14\">Confidential membership lists go to the core of the First Amendment right to associate, and this factor weighs heavily against their disclosure. Although the court acknowledges that plaintiffs\u2019 conspiracy claims require plaintiffs to show that two or more defendants came to a meeting of the minds and acted in concert, this is a factor that is not in dispute. Defense counsel stated at the oral argument that \u201c[t]here\u2019s no question\u201d that defendants joined together in trade associations to advocate against ATC and suggested that a stipulation to this effect could be reached.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 need for the actual membership lists therefore appears very minimal. The court finds that the privilege attendant to the confidential membership lists of the trade associations is not outweighed by plaintiffs\u2019 need for that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-15\">Second, as to documents concerning the trade associations\u2019 financial supporters, plaintiffs have not attempted to show that the balance tips in favor of disclosing this highly privileged information. The court finds the privilege is not outweighed by the need for the requested information. Such documents are properly withheld by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-16\">Third, with respect to the associations\u2019 internal lobbying information and legislative evaluations, plaintiffs argue the infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>mation is relevant and necessary because it (1) goes directly to plaintiffs\u2019 civil conspiracy claims that defendants entered into an agreement to oppose the implementation of ATC in the United States,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> and (2) refutes defendants\u2019 affirmative defenses that ATC was not feasible and was illegal because it identifies what defendants knew or did not know at particular points in time. Plaintiffs state that the information sought may provide them with \u201ca way to challenge\u201d deposition statements by defendants \u201cthat they were unaware of temperature correction issues at the retail level.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also maintain that the information may show that defendants used the trade associations to create the very situations in which defendants claim it was \u201cimpractical\u201d or \u201cimpossible\u201d to use ATC at the retail level. Under the third factor, plaintiffs assert that the lobbying information can only be obtained from defendants or from the trade associations. And under the fourth factor, plaintiffs assert that the nature of the information is such that it addresses contentions that defendants have put \u201cin issue\u201d with their affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In response, defendants argue that, under the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> plaintiffs will be unable to use information about defendants\u2019 lobbying activities to impose liability on defendants for a civil conspiracy, making the information neither relevant nor necessary. Defendants further assert that their affirmative defenses do not relate to the technical feasibility of ATC equipment, but rather to the fact that the applicable weight-and-measure standards prohibited defendants from installing ATC equipment, and that their lobbying strategies are irrelevant to what the law actually permitted.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> With respect to the third balancing factor, defendants contend that the state of a defendant\u2019s knowledge regarding the retail sale of temperature adjusted fuel can be learned by asking direct questions to this effect in interrogatories or at depositions. Finally, defendants argue that the information sought goes to the core of the associations\u2019 activities and that the privileged nature of the information trumps plaintiffs\u2019 minimally relevant discovery request.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">The court finds that plaintiffs have not met their burden of overcoming the First Amendment privilege attached to the associations\u2019 lobbying and legislative documents. Although the information might meet the minimal relevancy standards of Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1), it does not meet the heightened \u201ccertain relevance\u201d and need standards applicable in this First Amendment context. As noted above, there is no dispute in this ease that defendants joined together in trade associations to advocate against ATC. If plaintiffs wish to challenge defendants\u2019 conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>tions about their knowledge of ATC issues at the retail level, plaintiffs can directly inquire through interrogatories. Likewise, plaintiffs can obtain information about whether defendants helped create the very circumstances under which defendants claim it was impractical, impossible, or illegal to use ATC at retail by examining the readily available public positions taken by the trade associations. The nature of the information sought \u2014 showing the internal strategic processing done by associations as they prepare to advocate on behalf of their collective members \u2014 is highly privileged because it involves a core associational activity protected by the First Amendment. Plaintiffs have not shown that they have a particular need in obtaining this information such that the First Amendment protection accorded it should be overborne.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">In summary, the court holds that the First Amendment privilege of free association protects the following types of documents from disclosure: confidential membership lists of trade associations, confidential financial contributor lists of trade associations, and confidential internal trade association communications concerning lobbying and legislation. Therefore, plaintiffs\u2019 motion (doc. 668) to compel defendants to respond to plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests is denied in part and granted in part, as discussed more fully in this order. Likewise, plaintiffs\u2019 motion (doc. 738) to compel PMCA-KS to fully respond to plaintiffs\u2019 subpoena is denied in part and granted in part, as discussed more fully in this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">IV. Undue Burdens on Trade Associations of Responding to the Subpoenas</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">As discussed above, the court has determined that confidential documents that go to the core of the trade associations\u2019 associational activities \u2014 whether in the possession of defendants or the trade associations themselves \u2014 are protected by the First Amendment and need not be disclosed to plaintiffs. While this ruling protects from disclosure some of the documents in the possession of the trade associations that are potentially responsive to plaintiffs\u2019 subpoenas, it certainly does not protect all such documents. Thus, the trade associations would still bear the burden of reviewing their records, determining which are responsive to the subpoenas, further determining which are privileged, and then producing the remaining documents. Defendants, on behalf of the trade associations, have moved (doc. 999) to quash the subpoenas in their entirety arguing, among other things, that the subpoenas subject the trade associations to an undue burden.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 45 governs the issuance of subpoenas to non-parties. Rule 45(e)(3)(A)(iv) states that a court \u201cmust quash or modify\u201d a subpoena if it \u201csubjects a person to undue burden.\u201d Non-parties responding to a Fed.R.Civ.P. 45 subpoena are generally offered heightened protection from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>discovery abuse.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> \u201cWhether a subpoena imposes an undue burden upon a [non-party] is a case specific inquiry that turns on \u2018such factors as relevance, the need of the party for the documents, the breadth of the document request, the time period covered by it, the particularity with which the documents are described and the burden imposed.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> \u201cCourts are required to balance the need for discovery against the burden imposed on the person ordered to produce documents, and the status of a person as a non-party is a factor that weighs against disclosure.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The subpoenas that plaintiffs served on the trade associations very broadly reference forty-two categories of documents. Defendants argue that responding to the subpoenas would impose an undue burden on the trade associations, which have limited staff and resources to conduct document review. To illustrate, defendants submitted the declaration of Lisa Mullins, NATSO\u2019s president and chief executive officer. Ms. Mullins states that NATSO has only ten employees,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> many of whom are working more than seventy hours per week \u201cto keep up with the day-today challenges of new and changing proposed legislation and regulations at both the federal and state levels that would significantly impact the industry.\u201d <footnotemark>47</footnotemark> She contends that \u201cresponding to the subpoena would require NATSO to divert more than 300 employee-hours away from NATSO\u2019s core mission\u201d and estimates the cost of responding would exceed $575,000.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> NATSO\u2019s annual budget is a little more than $2,000,000.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Thus, responding to the subpoena would consume about a quarter of NATSO\u2019s budget for the year and hamper the association\u2019s exercise of its First Amendment right to advocate on behalf of its members. There is evidence in the record that the other trade associations would face similar burdens.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">Many documents responsive to the subpoenas are privileged under the terms of this order. Many other responsive documents have been \u2014 or will be \u2014 produced by defendants, parties in this case who are better positioned to respond to the requested discovery. In balancing all of these factors, the court finds that the need for discovery from the trade associations is outweighed by the burden of reviewing and producing the documents.

Application of this Order and Production of Privilege Logs</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Although the court has determined that certain categories of documents are protected from disclosure by the First Amendment, it is clear defendants are withholding documents that do not fall under the limited privilege recognized in this order.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The court is not satisfied with the current privilege logs prepared by defendants.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> With respect to documents in the possession of defendants, many defendants have provided only categorical privilege logs that do not \u201cdescribe the nature of the documents\u201d being withheld and consequentially, do not permit plaintiffs to \u201cassess the claim\u201d of privilege.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> With respect to documents in the possession of PMCA-KS, defendants have produced a complete privilege log, but the privilege asserted is quite broad: \u201cFirst Amendment Privilege <em>(Heartland).\u201d </em>In other words, the log does not identify how the withheld documents relate to \u201ccore associational activities,\u201d such as \u201cconfidential membership lists\u201d or \u201clobbying strategy.\u201d Moreover, as discussed earlier, the court has determined that the privilege for \u201cpast political activity\u201d is much narrower than it has been construed by defendants in responding to plaintiffs\u2019 discovery. The creation of new privilege logs is therefore in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Defendants are directed to perform a fresh review of responsive documents to determine which are truly privileged, using this order as a guide. Documents previously withheld on the basis of \u201cFirst Amendment privilege,\u201d which under the confines of this order are not privileged, shall be produced to plaintiffs by June 26, 2009. Documents that defendants continue to assert a privilege over shall be listed in detailed (as opposed to categorical) privilege logs, which also shall be provided to plaintiffs by June 26, 2009.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> If plaintiffs thereafter wish to challenge the application of the First Amendment privilege to specific documents, the court will entertain <em>limited </em>motions for in camera review, provided such motions are filed by July 10, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">VI.

The <em>\"Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine\u201d refers to the recognition in <em>Eastern R.R. Presidents Conf. v.

Although the parties use the term <em>\"Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine,\u201d the Tenth Circuit has stated that the preferred nomenclature outside of the antitrust context is \u201cthe right to petition the government.\u201d <em>Cardtoons, L.C. v.

The undersigned U.S. Magistrate Judge does not decide the issue of whether the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine precludes liability under plaintiffs\u2019 civil conspiracy claims based on defendants\u2019 petitioning activity. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1), ultimately this is a dispositive matter appropriate for a U.S. District Judge to decide, and in any event its resolution is not necessary for the court\u2019s ruling today. That is, the parties do not dispute that the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine does not directly bar discovery, <em>see N.C. Elec. Membership Corp. v.

Plaintiffs have stated they \"would be happy to\u201d narrow the subpoenas to \"minimize the burden\u201d on trade associations. Plaintiffs' Supplemental Memorandum on First Amendment Issues (doc. 1072) at 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b468-6\">. For example, of the 861 pages of documents that PMCA-KS identified as responsive to plaintiffs' subpoena, defendants have asserted a First Amendment privilege over approximately 630 pages. At oral argument on these motions, defense counsel estimated that the privilege log created for those documents would be shortened by 40% to 50% if publicly disclosed documents were removed. As earlier indicated, the court has held that publicly disclosed documents are not subject to a First Amendment privilege.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b468-7\">. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(5)(A) requires the creation of a privilege log \"[wjhen a party withholds information otherwise discoverable by claiming that the information is privileged or subject to protection as trial-preparation material.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b468-19\">. Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(5)(A)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b468-20\">. The court observes, however, that as a practical matter defendants very well might determine there are no \"smoking gun\" documents responsive to plaintiffs' discovery requests, such that any benefit of withholding responsive documents is overcome by the expense and aggravation of having to produce corresponding privilege logs. If such is the case, defendants shall produce all responsive documents by June 26, 2009.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
