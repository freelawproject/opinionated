The order issued as a result of defendant\u2019s submission of an affidavit by A.M.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who claimed to be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>informant, in support of the motion for disclosure. The State was granted leave to take an interlocutory appeal and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">On March 24, 2009, Atlantic City Police Department Detective Howard Mason obtained a no-knock search warrant for defendant\u2019s residence. The warrant application included Mason\u2019s affidavit stating that two controlled purchases of marijuana were made by a confidential informant at defendant\u2019s home. Mason said the confidential informant identified the seller as \u201cPearl,\u201d the person the officer observed on one occasion walking out of the apartment with the informant after a sale. The officer recognized \u201cPearl\u201d from prior contacts, and knew him to be defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">When the warrant was executed on March 25, 2009, law enforcement officials recovered approximately fourteen ounces of marijuana, baggies, a scale, and a handgun. Defendant was not charged with any offenses arising from the controlled buys described in Mason\u2019s affidavit but was charged with the following: fourth-degree possession of over fifty grams of marijuana, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10a(3) (count one); third-degree possession of more than one ounce of marijuana with intent to distribute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5a(l) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5b(11) (count two); third-degree possession of marijuana with intent to distribute within 1000 feet of school property, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7 (count three); second-degree possession of marijuana with intent to distribute within 500 feet of a public housing facility, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7.1 (count four); second-degree possession of a handgun without a permit, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5b (count five); second-degree possession of a weapon while possessing marijuana with intent to distribute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:39\u20144.1 (count six); and second-degree possession of a handgun by a convicted person, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-7 (count seven).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">In granting defendant\u2019s motion for disclosure, the court correctly centered its analysis on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>516, which authorizes the admission of evidence as to the identity of a confidential informant when \u201cthe judge finds that (a) the identity of the person furnishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>the information has already been otherwise disclosed____\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court reasoned that because the identity of the informant had been disclosed to defendant, the State was required to \u201cconfirm or deny\u201d it. Here we part company with the motion judge, as we do not agree that A.M.\u2019s affidavit constituted disclosure within the meaning of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">A.M.\u2019s affidavit is exactly reproduced below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">I [A.M] nicknamed [ ] is giving this statement August 26, 2009 because it is the truth and I\u2019am aware it could damage Ricky future. On the days ACPD was targeting his house and useing me as an informant I stated to them I didn\u2019t purchase from ricky, I dealt soley with friends of his son HI pearl, young men I knew by face and I am a friend of ricky that came over often to do work with him, he never knew the relationship I had with his sons friends but everytime after calling lil pearl I went over to get some weed there was always 2 or 3 of the guys there in his office. Im doing this because he really didnt know anything about my purchases at his home. He is a good hard working family man that gave me work when I needed it to make some extra money he runs a promotion business Big Picture Production, Pam aware that this the right thing to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The State contends that to require it to confirm or deny the informant\u2019s identity is error because A.M.\u2019s affidavit is not the equivalent of \u201cdisclosure.\u201d Generally, we afford substantial deference to a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. <em>State v. Covell, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>554, 564, 725 A.2d 675 (1999) (quoting <em>State v. Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 266, 524 A.2d 188 (1987)). \u201c \u2018[A]bsent a showing of an abuse of discretion, <em>i.e., </em>[that] there has been a clear error of judgment,\u2019 \u201d an evidentiary ruling will stand. <em>State v. Brown, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>138, 147, 784 A.2d 1244 (2001) (citing <em>State v. Marrero, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>469, 484, 691 A.2d 293 (1997)). We do not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court, \u201cunless \u2018the ... ruling was so wide of the mark that a manifest denial of justice\u2019 \u201d would result. <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Marrero, supra, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>at 484, 691 A.2d 298) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>We believe that this ruling falls within that category. When the identity of an informant \u201chas [already] been disclosed to those who would have cause to resent the communication, the privilege is no longer applicable.\u201d <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 <em>U.S. </em>53, 60, 77 <em>S.Ct. </em>623, 627, 1 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>639, 644-45 (1957). <em>See also N.J.R.E. </em>516. The essential question in this case, however, is whether A.M.\u2019s affidavit actually constitutes disclosure within the meaning of the rule such that the State must either confirm or deny his identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The privilege belongs to the State and not to the informer. <em>Roviaro, supra, </em>353 <em>U.S. </em>at 59, 77 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 627, 1 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 644. <em>See also State v. Williams, </em>356 <em>N.J.Super. </em>599, 603, 813 A.2d 1215 (App.Div.2003); <em>State v. Foreshaw, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>166, 180, 584 A.2d 832 (App.Div.1991) (citations omitted). It is the government that decides when \u201cto withhold from disclosure the identity of persons who furnish information of violations of law to officers charged with enforcement of that law.\u201d <em>Roviaro, supra, </em>353 <em>U.S. </em>at 59, 77 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 627, 1 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 644 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The purpose of secrecy is twofold\u2014to protect the safety of the informant and to encourage the process of informing. <em>See ibid.; State v. Williams, supra, 856 N.J.Super. </em>at 603, 813 A.2d 1215. The public has a strong interest in sustaining the flow of information about crime to law enforcement, and informants are a key source of that intelligence. <em>See Roviaro, supra, </em>353 <em>U.S. </em>at 59, 77 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 627, 1 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 644. The privilege is in fact intended \u201cto protect the public interest in a continuous flow of information to law enforcement officials.\u201d <em>Grodjesk v. Faghani, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>89, 97, 514 A.2d 1328 (1986) (citations omitted). It is from this need for information that the presumption protecting the informer\u2019s identity arises. <em>Roviaro, supra, </em>353 <em>U.S. </em>at 59, 77 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 627,1 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Because the privilege belongs to the State and not the informant, we cannot agree with the motion judge that a \u201cdisclosure\u201d has occurred within the meaning of the rule. Even if A.M.\u2019s affidavit is entirely legitimate and was offered spontaneously, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>disclosure was neither made by the State nor made as a result of circumstances beyond defendant\u2019s control. It was made by the alleged informant himself, no doubt at defendant\u2019s urging. Theoretically, there is no longer a need to protect A.M.\u2019s physical safety. But A.M.\u2019s revelation does not advance the other public policy objective behind the privilege, which is to encourage the flow of information to law enforcement about crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Confirmation in this and similar scenarios would vitiate the privilege. It would place those suspected of being confidential informants in the unfortunate position of being pressured to come forward. Defendants would have a reason to tamper with potential witnesses as well as a mechanism by which they could force the State\u2019s hand to compel disclosure. It may encourage the practice of obtaining sworn statements with a careless regard for the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the cited exception to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>516 does not apply and that the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling issued in error and must be reversed. A.M.\u2019s affidavit is not the type of \u201cdisclosure\u201d contemplated in the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-14\"> Because of the claimed status as a confidential informant, the affiant will be identified in this opinion-only by the use of initials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b370-9\"> The second prong of the rule requires disclosure when \u201cessential to assure a fair determination of the issues.\" <em>N.J.R.E. </em>516. That exception is not implicated in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
