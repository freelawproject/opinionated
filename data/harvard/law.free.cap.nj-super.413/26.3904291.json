Plaintiff Robert C. Curtis became dissatisfied with the quality of the cellular telephone service provided by defendant, C\u00e9lico Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless, and refused to pay the outstanding account balance. Defendant reported plaintiffs non-payment to national credit bureaus, which he maintains negatively impacted his credit score and impeded his ability to procure desired financing. Plaintiff filed this action alleging, among other things, violations of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act (CFA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to\u2014106.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court dismissed plaintiffs complaint, concluding the expansive language of the parties\u2019 service contract compelled arbitration. On appeal, plaintiff argues the service agreement was a contract of adhesion and, to be enforceable, must specifically include a waiver of statutory claims. Plaintiff maintains the contract with defendant lacks this specific waiver. Following our plenary review, we disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Plaintiff entered into a \u201cVerizon Wireless Customer Agreement\u201d (the Agreement) with defendant to provide cellular telephone service during the period November 1, 2004 to November 1, 2006. The Agreement required a $175 payment for termination of the Agreement prior to its end date. We recite additional Agreement provisions relevant to our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The first paragraph of the document stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">We\u2019re Verizon Wireless. Please carefully read this Agreement, including the calling plan or plans you\u2019ve chosen, before filing it in a safe place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-10\">This agreement covers important topics such as when it begins, how long it lasts, fees for early termination and late payments, our rights to change the agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>and your wireless service, limitations of liability, use of information about you, and settlement of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The Agreement included expansive provisions for dispute resolution and mandatory arbitration. These terms were distinguished from the Agreement\u2019s other terms by a box placed around them and the use of capitalized and bolded print. The introductory clause of this section states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">Dispute Resolution And Mandatory Arbitration</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">co <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> INSTEAD OF SUING IN COURT, WE EACH AGREE TO SETTLE DISPUTES (EXCEPT CERTAIN SMALL CLAIMS) ONLY BY ARBITRATION. THE RULES IN ARBITRATION ARE DIFFERENT. THERE\u2019S NO JUDGE OR JURY, AND REVIEW IS LIMITED, BUT AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF, AND MUST HONOR THE SAME LIMITATIONS STATED IN THE AGREEMENT AS A COURT WOULD.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">The Agreement expressed that its arbitration provisions were governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1 to 16. In describing the disputes covered, the Agreement stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM\">ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ... OR ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE PROVIDED UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT ... WILL BE SETTLED BY ONE OR MORE NEUTRAL ARBITRATORS.... THIS DOESN\u2019T CHANGE YOUR SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS, JUST THE POTENTIAL FORUMS FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES. IN ADDITION YOU CAN STILL BRING ANY ISSUES YOU MAY HAVE TO THE ATTENTION OF APPROPRIATE FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND THEY CAN STILL, IF THE LAW ALLOWS, SEEK RELIEF AGAINST US ON YOUR BEHALF.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">In a separately numbered paragraph, in bold font, the Agreement provided: \u201cIF AN APPLICABLE STATUTE PROVIDES FOR AN AWARD OF ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THEM, TOO.\u201d Lastly, the Agreement stated: \u201cIF FOR SOME REASON THESE ARBITRATION REQUIREMENTS DON\u2019T APPLY, WE EACH WAIVE ANY TRIAL BY JURY.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">Defendant also gave plaintiff a Verizon Wireless Customer Information Overview (CIO). That document was not designed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u201creplace or supplement\u201d the Agreement but rather to \u201csuccinctly summarize!] the terms and conditions of the Customer Agreement.\u201d Using bold print, the CIO reiterated the basic parameters for using arbitration to resolve disputes. It too explained, \u201call such customer disputes (except certain small claims) will be resolved through arbitration, not with a judge or jury.\u201d Immediately before the account holder\u2019s signature, the CIO set forth, in bolded capital letters, the signor\u2019s agreement to accept the terms of the Agreement, the $175 early termination fee, and the \u201cSETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BY ARBITRATION AND OTHER MEANS INSTEAD OF JURY TRIALS!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Plaintiffs acceptance of these terms was confirmed by his electronic signature, as well as his activation and use of the wireless phone service plan. The first page of the Agreement included a procedure to cancel the Agreement \u201cwithin fifteen days of accepting\u201d if its terms were objectionable. Plaintiff did not cancel the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">When he purchased the wireless service, plaintiff provided his home address; however, defendant did not disclose the limited signal strength and quality of transmission and reception in that location. Plaintiff found the cellular telephone service in his home was unreliable due to \u201cdropped calls, poor reception and coverage gaps.\u201d A technician for defendant later told plaintiff that, due to a lack of transmission equipment, the signal at plaintiffs home address was marginal to non-existent. Based upon defendant\u2019s prior knowledge of the lack of reliable wireless service in his area, plaintiff insisted defendant breached the service agreement from its inception. Plaintiff refused to satisfy the payment obligation on his wireless account and canceled his service before the conclusion of the Agreement term. An August 9, 2006 invoice showed a balance due, including an early termination fee, of $769.66.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Plaintiff called a customer service representative to complain of the problems he experienced and to dispute his obligation to satisfy the sum claimed due. As a result of those conversations, plaintiff believed defendant consented to relieve him of the out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>standing obligation. However, on September 22, 2006, and June 22, 2007, plaintiff received notices from collection agencies seeking payment on defendant\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In July 2007, plaintiff applied for a home equity loan. He learned that, beginning in December 2006 and for several successive months thereafter, defendant reported plaintiffs nonpayment to credit reporting agencies. This adversely affected plaintiffs credit rating, and he was deemed ineligible for a desired lower interest rate on an equity line of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Plaintiff filed this action on December 12, 2007. He sought to amend his complaint and transfer the matter from the Special Civil Part to the Law Division. <em>R. </em>6:4-1. Defendant opposed the motion and moved to enforce the arbitration clause of the Agreement. The court granted plaintiffs request to transfer the matter to the Law Division for the purpose of consideration of the motions, then granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint and compel arbitration. Plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">We have little trouble concluding the Agreement contained a valid and binding provision for arbitration of disputes. <em>Martindale v. Sandvik, Inc., </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>76, 86, 800 A.2d 872 (2002). The arbitration provisions are sufficiently clear, unambiguously worded, satisfactorily distinguished from the other Agreement terms, and drawn in suitably broad language to provide a consumer with reasonable notice of the requirement to arbitrate all possible claims arising under the contract. Plaintiffs arguments to the contrary lack merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">We must examine, however, whether the contractual language \u201cclearly and unmistakably established\u201d that plaintiffs CFA claims fall within the scope of the arbitration clause of the Agreement. In this regard, some basic principles apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">First, we note the FAA \u201crequires courts to enforce privately negotiated agreements to arbitrate, like other contracts, in accordance with their terms.\u201d <em>Volt Info. Scis., Inc. v. Bd. of Trs. of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>468, 478,109 <em>S.Ct. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>1248, 1255, 108 L.Ed.2d 488, 500 (1989); <em>See Martindale, supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 84, 800 A.2d 872. Likewise, New Jersey courts favor arbitration as a means of resolving disputes, embracing the federal policy preferring this method of alternative dispute resolution. <em>Ibid.; EPIX Holdings Corp. v. Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos., </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>453, 471, 982 A.2d 1194 (App.Div.2009); <em>Bruno v. Mark MaGrann Assocs., </em>388 <em>N.J.Super. </em>539, 545, 909 A.2d 768 (App.Div.2006). \u201cBecause of the favored status afforded to arbitration, \u2018[a]n agreement to arbitrate should be read liberally in favor of arbitration.\u2019\u201d <em>Griffin v. Burlington Volkswagen, Inc., </em>411 <em>N.J.Super. </em>515, 518, 988 A.2d 101 (App.Div.2010) (quoting <em>Garfinkel v. Morristown Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Assocs., </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>124, 132, 773 A.2d 665 (2001)). <em>See Martindale, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 84, 800 A.2d 872. Accordingly, \u201ccourts operate under a \u2018presumption of arbitrability in the sense that an order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.\u2019 \u201d <em>EPIX Holdings, supra, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 471, 982 A.2d 1194 (quoting <em>Caldwell v. KFC Corp., </em>958 <em>F.Supp. </em>962, 973 (D.N.J.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Second, \u201cagreements to arbitrate are not violative of public policy.\u201d <em>Martindale, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 84, 800 A.2d 872 (citing <em>Marchak v. Claridge Commons, Inc., </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>275, 281-82, 633 A.2d 531 (1993)). It is well-settled \u201cthat parties to an agreement may waive statutory remedies in favor of arbitration[.]\u201d <em>Garfinkel, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 131, 773 A.2d 665; <em>see Red Bank Reg\u2019l Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Red Bank Reg\u2019l High Sch. Bd. of Educ., </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>122, 140, 393 A.2d 267 (1978) (observing that the \u201cpropriety of a contractual waiver of statutory rights is well-established\u201d). \u201cOnly \u2018if a statute or its legislative history evidences an intention to preclude alternate forms of dispute resolution, will arbitration be an unenforceable option.\u2019 \u201d <em>EPIX Holdings, supra, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 477, 982 A.2d 1194 (quoting <em>Alamo Rent A Car, Inc. v. Galarza, </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>384, 389, 703 A.2d 961 (App.Div.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Courts have determined arbitration is an appropriate forum to vindicate statutory rights asserted under: the Family Leave Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:11B-1 to -16, <em>Martindale, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 81-83, 800 A.2d 872; the Civil Rights Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:6-1 to -2, <em>EPIX Holdings, supra, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 468-75, 982 A.2d 1194; the CFA, <em>Gras v.

Commodities Corp., </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>391, 405-07, 678 A.2d 1165 (App.Div.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Third, because an agreement to arbitrate is a contract, \u201conly those issues may be arbitrated which the parties have agreed shall be.\u201d <em>Garfinkel, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 132, 773 A.2d 665 (citing <em>In re Arbitration Between Grover &amp; Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>221, 228, 403 A.2d 448 (1979)). Accordingly, the examination of the scope of any arbitration provision must be on \u201ca case-by-ease basis.\u201d <em>Rockel v. Cherry Hill Dodge, </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>577, 580, 847 A.2d 621 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>545, 859 A.2d 689 (2004). We must determine whether the parties entered a valid agreement to arbitrate the issues presented in plaintiffs complaint based upon state contract law. <em>EPIX Holdings, supra, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 470, 982 A.2d 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Finally, in the context of consumer agreements,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">[a] contractual provision in which a consumer elects arbitration as the exclusive remedy [ ] must [ ] be read in light of its effect on the consumer\u2019s right to sue. A clause depriving a citizen of access to the courts should clearly state its purpose. The point is to assure that the parties know that in electing arbitration as the exclusive remedy, they are waiving their time-honored right to sue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\"><em>[Marchak, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 282, 633 A.2d 531.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">Arbitration of statutory claims is enforceable when the contract provisions (1) contain language reflecting a general understanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>of the type of claims included in the waiver; or (2) provide that, by signing, the consumer agrees to arbitrate \u201call statutory claims arising out of the relationship,\u201d or any claim or dispute based on a federal or state statute. <em>Gras, supra, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 56-57, 786 A.2d 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In examining whether the scope of an arbitration clause encompasses a CFA claim, we understand the tension between, on the one hand, the policy favoring liberal construction of arbitration provisions in a contract and, on the other hand, the CFA\u2019s intended effect of rooting out consumer fraud. <em>Rockel, supra, </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 580, 847 A.2d 621; <em>Gras, supra, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 53, 786 A.2d 886. When these two policies are in \u201cequipoise,\u201d we have held that enforcement of arbitration clauses turns on whether the parties\u2019 contract \u201ccontain[s] the appropriate attributes.\u201d <em>Rockel, supra, </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 580, 847 A.2d 621; <em>see Gras, supra, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 54, 786 A.2d 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Relying on <em>Garfinkel </em>and <em>Gras, </em>plaintiff argues that even if the terms constitute a valid and legal contract to arbitrate, they do not unambiguously require arbitration of \u201cfederal and/or state statutory claims.\u201d He suggests the Agreement\u2019s arbitration provisions, although extensive, are limited because they do not expressly \u201cdisclose that by signing the consumer agrees to arbitrate any claim or dispute based on a federal or state statute.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">In <em>Garfinkel, supra, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>at 129, 773 A.2d 665, the arbitration clause in the plaintiffs employment contract sought to encompass LAD claims. The clause did not contain a waiver of a jury trial, a right expressly granted to LAD claimants. <em>Id. </em>at 130-31, 773 A.2d 665. The Court concluded the LAD\u2019s choice of forum provision was of vital importance and an arbitration agreement must \u201cclearly and unmistakably\u201d evidence an employee\u2019s intent to abandon that right. <em>Id. </em>at 136, 773 A.2d 665 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">We have found nothing in the CFA that precludes vindication of a consumer\u2019s \u201cstatutory rights in the arbitral forum.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number><em>Gras, supra, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 53, 786 A.2d 886. While holding that a waiver of statutory rights \u201cmust be clear and explicit,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 54, 786 A.2d 886, such waivers need not specifically refer to every imaginable statute. <em>Id. </em>at 56, 786 A.2d 886. In <em>Gras, </em>we concluded the policy in favor of the arbitration of disputes sufficiently outweighed the plaintiffs\u2019 statutory right to present their CFA claims to a jury in a court of law when the arbitration provisions were \u201cspecific enough to inform plaintiffs that they were waiving their statutory rights to litigation in a court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57, 786 A.2d 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Thus, it is well-established that CFA claims may be the subject of arbitration and need not be exclusively presented in a judicial forum. <em>Rockel, supra, </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 580, 847 A.2d 621; <em>Gras, supra, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 52-53, 786 A.2d 886. Accordingly, nothing precludes plaintiffs presentation of his CFA claims in arbitration if the parties\u2019 agreement so provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Turning to the Agreement\u2019s language, we note it mandates the waiver of a jury trial in favor of submitting \u201cany controversy or claim arising out of or related to this [A]greement\u201d or \u201cany service provided under or in connection with this [A]greement\u201d to arbitration. Moreover, the Agreement defines claims to include the statutory right for reimbursement of attorney\u2019s fees. These provisions are succinctly stated, unambiguous, easily noticeable, and specific with regard to the actual terms and manner of arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Here, the language of the arbitration clauses do not suffer the same flaw identified in <em>Garfinkel, </em>as they include a clear and explicit waiver of the right to judicial adjudication. Reinforced by information in the CIO and the statement containing plaintiffs signature signifying acceptance, we determine the provisions requiring arbitration are unambiguous, highlighted, and easily understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Regarding the scope of the arbitration clause, \u201c[c]ourts have generally read the terms \u2018arising out of or \u2018relating to\u2019 [in] a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>contract as indicative of an \u2018extremely broad\u2019 agreement to arbitrate any dispute relating in any way to the contract.\u201d <em>Griffin, supra, </em>411 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 518, 988 A.2d 101 (quoting <em>Angrisani v. Financial Tech. Ventures, L.P., </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>138,149, 952 A.2d 1140 (App.Div.2008)). Such broad clauses have been construed to require arbitration of any dispute between the contracting parties that is connected in any way with their contract. <em>Ibid.; EPIX Holdings, supra, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 472, 982 A.2d 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The Agreement\u2019s arbitration clauses are \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d in their intent and purpose to inform the reader that all disputes must be presented in an arbitral forum, not a court. <em>Martindale, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 96, 800 A.2d 872; <em>see Rockel, supra, </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 581, 847 A.2d 621 (rejecting applicability of an arbitration clause for CFA claims as the parties\u2019 two agreements were highly ambiguous with disparate clauses regarding arbitration). While the language does not expressly identify the applicability of arbitration to federal and state statutory claims, which would be dispositive pursuant to our holding in <em>Gras, </em>it unmistakably informs a consumer accepting its terms for wireless telephone service that he or she must settle \u201cany controversy or claim arising out of or related to th[e] agreement\u201d in arbitration, where \u201cthere is no judge or jury.\u201d Finally, the Agreement mentions statutory claims for attorney\u2019s fees related to any dispute, which can be awarded in an arbitration proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Overall, the Agreement employs language reflecting that disposition of disputes will occur outside the courts. The terms gave plaintiff reasonable notice that, upon signing, he was waiving his right to judicial adjudication. <em>Rockel, supra, </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 586, 847 A.2d 621. Further, the Agreement makes apparent that a party does not forgo any substantive rights in submitting resolution to an arbitrator, rather than a court. <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>473 <em>U.S. </em>614, 628, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>3346, 3354, 87 L.Ed.2d 444, 456 (1985); <em>Martindale, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 93, 800 A.2d 872. Under these circumstances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>the Agreement reflects a willingness to arbitrate all claims, contractual, as well as statutory, flowing from those disputes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Scrutinizing plaintiffs specific claims, we note he sought damages for breach of contract, fraud (alleging the early termination fee was in reality an undisclosed liquidated damage clause), and CFA violations resulting from defendant\u2019s attempted collection efforts. The expressed factual allegations are that defendant knew its wireless service was inadequate at the inception of the contract and that its subsequent conduct to collect the tees for service and an early termination fee were actionable. Each of these claims \u201ctouch matters covered by the parties\u2019 contract.\u201d <em>EPIX Holdings, supra, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 473, 982 A.2d 1194 (quotations and citations omitted). We determine the Agreement\u2019s terms made clear that the subject matter of plaintiffs dispute, which arises out of the terms of the Agreement, must be vindicated in an arbitral forum. <em>Leodori v. CIGNA Corp., </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>293, 302-03, 814 A.2d 1098 (2003). Consequently, \u201c[cjompelling arbitration under these circumstances is fair and equitable.\u201d <em>Martindale, supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 96, 800 A.2d 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">We also reject plaintiffs argument implicating procedural unconscionability, suggesting that the Agreement is unenforceable because it contained \u201ca hidden term\u201d that is, the use of the symbol \u201c 00 \u2022\u201d Plaintiff submits the insertion of the infinity symbol is not disclosed and extends the contract term for arbitration for an unspecified period.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The infinity symbol was defined in the third paragraph of the Agreement\u2019s first page, which states: \u201cTHIS AGREEMENT STARTS WHEN YOU ACCEPT. Paragraphs marked \u2018oo\u2019 continue after it ends.\u201d Thereafter, the symbol is used eleven times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>in the Agreement. Relevant to our review is its insertion immediately prior to the description of the use of arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">In considering this argument, the trial judge found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqW\">there is nothing unfair or unconscionable about that language----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">With regard to the inclusion of the symbol infinity, even if the [clourt were to find that was somehow a hidden term, which the [clourt does not find, the [clourt finds that the dispute herein arises based upon and during the existence of the two-year contract that plaintiff signed, which went from November 1st, 2004 through November 1st, 2006.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">We reject plaintiffs arguments that the symbol was defined \u201cin very small type ... not explained in any other section of the document and it is printed but not explained in the section dealing with mandatory arbitration where the larger bold print capital letters appear[.]\u201d We cannot agree the symbol was hidden. It was defined in the beginning of the Agreement. Plaintiff had the opportunity and ability to read the plain language of the Agreement and was fairly apprised that he was not giving up his ability to vindicate substantive rights. Nothing in the record suggests he was infirmed, unsophisticated, confused or even had questions about the Agreement\u2019s terms. Also, there is no \u201cgross disparity in the relative bargaining positions of the parties.\u201d <em>Muhammad v. County Bank of Rehoboth Beach, DE, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>1, 18, 912 A.2d 88 (2006). In the absence of any unfair circumstances, we discern none of the indicia of procedural unconscionability. <em>See Sitogum Holdings, Inc. v. Ropes, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>555, 564-65, 800 A.2d 915 (Ch.Div.2002) (stating procedural unconscionability, \u201ccan include a variety of inadequacies, such as age, literacy, lack of sophistication, hidden or unduly complex contract terms, bargaining tactics, and the particular setting existing during the contract formation process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">We conclude the parties agreed to arbitrate, plaintiff\u2019s statutory claims fall within the scope of those provisions, and his claims can be vindicated in arbitration. Accordingly, plaintiff is bound to the Agreement, which mandates disputes be arbitrated. <em>Martindale, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 92-94, 800 A.2d 872; <em>Gras, supra, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 53-54, 786 A.2d 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-12\"> Plaintiff's complaint is not included in the record.
