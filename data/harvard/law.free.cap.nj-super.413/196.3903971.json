Brabham guilty of second-degree burglary, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:18-2a(1), b(1), second-degree robbery, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:15-1a, and fourth-degree theft, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:20-3a. The judge merged defendant\u2019s conviction for theft with his convictions for burglary and robbery, granted the State\u2019s motion for sentencing as a persistent offender on the robbery conviction, <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:44-3a, and sentenced defendant to a ten-year term of imprisonment for burglary and a concurrent eighteen-year term for robbery. Both sentences are subject to terms of parole ineligibility and parole supervision required by the No Early Release Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-7.2. The judge also imposed the appropriate fines, penalties and assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">Defendant primarily objects to the denial of his motions to suppress physical evidence seized by a New York parole officer during a search of his home and statements he made to New Jersey law enforcement officers. Accepting the judge\u2019s factual findings, we conclude that the physical evidence was properly admitted but the statements defendant made during a <em>meeting he </em>requested to negotiate a plea should have been excluded pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>410.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">At about half-past eight on the morning of February 21, 2006, Catherine Zahos heard a noise on the second floor of her home, which is located on Martinsville Road in Basking Ridge. After she called upstairs to find out who or what she had heard, a man she did not know ran down the staircase carrying a bundle. As he reached Zahos, he grabbed her hair and necklace, pushed her head down, dragged her to the living room and forced her to the floor. Threatening to kill her, he demanded money. He then went to the kitchen to get cash from her purse. Zahos followed and was again knocked to the floor. The intruder left with the bundle, but Zahos went outside and saw him leave in a green Altima with a New York license plate. An employee working in the Zahos family business, which is located behind the residence, also saw the man leaving with a bundle in a green Altima with a New York license plate.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">When the police arrived at the Zahos home, they found damage to the rear door of the house leading from a breezeway to the kitchen and a piece of the broken lock on the kitchen floor. Zahos was shaking, smoking a lot and appeared to be \u201cvery distraught.\u201d The police were not able to obtain a fingerprint with sufficient detail to permit identification of a suspect. According to Zahos, jewelry, including a gold medallion with a starburst design on one side and a depiction of the Parthenon on the other, as well as rings, pins and crosses were taken. In addition, a .38 caliber handgun and a comforter were missing. Neither Zahos nor her employee was able to give more than a general description of the intruder or provide the number of his New York license plate.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Others saw a green Altima with a New York license plate in the vicinity of the Zahos home on the morning of the burglary. Cheryl Himmelrich, who lives about a five-to-ten minute drive irom the Zahos property, was outside with her Labrador Retriever and approached the driver of a blue-green Altima with a New York license plate who backed into her driveway. He left after asking her about a family that did not live on her street. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>same morning, Debra Albanese was driving to work via Martins-ville Road. She noticed a green Altima with New York plates in front of her car because it was being driven at varying speeds and saw the driver turn into a driveway and toward the back of the house. The following day, in response to a flier distributed by police stationed near that driveway, Albanese reported what she had seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">None of these witnesses could identify defendant as the man they saw on the morning of the Zahos home invasion. The evidence linking defendant to the crimes was a gold medallion identified by Zahos as hers, which was recovered during a search of defendant\u2019s home conducted by his parole officer in New York, and statements defendant made to New Jersey law enforcement officers after he was incarcerated as a consequence of violating conditions of his parole in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">New Jersey law enforcement officers, who testified at trial, repeated what they recalled about statements defendant made during two meetings. In April 2006, defendant told the officers that they had done their job by finding the person that did this, meaning himself. In May, defendant told the officers that he got the idea to use the back door from a television show, described the odor of smoke in the home of an old lady, \u201claugh[ed] about the fact that [she] kept getting up and coming back after him,\u201d and spoke of an encounter in a driveway with a woman accompanied by a large dog that caused him to abandon his plan to burglarize a home in her neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Defendant\u2019s testimony at trial contradicted the officers\u2019 account of their meetings and his statements. He denied meeting with them in April. Although he acknowledged a meeting in May, he contended that he was transported there from Rikers Island, could not refuse to go and, other than asking for his lawyer, had said nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">At trial, defendant also described his background and addressed circumstantial evidence pointing to him as the perpetrator of the Zahos burglary. He is a college graduate with a paralegal certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>cate and works for a real estate management company in Larchmont. He collects jewelry, is part Greek and acquired his gold medallion while visiting family in Greece. He lives with his wife and daughter. His lawyer introduced a \u201cNavy\u201d ring, which was seized by the parole officer along with Zahos\u2019s gold medallion, and defendant testified that the ring was a gift from his father-in-law. He also explained that the Altima is his wife\u2019s car, and during the work week she leaves it at a ferry terminal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The jury found defendant guilty of burglary, robbery and theft of property with a value in excess of $500 but not guilty of taking a gun from the Zahos residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">[At the court\u2019s direction, its discussion of defendant\u2019s challenges to the search has been omitted from the published opinion.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">Defendant contends that the trial judge erred in denying his motion to preclude admission of statements he made after his arrest. On appeal his attorney raises these issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">II. THE DEFENDANT\u2019S CUSTODIAL STATEMENTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED BECAUSE THEY WERE OBTAINED WITHOUT <em>MIRANDA </em>WARNINGS, WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE THAT TWO CRIMINAL COMPLAINTS WERE FILED AGAINST HIM, AND WERE GIVEN IN THE CONTEXT OF PLEA NEGOTIATIONS.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-12\">A. The failure to administer a complete set of <em>Miranda </em>Warnings requires the suppression of defendant\u2019s oral statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-13\">B. At the May 8, 2006 meeting, the defendant was not told that two new criminal complaints were filed against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-14\">G. The defendant\u2019s statements were made during plea negotiations and therefore were inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>In addition, defendant has filed a pro se supplemental brief in which he argues:</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">II. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION TO SUPPRESS STATEMENTS THAT WERE ALLEGEDLY MADE BY DEFENDANT, WHICH WERE TAKEN AND ADMITTED INTO EVIDENCE BY THE PROSECUTION, IN VIOLATION OF DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHTS UNDER THE FIFTH, SIXTH, AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND NEW JERSEY\u2019S PRIVILEGE AGAINST SELF-INCRIMINATION.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">A. The prosecution introduced as evidence statements that were taken absent the required <em>Miranda </em>warnings, which made them inadmissible for use during the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">B. Defendant was denied his right to counsel when he was forcibly produced at a New York State District Attorney\u2019s office under court order, at the request of New Jersey officials for the purpose of an alleged attorney\u2019s conference or plea negotiation without his attorney being notified or present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">C. The court below failed to hold the prosecution to its burden under the New Jersey Rules of Evidence of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was properly informed of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>before allowing orally made custodial statements to be admitted as evidence of guilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">The evidence relevant to defendant\u2019s challenges to the admission of his statements was presented at a pre-trial hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. Detective Jon Burger and Lieutenant Edward Byrnes of the Bernards Township Police Department, Sergeant Sean Brown of the Long Hill Township Police Department and defendant testified. Through sharing information with other law enforcement agencies in New Jersey investigating residential burglaries involving a green Altima, the police suspected defendant committed the crimes against Zahos.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">After defendant was arrested as a consequence of the parole search on March 7, 2006, he was taken to the parole office. Byrnes, who was present at the time of the arrest and went to the parole office thereafter, sat near defendant and asked to speak to him. According to Byrnes, defendant said Byrnes could speak to him but he would not say anything. Byrnes advised defendant he would have to read him the warnings required by <em>Miranda, </em>but defendant interrupted, saying that he knew his rights. \u25a0 They had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>no further conversation that day. By defendant\u2019s account, he invoked his right to counsel when Byrnes tried to speak to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Burger and Brown returned to the New York parole office to obtain reports on March 22, 2006. By that time defendant had been confined at Rikers Island on his New York sentence. Defendant called the parole office from Rikers Island while the New Jersey officers were there, and he asked to speak to them. According to Burger, he was aware that defendant was represented by an attorney and told defendant he could not speak to him, but defendant replied that his lawyer worked for him, that he wanted to speak to the police directly and agreed to meet with the officers at Rikers Island. By defendant\u2019s account, the conversation was about him getting back documents that were not part of a New Jersey case.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Burger and Brown testified that they went to see defendant at Rikers Island on April 20, 2006, but defendant denied ever meeting with the officers at Rikers Island. The officers claimed that defendant cut Brown off when he attempted to advise him in accordance with <em>Miranda. </em>Burger recalled defendant saying, \u201cI know my rights. If I need my attorney at any time I know I can get one. And, you know, I don\u2019t need one now, I\u2019m talking to you, essentially.\u201d According to Brown, defendant said \u201cwhoa, whoa, whoa, I know my rights, I know if I need my attorney, I\u2019ll get him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The officers testified that there was no discussion of the details of the crimes that day and that they did not question defendant. Burger described the exchange as \u201ca very one-sided conversation,\u201d in which \u201c[i]t was basically [defendant] laying out everything that he knew.\u201d Defendant told the officers that he knew he could get three to five years for each burglary in New Jersey and how the system worked. He said he would talk to them if he could get one \u201cState\u2019s Attorney\u201d to go over all of the cases. When Burger warned defendant it might be difficult to get one prosecutor to handle all of the cases because the crimes were committed in different counties and not within the jurisdiction of one county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>prosecutor, defendant said, \u201c[T]hat ain\u2019t your problem, that\u2019s their problem. You guys did your job, you guys found the guy that did this, you guys found me. Let them work that out.\u201d Brown\u2019s recollection of the conversation was similar: when defendant was told that there could be three or four counties involved, defendant assured the detectives it \u201cwasn\u2019t [their] problem, that [they] had done [their] job ...[,] found the person that did this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Both officers recalled defendant being asked for the name of his lawyer. Burger thought Brown got the name, but Brown said he did not and that defendant had told them to go through him. In any event, the officers did not contact defendant\u2019s lawyer, and a second meeting was arranged.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The second meeting was held on May 8, 2006 in the office of a New York District Attorney. Burger, Brown, officers from other municipalities in New Jersey, and an assistant prosecutor from Middlesex County attended.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Brown explained that the assistant prosecutor was present because the plan was to discuss the potential for a plea bargain. Burger and Brown gave generally consistent accounts of the May 8 meeting. According to the officers, defendant interrupted efforts to advise him of his rights in accordance with <em>Miranda. </em>Attempts by both Brown and the assistant prosecutor evoked the same response: defendant insisted that he knew his rights and did not need to be advised and said that if he wanted to talk to his attorney he would let them know.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Both officers acknowledged that when defendant told them he knew his rights he also said that his statements would not be on the record. Burger recalled the assistant prosecutor trying to explain. He repeated their dialogue: \u201c[A]nything you tell us here\u2014I know my rights. I know my rights. But this is still off the record.\u201d According to Brown, however, the assistant prosecutor told defendant that \u201cnothing was off the record and that it would, in fact, be on the record.\u201d Neither officer testified that defendant was told that what he said would be used against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Brown and Burger testified that defendant took control of the meeting. He asked each of the officers present where they were from and disclosed information about the crimes in their respective jurisdictions. With respect to the Zahos burglary, defendant mentioned the odor of cigarette smoke in the old lady\u2019s house, laughed a little bit and said she kept getting up and he kept pushing her down\u2014she kept coming after him and even followed him outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The officers admitted that they asked defendant questions during the meeting. Burger testified that he \u201casked him about the .38 caliber gun, if there was one particularly taken from the residence and he said no, I don\u2019t take guns.\u201d Burger also recalled saying something about the lady being \u201ctough,\u201d to which defendant responded, \u201cyeah, she kept getting up and kept coming after me.\u201d Brown asked defendant if he had \u201cdone any other burglaries in the area of Long Hill Township[/]Bernards Township town line,\u201d which prompted a response from defendant describing an encounter with a \u201cfellow\u201d walking a dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">By defendant\u2019s account of the May 8 meeting, the assistant prosecutor appeared to be there under the false impression that defendant had asked for the meeting. He had not asked for the meeting, did not want to attend and told all present that they would have to speak to his attorney. After that, the officers outlined the facts of the eases in their respective jurisdictions, but, beyond denying his involvement, he did not say anything. No one attempted to advise him of his rights. Defendant further testified that he knew nothing about New Jersey law and consolidation of cases involving crimes committed in separate counties prior to that meeting, but he also said that he thought the assistant prosecutor intended to work out a resolution of all of the cases in the various counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">According to the officers, defendant eventually agreed to give a recorded statement in the presence of his attorney and gave them his attorney\u2019s name. They attempted to contact the attorney but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>were unable to reach him. For that reason, defendant did not give a recorded statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The trial judge denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the statements he made on several grounds. Relevant to the State\u2019s duty to deliver the advisements required by <em>Miranda, </em>the judge found: \u201cThe detective in this case attempted to inform defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, but the defendant refused to listen. The court notes that in such set of circumstances, the defendant has effectively waived his right to be informed. Accordingly, the defendant is estopped from asserting his rights under <em>Miranda.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Additionally, crediting the officers\u2019 testimony, the judge found that <em>Miranda </em>did not apply because there was no interrogation and defendant volunteered the statements. He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the detectives are telling the truth____ [T]he defendant wants to run the show. That the defendant is basically orchestrating what\u2019s going to happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-9\">He\u2019s effectively telling them what to do. And that despite their many attempts to advise defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>warning, he constantly interrupts them and will not let them do it. Purposely will not let them do it. Repeatedly they try to give him the <em>Miranda </em>warning and consistently he interrupts them. He prevents them from giving the <em>Miranda </em>warning and then says what he wants to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-10\">- The most compelling example is when he has a number of detectives from a variety of towns sitting at the DA\u2019s office with an assistant prosecutor there and the defendant tries to run the show by telling everybody, well, this is off the record, and the AP says, no, it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not off the record, everything is on the record____ [A]nd then we have a round robin, ... the defendant would go down the line and as the detective[s] would introduce themselves [he would] tell what town they were from, the defendant would then go to proceed to tell them what he did in that town and describe the criminal events.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-13\">It wasn\u2019t pursuant to questioning. He wanted to orchestrate a deal ... where everything was combined. And he decided that he did not want his attorney called in____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-14\">The judge rejected defendant\u2019s testimony that he was transported to the meeting, could not refuse to attend and did not speak. He found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-15\">The most telling example of that not being the truth is that all of these people took time from all of the various towns to meet with the defendant at the DA\u2019s office____ That didn\u2019t just happen. That was orchestrated. And it was orchestrated by the defendant, frankly. So what he says to the detective is admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">To admit a statement obtained during custodial interrogation, the prosecution must demonstrate that the defendant was informed in accordance with <em>Miranda </em>and knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his or her rights. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 479, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 1630, 16 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>694, 726 (1966); <em>State v. O\u2019Neill, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>148, 168, 936 A.2d 438 (2007). \u201c \u2018[T]he New Jersey common law privilege against self-incrimination affords greater protection to an individual than that accorded under the federal privilege.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. A.G.D., </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>56, 67, 835 A.2d 291 (2003) (quoting <em>In re Grand Jury Proceedings of Guarino, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>218, 229, 516 A.2d 1063 (1986)). Thus, under the law of this State, the prosecution \u201c\u2018must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the suspect\u2019s waiver [of the privilege against self-incrimination] was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary in light of all the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>State v. Presha, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>304, 313, 748 A.2d 1108 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">In this case, the evidence the State introduced to meet its burden under the foregoing standards established a different ground for exclusion of the statements defendant made at the May 8 meeting. As defense counsel argued in the trial court and contends on appeal, the State\u2019s proofs and the trial judge\u2019s findings required exclusion of the statements pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>410.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> With respect to the statements defendant made during the May 8 meeting at the District Attorney\u2019s office, we fully agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>410, with exceptions not relevant here, \u201cany statement made during plea negotiations ... is not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding against the person who made the plea or statement or who was the subject of the plea negotiations.\u201d Thus, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>410 supersedes <em>State v. Boyle, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>64, 69-73, 486 A.2d 852 (App.Div.1984), a case in which we held that statements volunteered during a plea negotia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>tion could be admitted into evidence in a criminal proceeding. <em>See </em>1991 Supreme Court Committee Comment to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>410 (noting that change in the law) (reprinted in Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>410 (2009)). The rationale for this evidence rule is that \u201cfor \u2018plea bargaining to work effectively and fairly, a defendant must be free to negotiate without fear that his statements will later be used against him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boyle, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 69, 486 A.2d 852 (quoting <em>United States v. Herman, </em>544 <em>F.2d </em>791, 796 (5th Cir.1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The judge\u2019s factual findings compel us to conclude that <em>N.J.R.E. </em>410 required exclusion of everything defendant said at the May 8 meeting. Accepting the State\u2019s proofs, he found: the presence of law enforcement officers at a meeting with defendant did not just happen but occurred because the meeting was orchestrated by defendant; defendant wanted to \u201crun the show\u201d and was \u201cbasically orchestrating what [was] going to happen\u201d; he said \u201cwhat he want[ed] to say\u201d; and \u201c[h]e wanted to orchestrate a deal ... where everything was combined.\u201d Those findings, which are well-supported by the officers\u2019 testimony, including the State\u2019s explanation for the presence of the assistant prosecutor, do not permit any conclusion other than that defendant believed he was attending the meeting he wanted to have\u2014a meeting to negotiate a global plea agreement resolving multiple burglaries committed in various counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Without any evidence that defendant was informed that the officers and the assistant prosecutor attended the meeting to collect incriminating statements to be used against defendant at trial, the facts, as the judge found them to be, required exclusion of the statements pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>410. In short, we conclude that the State cannot introduce evidence to convince the court that a suspect has volunteered statements and then avoid the legal implications that flow from the proofs presented. It was error to admit these statements after finding that the statements were made under circumstances in which they cannot be admitted in conformity with <em>N.J.R.E. </em>410.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>To avoid confusion, we stress that we have not found a violation of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>410 because the suspect hoped that cooperation would bring favorable treatment. This decision is based on factual findings of the trial judge that compel the conclusion that defendant thought he was volunteering his statements during a meeting he requested to negotiate a plea bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Because <em>N.J.R.E. </em>410 requires exclusion of the statements defendant made at the May 8 meeting, there is no need to consider the propriety of the court\u2019s ruling that a suspect who interrupts <em>Miranda </em>warnings is estopped from seeking relief on the ground that the State failed to deliver them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It also makes it unnecessary for us to address the obvious conflict between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>judge\u2019s finding that defendant was not interrogated at the May 8 meeting and the officers\u2019 testimony detailing the questions they asked. Our ruling on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>410 also eliminates any reason to consider whether defendant was advised of all charges pending against him on May 8. Our silence on these issues should not be understood as an implied endorsement of the rulings or the adequacy of the State\u2019s evidence on these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">We also stress that our reliance on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>410 should not obscure the fact that the circumstances of the May 8 meeting raise a question about the validity of defendant\u2019s waiver of his right against self-incrimination. That question is whether defendant made statements at the May 8 meeting that he \u201cwould not have made had it not been for the misleading actions of the Government.\u201d <em>United States v. Swint, </em>15 F.3d 286, 290 (3d Cir.1994); see <em>also State v.

Pillar, </em>359 <em>N.J.Super. </em>249, 268, 820 A.2d 1 (App.Div.) (concluding that the State was obligated to dispel confusion about whether defendant\u2019s statements were on or off the record), <em>certif. denied, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>572, 832 A.2d 322 (2003). \u201c[Pjolice officers conducting a custodial interrogation cannot withhold essential information necessary for the exercise of the privilege----\u201d <em>O\u2019Neill, supra, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>at 179, 936 A.2d 438. We do not address that issue because it is not necessary to our decision and defendant has not argued the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Because we cannot conclude that the judge\u2019s factual findings with respect to the May 8 meeting have any relevance to the meeting at Rikers Island, we turn to consider defendant\u2019s claim that <em>Miranda </em>required exclusion of the statement he made during the April meeting held at Rikers Island. It was during that meeting that defendant assured the officers that they had done their job and found the right person.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\"><em>Miranda </em>has no application to statements that are \u201cvolunteered.\u201d <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 478, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1630, 16 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d at 726. Interrogation triggering the State\u2019s obligation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>deliver <em>Miranda </em>warnings requires \u201cwords or actions on the part of the police that they should have known were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 <em>U.S. </em>291, 303, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>1682, 1691, 64 L.Ed.2d 297, 309 (1980); <em>State v. Ward, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>412, 417, 573 A.2d 505 (App.Div. 1990) (quoting Innis); <em>see State v. Stott, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>343, 365, 794 A.2d 120 (2002) (referencing the <em>Innis </em>standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">With respect to the statement defendant made at Rikers Island, the judge\u2019s conclusion that it was volunteered and not a product of interrogation is \u201c \u2018supported by sufficient credible evidence in the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Gandhi </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>161, 200, 989 A.2d 256 (2010) (quoting <em>State v. Elders, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>224, 243, 927 A.2d 1250 (2007)). There is no evidence in this record even suggesting that either of the officers said or did anything reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response during that meeting. By the officers\u2019 account, which is the only account, the conversation was one-sided; defendant set forth what he knew about his potential exposure and expressed his desire to have the charges resolved by one prosecutor and without his lawyer. Thus, there is no reason to disturb the judge\u2019s decision to admit the statement assuring the officers\u2019 that they had done their job. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Defendant\u2019s claimed violation of <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 <em>U.S. </em>477, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981), warrants no more than brief comment. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2). The judge did not credit his testimony, and the officers, whom the judge believed, testified that defendant did not invoke his right to counsel at any point prior to his refusal to give a recorded statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In summary, we have concluded that defendant\u2019s statement assuring the officers that they had done their job and found the person who committed these crimes was properly admitted. In contrast, we have determined that the statements defendant made at the May 8 meeting were admitted in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">That leaves us to consider whether the admission of the statements defendant made at the May 8 meeting was harmless error. <em>R. </em>2:10-2. While we have no doubt that the admissible evidence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>adequate to permit a conviction, it is not sufficiently overwhelming to eliminate all reasonable doubt about whether the verdict would have been different if the statements were excluded. <em>State v. Castagna, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>293, 312, 901 A.2d 363 (2006); <em>see Chapman v. California, </em>386 <em>U.S. </em>18, 24, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>824, 828,17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-11 (1967). The statements at issue provided additional and persuasive evidence of guilt. The likely impact on jurors who heard the officers repeat defendant\u2019s recitation of facts disclosing his familiarity with the Zahos home and the victim\u2019s response to her attacker is too apparent to require elaboration. Accordingly, we conclude that defendant\u2019s conviction must be reversed and the case must be remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">IV</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">[At the court\u2019s direction, its discussion of the additional issues raised on appeal has been omitted from the published opinion.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-15\"> The State introduced other items seized from defendant's residence that did not tend to link defendant with the Zahos crimes but were relevant to his parole violation. Those items were a ticket from a pawn shop in Virginia indicating receipt of two rings from defendant and a Virginia driver\u2019s license issued to him. Both the license and pawn shop ticket were dated February 26, 2006, a date five days after Zahos was attacked in her home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b235-9\"> Although this issue was raised and argued by defense counsel at the suppression hearing, the judge did not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b237-7\"> There is some authority for the proposition that a suspect may waive <em>Miranda </em>warnings by interrupting their delivery. <em>See State v.
