Grinnell Haulers, Inc., </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>102, 106, 853 A.2d 940 (2004). The Brodskys exited their car and stood on the shoulder. Minutes later, a vehicle driven by William Horsman hit Mr. Brodsky and then the disabled car, which struck Mrs. Brodsky. <em>Id. </em>at 106-07, 853 A.2d 940. Mr. Brodsky died soon after, and Mrs. Brodsky suffered severe permanent injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 107, 853 A.2d 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">The Brodskys filed a personal injury and wrongful death action against Grinnell and Horsman. <em>Ibid. </em>Horsman, who was not insured, filed for bankruptcy, and the bankruptcy court discharged Horsman from any debt arising from the accident. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">Grinnell had a primary insurance policy with plaintiff New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Company (NJM), with a coverage limit of $1 million, and an excess policy with defendant National Casualty Company (NCC), which provided an additional $4 million in coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>In October 1999, the Brodskys made a settlement demand of $5 million against Grinnell, which was lowered to $3.5 million in September 2000. This demand remained firm in the face of offers by Grinnell for $400,000 and $750,000 before the first trial in December 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">At that trial, the only issues were the apportionment of fault between Grinnell and Horsman and the extent of the Brodskys\u2019 damages. <em>Brodsky, supra, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>at 107, 853 A.2d 940. The jury found Grinnell sixty percent negligent and Horsman forty percent negligent, and awarded the Brodskys $1,640,000 in damages, plus prejudgment interest, for a total judgment of $1,945,533.17. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">On appeal, we concluded that the trial court erred in giving an ultimate outcome instruction and therefore reversed and remanded for a new trial on the apportionment of liability. <em>Brodsky v. Grinnell Haulers, Inc., </em>362 <em>N.J.Super. </em>256, 262, 284, 827 A.2d 1104 (App.Div.2003). The Supreme Court affirmed this decision. <em>Brodsky, supra, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>at 128, 853 A.2d 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Before the trial on remand, GrinneU\u2019s counsel informed NCC\u2019s counsel in September 2004 that NJM had authorized payment of its full $1 million policy limit to settle the Brodskys\u2019 claims. However, NCC\u2019s counsel allegedly asked Grinnell\u2019s counsel to withhold this offer from the Brodskys\u2019 counsel in order to convince the Brodskys to settle for less than $1 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Around the same time, the Brodskys lowered their settlement demand to $1.5 million. However, NCC allegedly offered to contribute only $100,000 to meet this demand, insisting that NJM pay the remaining $1.4 million. NJM refused to pay this amount, taking the position that it was not obligated to pay anything above its $1 million policy limit to settle the case. The communications between NCC and NJM regarding the Brodskys\u2019 $1.5 million settlement demand are discussed in greater detail later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">In December 2004, the trial on remand took place, which resulted in the same apportionment of liability as the first trial: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Grinnell was again found sixty percent negligent and Horsman was again found forty percent negligent. Thus, a judgment in the amount of $1,640,000 was entered against Grinnell, plus $580,322.07 of prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">NJM paid its $1 million policy limit and NCC paid the remaining $640,000 of the damages award. The carriers agreed to equally divide responsibility for payment of the $580,322.07 in prejudgment interest on a temporary basis, reserving the right to litigate their obligation for payment of this obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">NJM subsequently brought this action seeking a determination that NCC is obligated to pay the full amount of the prejudgment interest awarded to the Brodskys. NCC filed a counterclaim seeking a determination that NJM is responsible for payment of the prejudgment interest. The trial court decided the case on NJM\u2019s motion for summary judgment, determining that NJM was only responsible for its $1 million policy limit and that NCC was responsible for the entire judgment above this amount, including $580,322.07 in prejudgment interest awarded the Brodskys.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">On appeal, we reversed this summary judgment. <em>N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co. v. Nat\u2019l Cas. Co., </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, 923 A.2d 315 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>481, 932 A.2d 31 (2007). We concluded that a primary carrier such as NJM may be held \u201cliable for the payment of prejudgment interest, even if such payment exceeds its policy\u2019s coverage limit, [if the] trial court ... find[s] ... that the carrier did not engage in good faith negotiations to settle the claim within the policy\u2019s coverage limit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344, 923 A.2d 315. In reaching this conclusion, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">[AJ carrier may be found liable for prejudgment interest under <em>R. </em>4:42-ll(b), even if such payment exceeds the policy\u2019s coverage limit, if the manner it has handled a claim against its insured evidences \u201cmisconduct\u201d or \u201cbad faith.\u201d This duty of good faith is a well-established part of our State\u2019s insurance law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">... The existence of excess coverage does not in any way extinguish or diminish a primary carrier\u2019s fiduciary duty to its insured to take all reasonable steps to settle a case within the scope of the primary coverage, including offering the policy limit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">[Id. at 353-55, 923 <em>A.2d </em>315 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>We also concluded that it could not be determined based on the evidentiary material presented to the trial court on NJM\u2019s motion for summary judgment \u201cwhether NJM violated its fiduciary duty to engage in meaningful, timely, good faith efforts to settle the claims asserted by the party suing its insured within the policy\u2019s coverage limit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344, 923 A.2d 315. Accordingly, we remanded for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">On the remand, NJM undertook to obtain discovery regarding NCC\u2019s own course of conduct in the negotiations for settlement of the Brodskys\u2019 claims, focusing particularly on the period following NJM\u2019s decision to offer its $1 million policy limit to settle the case. NCC resisted such discovery on the ground that only NJM\u2019s conduct was relevant to NJM\u2019s obligation to pay the entire amount of prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">NJM served a subpoena on NCC\u2019s counsel, Allan Maitlin, requesting his deposition and production of his file regarding his representation of NCC during the <em>Brodsky </em>litigation. NJM also sought to depose James Lavigne, NCC\u2019s Senior Litigation Specialist who monitored the <em>Brodsky </em>litigation for NCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">NCC moved to quash the subpoena served on Maitlin and for a protective order barring Lavigne\u2019s deposition. NJM filed a cross-motion for an order compelling NCC to produce a detailed privilege log. NCC also filed a motion to strike NJM\u2019s fourth and fifth affirmative defenses to its counterclaim, which asserted that NCC had denied the coverage it owed to Grinnell and NJM in bad faith and breached its fiduciary duties to Grinnell and NJM.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The trial court denied NCC\u2019s motions to quash Maitlin\u2019s subpoena and for a protective order as to the discovery related to Lavigne and granted NJM\u2019s motion for production of a privilege log. The court also denied NCC\u2019s motion to strike NJM\u2019s fourth and fifth affirmative defenses to its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">NCC filed a motion for leave to appeal these orders, which we denied. NCC then filed a motion for leave to appeal with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Supreme Court, which granted the motion and \u201csummarily remanded to the Appellate Division to consider on the merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The primary issue presented by this appeal is whether NCC\u2019s conduct relating to the negotiations for settlement of the Brodskys\u2019 claims is relevant to NCC\u2019s claim against NJM for the entire amount of prejudgment interest awarded the Brodskys. We did not decide this issue in NCC\u2019s prior appeal because the only issue before us was whether the trial court had properly granted NJM summary judgment denying NCC\u2019s claim without conducting an evidentiary hearing on the question of whether NJM violated its fiduciary duty to engage in meaningful, timely, good faith efforts to settle the Brodskys\u2019 claims. 393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 344, 923 A.2d 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">In determining the relevance of NCC\u2019s conduct relating to the negotiations for settlement of the Brodskys\u2019 claims, we start with <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Insurance Co. of America, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 323 A.2d 495 (1974), which is the seminal case dealing with an insurer\u2019s obligation to engage in good faith negotiations with a party asserting a claim against its insured, in default of which the insurer may become liable for the full amount of a judgment against its insured even though it exceeds the policy\u2019s coverage limit. In <em>Rova Farms, </em>the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">An insurer, having contractually restricted the independent negotiating power of its insured, has a positive fiduciary duty to take the initiative and attempt to negotiate a settlement within the policy coverage. Any doubt as to the existence of an opportunity to settle within the face amount of the coverage or as to the ability and willingness of the insured to pay any excess required for settlement must be resolved in favor of the insured <em>unless the insurer, by some affirmative evidence, demonstrates there was not only no realistic possibility of settlement within policy limits, but also that the insured would, not have contributed to whatever settlement figure above that sum might have been available.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 496, 323 A.2d 495 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">Thus, under <em>Rova Farms, </em>an insurer that fails to negotiate in good faith with a party who asserts a claim against its insured is not automatically liable for any judgment in excess of the policy limit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Instead, the insurer may avoid such liability if it can show that there was no realistic possibility of a settlement within the policy limits and that its insured\u2014or in this case the excess carrier\u2014 would not have contributed whatever amount above the policy limit would have been required to settle the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">In <em>Courvoisier v. Harley Davidson of Trenton, Inc., </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>153, 164, 742 A.2d 542 (1999), the Court reaffirmed the availability of this affirmative defense to an insurer against which a <em>Rova Farms </em>claim is asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">Under <em>Rova Farms, </em>it is the insured\u2019s burden to \u201cestablish bad faith on the part of the insurer\u201d in a separate trial. Once the insured establishes such bad faith,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aug\">a prima facie case of damages for the difference between the policy limit and the excess verdict has also been shown. <em>It is then up to the insurer to demonstrate that settlement could not have been achieved within the policy limit or for the policy limit plus any amount the insured would have been able and witting to contribute.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">[Emphasis added; citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">Therefore, NJM is entitled to conduct appropriate discovery to support this defense to liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">Moreover, even without whatever additional evidence may be revealed by the discovery authorized by the orders that are the subject of this appeal, there is already evidence in the record that could support such a defense. Before the first trial in 2001, the Brodskys\u2019 counsel made a settlement demand of $3.5 million, and advised Grinnell\u2019s counsel that \u201cthis case will never settle for $1 million or less, but will only settle, if ever, well into the excess policy.\u201d A trier of fact could find based on this evidence that \u201cthere was ... no realistic possibility of settlement [of the Brodskys\u2019 claims before the first trial] within [the $1 million NJM] policy limits[.]\u201d <em>Rova Farms, supra, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>at 496, 323 A.2d 495. In addition, although there is no direct evidence whether NCC expressed a willingness to contribute to a settlement before the first trial, the record contains a document entitled \u201c[NCC] Reinsurance Claim Status Report,\u201d dated July 1, 2002, which states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>After further consideration, we have advised the underlying carrier [NJM] that they are not to expect indemnification of the Insured from our policy, unless it will require more than $2,000,000 to settle the claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Thus, this document indicates that NCC was unwilling to contribute to a settlement of the Brodskys\u2019 claim unless NJM first agreed to contribute $2 million. There is no evidence that NCC changed this settlement position prior to September 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">We also note that the July 1, 2002 report refers to a previous report, dated December 21, 2001, which would have been around the time of the first trial. This document is not part of the record before us, but presumably would be discoverable under the orders that are the subject of this appeal and may indicate whether NCC expressed any willingness to contribute to a settlement before or immediately after the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Although our discussion thus far has focused upon the relevance of NCC\u2019s conduct with respect to its claim for prejudgment interest based on NJM\u2019s alleged bad faith in the settlement negotiations preceding the first trial, NCC\u2019s conduct with respect to the settlement negotiations preceding the second trial is also relevant. On September 3, 2004, NJM authorized the payment of its full $1 million policy limit towards the settlement of the Brodskys\u2019 claims, which was confirmed by a letter from Grinnell\u2019s counsel, dated September 9, 2004. However, NCC\u2019s counsel allegedly requested Grinnell\u2019s counsel to withhold disclosure of this authorization from the Brodskys\u2019 counsel in the hope that the case could still be settled for less than NJM\u2019s policy limit. Furthermore, when the Brodskys\u2019 counsel made a settlement demand of $1.5 million, NCC only offered to contribute $100,000 towards such a settlement, taking the position that NJM should contribute the remaining $1.4 million, which was $400,000 above its $1 million policy limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>These allegations, if established at trial, could justify a conclusion that even if NJM acted in bad faith in failing to offer its policy limits to settle the Brodskys\u2019 claims before the first trial, and NJM failed to establish the previously discussed affirmative defense to NCC\u2019s claim, thus subjecting NJM to liability for prejudgment interest for the period after the case could have been settled by an offer of NJM\u2019s policy limits before the first trial, such liability should terminate as of September 2004, when NJM offered its policy limits but NCC refused to contribute more than $100,000 to a settlement. 1 Allan D. Windt, <em>Insurance Claims and Disputes: Representation of Insurance Companies and Insureds </em>\u00a7 5.26 (5th ed. 2007) (stating that \u201c[w]hen a primary insurer ... is willing to contribute its limit of liability to a settlement and makes that fact known to an excess insurer, ... the excess insurer should be subject to the same duty to settle principles as a primary insurer\u201d). Therefore, NCC\u2019s settlement position before the second trial is also relevant, and NJM is entitled to conduct discovery to obtain additional evidence regarding that position.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">NCC argues that the discovery orders from which this interlocutory appeal has been taken violate the attorney-client privilege and the confidentiality of \u201cmediation communications\u201d provided by <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:23C-1 to -13, and <em>Rule </em>l:40-4(c) and (d). These arguments are clearly without merit and do not warrant extended discussion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E). We only note that those orders simply require NCC\u2019s counsel and \u201cSenior Litigation Specialist\u201d to appear for depositions, without ruling upon any specific questions of privilege that may arise during the course of those depositions, and require NCC to produce a more detailed privilege log, without ruling upon whatever privilege claims that log may present.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">For the guidance of the trial court, we also make several additional observations about NCC\u2019s claim against NJM.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>First, we note that the Court in <em>Rova Farms </em>discussed the \u201cvarious difficulties\u201d presented by a claim for prejudgment interest based on an insurer\u2019s breach of its duty of good faith in settlement negotiations. 65 <em>N.J. </em>at 503, 323 A.2d 495. One of those difficulties is establishing the \u201cpoint in time\u201d at which \u201can insurer\u2019s failure to settle [may] be said to [have] oecur[red].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504, 323 A.2d 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The Brodskys were presumably awarded prejudgment interest from May 18,1999, which was \u201cthe date of the institution of [their] action.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:42\u201411(b). However, NCC\u2019s claim that NJM should be liable for prejudgment interest because it failed to engage in good faith negotiations to settle the Brodskys\u2019 claim appears to be based solely on NJM\u2019s failure to offer the full amount of its policy in settlement negotiations in the fall of 2001. Therefore, even if NCC establishes this claim, it is difficult to see how it could support imposition of liability upon NJM for prejudgment interest that accrued before it breached its fiduciary duty to its insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Second, NCC places substantial reliance upon the fact that NJM had use of the $1 million it paid in partial satisfaction of the judgment against Grinnell for the more than five-year period between the filing of the complaint and entry of final judgment after the second trial. However, we see no basis in <em>Rova Farms </em>or its progeny for the imposition of any liability upon a primary insurer beyond its policy limits without a showing of the bad faith and the failure to establish the previously discussed affirmative defense. To the contrary, <em>Kotzian v. Barr, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>360, 366-67, 408 A.2d 131 (1979) indicates that imposition of liability upon a primary insurer for prejudgment interest beyond its policy limit is impermissible in the absence of a showing of bad faith. In any event, to the extent NJM\u2019s use of the $1 million provided under its policy during the entire course of this prolonged litigation may be relevant, it must be noted that NCC also had use during that same period of the $640,000 it ultimately had to pay to satisfy the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>The interlocutory orders from which this appeal was taken are affirmed. The case is remanded to the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-9\"> The basis for this position, explained in the July 1, 2002 status report, was that the claims on behalf of Mrs. Brodsky and the estate of Mr. Brodsky involved \u201ctwo separate accidents, two separate claims and two separate losses.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
