It involves a dispute between defendants\u2014Withum Smith &amp; Brown (WSB), a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>professional group of certified public accountants and consultants\u2014and plaintiffs\u2014Coast Automotive Group, Ltd.; its landlord, Shansab Bealty, Inc.; and Shansab\u2019s president, Tamim Shansab (collectively plaintiffs). By agreement executed on July 12, 2005, plaintiffs retained WSB as an expert in connection with their litigation against Universal Underwriters. Universal was the insurer of property damaged in a fire. The fire occurred on March 11, 2001, at a dealership operated by Coast on premises leased from Shansab.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Based upon a provision of the parties\u2019 retainer agreement, the judge compelled them to arbitrate plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of breach of contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and defendants\u2019 counterclaims, which allege breach of contract by failure to submit payment; fraud in the inducement; and unjust enrichment. Several of plaintiffs\u2019 claims sounding in tort were dismissed for failure to state a claim. <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e).' One claim not referred to the arbitrator survived WSB\u2019s motions to dismiss\u2014 plaintiffs\u2019 claim alleging professional malpractice, which is pending before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Plaintiffs appeal and contend that a claim for consequential damages resulting from WSB\u2019s breach\u2014a claim resting on their allegation that WSB\u2019s breach placed them in a position in which they were compelled to accept an unfavorable settlement with Universal\u2014is not within the scope of the arbitration clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>only significant question raised on this appeal is the propriety of the judge\u2019s construction of the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate. We conclude that the agreement to arbitrate does not encompass plaintiffs\u2019 affirmative claim for consequential damages in its litigation with Universal. Accordingly, we modify the scope of arbitration but otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Our discussion of the procedural history and facts is limited to the matters pertinent to questions presented on this appeal. With respect to arbitration, the retainer agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">If at the conclusion of this matter our fees for services are not fully paid, adequately secured or appropriately provided for, and payment of our fees becomes an issue, you agree to participate in mediation and binding arbitration to resolve any and all fee-related disputes____You further agree to be bound by the final decision of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall be a mutually agreed-upon attorney, CPA or retired judge in the [Sjtate of New Jersey and all matters pertaining to this agreement will be administered in the [S\u00edtate of New Jersey under laws of New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">The agreement addressed the services to be provided, retainers, hourly billing rates, expenses and periodic payments. WSB agreed to bill on a monthly basis and to \u201ckeep detailed records of time and expenses.\u201d WSB also agreed to make those records available for plaintiffs\u2019 inspection upon request and reasonable notice. Plaintiffs agreed to review the bills and raise any questions in a \u201ctimely fashion.\u201d Plaintiffs also acknowledged that WSB would rely on their acceptance of the bill as \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d and of plaintiffs\u2019 obligation to pay if they did not object within twenty days of receipt of the bill. Bills were to be paid within thirty days of receipt, and WSB reserved the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>terminate or discontinue services if they were not paid pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The parties also provided that all outstanding \u201cfees\u201d were to be paid in full prior to WSB\u2019s preparation for testifying at depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">A dispute arose about fees when WSB submitted its first bill for payment. These factual allegations were included in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint: the first bill included a total, \u201cwith no breakdown of hours\u201d; WSB refused to provide documentation describing each hour billed; WSB failed to keep hourly billing records; the invoices WSB provided for its services were fraudulent in that they included double billings and billings for work that was not necessary or was not done; WSB wrongly accused plaintiffs of being in breach of their retainer agreement; WSB wrongly demanded payment in an attempt to extract payment of a compromise amount, which WSB then wrongfully declined to accept; and WSB\u2019s conduct \u201cplaced [p]laintiffs\u2019 litigation [with] their insurance carrier in great jeopardy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">In August 2006, about one month after plaintiffs commenced this litigation against WSB, WSB sought an order compelling arbitration pursuant to the retainer agreement and an order declaring that WSB was not required to continue serving as plaintiffs\u2019 expert in plaintiffs\u2019 litigation with Universal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiffs opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The hearing on WSB\u2019s motion was conducted on September 22, 2006. At that hearing, plaintiffs disclosed for the first time that their litigation with Universal had been settled. Although the record provided on this appeal does not indicate when that settlement was reached, the parties acknowledged that the question of continued service by WSB was moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">The trial judge considered the allegations in the complaint. On that basis, the judge determined that the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate applied to the fee dispute and that \u201cany breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>contract or any breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing\u2014is part and parcel of the fee dispute.\u201d He further concluded that the arbitration agreement did not cover the torts alleged. By order dated October 26, 2006, the judge compelled arbitration in accordance with his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">On October 27, 2006, WSB filed its answer and counterclaim. On March 2, 2007, the judge considered whether the arbitrator should address plaintiffs\u2019 claim resting on an allegation that WSB\u2019s breach of contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing placed plaintiffs in a position in which they were compelled to accept an unfavorable settlement with Universal and award consequential damages upon proof of that claim. In a written decision of March 9, 2007, the judge concluded that this claim raised by plaintiffs is one for \u201cdamages flowing from the breach of the contract\u201d that is \u201cto be resolved through mediation [sic].\u201d The judge also determined that the claims asserted by WSB were related to the fee dispute and subject to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">On July 6, 2007, plaintiffs amended their complaint to include a claim for damages incurred as a consequence of WSB\u2019s professional malpractice. That count also seeks consequential damages including damages based upon plaintiffs\u2019 settlement with Universal.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">We conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 affirmative claims seeking consequential damages for breach of contract, as opposed to plaintiffs\u2019 claims of breach urged as a defense to WSB\u2019s claim for payment due, are beyond the scope of the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate. Our decision is informed by a transcript of the arbitrator\u2019s preliminary decision on the scope of his authority. That transcript is before us on our grant of plaintiffs\u2019 unopposed motion to supplement the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">This agreement to arbitrate, reached on July 12, 2005, is governed by the Uniform Arbitration Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23B-1 to - 32. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23B-3(c); <em>Wein v. Morris, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>364, 375, 944 A.2d 642 (2008). Absent \u201ca ground that exists at law or in equity for the revocation of a contract,\u201d it is enforceable. <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>2A:23B-6(a). Plaintiffs\u2019 brief includes a point contending that in light of the nature of WSB\u2019s alleged wrongful conduct, the judge erred by directing arbitration. Plaintiffs do not, however, present any argument suggesting that there is a basis at law or in equity to revoke the arbitration clause in the retainer agreement. Accordingly, the question presented is the scope of the arbitration clause, not WSB\u2019s right to enforce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The interpretation of an arbitration clause is a matter of contractual construction that this court should address de novo. <em>Hutnick v. ARI Mut. Ins. Co., </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>524, 528, 918 A.2d 729 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>70, 926 A.2d 855 (2007); <em>Fastenberg v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>415, 420, 707 A.2d 209 (App.Div.1998); <em>Young v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., Inc., </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>605, 622, 688 A.2d 1069 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>408, 694 A.2d 193 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Public policy favors arbitration. <em>See Barcon Assocs. v. Tri-County Asphalt Corp., </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>179, 186, 430 A.2d 214 (1981). Accordingly, arbitration clauses should be construed \u201cliberally to find arbitrability if reasonably possible.\u201d <em>J. Baranello &amp; Sons, Inc. v. City of Paterson, </em>168 <em>N.J.Super. </em>502, 507, 403 A.2d 919 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>340, 407 A.2d 1214 (1979) (internal quotations omitted); <em>see Marchak v. Claridge Commons, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>275, 282, 633 A.2d 531 (1993); <em>Young, supra, </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 617, 688 A.2d 1069. Nonetheless, \u201ca court may not rewrite a contract to broaden the scope of arbitration[.]\u201d <em>Fawzy v. Fawzy, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>456, 469, 973 A.2d 347 (2009) (quoting <em>Garfinkel v. Morristown Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Assocs., P.A., </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>124, 132, 773 A.2d 665 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">In construing an arbitration clause, courts must honor the intentions of the parties as set forth in the language. <em>Quigley v. KPMG Peat Marwick, LLP, </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>252, 270, 749 A.2d 405 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>527, 760 A.2d 781 (2000). The scope of arbitration is dependent on the parties\u2019 agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 270-71, 749 A.2d 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Here, the parties agreed \u201cto participate in mediation and binding arbitration to resolve any and all fee-related disputes.\u201d The ordinary meaning of the language the parties employed encompasses any dispute related to fees earned, billed and owed under the terms of the agreement as well as all defenses to payment based on WSB\u2019s breach of its contractual duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The significance of a distinction between an affirmative claim for damages allegedly attributable to improper performance by one retained to render professional services and a claim of improper performance raised by the client as \u201can affirmative defense to an action by a professional for the recovery of fees\u201d has been recognized in other contexts. <em>See, e.g., Charles </em>A <em>Manganaro Consulting Eng\u2019rs, Inc. v. Carneys Point Twp. Sewerage Auth., </em>344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>343, 347, 781 A.2d 1116 (App.Div.2001). In <em>Manganaro, </em>that distinction led the court to hold that a client who is a defendant in an action by a professional to collect fees for services must comply with the affidavit of merit statute in order to assert a counterclaim for damages \u201cbased on \u2018an alleged act of malpractice or negligence\u2019 \u201d but not to \u201cassert[ ], as an affirmative defense to an action by a professional for the recovery of fees, that the plaintiff should be denied any relief because the professional services were not properly performed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347, 781 A.2d 1116.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">In <em>Saffer v. Willoughby, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>256, 670 A.2d 527 (1996), the Supreme Court addressed the distinction in the context of arbitration of a dispute about an attorney\u2019s fee in accordance with <em>Rule </em>1:20A-2(a). The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">[A] Fee Committee lacks jurisdiction to decide legal malpractice claims. But the filing of a malpractice claim does not, however, deprive the Fee Committee of jurisdiction to decide the fee dispute. In the course of deciding the reasonableness of a fee, a Fee Committee may consider evidence of malpractice for the limited purpose of affecting \u201cthe quality of services rendered in assessing the reasonableness of the fee pursuant to <em>RPC </em>1.5.\u201d <em>R. </em>1:20A-2(c)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 266, 670 A.2d 527.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">The arbitration clause in this agreement warrants a similar construction and procedure. The parties agreed to \u201cbinding arbitration to resolve any and all fee-related disputes.\u201d Claims of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>breach relevant to a reduction of the fee sought are within the scope of their agreement. Affirmative claims for consequential damages incurred as a consequence of the quality of performance or the lack of good faith and fair dealing during the course of performance, like claims of malpractice, are separate from and unrelated to the fee dispute. Those claims are not within the scope of the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">We stress that this appeal does not require us to decide whether any breach alleged by plaintiffs would provide a total defense to payment. As we understand the arbitrator\u2019s decision, he has construed the judge\u2019s orders and the parties\u2019 agreement in a manner substantially consistent with our interpretation of the agreement which is to permit his consideration of the parties\u2019 respective claims of breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing only as relevant to the fee dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">To the extent that the judge\u2019s decision of March 9, 2007 suggests that the arbitrator may adjudicate the question of consequential damages unrelated to the fee dispute and asserted as an affirmative claim for damages attributable to breach, it is modified to preclude the arbitrator from considering that claim. Plaintiffs\u2019 affirmative claim for consequential damages, flowing from its settlement with Universal and allegedly attributable to WSB\u2019s breach of its obligations, is not within the scope of the agreement to arbitrate and is closely related to and should be heard with plaintiffs\u2019 malpractice claim, which is currently pending before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">We have considered plaintiffs\u2019 objections to the order appointing the arbitrator and WSB\u2019s objection to the timeliness of this appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have concluded that the arguments presented lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Affirmed as modified and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\"> The judge dismissed plaintiffs' claims for damages based upon fraud, tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, estoppel, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the Consumer Fraud Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to -184. Their claim for declaratory relief was also dismissed as were their claims against the individual defendants, who are persons who provided services to plaintiffs on behalf of WSB.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b393-9\"> We denied WSB's motion for leave to appeal on August 23, 2007, and a motion for leave to appeal was filed by plaintiffs on September 7, 2007.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-10\">This appeal is before this court on Notice of Appeal filed on September 15, 2008. In April 2008, the Supreme Court exercised its \"rulemaking authority [to] amend <em>Rule </em>2:2-3(a) to add an order of the court compelling arbitration to the list of orders that shall be deemed final judgments for appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>purposes.\u201d <em>Wein v.
