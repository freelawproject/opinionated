We have considered the arguments raised in light of the record and applicable legal standards. We affirm the denial of plaintiffs motion to amend his complaint; we reverse the dismissal of the complaint with prejudice, and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">On the evening of January 31 and into the early morning hours of February 1, 2006, plaintiff and his friend, Konstadinos Peppas, were at Houlihan\u2019s Restaurant in Paramus. The manager of the restaurant summoned the police, claiming the men were both \u201cheavily intoxicated[ ] and acting up.\u201d When police arrived, they confronted the two men. A struggle ensued and plaintiff was ultimately arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">On August 29, 2006, the Bergen County grand jury indicted plaintiff and Peppas for two counts of fourth-degree aggravated assault on a police officer, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-l(b)(5)(a), and one count of third-degree resisting arrest, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2(a)(3)(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The victims of the assaults were alleged to be Paramus police officers, Douglas Ehrenberg, in one count, and Craig McEllen in the other. The indictment also named Paramus police officers \u201cR. Gleason,\u201d \u201cC. Tsentas,\u201d and \u201cMichael Cebulski\u201d as those whose arrest plaintiff resisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>During preliminary proceedings in the criminal case, plaintiff sought access to the personnel files of the five officers, indicating that he intended to assert \u201cas a defense to the charges[,] ... both self-defense and resistance to excessive force----\u201d On January 2, 2007, plaintiff appeared in Superior Court, and, pursuant to a plea bargain reached with the State, was prepared to plead guilty to the disorderly persons offense of resisting arrest as amended, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29\u20142(a)(1); the other charges were to be dismissed. Plaintiff intended to apply to the Pre-Trial Intervention Program (PTI), however, and defense counsel, the prosecutor, and the judge noted that PTI was unavailable if plaintiff pled guilty to a disorderly persons offenses. <em>See </em>Pretrial Intervention Programs, Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment on <em>R. </em>3:28, Guideline 2 at 1063 (2010) (\u201cAny defendant <em>accused of crime </em>shall be eligible for admission into a PTI program.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>see also State v. Motley, </em>369 <em>N.J.Super. </em>314, 320, 848 A.2d 875 (App.Div.2004) (\u201cPTI is a diversionary program designed to \u2018augment the options of prosecutors in disposing of <em>criminal matters </em>____\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>State v. Brooks, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>215, 223, 814 A.2d 1051 (2002) (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">As a result, defendant entered a guilty plea to fourth-degree resisting arrest as amended. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2(a)(2) (\u201c[A] person is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree if he, by flight, purposely prevents or attempts to prevent a law enforcement officer from effecting an arrest\u201d). In response to questioning by his attorney, plaintiff admitted that he had \u201cattempted to prevent [his] lawful arrest by officers that had entered th[e] restaurant.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge explained that if plaintiff was \u201cthrown out of PTI,\u201d he would be placed on probation pursuant to the plea bargain. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Defendant entered the PTI program, a one-year \u201corder of postponement\u201d of the criminal charges was filed, plaintiff successfully completed PTI, and the indictment was dismissed on February 29, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">On March 26, 2007, plaintiff filed his complaint against defendants Borough of Paramus, Police Department of the Borough of Paramus, police officers Ehrenberg, McEllen, Cebulski, Robert Gleason, and Chris Tsentas (collectively, defendants). In the first count, plaintiff claimed defendants had committed an \u201cassault and battery[,]\u201d further alleging that the \u201cattack ... continued while [he] was handcuffed and in police custody.\u201d In count two, plaintiff alleged defendants \u201caet[ed] under color of law\u201d in violation of 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983. He sought damages and counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Discovery ensued. On July 31, 2008, prior to the discovery end date, Cebulski moved for summary judgment claiming that he had not been present at the scene of plaintiffs arrest. The motion was supported by a document, the Paramus Police Department\u2019s \u201cInitial General Complaint Report.\u201d Cebulski also referenced the deposition testimony of Tsentas and McEllen wherein they claimed Cebulski was not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">On August 19, plaintiff filed opposition and cross-moved to amend the complaint. In opposition to Cebulski\u2019s motion, plaintiff cited McEUen\u2019s grand jury testimony in which he had identified Cebulski as being present. He also cited the deposition testimony of Peppas and Houlihan\u2019s manager, both of whom indicated that at least five officers responded to the restaurant. He claimed this evidence raised a factual dispute regarding Cebulski\u2019s involvement; thus, summary judgment should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">In support of his motion to amend, plaintiff claimed the Initial General Complaint Report \u201cwas never previously identified during the discovery period.\u201d In that report, police officer Robert Von Sehalscha was named as having been present at Houlihan\u2019s on the night of plaintiffs arrest; plaintiffs motion sought to add Von Sehalscha as a defendant. Defendants opposed the motion to amend, arguing that plaintiff could have discovered Von Sehals<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>eha\u2019s name through the exercise of \u201cdue diligence,\u201d and, since the statute of limitations had now expired, the proposed amendment was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">On September 10, 2008, before these motions were heard, Ehrenberg moved to dismiss plaintiffs complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See R. </em>4:6-2(e). In essence, Ehrenberg argued that plaintiffs complaint was legally barred in light of his entry into PTI. Plaintiff opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">On October 10, 2008, after hearing oral argument from all parties on the pending motions, the judge denied plaintiffs motion for leave to amend the complaint, concluding that plaintiff had not utilized the fictitious party rule, <em>Rule </em>4:26-4, had produced \u201cno evidence of diligent inquiry,\u201d and the statute of limitations had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The judge granted Ehrenberg\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, citing <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 <em>U.S. </em>477, 486-87, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>2364, 2372, 129 L.Ed.2d 383, 394 (1994), and other cases, the principles of which he summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aiv\">[I]f ... plaintiff has taken steps that are not compatible with [his] demand for remedies under the Constitution, 42 <em>[U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 ] 1983, and are not compatible with the common-law, then the plaintiff is either estopped or barred from pursuing those remedies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">The idea behind it is that if there is an impugnment [sic] ... or the creation of something that would suggest conflicting resolutions of the underlying transaction, the Court will not allow it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">The judge reasoned that plaintiffs \u201centry into PTI\u201d and his \u201csubmission to the unfavorable circumstances of PTI\u201d barred his civil claims against defendants as a matter of law. He further determined that plaintiffs factual allegations were all contained within a \u201cbundle of facts ... wrapped up in and around the same sequence of events from start to finish at Houlihan\u2019s.\u201d He concluded, \u201cit would be inconsistent for the judiciary to permit these civil claims [based upon those facts] to proceed\u201d after plaintiffs completion of PTI.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">Although he did not specifically rule on Cebulski\u2019s motion for summary judgment and no order was entered, the judge noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>that he \u201cwould have denied\u201d the motion because there were genuine issues of disputed material fact as to whether CebulsM was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Plaintiffs motion for reconsideration was denied by order dated November 21, 2008. After plaintiff filed his notice of appeal, the judge entered a consent order clarifying his earlier order, and noting that the order dismissing plaintiffs complaint had \u201cresulted in a complete disposition of all claims as to all parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Plaintiff argues that the judge \u201cmisapplied case law and wrongfully dismissed\u201d his claims. He further contends that the judge should have permitted the amendment of his complaint because he was unaware of Von Schalscha\u2019s alleged involvement, he exercised due diligence throughout the discovery period, and no undue prejudice or delay would result from the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Defendants argue that the complaint was properly dismissed. They contend that all of plaintiffs claims were legally barred not only by his guilty plea to resisting arrest, but also by his entry into PTI. They further argue that since the statute of limitations had expired as to both plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 and common law claims, the judge properly denied his motion to amend the complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">The issue presented is one of first impression in this State. Specifically, we are asked to consider whether plaintiffs civil complaint for damages under the common law and \u00a7 1983 is barred <em>as a matter of law </em>because of his guilty plea to resisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>arrest, and the subsequent dismissal of that charge as well as the two counts of aggravated assault, as a result of his entry into PTI.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">In <em>Heck, supra, </em>the Supreme Court decided \u201cwhether a state prisoner may challenge the constitutionality of his conviction in a suit for damages under 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1983.\u201d 512 <em>U.S. </em>at 478, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2368, 129 L.Ed.2d at 389. The plaintiff, who had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter in state court, alleged that the defendant state officials violated \u00a7 1983 by \u201cengaging] in an \u2018unlawful, unreasonable, and arbitrary investigation\u2019 leading to [his] arrest; \u2018knowingly destroyed\u2019 evidence \u2018which was exculpatory in nature and could have proved [his] innocence\u2019; and caused \u2018an illegal and unlawful voice identification procedure\u2019 to be used at [his] trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2368, 129 L.Ed.2d at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The Court likened the plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claims to \u201c[t]he common-law cause of action for malicious prosecution----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2371, 129 L.Ed.2d at 392. \u201cOne element that must be alleged and proved in a malicious prosecution action is termination of the prior criminal proceeding in favor of the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2371, 129 L.Ed.2d at 393 (citations omitted). The Court then held that if convicted of the underlying crime,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD_A\">a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 2254. A claim for damages bearing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that has <em>not </em>been so invalidated is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 486-87, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2372, 129 L.Ed.2d at 394.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">In the Third Circuit, the holding in <em>Heck </em>has been expanded so as to bar \u00a7 1983 claims even when the underlying criminal charges have not resulted in conviction. In <em>Gilles v. Davis, </em>427 <em>F.</em>3d 197, 201 (3d Cir.2005), the court considered \u201cwhether resolution of a criminal charge under Pennsylvania\u2019s \u2018Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition\u2019 [ARD] program bars a subsequent \u00a7 1983 claim.\u201d There, the plaintiff, \u201cPetit[,] was charged with resisting arrest, disorderly conduct, and failure of disorderly persons to disperse,\u201d for his role in videotaping a provocative evangelical message his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>cohort, Gil\u00edes, delivered to a crowd on the campus of Indiana University in Pennsylvania. <em>Id. </em>at 201-02. \u201cPetit entered into the [ARD] program, which permitted] expungement of the criminal record upon successful completion of a probationary term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202. Petit sought relief under \u00a7 1983, declaring that university officials had violated his First Amendment rights, as well as punitive damages, and the return of his confiscated videotape. <em>Id. </em>at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The court noted that under the rules governing Pennsylvania\u2019s ARD program,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">acceptance into [the] ARD program is not intended to constitute a conviction, but it may be statutorily construed as a conviction for purposes of computing sentences on subsequent convictions. By entering the ARD program, the defendant waives his right to prove his innocence, but at the same time, does not admit guilt. <em>[Gilles, supra, </em>427 <em>F.</em>3d at 209 (quotations and citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The court reasoned that \u201cPetit efould] not maintain a \u00a7 1983 claim unless successful completion of the ARD program constituted a termination of the prior criminal proceeding in favor of the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210 (quotation and citation omitted). The court then examined a number of district court decisions from Pennsylvania that held entry into ARD precluded subsequent federal civil rights claims, and the decisions of two circuit courts that held the alternative disposition programs in other states similarly precluded federal civil rights claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Gilles, supra, </em>427 F.3d at 210-11. The court concluded that \u201cthe ARD program [wa]s not a favorable termination under <em>Heck. </em>Petit\u2019s participation in the ARD program bar[red] his \u00a7 1983 claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211-12 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">There exists, however, a split among the circuit courts regarding application of the <em>Heck </em>bar to situations where the underlying criminal charges did not result in any conviction. In <em>Taylor v. Gregg, </em>36 F.3d 453, 455-57 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc), <em>overruled on other grounds, Castellano v. Fragozo, </em>352 F.3d 939, 949 (5th Cir.2003), the Fifth Circuit held that the plaintiffs\u2019 false arrest and malicious prosecution claims were legally barred in light of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>participation in a federal pre-trial diversion program. <em>See also DeLeon v. City of Corpus Christi, </em>488 F.3d 649, 656 (5th Cir.2007) (concluding a plea of guilty, followed by a pending \u201cdeferred adjudication\u201d that would ultimately lead to dismissal of the criminal charges, was nevertheless \u201ca conviction for the purposes of <em>Heck\u2019s </em>favorable termination rule.\u201d). In <em>Roesch v. Otarola, </em>980 F.2d 850, 852 (2d Cir.1992), a case decided before <em>Heck </em>and cited by the <em>Gil\u00edes </em>court, the Second Circuit held that \u201ca [\u00a7 ] 1983 claim sounding in malicious prosecution, false arrest, or unjust imprisonment ... [was legally barred by] a disposition pursuant to Connecticut\u2019s accelerated pretrial rehabilitation statute____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">However, in <em>McClish v. Nugent, </em>483 F.3d 1231, 1251 (11th Cir.2007), considering whether the plaintiffs excessive force complaint was barred after his successful completion of Florida\u2019s PTI program and dismissal of the criminal charges, the court concluded <em>\u201cHeck </em>[wa]s inapposite.\u201d The court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">The issue is not, as the district court saw it, whether [the plaintiffj\u2019s participation in PTI amounted to a favorable termination on the merits. Instead, the question is an antecedent one\u2014whether <em>Heck </em>applies at all since [the plaintiff] was never convicted of <em>any </em>crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">\n<em>[Ibm</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Although not binding upon us, we find the Third Circuit\u2019s interpretation of <em>Heck </em>to be persuasive. <em>See Young v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>605, 622, 688 A.2d 1069 (App.Div.1997) (\u201c[I]nterpretation of federal law by federal courts may be persuasive in a given case, and \u2018should be accorded due respect\u2019; nevertheless, such rulings, other than by the United States Supreme Court, are not binding upon a state appellate court.\u201d) (quoting <em>Dewey v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>69, 79-80, 577 A.2d 1239 (1990)), <em>certif. denied, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>408, 694 A.2d 193 (1999); <em>see also Glukowsky v. Equity One, Inc., </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>49, 64, 848 A.2d 747 (2004) (\u201c[T]he principle of comity instructs state courts to give due regard to a federal court\u2019s interpretation of a federal statute.\u201d) (citing <em>Dewey, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 80, 577 A.2d 1239), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 <em>U.S. </em>1049, 125 <em>S.Ct. </em>864, 160 L.Ed.2d 770 (2005). Our federal district court has held that dismissal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>criminal charges through PTI is not a favorable disposition for purposes of a malicious prosecution suit brought under \u00a7 1983. <em>Lindes v. Sutter, </em>621 <em>F.Supp. </em>1197, 1201-02 (D.N.J.1985). We have reached the same conclusion regarding similar state claims. <em>See Rubin v. Nowak, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>80, 83, 590 A.2d 249 (App.Div.1991) (citing <em>Lindes, supra, </em>621 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1201; <em>Thomas v. N.J. Inst. of Tech., </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>60, 62, 427 A.2d 1142 (Law Div.1981)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor is completion of PTI a favorable result entitling a . plaintiff to reimbursement of counsel fees pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:16-6.1.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Cressinger v.

These restrictions are very similar to the \u201cjudicially imposed limitations on freedom\u201d discussed by the <em>Gil\u00edes </em>court in evaluating Pennsylvania\u2019s ARD program. <em>Gilles, supra, </em>427 <em>F.3d </em>at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Although the federal courts have not considered in a published opinion the precise symmetry between PTI and ARD for purposes of analyzing \u00a7 1983 claims, at least one unpublished opinion from New Jersey\u2019s District Court has concluded that the two programs are without significant difference. In <em>Hendrix v. City of Trenton, </em>2009 <em>WL </em>5205996, at *1, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120718, at *2 (D.N.J. Dec. 29, 2009), the court considered \u201cwhether <em>Heck ... </em>applie[d] to bar [plaintiffs claims when [p]laintiff had resolved his criminal charges by participating in [PTI].\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Finding \u201c[t]he similarities between the ARD and the PTI [to be] striking[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at *4, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120718, at *14, the court concluded that the \u201c[plaintiff\u2019s attempt to distinguish the ARD and PTI programs [must] fail[ ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *4, 2009 U.S. Dist.

This is so because under the facts alleged, regardless of how the criminal charges were terminated, the claims in plaintiffs civil action may \u201cnot be inconsistent with a holding that the officers, during a lawful arrest, used excessive (or unlawful) force in response to [a plaintiffs] own unlawful actions.\u201d <em>Lora-Pena v.

But if the district court determines that the plaintiff\u2019s action, even if successful, will <em>not </em>demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment against the plaintiff, the action should be allowed to proceed, in the absence of some other bar to the suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\"><em>[Heck, supra, </em>512 <em>U.S. </em>at 487, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2372-73, 129 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 394.

We quote the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>presented there as set forth in the opinion because they mirror those presented by plaintiff in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">According to [the plaintififs complaint, he disobeyed Lthe officerj\u2019s orders to halt and instead ran away. [The officer] pursued and caught [the plaintiff], and a struggle ensued. [The plaintiff] claims that he then sat down and that when he later got up from the chair, [the officer] beat him with a flashlight and used excessive and malicious force to subdue him. [The plaintiff] asserts that he sustained physical and psychological injuries as a result of [the officerj\u2019s actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS0\"><em>[Id. </em>at 144.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The plaintiff was ultimately convicted of resisting arrest, and \u201cthat ... conviction [wa]s unimpaired.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">After analyzing state criminal law regarding the charge of resisting arrest, <em>id. </em>at 145, the court concluded that \u201ca finding that [the officer] used excessive \u2018substantial force\u2019 would not imply that the arrest was unlawful and thus the Supreme Court\u2019s example of how <em>Heck ... </em>can bar a civil action is not applicable here.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">Rather, we believe that the Supreme Court intended to demonstrate that a civil suit for an unreasonable seizure predicated on a false arrest would be barred so long as a conviction for resisting the same arrest remained unimpaired. But this ease is different because [the plaintiff] does not charge that [the officer] falsely arrested him. Instead, [the plaintiff] charges that [the officer] effectuated a lawful arrest in an unlawful manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 145-46.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">Thus, a plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claim for excessive force is only barred under the rationale in <em>Heck </em>if a potential verdict in the civil cause \u201cwould be inconsistent with [the plaintiffs] conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">The Third Circuit and the federal District Court of New Jersey have consistently followed <em>Nelson\u2019s </em>limitation upon the broad application of the <em>Heck </em>defense to \u00a7 1983 claims of the use of excessive force in an arrest. In <em>Lora-Pena, supra, </em>529 <em>F.3d </em>at 506, the court reversed the dismissal of the plaintiffs complaint, concluding that his \u201cconvictions for resisting arrest and assaulting federal officers [did not] bar[] his civil suit at the <em>Rule </em>12(b)(6) stage.\u201d In <em>Ference v.

Baker, </em>435 F.3d 689, 692 (7th Cir.2006) (holding that a successful \u00a7 1983 suit for excessive force would not imply the invalidity of the underlying conviction for resisting a law enforcement officer); <em>Smith v. City of Hemet, </em>394 F.3d 689, 698 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc) (holding that <em>Heck </em>does not bar \u00a7 1983 suit because conviction for resisting arrest could stand based on pre-arrest acts of resistance, and thus the fact that arrest may have been unlawful due to excessive force did not negate the underlying conviction); <em>Sanford v. Motts, </em>258 F.3d 1117,1119 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that <em>Heck </em>does not bar \u00a7 1983 suit because record did not clearly establish whether excessive force took place during, or after, the arrest); <em>Martinez v. City of Albuquerque, </em>184 F.3d 1123, 1125 (10th Cir.1999) (holding that <em>Heck </em>does not bar \u00a7 1983 suit because the record did not rule out that plaintiff could have been convicted for offenses prior to arrest, and that, even if he were not, jury could find under New Mexico law that \u201cpolice officers effectuated a lawful arrest ... in an unlawful manner,\u201d thus not negating underlying conviction)____<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>We distill from these cases that if plaintiffs proofs regarding the alleged \u00a7 1983 violation do not seek to invalidate any element of the underlying criminal conviction, the complaint is not barred as a matter of law by <em>Heck. </em>The same result should apply where, as here, the underlying criminal charges were dismissed via successful completion of PTI.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The Second Circuit has applied this rationale in a case decided after <em>Roesch </em>and <em>Heck. </em>In <em>Johnson v. Bax, </em>63 <em>F.</em>3d 154, 156 (2nd Cir.1995), the court reversed summary judgment dismissing the plaintiffs claims under \u00a7 1983 for First Amendment violations, despite his admittance into New York\u2019s diversionary \u201c \u2018adjournment in contemplation of dismissal\u2019 \u201d program on the underlying criminal charges. Without mention of <em>Heck, </em>the court distinguished its earlier decisions, including <em>Roesch, </em>finding that they \u201cha[d] no application to [the plaintiffs] cause of action, ... [because] the favorable termination of a criminal proceeding [wa]s not an essential element of an independent First Amendment claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">We find the rationale expressed in <em>Hendrix, </em>which focuses on the relationship between the elements of the \u00a7 1983 claim and the underlying criminal violation, to be persuasive in this regard, particularly because the facts of that case are quite similar to those presented here. In <em>Hendrix, supra, </em>the plaintiff was indicted for aggravated assault upon a police officer, and resisting arrest; the indictment was dismissed after the plaintiff successfully completed PTI. 2009 <em>WL </em>5205996, at *2, 2009 U.S. Dist.

That presumptively established that plaintiff knew defendants were law enforcement officers, that they were effectuating his arrest, that he purposely prevented, or attempted to prevent, his arrest, and, fearing his arrest, fled. <em>See State v. Simms, </em>369 <em>N.J.Super. </em>466, 470-72, 849 A.2d 573 (App.Div.2004) (defining elements of the crime); <em>see also Model Jury Charge (Criminal), </em>\u201cResisting Arrest\u2014Flight Alleged\u201d (2007). However, \u201ca person may resist excessive force used by the arresting officer, even if the arrest is otherwise legal.\u201d Cannel, <em>New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, </em>comment 10 on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4 (2009) (citing <em>State v. Mulvihill, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>151, 156-57, 270 A.2d 277 (1970)); <em>see also Simms, supra, </em>369 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 472, 849 A.2d 573 (\u201c[A]n officer effecting an arrest may use only such force as is reasonable under the circumstances____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">By pleading guilty, however, plaintiff forfeited any claim that defendants used excessive force in effecting his arrest. <em>See ibid. </em>(\u201c[I]f the officer uses excessive or unnecessary force \u2018the citizen may respond or counter with the use of reasonable force to protect himself____\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Mulvihill, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>at 156, 270 A.2d 277); <em>see also Model Jury Charge (Criminal), </em>\u201cJustification\u2014Self Defense Resisting Arrest\u201d (1988) (making the defense available only if the officer used unlawful force to effectuate the arrest). Thus, to the extent plaintiffs claims involved defendants\u2019 use of force in effectuating his arrest, as opposed to after he was in custody, they are barred because a favorable outcome in the civil action would be inconsistent with the admissions he made by pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Although plaintiff never made any admissions regarding the aggravated assault charges, which were ultimately dismissed via <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>PTI, the same reasoning must apply. While an actor has a right under our Criminal Code to use force to defend himself, the use of force is justified only if he \u201creasonably believes that such force is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting himself against the use of <em>unlawful </em>force----\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:3-4(a) (emphasis added); <em>Simms, supra, </em>369 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 472, 849 A.2d 573. When he pled guilty to resisting arrest, plaintiff was acknowledging that defendants did not use unlawful force during the actual arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">While the motion judge found that plaintiff\u2019s claims arose from a \u201cbundle of facts ... wrapped up in and around the same sequence of events from start to finish at Houlihan\u2019s[,]\u201d we cannot discern how he reached that conclusion.

Rather defendants argued that the complaint failed to state a claim in light of what transpired during the criminal prosecution. In considering the motion, the judge was obligated, therefore, to consider only \u201cwhether a cause of action [wa]s \u2018suggested\u2019 by the facts.\u201d <em>Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>739, 746, 563 A.2d 31 (1989) (quoting <em>Velantzas v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>189, 192, 536 A.2d 237 (1988)). That \u201cinquiry is limited to examining the legal sufficiency of the facts alleged on the face of the complaint.\u201d <em>Printing Mart, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 746, 563 A.2d 31 (citing <em>Rieder v.

In other words, to the extent plaintiff claimed defendants used unlawful force by continuing to attack him after he was in custody, his \u201caction, ... if successful, w[ould] <em>not </em>demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment against\u201d him. <em>Heck, supra, </em>512 <em>U.S. </em>at 487, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2372, 129 L.Ed.2d at 394. As a result, his \u201caction should [have] be[en] allowed to proceed____\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(footnote omitted).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The same reasoning applies to plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claim. For such purposes, a claim of \u201cexcessive force in the course of an arrest is properly analyzed under the Fourth Amendment....\u201d <em>Abraham v. Raso, </em>183 <em>F.</em>3d 279, 288 (3d Cir.1999) (citing <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 <em>U.S. </em>386, 393-94, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1865, 1870-71, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989)). As the Court has explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">Our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has long recognized that the right to make an arrest ... necessarily carries with it the right to use some degree of physical coercion or threat thereof to effect it. Because [t]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application, however, its proper application requires careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case, including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\"><em>[Graham, supra, </em>490 <em>U.S. </em>at 396, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1871-72, 104 L.Ed.2d at 455 (quotations and citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Thus, in considering whether plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claim was insufficient as a matter of law, the motion judge was obligated to credit his allegation that defendants continued to attack him after he was in custody. Whether that alleged conduct was reasonable under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d is a question that could not be resolved on a motion brought pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e). <em>Accord Nelson, supra, </em>109 F.3d at 145-46; <em>Ference, supra, </em>538 F.Supp.2d at 804-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In conclusion, since plaintiffs complaint was dismissed by the motion judge as a matter of law based upon <em>Heck </em>and <em>Gilles, </em>we reverse the order and remand the matter to the trial court. We hasten to add that we express no opinion about the ultimate merits of plaintiffs claims. We only hold that as defendants\u2019 motion sought relief under <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e), dismissal was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Finally, we affirm the judge\u2019s denial of plaintiffs motion to amend his complaint. Consideration of such a motion \u201crests in the ... sound discretion\u201d of the motion judge. <em>Notte v. Merchs. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>490, 501, 888 A.2d 464 (2006) (quotation and citation omitted). \u201cTh[e] exercise of [such] discretion requires a two-step [analysis]: whether the non-moving party w[ould] be prejudiced[;] and whether the amendment would ... be futile\u201d\u2014 that is, whether the claim as amended would nevertheless fail, thus making amendment a useless endeavor. <em>Ibid. </em>In this case, the judge did not mistakenly exercise his discretion by denying the motion because the amendment seeking to add Von Schaiseha was time-barred by the statute of limitations. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-2; <em>Cowell v. Palmer Twp., </em>263 F.3d 286, 291 (3d Cir.2001) (noting \u00a7 1983 actions in New Jersey are governed by a two-year statute of limitations).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Plaintiff admittedly never utilized the fictitious party rule, <em>Rule </em>4:26-4. <em>\u201cThe purpose ofthfat] rule is to render timely </em>the complaint filed by a diligent plaintiff, who is aware of a cause of action against an identified defendant but does not know the defendant\u2019s name.\u201d <em>Greczyn v. Colgate-Palmolive, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>5,11, 869 A.2d 866 (2005) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). A plaintiff cannot use the rule to add a belated claim of liability against a defendant not named in a timely fashion. As Judge Pressler explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\">[The <em>Rule </em>] does not apply if the plaintiff has properly designated some defendants by fictitious names and then later discovers a cause of action against undescribed defendants whom he then seeks to join.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">[Pressler, <em>supra, </em>comment t on <em>R. </em>4:26-4 (citing <em>Gallagher v.

However, plaintiff admits that he did not seek the records of the police department until May, 2008, after the statute of limitations expired. Plaintiff never explains why he did not seek the court\u2019s assistance to depose defendants if their avoidance was deliberate or repetitive. There is nothing in the record that suggests defendants induced or tricked plaintiff. In short, we find no basis to reverse the judge\u2019s decision to deny plaintiffs request to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Affirmed in part; reversed in part; remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Since the issue has not been raised, we specifically decline to decide whether it was proper to condition defendant\u2019s admittance into PTI upon a requirement that he first pled guilty to a crime.

Defendants' appellate brief makes it clear that they did not, and do not intend, to waive this defense, which, as we note below, necessarily requires detailed factual findings.

The limited transcript of plaintiff\u2019s deposition that is part of the appellate record does not elucidate the exact circumstances giving rise to plaintiff\u2019s claim that defendants continued to attack him after he was in their custody. In his brief, he alleges that he was \"maced\u201d after he was handcuffed, and that defendants \"took him outside to the parking lot and continued to beat, knee and kick him all the way to the patrol car.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b325-10\"> We decline to consider defendants' argument that plaintiff's common law claims are barred by N.J.S.A. 59:5-2(b)(3) (immunizing public entities and employees from claims \"for any injury caused by [] a person resisting arrest or evading arrest\"). Although raised in defendants' brief on appeal, the issue was only first raised in their reply brief to plaintiff's opposition to the motion to dismiss. It was not considered by the judge below. In any event, we believe whether the immunity applies is dependent on the particular facts presented.
