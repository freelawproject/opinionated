The full text of EO 7 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>WHEREAS, it is the clear and express intent of this Administration that all individuals who are elected to or otherwise hold public office shall adhere to the highest ethical standards; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">WHEREAS, prior actions of the New Jersey Legislature and existing Executive Orders have imposed stringent requirements on those individuals who hold public positions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">WHEREAS, since 2004, there have been a series of legislative and executive actions which have imposed restrictions on the campaign contributions of those who contract with the State of New Jersey and other public entities, so as to avoid actual conflicts of interest or even the appearance of conflicts of interest in the public contracting process; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">WHEREAS, even though these \u201cpay-to-play\u201d restrictions have had a positive impact on the public contracting process, they have not extended their reach to all \u201cbusiness entities\u201d which contract with the State of New Jersey and other public entities; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">WHEREAS, even though contributions in excess of the amount identified in legislation, Executive Orders, and regulations are restricted to many forms of political and campaign committees, these restrictions have not extended then- reach to all such committees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">NOW, THEREFORE, I, CHRIS CHRISTIE, Governor of the State of New Jersey, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and by the Statutes of this State do hereby ORDER, and DIRECT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">1. Prior Executive Orders implementing \u201cpay-to-play\u201d restrictions are hereby modified to include within the definition of the term \u201cBusiness Entity\u201d any Labor Union or Labor Organization which enters into contracts with the State of New Jersey and its instrumentalities or with other New Jersey public entities. The reference in this Executive Order to \u201clabor unions\u201d and \u201clabor organizations\u201d shall include any political committee formed by any such labor union or labor organization, one of the purposes of which political committee is to make political contributions.

Prior Executive Orders implementing \u201cpay-to-play\u201d restrictions are hereby modified to include Legislative Leadership Committees within the list of committees and depositories as to which the contribution restrictions are applicable. All Department and Agency heads are directed to revise current regulations to be consistent with this change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-12\">3. This Order shall take effect immediately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-13\">[ 42 <em>N.J.R. </em>580(b).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">Appellants, six labor unions that are the duly-elected representatives of more than 300,000 public employees, have brought this consolidated emergent appeal, alleging that EO 7 is unconstitutional in numerous respects. In particular, appellants contend that EO 7 conflicts with the terms of existing legislation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>thereby infringes upon principles of separation of powers, in violation of article III, paragraph 1, of the New Jersey Constitution. Appellants further argue that EO 7 transgresses their rights of free speech, political association, and equal protection under the Federal and State Constitutions. They seek immediate injunctive relief so that they can exercise their rights of political participation without fear of some form of debarment or disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The Governor maintains that EO 7 represents the lawful exercise of his constitutional powers. He asserts that EO 7 simply extends the provisions of pay-to-play executive orders that were issued by his two immediate predecessors in office, and that EO 7 serves legitimate public purposes that can be harmonized with existing statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Because we conclude, for the reasons explained in this opinion, that paragraph 1 of EO 7 violates principles of separation of powers, we invalidate it to the extent that it is written or intended to be construed to cover labor unions and collective bargaining<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> agreements. We do so without prejudice to the potential adoption of an appropriate statute that might enact pay-to-play reforms covering labor organizations, but in a manner consistent with existing statutes or which explicitly amends those existing laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">EO 7 follows a series of statutes and gubernatorial executive orders generated over the past six years, which have been focused upon restricting the actual or perceived impact of political campaign contributions upon governmental procurement decisions. As we noted in <em>In re Earle Asphalt Co., </em>401 <em>N.J.Super. </em>310, 321, 950 A.2d 918 (App.Div.2008), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>143, 966 A.2d 460 (2009), there is a \u201cstrong governmental interest in limiting political contributions by businesses that contract with the State[.]\u201d That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>strong governmental interest has been recognized by both the Legislative and Executive Branches of our State Government. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>19:44A-20.13; 36 <em>N.J.R. </em>4562(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">As <em>N.J.S.A </em>19:44A-20.13 declares, \u201c[w]hen a person or business interest makes or solicits major contributions to obtain a contract awarded by a government agency or independent authority, this constitutes a violation of the public\u2019s trust in government and raises legitimate public concerns about whether the contract has been awarded on the basis of merit[.]\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cIt is essential that the public have confidence that the selection of State contractors is based on merit and not on political contributions made by such contractors!)]\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Likewise, \u201cit is essential that the public have trust in the processes by which taxpayer dollars are spent[.]\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The concept of pay-to-play has been described as \u201cthe political practice of rewarding campaign contributors with no-bid government contracts.\u201d Paula A. Franzese &amp; Daniel J. O\u2019Hern, Sr., <em>Restoring the Public Trust: An Agenda For Ethics Reform of State Government and a Proposed Model for New Jersey, </em>57 <em>Rutgers L.Rev. </em>1175, 1222 (2005). The evil arises when prospective vendors \u201cpay\u201d contributions to candidates for public office, or to their affiliated political organizations, in order to \u201cplay\u201d for (i.e., be awarded or favorably considered in the award of) government contracts when those candidates take or retain public office.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Even though various ethics laws, procurement laws, and criminal laws already forbid the making of political contributions as a <em>quid pro quo </em>for receiving a government contract, a frequent problem in establishing the violation of those laws is \u201cproving the connection between the contributions and the contract.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Consequently, pay-to-play provisions (perhaps more accurately described as \u201c&lt;mii-pay-to-play\u201d provisions) typically \u201cprohibit the participation in the public contracting field of campaign contributors whose donations exceed certain minimum levels.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">To address these concerns over pay-to-play practices, a succession of statutes and executive orders were promulgated in our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>State between 2004 and 2008, preceding the issuance of EO 7 in January 2010.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because EO 7, by its own terms, is couched as an effort to build upon those prior enactments, and because the historical context bears upon our analysis of the issues before us, we discuss those prior enactments in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The first set of pay-to-play restrictions were enacted by the Legislature on June 10, 2004, and signed into law by former Governor McGreevey less than a week later on June 16, 2004. <em>See L. </em>2004, c. 19. That statute, now commonly referred to as \u201cChapter 19,\u201d was entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Certain Campaign Contributions By Certain Business Entities and County Political Party Committees[.]\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also Assemb. B. </em>2, 211th Leg. Sess. (2004) (utilizing that title); <em>S.B. </em>2, 211th Leg. Sess. (2004) (same). The statute expressly indicated that it was <em>\u201csupplementing </em>[L.] 1973, c. 83 <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-1 to -26], and <em>amending </em>[L.] 1973, c. 83 <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-1 to -26].\u201d <em>L. </em>2004, c. 19 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The New Jersey Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Reporting Act, <em>L. </em>1973, c. 83 (\u201cChapter 83\u201d), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-1 to -26, which Chapter 19 literally \u201csupplemented\u201d and \u201camended,\u201d covers a wide scope of matters dealing with political campaign contributions, expenditures, and reporting. Chapter 83 includes several requirements that place ceilings<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> upon political contribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>tions that can be lawfully made by various enumerated categories of donors.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The donors that are subject to Chapter 83\u2019s contribution limits specifically include, among other categories, a \u201clabor organization of any kind which exists or is constituted for the purpose, in whole or in part, of collective bargaining, or of dealing with employers concerning the grievances, terms or conditions of employment, or of other mutual aid or protection in connection with employment!;.]\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A </em>19:44A-11.3(a) (containing this reference to labor organizations); <em>N.J.S.A </em>19:44A-11.4(a), (b), &amp; (c) (same). When the Legislature amended Chapter 83 in 2002 to impose further restrictions upon donations to certain political committees, it repeated the same explicit language encompassing labor organizations. <em>See L. </em>2001, c. 384, \u00a7 3; <em>N.J.S.A </em>19:44A-11.5(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">As initially enacted, Chapter 19 injected pay-to-play restrictions into the statutory scheme by limiting the political donations payable by prospective government contractors. The law, in its original form, disallowed a \u201cbusiness entity,\u201d a term specifically defined within the new statute, <em>see NJ.S.A </em>19:44A-20.7, to obtain no-bid government contracts with an anticipated value above $17,500 from any state, county, or municipal agency, in eircum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>stances where the business entity had made a political contribution above a defined monetary threshold to an elected official or to a political party at the state, county, or municipal level. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.3 to -20.12.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a sign that the Legislature recognized the impact these new restrictions would cause when they were superimposed upon existing statutes, it explicitly stated, in several places, that Chapter 19\u2019s provisions were being enacted \u201c[n]otwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary.\u201d <em>See L. </em>2004, c. 19, \u00a7\u00a7 1-4; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.3 to -20.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Chapter 19 originally included an exemption for contracts awarded pursuant to a \u201cfair and open process.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.3. This exemption pertained to contracts that were publicly advertised; provided for public solicitations; awarded according to set written criteria; and publicly announced when awarded. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.7 (defining a \u201cfair and open process\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">As defined in Chapter 19, a \u201cbusiness entity\u201d subject to its restrictions is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">any natural or legal person, business corporation, professional services corporation, limited liability company, partnership, limited partnership, business trust, association or any other legal commercial entity organized under the laws of this State or of any other state or foreign jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.7.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">The detailed legislative statement accompanying Chapter 19, as recited in both the Assembly version of the bill and the Senate version, commented that the purpose of the new law was to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-11\">reduce the risk of actual or perceived corruption which may result when public contracts are awarded to business entities that have contributed to elected officials having control, or apparent control, over the awarding of those contracts, or to political party committees at various levels of government that may have influence over the officials responsible for awarding such contracts, a practice commonly referred to as \u201cpay-to-play.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-12\"><em>[Assemb. B. 2, </em>211th Leg. Sess. (2004) (Sponsor\u2019s Statement); <em>S.B. </em>2, 211th Leg. Sess. (2004) (Sponsor\u2019s Statement).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-VZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The effective date of Chapter 19 designated by the Legislature was to be eighteen months in the future, January 1, 2006. <em>L. </em>2004, c. 19, \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Three months after the enactment of Chapter 19, Governor MeGreevey signed Executive Order 134 (\u201cEO 134\u201d), on September 22,2004. <em>See </em>36 <em>N.J.R. </em>4562(b) (Oct. 18, 2004). EO 134 generally attempted to strengthen certain aspects of Chapter 19 as it related to State contracts, and to accelerate the implementation of pay-to-play restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">In particular, EO 134 sought to extend the reach of pay-to-play restrictions by covering all contracts above $17,500 in value entered into by .the State or by \u201cany of its purchasing agents or agencies or those of its independent authorities,\u201d implicitly including State contracts subject to a \u201cfair and open process\u201d that were otherwise exempted from Chapter 19. <em>Id. </em>at 4563, \u00b6\u00b61-2. EO 134 was confined to State procurement, and did not cover procurement by county or municipal governments. The executive order utilized the identical definition of a \u201cbusiness entity\u201d contained in Chapter 19. <em>Id. </em>at 4563, \u00b6 4. Like Chapter 19, EO 134 made no reference to labor unions, labor organizations, or collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The preamble of EO 134 reaffirmed the State\u2019s compelling interest in protecting the integrity of government by refraining from awarding contracts to business entities because they are contributors to political candidates and holders of public office. <em>Id. </em>at 4562-63. Focusing upon the State\u2019s important role in procurement decisions, the preamble to EO 134 underscored that <em>\u201cin the procurement process, </em>our public policy grants to the State <em>broad discretion, </em>taking into consideration all factors, to <em>award a contract to a bidder whose proposal </em>will be most advantageous to the State[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4563 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>As a further indication of its procurement focus, EO 134 contains numerous references to public bidding terminology, directing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">Every <em>contract and bid application and specifications </em>promulgated in connection therewith covered by this Order shall contain a provision describing the requirements of this Order and a statement that compliance with this Order shall be <em>a material term and condition of said contract and/or bid application </em>and binding upon the parties thereto upon the entry of all applicable contracts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 4564, \u00b6 11 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">In that same procurement-oriented vein, EO 134 instructed that \u201c[p]rior to <em>awarding </em>any contract or agreement <em>to procure services or any material, supplies or equipment </em>from, or for the acquisition, sale, or lease of <em>any land or building </em>from or to, any business entity,\u201d that State purchasing agencies require, \u201cas part of <em>the procurement process,\" </em>each such business entity to report all political contributions it made during the preceding four years to specified political organizations. <em>Id. </em>at 4563, \u00b6 5 (emphasis added). <em>See also id. </em>at 4563, \u00b6 6 (likewise referring to contracts or agreements \u201cto procure services, or any material, supplies or equipment[,]\u201d or pertaining to the sale or lease of land or buildings).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Paragraph 13 of EO 134 stated that it \u201cshall take effect October 15, 2004, and is intended to have prospective effect only.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4564,1113. This effective date, less than a month after EO 134\u2019s issuance, was substantially sooner than the effective date of January 1, 2006 chosen by the Legislature for activating the pay-to-play restrictions of Chapter 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">EO 134 further sought to regulate contracts made with the Executive Branch when a contribution was made to a county, as opposed to a statewide, political committee. <em>Id. </em>at 4563,11111 &amp; 2. It also expanded the time period in which a covered business entity was barred from contributing to a Governor, a candidate for Governor, a State political party committee or a county political committee, to eighteen months before the commencement of nego<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>tiations for a contract. <em>Compare L. </em>2004, <em>c. </em>19, \u00a7\u00a7 1-2 <em>with </em>36 <em>N.J.R. </em>4563, \u00b6 1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">On October 15, 2004, the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services (\u201cOLS\u201d) issued an opinion that EO 134 was constitutionally invalid. The OLS opinion concluded that EO 134 usurped legislative powers in several respects, in particular by changing the effective date of Chapter 19, by including contracts that were subject to a \u201cfair and open process\u201d within the pay-to-play restrictions, and by expanding the types of political committees that were covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Following the OLS opinion casting doubt upon EO 134\u2019s constitutional validity,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Assembly Bill A-1500 and Senate Bill S-2052 were introduced in October and November 2004. These companion bills, both expressly \u201cmodeled on\u201d EO 134, were ultimately enacted as <em>L. </em>2005, c. 51 (\u201cChapter 51\u201d), and signed into law by Acting Governor Codey on March 22, 2005. Chapter 51 is mainly codified at <em>N.J.S.A </em>19:44A-20.13 to -20.25, appearing right after most of the provisions earlier adopted in Chapter 19, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.3 to -20.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Like both Chapter 19 and EO 134 which preceded it, Chapter 51 seeks to thwart pay-to-play activities that can improperly influence government procurement decisions. <em>See also Earle Asphalt, supra, </em>401 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 321-23, 950 A.2d 918. The preamble to Chapter 51 expressing the Legislature\u2019s, findings and declarations of policy, <em>N.J.SA </em>19:44A-20.13, is derived substantially\u2014at times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>verbatim\u2014from the preamble to EO 134.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statutory preamble replicates EO 134\u2019s multiple references to \u201cprocurement\u201d and to procurement-related concepts such as \u201cthe selection of State contractors,\u201d and the \u201caward\u201d of a contract to a \u201cbidder.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.13. Neither the text nor the preamble of Chapter 51 makes any references to labor unions, labor organizations, or collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Chapter 51 amended and supplemented several aspects of Chapter 19 with respect to contracts awarded within the Executive Branch of State government. In particular, Chapter 51 repealed and superseded Chapter 19\u2019s provisions applicable to contracts awarded by State agencies within the Executive Branch. <em>See L. </em>2005, c. 51, \u00a7 16 (repealing <em>N.J.S.A </em>19:44A-20.2) &amp; \u00a7\u00a7 14-15 (eliminating references to the Executive Branch from <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.7 and -20.8). Chapter 51 left undisturbed Chapter 19\u2019s pay-to-play restrictions for vendor contracts with a State agency within the Legislative Branch, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.3, contracts with county governments, <em>N.J.S.A </em>19:44A-20.4, and municipal contracts, <em>N.J.S.A </em>19:44A-20.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Substantively, Chapter 51 eliminated Chapter 19\u2019s exemption for State contracts with Executive Branch agencies entered into pursuant to a \u201cfair and open process,\u201d as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>19-.44A-20.7.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Chapter 51 instead places within its scope State contracts that \u201cprocure from any business entity services or any material, supplies or equipment, or [which are entered into] to acquire, sell, or lease any land or building.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.14. In situations of public exigency, the statute does provide an exemption for contracts requiring the immediate delivery of goods or the performance of services. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Furthermore, Chapter 51 expanded the pertinent definition of \u201cbusiness entity\u201d by adding: all principals who own or control more than 10% of the profits, assets, or stock of a business entity; any subsidiaries of the business entity; any political organizations controlled by the business entity; and, if the business entity is a natural person, that person\u2019s spouse or child residing with him or her. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Largely tracking the structure and text of EO 134, the operative provisions of Chapter 51 repeatedly invoke the nomenclature of procurement and of public bidding. For instance, one section refers to \u201cpurchasing agents or agencies,\u201d and contracts \u201cto procure\u201d services, material, supplies, or equipment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.14. Another requires, \u201cas part of the procurement process,\u201d the reporting of political contributions \u201c[p]rior to awarding any contract or agreement to procure services or any material, supplies or equipment[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.18. A third section requires \u201c[e]very contract and bid application and specifications promulgated in connection therewith\u201d to contain a provision describing Chapter 51\u2019s pay-to-play requirements, stating that compliance with the statute \u201cshall be a material term and condition of said contract or bid application and binding upon the parties thereto[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.24. And, as part of the statute\u2019s remedial measures, Chapter 51 declares it \u201ca breach of the terms of the government contract\u201d for a business entity to make or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>solicit a contribution in violation of the statute. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Again exhibiting the interplay between the newly-codified pay-to-play laws and other pre-existing laws and statutes, the Legislature ultimately included a proviso in Chapter 51, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.25, making its terms inapplicable where they would violate federal laws or regulations, or where they would prevent the State from complying with the provisions of the Eminent Domain Act of 1971, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-1 to -50. This proviso resulted from a conditional veto message of Acting Governor Codey, who had expressed concerns that Chapter 51, absent such a proviso, might jeopardize the State\u2019s receipt of federal transportation funds.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Veto Message of Acting Governor Richard J. Codey with Regard to Assembly Bill No. 1500 </em>(Mar. 7, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">With respect to timing, the Legislature endeavored within Chapter 51, at least in part, to accommodate EO 134\u2019s goal of accelerating the implementation of the pay-to-play restrictions. Specifically, all of the new provisions of Chapter 51 were declared retroactively effective as of October 15, 2004, the same effective date prescribed by EO 134. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>19:44A-20.13 to -20.25. The provisions of Chapter 19 amended by Chapter 51 retained their later (and prospective) effective date of January 1, 2006. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.7 &amp; -20.8. Chapter 51 also declared that \u201cExecutive Order No. 134 (2004) is hereby superseded.\u201d <em>L. </em>2005, c. 51, \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">The next revision to the pay-to-play laws occurred on January 5, 2006. On that date, <em>L. </em>2005, c. 271 (\u201cChapter 271\u201d), became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>effective. Chapter 271 provided that, notwithstanding the terms of Chapter 19, local governments could limit the award of public contracts in certain situations when a contractor bidding on or seeking that award had made a political contribution. <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A:11-51. Without this amendatory statute, Chapter 19 arguably would have preempted local governmental units from adopting their own pay-to-play restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Chapter 271 also inserted additional requirements into the pay-to-play statutes. <em>L. </em>2005, c. 271, \u00a7\u00a7 2-3. These additions required bids on public contracts to include a list of reportable political contributions. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19-.44A-20.26. They also required business entities making political contributions of $50,000 or more in a year to file an annual disclosure statement with the State Election Law Enforcement Commission (\u201cELEC\u201d). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.27.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Subsequently, on January 13, 2008, the Legislature enacted <em>L. </em>2007, c. 304 (\u201cChapter 304\u201d), amending both <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.26 and -20.27. Chapter 304 was enacted to clarify <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.26 and -20.27, so as to confine the definition of a business entity, for purposes of disclosure and reporting requirements of those sections, to a \u201cfor-profit entity.\u201d <em>L. </em>2007, <em>c. </em>304. Consequently, Chapter 304 exempts nonprofit organizations from the reporting and disclosure requirements of the pay-to-play statutes. <em>Ibid.; see also S.B. </em>3025, 212th Leg. Sess. (2007) (Sponsor\u2019s Statement) (noting the purpose of the amendatory bill \u201cto clarify\u201d that the reporting and disclosure obligations of Chapter 51 apply only to \u201cfor-profit business entities\u201d and \u201cdo not apply to nonprofit entities\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">G.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">On September 24, 2008, Governor Corzine signed both Executive Order 117 (\u201cEO 117\u201d), 40 <em>N.J.R. </em>6251(a), and Executive Order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>118 (\u201cEO 118\u201d), 40 <em>N.J.R. </em>6252(a). These two orders further addressed pay-to-play issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Echoing the \u201cfor-profit\u201d definitional qualifier that the Legislature had inserted through Chapter 304, EO 117 instructed Executive Branch agencies, in their enforcement of the pay-to-play laws, to construe the term \u201cbusiness entity\u201d as being confined to \u201cfor-profit\u201d enterprises. 40 <em>N.J.R. </em>6251, \u00b6 2. EO 117 further advised that a business entity encompasses, among other things, sole proprietorships and proprietors, as well as \u201cany other form of entity organized under the laws of this State or any other state or foreign jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6251, \u00b6 1(a). The order also extended the restrictions on political donations by spouses of contractors to their civil union partners. <em>Id. </em>at 6251,\u00b6 1(a)(iv). Addressing the recent creation of the constitutional post of Lieutenant Governor, EO 117 stated that the pay-to-play laws respecting other Executive Branch departments and offices would similarly apply to contributions to the political campaign of a candidate for Lieutenant Governor. <em>Id. </em>at 6251, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">EO 118, meanwhile, extended the reach of the pay-to-play laws to contracts between a \u201cState redevelopment entity\u201d and \u201ca redeveloper.\u201d 40 <em>N.J.R. </em>6252-53. As noted in EO 118, such contracts consist of agreements between developers and those members of the Executive Branch, or groups designated by the Executive Branch, \u201cto implement a redevelopment project and carry out a redevelopment plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6252, \u00b61(c). In restricting political donations in that redevelopment context, EO 118 repeated the definition of a \u201cbusiness entity\u201d set forth in EO 117. <em>Id. </em>at 6252, \u00b6 1(a). It classifies a \u201credeveloper\u201d as \u201cany business entity that enters into or proposes to enter into a redevelopment agreement,\u201d including \u201ca subsidiary business entity directly or indirectly controlled by the redeveloper,\u201d and business entities retained by a redeveloper \u201cto perform professional, consulting, or lobbying services in connection with the redevelopment project.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6252, \u00b6 1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Deploying, once again, procurement-related phraseology, EO 118 directed State redevelopment entities to \u201cuse a competitive process, to include public issuance of a request for proposal, a request for qualifications, or similar solicitation, for selecting a redeveloper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6252, \u00b6 2. It further mandated that \u201c[e]very request for qualifications, request for proposals, or any similar solicitation issued by a State redevelopment entity ... shall contain ... a statement that compliance with this Order shall be a material term and condition of any redevelopment agreement with the State redevelopment entity and binding upon the parties[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6253, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">As of this date, the Legislature has not enacted statutory provisions codifying the terms of EO 117 or EO 118. We are unaware of any litigation challenging the constitutional validity of those prior executive orders. Nor are we aware of any legal opinions requested from, or issued by, OLS opining on their validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">EO 7, the executive order of Governor Christie under review in the instant appeals, seeks to extend pay-to-play restrictions to labor unions and labor organizations. It attempts to do so by redefining the term \u201cbusiness entity\u201d in this context to encompass \u201cany Labor Union or Labor Organization which enters into contracts with the State of New Jersey and its instrumentalities or with other New Jersey public entities.\u201d 42 <em>N.J.R. </em>580(b), It 1. According to EO 7, \u201c[p]rior Executive Orders implementing \u2018pay-to-play1 restrictions are hereby modified\u201d to include such labor organizations. <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, EO 7\u2019s reference to labor unions and labor organizations \u201cshall include any political committee formed by any such labor union or labor organization, one of the purposes of which political committee is to make political contributions.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The order further recites in its second paragraph that \u201c[p]rior Executive Orders implementing \u2018pay-to-play\u2019 restrictions are hereby modified\u201d to include certain legislative leadership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>committees.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 580, \u00b6 2. The second paragraph does not refer to labor unions or labor organizations. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In its preamble, EO 7 cross-references\u2014and attempts to build upon\u2014\u201cprior actions of the New Jersey Legislature and existing Executive Orders!.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580. It observes that \u201csince 2004, there have been a series of legislative and executive actions which have imposed restrictions on the campaign contributions of <em>those who contract with the State of New Jersey </em>and other public entities, so as to avoid actual conflicts of interest or even the appearance of conflicts of interest <em>in the public contracting process </em>[.]\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). The order acknowledges that those restrictions \u201chave had a positive impact\u201d upon what it again describes as \u201cthe public contracting process!.]\u201d Even so, EO 7 finds that such restrictions \u201chave not extended their reach to all \u2018business entities\u2019 which contract -with the State of New Jersey and other public entities!.]\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Based upon these stated premises, EO 7 directs the Executive Branch to extend the State\u2019s pay-to-play restrictions to labor organizations and labor unions. In his brief, counsel for the Governor* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> explains that the objective of the executive order is to place on \u201cthe same footing\u201d both labor unions and private enterprises, both of which can exert significant influence through campaign donations upon public officials elected into office.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">With regard to implementation, EO 7 directs all \u201cDepartment and Agency heads\u201d to \u201crevise current regulations to be consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>with this change.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2. By its terms, the order took effect immediately, on January 20, 2010. <em>Id. </em>at 580, \u00b6 3. As of the time of oral argument, no implementing regulations had been enacted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">On February 11, 2010, the New Jersey Education Association (\u201cNJEA\u201d) requested that ELEC determine whether EO 7 applies to negotiated agreements with public employers. The NJEA is a nonprofit labor organization that represents over 200,000 professional and support staff employees of public schools in New Jersey. ELEC responded that the question should be referred to the Treasury Department. The Treasury Department did not respond to the NJEA\u2019s interpretative request prior to the filing of the present appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Five days later, on February 16, 2010, OLS issued an opinion, concluding that EO 7 is unconstitutional because it impermissibly intrudes upon legislative powers.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The present litigation challenging the constitutionality of EO 7 promptly ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">On February 24, 2010, Communications Workers of America, AFL-CIO (\u201cCWA\u201d), New Jersey Public Employees, Council 1 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO (\u201cAFSCME Council 1\u201d), the International Federation of Professional and Technical Employees, AFL-CIO, Local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>195 (\u201cLocal 195\u201d), and the American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO-New Jersey (\u201cAFT\u201d) (collectively \u201cappellants\u201d) jointly filed a notice of appeal, an emergent application for a stay and a motion to accelerate the appeal. A few days later, NJEA and the New Jersey State Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Association (\u201cPBA\u201d) filed separate appeals, which we consolidated with the existing appeal. The appeals were properly filed with this court as a challenge to a final administrative decision or order, pursuant to <em>Rule </em>2:2\u20143(a)(2). <em>See also Bullet Hole, Inc. v. Dunbar, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>562, 571-72, 763 A.2d 295 (App.Div.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">CWA represents 40,000 state employees organized into thirty-seven \u201clocals,\u201d each of which has a legislative political action committee. CWA locals negotiate collective bargaining agreements with several counties and local government entities. They also endorse political candidates in certain public elections. The umbrella organization, CWA, represents its members in various collective agreements with the State. It, too, contributes to political campaigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">AFSCME Council 1, together with affiliated AFSCME councils 52, 71 and 73 and their locals (collectively, the \u201cAFSCME councils\u201d), represent approximately 10,000 state employees, as well as the employees of municipal and county agencies. The political action committee of the AFSCME councils makes contributions to the campaigns of legislators and other public officials who are perceived to support or favor the union members\u2019 interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Local 195 represents 7,000 state employees in operations, maintenance, services, and craft positions. Local 195 has a political action committee, which endorses candidates for office and which makes political contributions on behalf of its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">AFT represents over 40,000 employees in public and private schools, libraries, and public universities. Each of AFT\u2019s three main constituent parts\u2014Health Professionals and Allied Employees, the New Jersey State Federation of Teachers, and the Council of New Jersey State College Locals\u2014is involved in political activities and makes contributions to political campaigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>The PBA represents over 38,000 employees holding law enforcement positions with state, county, and municipal agencies.

They maintain that our present New Jersey statutes, particularly those addressing the election of labor representatives and matters of collective bargaining, cannot be rationally harmonized with EO 7. They also contend that the intrinsic nature of a labor union is manifestly in conflict with the statutory definitions of a \u201cbusiness entity\u201d specified by the Legislature in Chapter 19 and Chapter 51. Appellants further point to their constitutional rights to engage in collective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>negotiations pursuant to article I, paragraph 19 of the State Constitution. Additionally, appellants contend that EO 7 violates the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as well as the freedom of speech and association provisions of the New Jersey Constitution, <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. I, \u00b6\u00b6 6 &amp; 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In his defense of EO 7, the Governor maintains that it is a valid exercise of his authority over State contracts and State employees, in his capacity as the chief of the Executive Branch. He contends that EO 7 simply builds upon the precepts of EO 134, EO 117, and EO 118 to root out favoritism in public contracts, and that his order does not intrude upon legislative prerogatives any more than did the executive orders of his predecessors in office addressing pay-to-play issues. The Governor requests that, consistent with past tradition, this court accord substantial deference to the Executive Branch\u2019s constitutional role, and argues that EO 7 is thereby entitled to a presumption of validity. The Governor further submits that EO 7 is consonant with the First Amendment and with freedoms of political expression and association. Lastly, he maintains that the executive order does not violate any of the other constitutional provisions invoked by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">We <em>begin </em>our analysis of the separation-of-powers issues with a recognition of the formidable executive authority vested in the Governor of New Jersey under the 1947 Constitution. In large measure, the 1947 Constitution strengthened the much more limited powers of the Governor that previously existed under the State Constitutions of 1776 and 1844. <em>Kenny v. Byrne, </em>144 <em>N.J.Super. </em>243, 250-51, 365 A.2d 211 (App.Div.1976), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>458, 383 A.2d 428 (1978) (noting that the framers of the 1947 Constitution intended to create a \u201cstrong executive\u201d); <em>see also Bullet Hole, supra, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 573, 763 A.2d 295.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>other things, the Governor has the power to: appoint cabinet members and State justices and judges, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, <em>N.J.

V, \u00a7 1, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The key textual source for the Governor\u2019s constitutional authority over the Executive Branch of State Government appears in article V, section 1, paragraph 11:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">The Governor shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. To this end he shall have power, by appropriate action or proceeding in the courts brought in the name of the State, to enforce compliance with any constitutional or legislative mandate, or to restrain violation of any constitutional or legislative power or duty, by any officer, department or agency of the State; but this power shall not be construed to authorize any action or proceeding against the Legislature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\"><em>[N.J.

The Legislature\u2019s plenary law-making authority is reposed, by article IV, section 1, paragraph 1 of the State Constitution, in the State Senate and General Assembly. It includes, <em>inter alia, </em>the power to introduce legislation and to present bills upon their passage to the Governor, <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. IV, \u00a7 4 and art.

In particular, article III, paragraph 1, the constitutional provision at the heart of the labor unions\u2019 core argument, instructs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">The powers of the government shall be divided among three distinct branches, the legislative, executive, and judicial. <em>No person or persons belonging to or constituting one branch shall exercise any of the powers properly belonging to either of the others except as expressly provided, in this Constitution.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\"><em>[N.J.

Although each branch within State government is delegated certain powers, these powers are not designed to be completely distinct and separate from each other.

Vesta Co., </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>301, 326, 212 A.2d 345 (1965), our courts have consistently recognized \u201cthat the doctrine requires not an absolute division of power but a cooperative accommodation among the three branches of government.\u201d <em>Commc\u2019ns Workers of Am. v. Florio, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>439, 449, 617 A.2d 223 (1992).

Naturally, it is inevitable that \u201csome osmosis occurs when the branches touch one another; the powers of one branch sometimes take on the hue and characteristics of the powers of the others.\u201d <em>Knight v.

Or a branch may deliberately and definitively choose to share some of its power with another branch. <em>See, e.g., In re Advisory Comm. on Prof'l Ethics Opinion 705, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>46, 58, 926 A.2d 839 (2007) (deferring to the Legislature regarding certain provisions of the New Jersey Conflicts of Interest Law).

In such scenarios of unilateral aggrandizement, our courts have applied more stringent review. For example, in <em>Communications Workers of America, supra, </em>while striking down the Legislature\u2019s adoption of a statute that would have dictated to the Executive Branch certain layoff procedures and intra-branch resource allocations, the Supreme Court instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">Where cooperation between the branches is necessary <em>to farther the underlying substantive purposes of the legislative enactment, </em>and where the cooperation offers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>no substantial potential for interference with the exclusive functions of the other branch, </em>the mechanism for legislative involvement will not violate the separation-of-powers principle. <em>But where shared authority is not necessary to effectuate the statutory scheme, or where the legislative intrusion threatens to interfere with exclusive functions of another branch, </em>then the intrusion will violate the separation-of-powers principle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 460, 617 A.2d 223 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">These core principles, safeguarding the \u201cessential integrity\u201d and \u201cexclusive functions\u201d of each branch of government, have been applied to cases such as this one, implicating the legitimacy of a Governor\u2019s executive order. To be sure, in several of the limited instances where they have been challenged, the executive orders have been sustained as a valid exercise of the Governor\u2019s authority. <em>See, e.g., Worthington v. Fauver, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>183, 440 A.2d 1128 (1982); <em>Kenny, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 243, 365 A.2d 211. That is particularly true in situations where, unlike the present case, the executive order flows out of the Governor\u2019s legislatively-delegated emergency powers to act on behalf of the safety and welfare of the people of New Jersey under the Disaster Control Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>App. A:9-30 to -63.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Worthington, supra, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>at 183, 440 A.2d 1128 (regarding a crisis caused by the overcrowding of inmates within the State prisons). However, the Governor\u2019s invocation of such emergency authority is not boundless. <em>See id. </em>at 203-04, 440 A.2d 1128 (noting that the executive order would be invalid if it invokes the same emergency each year indefinitely).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">In the absence of an emergency, an executive order must be based upon the furtherance of a legislative act or a constitutional mandate. <em>Id. </em>at 194, 440 A.2d 1128. An executive order is invalid if it usurps legislative authority by acting contrary to the express or implied will of the Legislature. <em>Id. </em>at 207, 440 A.2d 1128. Conversely, when the Governor is acting consistently with express or implied authority from the Legislature, his or her action should be given \u201c \u2018the widest latitude of judicial interpreta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>tion, and the burden of persuasion would rest heavily upon any who might attack it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bullet Hole, supra, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 575, 763 A.2d 295 (quoting <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, </em>343 <em>U.S. </em>579, 637, 72 <em>S.Ct. </em>863, 871, 96 <em>L.Ed. </em>1153, 1200 (1952)). By analogy, in <em>Youngstown Sheet, </em>where President Truman\u2019s executive order established federal possession of most of the nation\u2019s steel mills to avert a threatened strike and the attendant stoppage of steel production, the United States Supreme Court held that the President can only act pursuant to either a constitutional right or an act of Congress, and that presidential power cannot be implied from an \u201caggregate\u201d of the President\u2019s Constitutional powers. <em>Id. </em>at 584-86, 72 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 866, 96 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 1166.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Although the judicial nullification of a gubernatorial executive order has been infrequent, there are some useful illustrations. For instance, in <em>County of Gloucester v. State, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>141, 623 A.2d 763 (1993), our Supreme Court invalidated an executive order on prison overcrowding because it no longer qualified as a perennial \u201cemergency\u201d under the Disaster Control Act. <em>Id. </em>at 153, 623 A.2d 763. Nevertheless, the Court stayed the order\u2019s invalidation for a year, so as to allow for a legislative response to the persisting issue. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In <em>Williamson v. Treasurer, </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>253, 814 A.2d 1153 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>493, 828 A.2d 920 (2003), we found a Governor\u2019s executive order inoperative, insofar as it unilaterally created an exemption from public disclosure of certain unclaimed property records in a manner inconsistent with the Right to Know Law, N.J.S.A 47:1A-1. <em>Williamson, supra, </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 272, 814 A.2d 1153. In declining to enforce and apply the order, we noted that, \u201c[sjimply put, an Executive Order cannot amend or repeal a statute.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also Twiss v. Dept. of Treasury, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>342, 352, 571 A.2d 333 (App.Div.1990), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>461, 591 A.2d 913 (1991) (recognizing the same principle, although nullifying only a regulation issued by the State Treasurer and not an executive order). However, we found it unnecessary in <em>Williamson </em>to declare the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>executive order invalid <em>per se, </em>as we construed its terms to be inapplicable to appellant\u2019s particular circumstances. <em>Williamson, supra, </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 273,814 A.2d 1153.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">As a further historical, if not precedential, example, in <em>De Rose v. Byrne, </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>273, 343 A.2d 136 (Ch.Div.1975), the trial court nullified a Governor\u2019s executive order concerning membership on the bi-state Waterfront Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 288, 343 A2d 136. The court held that the Governor could not convert the part-time position of De Rose, a designated New Jersey member of the Commission, to a full-time position that would be subject to conflict-of-interest rules governing such full-time employees. <em>Ibid. </em>The court reasoned that the executive order was invalid because it was not based on \u201can emergent situation,\u201d nor was it based upon \u201cthe furtherance of a legislative act or constitutional mandate.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Youngstown Sheet, supra, </em>343 <em>U.S. </em>at 585, 72 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 866, 96 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 1166). After the Chancery Division issued its decision, Governor Byrne decided to allow De Rose to retain his part-time position on the Commission and waived the application of the constraints of the executive order to De Rose\u2019s current term. Consequently, this court vacated the Chancery Division\u2019s decision as moot. <em>De Rose v. Byrne, </em>139 <em>N.J.Super. </em>132,133-34, 353 A.2d 100 (App.Div.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The Governor asserts that EO 7 comports with these established precepts of separation of powers. Before evaluating that assertion, we must examine one more subject: the existing law of New Jersey respecting public-sector employees, labor organizations, and collective negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Under <em>N.J. Const. </em>article I, paragraph 19, \u201c[pjersons in public employment shall have the right to organize, present to and make known to the State, or any of its political subdivisions or agencies, their grievances and proposals <em>through representatives of their own choosing.\u201d Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). As noted by our Supreme Court, \u201c[t]he parameters of collective negotiations about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>such proposals were established in 1968 by the New Jersey Employer-Employee Relations Act [ (\u2018EERA\u2019) ], <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-1 to -21, and later by judicial decisions.\u201d <em>In re Local 195, IFPTE, AFL-CIO, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>393, 401, 443 A.2d 187 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The Court has acknowledged that \u201cthe phrase \u2018representatives of their own choosing\u2019 [within article I, paragraph 19] has become a phrase of art, designed to convey the intention that the employees\u2019 selection of a bargaining representative should be an uncoerced and free choice.\u201d <em>Lullo v. Int\u2019l </em>Assoc. <em>of Fire Fighters, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>409, 422, 262 A.2d 681 (1970). The Court determined that the framers of the 1947 Constitution would have been familiar with this usage, as it derives from the wording of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 157, which was enacted in 1935. <em>Lullo, supra, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>at 422-23, 262 A.2d 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Under the EERA, the designated union representative of a majority of public employees is chosen by those employees alone. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.3. Once chosen, the State is required to negotiate in good faith with that representative. <em>Ibid. </em>The statute establishes the Public Employment Relations Commission (\u201cPERC\u201d), an agency which has the authority and duty to \u201cmake policy and establish rules and regulations concerning employer-employee relations in public employment relating to dispute settlement, grievance procedures and administration including enforcement of statutory provisions concerning representative elections and related matters and to implement fully all the provisions of [the EERA].\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34.T3A-5.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Pursuant to its statutory authority, PERC has promulgated numerous regulations. Among other things, the regulations specify the methods for certification and decertification of a union representative. Both certification and decertification require a \u201cshowing of interest\u201d by the employees in the bargaining unit, surpassing a thirty percent threshold. <em>N.J.AC. </em>19:11-1.2(a)(9) (regarding certification); <em>N.J.AC. </em>19:11-1.3(a)(3) (regarding decertification). A public employee or group of public employees may file the initial petition for certification with PERC. <em>N.J.A.C. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>19:11-1.1(a)(1). Similarly, a petition may be filed by \u201cany individual or employee organization claiming to be the exclusive representative of public employees.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">A public employer may also file a petition for certification on behalf of its employees. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:11-1.1(a)(2). In order for a petition for certification to be accepted by PERC from the public employer, such as the State, that petition must \u201cstate that a claim for representation or continued representation has been made by one or more public employees, groups of public employees, individuals or employee organizations and that the public employer has a good faith doubt concerning the majority status of the representative of its employees.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:11-1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Only a \u201cpublic employee or group of public employees or any individual acting on their behalf\u201d may file a petition for decertification. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:11-1.1(a)(3). Such a petition must detail the petitioner\u2019s allegations that the current representative \u201cis no longer the majority representative of such employees and that the employees no longer desire to be represented by any employee representative.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>A public employer may not file a petition for decertification. <em>Ibid. </em>Therefore, although the EERA does not expressly detail the process for the removal of a duly-selected labor organization, the administrative regulations delineate that procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">We recognize, as appellants\u2019 counsel acknowledged at oral argument, that it is conceivable that a union chosen by a majority of employees and certified by PERC might be thereafter declared ineligible, as a matter of law, to continue to represent the employees in a bargaining unit for reasons of criminal conduct or other wrongdoing. No present statutes or regulations in our State appear to address the process for such an ouster arising out of criminality or wrongdoing, apart from the decertification procedures administered by PERC.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>On the whole, these interconnected provisions in the State Constitution, the EERA, and the PERC regulations signify that certifying and decertifying a majority representative in the public sector is accomplished through mechanisms that carry out the \u201cuncoerced and free choice\u201d of the represented employees. <em>Lullo, supra, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>at 423, 262 A.2d 681. There is a well-developed body of law and an administrative scheme in place to regulate the selection and displacement of the employees\u2019 chosen majority representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Once in place, a majority representative is authorized to engage in collective negotiations with the public employer. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-5.3. The negotiations are designed to produce a collective bargaining agreement with the employer, reciting the terms and conditions of the employees\u2019 compensation, disciplinary practices, and other matters affecting the workplace. The negotiations are bilateral interactions between the employer and the union, and, unlike many contracts for goods and services, there can be no \u201ccompetitive bidding\u201d or participation of third party competitors. <em>Mount Holly Twp. Bd. of Educ. v. Mount Holly Twp. Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>319, 327-29, 972 A.2d 387 (2009). When the terms of an agreement cannot be reached, issues may be referred to an arbitrator for resolution. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:13A-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">These fundamental aspects of a public employee union\u2019s selection and function, and the distinctive genesis and nature of a collective bargaining agreement, bear significantly upon our analysis of EO 7\u2019s compatibility with existing laws and statutes. We now turn to that analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">By its stated terms, EO 7 attempts to broaden the definition of \u201cbusiness entity\u201d under the pay-to-play laws to encompass \u201clabor unions and labor organizations.\u201d The executive order does not refer to collective bargaining or to collective negotiations. However, the Governor\u2019s attorney confirmed, both in his brief and at oral argument, that EO 7 was intended to include such collective labor agreements within its scope.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> According to the Governor, EO 7 is intended to require Executive Branch agencies and departments to treat collective bargaining agreements as another form of \u201ccontract\u201d subject to the pay-to-play laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The Governor and the <em>amicus </em>forcefully argue that there are strong public policies to eradicate improper influences, or even the appearance of such influences, arising out of political campaign contributions made by labor organizations. They assert that taxpayers and the public at large can be disadvantaged when labor organizations contribute generously to political candidates who are in or who assume State office, and who then participate in collective negotiations with those same unions. The concern is that State office-holders, having personally benefited from the largesse of a union during the campaign, will be apt to treat the union members generously at the bargaining table during the next round of collective negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">We do not minimize or reject these stated public policy concerns, although we likewise recognize the unions\u2019 claim that those concerns are either mistaken or overstated. It is not our function as a court to referee the merits of that important public policy debate. Instead, we are tasked with the discrete but important responsibility of determining whether the method selected for implementing the new public policy, i.e., Executive Order 7, com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>ports with the Constitution, and, in particular, the doctrine of separation of powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">In a host of respects, the terms of EO 7, if applied to collective bargaining agreements, do not mesh with existing statutes and laws governing public employee relations. EO 7\u2019s attempted extension to labor unions and to collective negotiations also does not fit neatly within the structure of existing pay-to-play statutes codified by the Legislature in Chapters 19 and 51. Nor, if relevant, is EO 7 of the same species as the executive orders on pay-to-play issues that preceded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">As our previous discussion in Part I, <em>supra, </em>has shown, the structure and verbiage of the pay-to-play restrictions codified by the Legislature in Chapters 19 and 51, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.3 to - 22\u2014as well as in (now-superseded) EO 134 and in EO 117 and EO 118\u2014are replete with terms associated with public bidding and with the procurement of lands, buildings, goods, and services. They repeatedly allude, not only to procurement itself, but to an assortment of procurement-related concepts such as contract \u201cbidders,\u201d \u201cbid applications,\u201d \u201cspecifications,\u201d \u201cawards,\u201d \u201cpurchasing agents or agencies,\u201d \u201cbid or price quote,\u201d \u201cmaterial terms,\u201d and \u201cbreach\u201d in a competitive marketplace. This terminology is consistent throughout those measures and cannot be accidental. The measures are plainly targeted against undue influence by political contributors within the domain that is conventionally known as the procurement of government contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In construing the words of a statute or other legal provision, we routinely apply the ordinary meaning ascribed to those words. <em>Soto v. Scaringelli, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>558, 570, 917 A.2d 734 (2007). The widely-accepted understanding of the term \u201cprocurement\u201d does not encompass collective bargaining agreements between a public employer and a labor union representing public workers. <em>See, e.g., Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary </em>882 (1999) (defining \u201cprocurement\u201d as the noun version of \u201cprocure,\u201d meaning \u201cto obtain: acquire.\u201d); <em>see also Fennimore v.

As we have noted, both of those statutory definitions classify a business entity to mean \u201cany natural or legal person, business corporation, professional services corporation, limited liability company, partnership, limited partnership, business trust, association or any other legal commercial entity organized under the laws of this State or any other state or foreign jurisdiction.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.7 &amp; -20.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">To be sure, a labor union literally is a \u201clegal person\u201d and a form of \u201cassociation.\u201d But a union is not the same sort of person or association that is anything like the other examples set forth within the statutory definition. The catchall phrase at the end of the definition, \u201cany other legal <em>commercial </em>entity organized under the laws of this State or any other state or foreign jurisdiction!,]\u201d notably contains the adjective \u201ccommercial,\u201d which signifies an enterprise that is organized for entrepreneurial purposes. <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added). <em>Webster\u2019s </em>defines \u201ccommercial\u201d as \u201c[o]f or relating to commerce\u201d and \u201c[e]ngaged in commerce.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>II, supra, </em>at 225.

Unlike a business, it is commonly organized under Section 501(c)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 501(c)(5). Moreover, the statutory references to \u201cprofits,\u201d \u201cstock,\u201d and \u201cassets\u201d in defining a person\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d in a business entity, <em>see </em>N.J.S.A. 19:44A-20.7, do not logically apply to labor unions. Unions are not established as profit-seeking ventures. Rather, they are created to further their members\u2019 interests in maximizing wages and benefits, while, at the same time, advocating for workplace safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The statute\u2019s catchall reference to \u201cany other legal commercial entity\u201d follows an illustrative list of enumerated entities within the definition of a \u201cbusiness entity.\u201d That illustrative list includes traditional for-profit entities such as corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies. Under the basic principle of statutory construction, <em>ejusdem generis, </em>the general words following specific words should be construed to embrace only objects that are similar in nature. <em>Gallenthin Realty Dev., Inc. v. Borough of Paulsboro, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>344, 367-68, 924 A.2d 447 (2007); <em>State v. Hoffman, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>564, 584, 695 A.2d 236 (1997) (citing 2A Norman J. Singer, <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 47.17 (5th ed. 1992)). A labor organization, particularly in this overarching procurement context, is not a \u201csimilar object\u201d to a corporation, partnership, or other commercial enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The 2007 amendment to the pay-to-play statutes\u2019 reporting and disclosure requirements, Chapter 304, inserted the prefatory language, a <em>\u201cfor-profit </em>entity that is ...\u201d immediately before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>statute\u2019s definition of business entity. <em>L. </em>2007, c. 304 (emphasis added); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19.-44A-20.26, -20.27. This insertion underscores the commercial focus of the existing pay-to-play laws. Chapter 304 also makes it unmistakably clear that nonprofit organizations are outside the scope of what the Legislature meant by a \u201cbusiness entity.\u201d We are mindful that the Legislature did not simultaneously make similar clarifying revisions in 2007 to the definitions of business entity in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.7 and -20.17. However, the legislative history reflects that the impetus of the 2007 amendment was to spare nonprofits the burden of filing annual reports with ELEC under the pay-to-play laws, a compliance issue that had been the particular subject of regulatory concern.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Moreover, the remedial aspects of Chapters 19 and 51 are not reasonably compatible with a mechanistic injection of the terms \u201clabor organization\u201d and \u201clabor union\u201d within the four corners of the existing pay-to-play statutes. Since labor organizations are not-for-profit entities, they are statutorily excluded by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.26 and -20.27 from the pay-to-play statute\u2019s disclosure and reporting requirements. That exclusion would substantially weaken the effort to subject collective negotiations to the pay-to-play laws. That is because a labor union\u2019s past political contributions would not readily be made known, at least not without some form of independent research, to the public agency engaged in bargaining with that union and to the public at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Also, quantifying the \u201cvalue of the transaction\u201d for purposes of the statutory $17,500 threshold triggering the pay-to-play restrictions, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.14, is problematic when applied to the State\u2019s relationship as employer with a labor organization representing State employees. A collective bargaining agreement is not ordinarily referred to as a \u201ctransaction,\u201d although we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>acknowledge that the word \u201ctransaction\u201d could have sufficient breadth of meaning to cover such negotiated agreements. Even so, it is not certain whether the \u201cvalue\u201d to be measured under the law, if EO 7 were upheld, would be the portion of the State\u2019s payroll disbursed to the represented employees or whether, as the Governor\u2019s counsel suggested at oral argument, the \u201cvalue\u201d would be measured by the labor organization\u2019s receipt of union dues from its members. Although these alternative approaches are likely to yield values exceeding $17,500, the valuation terminology within the statute does not readily fit the union\u2019s distinctive role.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">In addition, we have great difficulty in sensibly applying, in the unique context of a collective bargaining agreement, the legislative declaration of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-20.21, stating that a violation of the pay-to-play laws \u201cshall be a <em>breach </em>of the terms of the government contract\u201d with the business entity, (emphasis added). Even if we were to apply the notion of a breach, a term more commonly found in a traditional contract setting, in the collective bargaining context, it is unclear how a violation of EO 7 comprising such a breach would be remedied.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">For example, it is not clear if EO 7 is meant to require the ouster or decertification of the labor union that made the prohibited campaign donation. If so, that ouster would implicate, and would likely directly clash with, the constitutional and statutory right of public employees to be represented by the union approved by a majority vote of its members. The intended timing and conditions of the ouster, and its effect upon existing collective bargaining agreements, also are murky at best. This is not a minor detail that can be left to a future administrative regulation. Instead, such an ouster or decertification would strike at the core of our collective bargaining system embedded in pre-existing statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u201c \u2018In discerning [the Legislature\u2019s] intent, [courts] consider not only the particular statute in question, but also the entire legislative scheme of which it is a part.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Adoption of a Child by W.P. and M.P., </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>158, 168, 748 A.2d 515 (2000) (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number><em>Alan J. Cornblatt, P.A. v. Barow, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>218, 234, 708 A.2d 401 (1998)). Here, the Legislature\u2019s self-evident omission of labor organizations and collective bargaining agreements from the extant pay-to-play statutes in Chapters 19 and 51 in <em>Title </em>19 is compatible with the \u201centire legislative scheme\u201d in <em>Title </em>34 regulating labor organizations under the EERA. By contrast, EO 7 lacks such manifest compatibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The Legislature clearly knew how to define and include labor organizations when it wanted them encompassed by the campaign contribution laws. By way of illustration, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19.-44A-11.3 and -11.4, the statutes that impose general limits on political campaign contributions, include several explicit prohibitions that broadly and unambiguously sweep in labor unions. As we noted in Part I, <em>supra, </em>those statutes, which are codified in the statutory provisions immediately before the pay-to-play provisions of Chapters 19 and 51, instruct that \u201cno labor organization of any kind which exists or is constituted for the purpose, in whole or in part, of collective bargaining, or of dealing with employers concerning the grievances, terms or conditions of employment, or of other mutual aid or protection in connection with employment\u201d may make campaign donations above the prescribed limits of that section. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-11.3(a); <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-11.4(a)(1), (b), &amp; (e) (utilizing the same definition).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">When the Legislature wanted to include labor organizations in a statute, it consciously chose the words to do so. Its omission of equivalent references to labor organizations in Chapters 19 and 51 is, by comparison, conspicuous and instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Careful examination shows that a revision of the pay-to-play laws to encompass labor organizations and collective bargaining agreements would necessitate substantial amendments and modifications to existing statutes, including, but not limited to, EERA, as well as to certain aspects of Chapters 19 and 51. The desired changes in the law would, in essence, require not only a pen, but also an eraser. Given the statutes already on the books, an executive order cannot unilaterally mandate the de facto decer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>tification of a labor union as the designated representative of public employees, at least not without implementing many other statutory modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">We are not, by any means, concluding that what the Governor seeks to accomplish is illegal, impossible, or unwise public policy. At oral argument, counsel for the unions acknowledged that an appropriate statute potentially could be enacted to create, subject to other constitutional constraints, the functional equivalent of pay-to-play restrictions for labor organizations. But such a new statute necessarily would require a significant overhaul of existing laws. The Legislature, given its constitutionally delegated realm of authority, would have to be part of that law-making process. <em>See N.J. Const. </em>art. V, \u00a7 1, \u00b6 14(a) (the Presentment Clause). We cannot accord deference to EO 7\u2019s unilateral attempt to exercise the Legislature\u2019s powers, where the Legislature has not ceded those powers to the Executive. <em>Commc\u2019ns Workers of Am., supra, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>at 463, 617 A.2d 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">An executive order cannot bypass the Legislature and carry out what would be, in effect, an implied repealer of existing legislation. \u201cA repeal by implication requires clear and compelling evidence of legislative intent, and such intent must be free from reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Twp. of Mahwah v. Bergen County Bd. of Taxation, </em>98 <em>N.J. 268, </em>280, 486 A.2d 818 (1985). A strong presumption against an implied repealer exists, and \u201c[e]very reasonable statutory construction should be applied to avoid finding [it].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281, 486 A.2d 818. To the extent that it aims to dramatically alter the existing and comprehensive statutory scheme for collective bargaining, EO 7 cannot substitute for an appropriate repealing statute duly enacted by the Legislature and signed into law (absent a veto override) by the Governor.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The constitutionality of EO 7 is not bolstered by the issuance of prior executive orders by Governors McGreevey and Corzine. Those prior orders were aimed at traditional procurement and public contracting, not collective negotiations. EO 7 is of an entirely different stripe. It alters the definition of a \u201cbusiness entity\u201d in a manner fundamentally different from what was pursued in EO 134, EO 117, and EO 118. Moreover, none of those prior executive orders was ever challenged or upheld in court.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> When such a challenge was anticipated respecting EO 134, the Legislature quickly preempted that possibility by enacting Chapter 51 and by superseding EO 134. Indeed, the Legislature\u2019s rapid enactment of Chapter 51 is a further indication that it has not abdicated its constitutional role over these subject matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">We have considered whether, as one of appellants\u2019 counsel has suggested, a \u201csavings construction\u201d of EO 7 should be adopted, one which interprets EO 7 to apply only to the rare or hypothetical instance in which a <em>procurement </em>contract for goods and services is awarded to a labor organization. At oral argument we were informed that such minor contracts are occasionally awarded to labor organizations undertaking certain training activities on behalf of the State. None of the appellants is aware of any such procurement contracts now in existence involving their particular unions. The Governor\u2019s counsel, meanwhile, submits that EO 7 was not issued to apply only to such minor and rare situations. A grand initiative is not saved by shrinking it to an inconsequential afterthought.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Given the reality of the circumstances, we choose not to construe EO 7 in a constrictive and artificial manner. Instead, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>shall read it in a fashion consistent with its announced and apparent policy objectives. Such a faithful reading cannot be reasonably harmonized with existing statutes and laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The prospective adoption of regulations implementing EO 7 will not cure these many problems. It is well settled that administrative regulations adopted by the Executive Branch cannot amend or repeal statutes. <em>Accident Index Bureau, Inc. v. Hughes, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>160, 165-66, 215 A.2d 529 (1965); <em>Twiss, supra, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 352-53, 571 A.2d 333. Consequently, there is no reason for the court to await such regulations before making a definitive ruling on the separation-of-powers issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">This is not the first time that the Constitution has mandated the nullification of an executive order. Nor is it the first time that a governmental branch has engaged in institutional encroachment. In <em>Communications Workers of America, supra, </em>the Legislature was found to have overstepped its bounds by encroaching upon the powers of the Executive. <em>See Commc\u2019ns Workers of Am., supra, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>at 463, 617 A.2d 223. Here, the Executive has encroached upon the powers of the Legislature. In both instances, the Constitution must prevail, while still providing ample opportunity for future inter-branch accommodation. The pursuit of expanding pay-to-play reforms to include labor unions need not cease today. Rather, that pursuit, if desired, may continue through collaborative endeavors.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In sum, we conclude that paragraph 1 of EO 7, at least insofar as it is intended to treat collective bargaining agreements as \u201ccontracts\u201d and labor unions as \u201cbusiness entities,\u201d is so fundamentally incompatible with our existing laws and statutes as to impair the \u201cessential integrity\u201d of the constitutional powers of the Legislature. <em>Massett Bldg. Co., supra, </em>4 <em>N.J. </em>at 57-59, 71 A.2d 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">We do not reach this conclusion lightly. Nor do we otherwise discount or question the Governor\u2019s policy objectives or his considerable and well-established constitutional authority over the Exec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>utive Branch and the management of the State workforce.

However, the parties subsequently acknowledged to us at oral argument that the urgency of the situation was abated by the Governor\u2019s counsel\u2019s concession at oral argument that EO 7 does not apply, and was not intended to apply, to contributions made in connection with county, municipal, or school board elections. In addition, it was represented to us at oral argument that there are no statewide offices or legislative races presently contemplated for the November 2010 General Election.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b280-8\"> This opinion disposes of all open motions in the appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b281-10\"> <em>See generally </em>Robert F.
