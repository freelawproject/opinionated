Charles L. Hancock was not living at the time of the decease of the testator. A child is not living, the mother is not quick, until the 16th or 18th week after conception. Hutchinson on Infanticide, 8 ; 1 Paris &amp; Fonbl. Med. Jurispr. 239 ; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>3 Campb. 77. It is not a punishable offence at common law, to procure, or to attempt to procure, an abortion, unless the mother is quick <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bangs, </em>9 Mass. R. 387. The precedent in 3 Chit. Crim. Law, 798, contains the words \u201c <em>big </em>and pregnant,\u201d which are equivalent, to an allegation, that the woman was quick; and the distinction between <em>grassement enseint </em>and <em>priviment enseint, </em>continually recurs in the books which treat of this subject. A woman convicted of a capi tal offence, is not to be executed, if quick; otherwise, if merely pregnant. 1 Hale\u2019s P. C. 368 ; 4 BI. Comm. 395. An unborn child is not the subject of homicide ; but if from injuries inflicted before birth, the child dies after birth, it is homicide. Gouldsb. 176; 3 Inst. 50; 1 Hawk. P. C. (Curwood\u2019s ed.) c. 31, \u00a7 16 ; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Enoch, </em>5 Carr. &amp; Payne, 539. This can be only, where the mother is quick when the injury is inflicted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-12\">The Digest makes a distinction between a child era <em>ventre sa mere in esse, </em>at the father\u2019s death, and only conceived. Dig. <em>lib. </em>38, <em>tit. </em>8. And this distinction is recognised in <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>2 Freem. 42. In <em>Gibson </em>v. Gibson, 2 Freem. 223, the court said, that \u201c it appeared- that the mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>was quick, at the death of the father.\u201d So, in <em>Millar </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>1 Ves. sen. 86, Lord <em>Hardwicke </em>said, of a child <em>en ventre sa mere, </em>that \u201c the destruction of him is murder;\u201d which can be only where the mother is quick.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-5\">The jury were not rightly instructed. Although the usual period of gestation is nine calendar months, yet there is <em>very commonly </em>a difference of one, two or three weeks. Co. Lit. 123 <em>b, </em>Hargr. note ; 2 Stark. Ev. 222, note (b) ; 1 Paris &amp; Fonbl. Med. Jurispr. 244 ; 3 ibid. 211 to 222. If the legal presumption is, as the jury were instructed, that Charles L. Hancock was <em>in esse </em>at the decease of the testator, yet he clearly was <em>not living; </em>and the jury were not warranted in finding the issue for the plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-9\"><em>Dexter </em>and <em>Gardiner, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AW_\">cited Cruise\u2019s Dig. <em>tit. </em>38, <em>Devise, c. </em>20, \u00a7 56 ; <em>Trower </em>v. <em>Butts, </em>1 Sim. &amp; Stu. 181 ; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>2 H.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUL\">delivered the opinion of the Court. The single question is, whether Charles L. Hancock, for whose benefit this suit on a probate bond is brought, is entitled to s share with his four brothers, in a bequest of his grandfather, James Scott. The bequest- was to certain grandchildren, Ci that is to say, to such of them as may be living at my decease, in equal portions, be their number more or less.\u201d The claimant being born within nine months after the death of the testator, the question is, whether he was then <em>living, </em>within the meaning of the law, so as to be entitled to a share.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-16\">In the first place, we think the jury were rightly instructed, that a child is to be considered <em>in esse </em>at a period commencing nine months previously to its birth, and where there is not evidence to rebut the presumption, it is conclusive. We are also of opinion, that the distinction between a woman being pregnant, and being quick with child, is applicable mainly if not exclusively to criminal cases ; and that it does not apply to cases of descents, devises and other gifts ; and that, generally, a child will be considered in being, from con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>ception to the time of its birth, in all cases where it will be for the benefit of such child to be so considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">In a recent case it was held, that where a gift was to children <em>born </em>&amp;c., a child <em>en ventre sa mere </em>should take a share. Among other considerations it was suggested^ that a child <em>en ventre sa </em>mere, even in the early stages of pregnancy, should be deemed living, because the potential existence of such child places it within the reason and motive of the gift. And the maxim of the civil law was cited, <em>posthumus pro nato habetur. Trower </em>v. Butts, 1 Sim. &amp; Stu. 181. Whether the Court would feel justified in going to this extent, when the gift is to children <em>born </em>&amp;c., it is not now necessary to decide ; but the Court are of opinion, that a child <em>en ventre sa mere </em>is to be considered a child living, so as to take a beneficial interest in a bequest, where the description is \u201c children living.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">A child <em>en ventre sa mere </em>is taken to be a person in being, for many purposes. He may take by descent; by devise, <em>Long </em>v. <em>Blackall, </em>7 T. R. 100 ; or under the statute of distributions, <em>Wallis </em>v. <em>Hodson, </em>2 Atk. 117; <em>Thellusson </em>v. <em>Woodford, </em>4 Ves. 322 ; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Lancashire, </em>5 T. R. 49 and generally for all purposes where it is for his benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Lord <em>Hardwicke </em>says, in <em>Wallis </em>v. <em>Hodson, </em>the principal reason I go upon is, that a child <em>en ventre sa mere </em>is a person <em>in rerum natura, </em>so that, both by the rules of the civil and common law, he is to all intents and purposes a child, as much as if born in the father\u2019s lifetime. And <em>Buller </em>J., in delivering his opinion, in <em>Thellusson </em>v. <em>Woodford, </em>4 Ves. 324, after citing various cases, says, the effect is, that there is no difference between a child actually born and a child <em>en ventre sa mere.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">The case of <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Clarke, 2 </em>H. Bl. 399, is directly in point. The devise was by the testator to his brother for life, and from his decease, to all and every such child or children as should be living at the time of his decease. The brother died in October 1782, and the plaintiff was born in May 1783, and it was held that she was entitled to a share as a child living. And it was stated as a fixed principle, that wherever such consideration would be for his benefit, a child <em>en ventre sa mere </em>shall he considered as absolutely born.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>\u25a0 The Court are all of opinion, that Charles L. Hancock, for whose benefit the suit was brought, was entitled to a share, and that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
