The sergeant\u2019s return stated, that he had warned \u201c Lewis Cobb junior.\u201d Lewis Cobb, the father of the petitioner, lived within the bounds of the company, but was not subject to military duty, by reason of age ; and it did not appear that any other person of the same name, except the petitioner, resided within those limits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-12\">Thomas testified, that he signed a notice directed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>\u201c Lewis Cobb junior,\u201d to warn him to training, and that he gave it to the captain to leave at the house of the petitioner\u2019s father; that on the 30th of September the witness saw the petitioner and asked him if he had received his notice ; that the petitioner replied, no, not as he knew of; that the witness told him that he supposed one had been left at his father\u2019s, and that he presumed the petitioner made his home at his father\u2019s.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-7\">The captain testified that he received from Thomas, the sergeant, a notice for Lewis Cobb junior, and that on the 30th of September he left it with the petitioner\u2019s father, at the door of his house. This testimony was objected to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-8\">Lewis Cobb, the father of the petitioner, testified that more, than four days before the training, when standing near the door of his house, he received from the captain a paper which the captain said was a notice for Lewis, and that the witness carried it into the house and handed it to his wife to give to his son ; and that he did not know of his son\u2019s being at home before the 9th of October.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-9\">There was evidence tending to show tnat the petitioner avoided going t\u00f3 his father\u2019s house, where he lived, in order that he might not receive the notice until after the muster.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-10\">The orderly book of 'the company was produced, containing the following entry:\u2014\u201cOct. 7, 1828. By order of Capt. Daniel Cobb, the company of militia commanded by him was ordered and directed to assemble and appear at the dwellinghouse of Levi Cobb, in Middleborough, on Tuesday the seventh day of October present, at eight o\u2019clock in the morning, with arms and equipments as the law directs, for military duty, then and there to wait for further orders, &amp;c., and the following persons were. absent, viz. (naming Lewis Cobb junior and others.)

That the justice permitted the captain to testify in support of the prosecution. (But see <em>Burt </em>v. Dimmock, 11 Pick. 355, where it was held that a captain has no personal interest, and tnerefore is a competent witness, in the prosecution for a fine.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-5\">4. That in the orderly book there is no record of the orders issued for warning the company to meet on the 7th of October ; and that it does not appear by any record therein, t^at there was a meeting or training of the company on that day ; or that the roll was called on that day ; or that the petitioner was not present at the supposed meeting of the company on that day.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b17-6\">Stevens, in support of the petition,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AM\">cited as to the misnomer, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>3 Pick. 262 ; and as to the insufficiency of the orderly book, <em>Sawtel </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>5 Greenl. 438.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b17-7\">\n<em>Eddy, contrd,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ\">cited in regard to the service of the notification, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cutter, </em>8 Mass. R. 279.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b17-8\">The opinion of the Court was afterwards drawn up by</p>\n<author id=\"b17-9\">Morton J.</author>\n<p id=\"AI6\">The appointment and qualification of the captain and clerk are admitted. The petitioner also appears to have been duly enrolled. The addition of <em>second </em>to his 'name would as clearly distinguish him from an older person of the same name, as <em>junior. </em>Neither of the terms constitutes any part of the name, but they are used to describe and designate the person; as his residence is sometimes used for the same purpose. <em>Kincaid </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>10 Mass. R. 203 ; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>1 Pick. 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-10\">The orderly book was competent and sufficient evidence of the meeting of the company, and of the absence of the petitioner; according to the decision in the preceding case.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-11\">The company order directing the sergeant to warn Lewis Cobb, gave him authority to notify the petitioner. Although there was another person within the limits of the company, of the same name, yet he was not liable to do military duty; and this circumstance, if known to the sergeant, would enable him to determine which of the two was intended. Besides, as above remarked, <em>junior </em>or <em>second </em>is no part of the name, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>but only addition or description, used to designate the i ldi vidual referred to ; and where no addition is required by law, an error in it cannot invalidate. If therefore the petitioner was duly notified, he 'cannot object that the warning officer had no authority to warn him.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-7\">The return of the sergeant on the warrant, shows that he warned Lewis Cobb <em>junior. </em>It also appears from his testi many, (and he is a competent witness to this point,) that he made out and signed a written notice directed to Lewis Cobb junior, and gave it to the captain to be delivered to the petitioner. That this was left at the house of his father, is directly proved by the testimony of the captain, and is clearly to be inferred from other evidence in the case. It is also shown that the petitioner lived at his father\u2019s house. A notification left at his last and usual place of abode, was a legal warning, whether the sergeant left it himself or sent it by an agent or servant. [But see Revised Stat. c. <em>12, </em>\u00a7 89.] And although it was not a service very appropriate to the office of captain, yet in a legal view he might as well be the messenger, as any other person.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-8\">It was further proved by the warning officer, that he per sonally informed the petitioner that a notification was left at his father\u2019s ; so that he had not only <em>constructive, </em>but <em>actual </em>notice of the training.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-9\">It unquestionably was the duty of the clerk to record <em>this </em>and all other company orders in the orderly book. But the authority of the orders of the commanding officer do not depend upon their being recorded, and this neglect of duty on the part of the clerk will not invalidate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-10\">The conduct of trie petitioner in working and lodging about in the neighbourhood and avoiding his father\u2019s house and his own home, was a shallow subterfuge to evade the law, unworthy the character of a soldier, and which, were it effectual, would be a reproach to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-11\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
