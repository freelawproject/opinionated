It appeared by the records of the commissioners, that he had waived his claim to greater damages than the commissioners had awarded to him. The fact of a waiver was denied by him, and he contended that a claim for damages in such a case could not be released except by a writing signed by the owner of the land. But the <em>Court </em>said, that although a right of way is an interest in real estate, yet that the taking of land for a highway is an act done by the commissioners pursuant to authority given them by statute, and the waiver of damages is a relinquishment, not of an interest in land, but of a pecuniary claim ; that this claim may be released by paroi before the commissioners and by an entry thereof on their records, and their records will be conclusive evidence of such release ; wherefore, in the present case, the commissioners were justified in refusing a jury, and the petition must be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
