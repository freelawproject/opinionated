Issue was joined on this plea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-10\">The parties stated the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-11\">At the trial, before <em>Wilde </em>J., it appeared or was admitted, that the defendants acted honestly in the assessment and collection of the tax ; that for a long period of years prior to 1830, the plaintiff\u2019s residence and the estate taxed fell within the limits of Wellfleet, according to certain ancient monuments, and by the boundary lines between Truro and Well-fleet, as run and marked by the selectmen of those two towns , that he had never been taxed in Truro for his poll or for this estate, previously to 1830, but had always been taxed therefor in Wellfleet; that in 1829, the selectmen of Truro and Wellfleet perambulated and marked out the boundary line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>between these towns ; that by this line, which was duly certified by such selectmen and recorded in the town records of both towns, the plaintiff\u2019s residence and this estate fell within the limits of Truro ; and that this line remained unaltered in 1830, when the tax in question was assessed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-3\">The jury were instructed, that if, at the time when this tax was assessed, the plaintiff\u2019s residence and the estate taxed were in Wellfleet, their verdict should be for the plaintiff; otherwise it should be for the defendants. The questions of law were reserved for the whole Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-4\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-5\">It was objected on the part of the defendants :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-6\">1. That they, as assessors, were not responsible on account of such assessment, they having been thereto required by the constituted authorities of the town, and having acted with integrity and fidelity ; and that the remedy of the plaintiff, if he had any, was against the town of Truro.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-7\">2. That if the defendants weie responsible in any form, they were not liable in an action on the <em>case, </em>but only in <em>trespass.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-8\">If, upon these facts, the Court should be of opinion, that the defendants were not responsible, or that the action should have been trespass, or if upon the whole evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, the verdict was to be set aside, and judgment entered for the defendants for costs ; otherwise judgment was to be rendered upon the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b53-9\"><em>J. </em>and <em>T. Reed, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtC\">as to the first objection, cited <em>Ingraham </em>v.

The jury have determined that the plaintiff\u2019s residence and estate were in Wellfleet. And although the recent perambulation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>the line between the towns of Well fleet and Truro had thrown the plaintiff\u2019s home and estate in the latter town, yet this was only <em>prim\u00f3, facie </em>evidence of the line, and, we are satisfied, was shown to be incorrect by more potent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">By <em>St. </em>1785, c. 75, \u00a7 1, it is enacted, \u201cthat the bounds of all townships shall be, and remain as heretofore granted, settled and established.\u201d It is also provided, that the lines between towns shall be run and the marks renewed within three years, \u201c and once every five years for ever after, by two or more of the selectmen of each town,\u201d \u201c and their proceedings, after every such renewal of boundaries, shall be recorded in their respective town books.\u201d Selectmen clearly have no power to alter the limits of towns. This can only be done by the legislature of the commonwealth. Nor are they the ultimate judges of the territorial limits of towns. Their dtity is a ministerial rather than a judicial one. It is to resurvey an <em>old </em>line and not to establish a <em>new </em>one. It is to <em>renew </em>monuments as they have existed, and not to <em>alter </em>their location. They are liable to fall into errors and mistakes in their perambulations, and if these are to be deemed conclusive evidence, the boundaries of towns may be changed, and the rights of individuals, as well as corporations, affected by an accidental blunder or unintentional mistake of selectmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">When perambulations are duly made and recorded, they are not merely <em>prim\u00f3 facie, </em>but <em>very high </em>and <em>strong </em>evi dence. They may however be overbalanced by <em>higher </em>and <em>stronger </em>evidence, and, in the present case, we think they were so. The ancient monuments and immemorial usage and acquiescence of the adjoining towns, were properly judged by the jury to be of more weight than the recent perambulation of selectmen, who, preferring a straight to a crooked line, run it where they thought it probably ought to be, rather t&gt; an where they believed it ever had been.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">The defendants, in assessing the plaintiff, acted, as has been agreed by the parties, with fairness, fidelity, and integrity. But this will not protect them from this action. They cannot correctly be said to have been required by the town of which they were assessors, to assess a tax upon persons, who did not reside within, or own estate lying within, its territorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>\u2022units, and so are not protected by the statute of 1823, <em>c. </em>138, \u00a7 5. <em>Gage </em>v. <em>Currier, 4 </em>Pick. 399 ; <em>Inglee </em>v. <em>Bosworth, </em>5 Pick. 498 ; <em>Ingraham </em>v. <em>Doggett, </em>5 Pick. 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">But the plaintiff has clearly misconceived his action. Trespass, and not case, is the proper remedy. The constable or collector acted by the command of the assessors contained in their warrant to him. The act itself was a direct and forcible injury to the plaintiff. And those who commanded it to be done are principals in it, as much as those who actually committed it. That trespass is the only proper form of action, was directly decided in 1814, in <em>Agry </em>v. <em>Young, </em>11 Mass. R. 220. That decision has never been questioned, and the practice has been uniformly according to it ever since ; and indeed it was generally the same long before. <em>Colburn </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>5 Mass. R. 427. The plaintiff therefore cannot have judgment upon this writ and declaration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
