In <em>Trueman </em>v. Fenton, Cowp. 546, it was argued by the counsel, that a promise by a bankrupt to pay a debt in consideration of a creditor\u2019s signing his certificate, would have been a good ground of action before the <em>St. </em>5 <em>Geo. </em>2, c. 30, \u00a7 11 ; and the court appeared to assent to this position. As we have no statute of the kind, such a promise would seem to be valid here. Bayley on Bills, 353, 354. A debtor may prefer a creditor and pay the debt at once ; if so, <em>a fortiori, </em>a stipulation for a further payment would be legal.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-8\"><em>Warren, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARn\">cited <em>Cockshott </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>2 T.

The only question reserved is, whether the evidence was admissi ble, it seeming to be conceded, that if admissible, it establishes a good defence. And the Court are of opinion, that it was admissible and did show that the note was fraudulent and void. The plaintiff, with the other creditors of the defendant, entered into an arrangement with the defendant, by which he consented to take an equal distribution of his property and give him a discharge. But at the same time he entered into a secret agreement with the debtor, by which he stipulated to have a separate note for the balance of his debt This was an unwarrantable coercion upon the debtor, and a fraud upon the other creditors, which renders the note void. That the plaintiff himself was conscious of this, is manifest from the fact, that although it was given at the time of the execution of the assignment and as an inducement to the plaintiff to sign that instrument, it was post-dated, in order to give it the appearance of a subsequent and independent transaction, entered into after the defendant had become a free man by obtaining his discharge, which might have been good. <em>Cockshott </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>2 T.
