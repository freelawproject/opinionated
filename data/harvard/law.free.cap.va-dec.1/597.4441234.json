Witt, attorney for the commonwealth of Virginia, for the city of Eichmond, and who in this behalf prosecutes for the said commonwealth,, in his proper person comes into the said court, on this 6th day of July, 1885, and here gives the said court to understand and be informed, that A. B. Guigon, Jr., did, within the last twelve months past, bring suit against the commonwealth for the recovery of money for coupons tendered for taxes, without having the special license required by law ; against, the peace and dignity of the commonwealth of Virginia. \u2019 \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-6\">To this information the defendant in error demurred, and the court sustained the demurrer ; and to that judgment the commonwealth obtained this writ.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b602-7\"><em>The Attorney- </em>General, for the commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b602-8\">R. <em>L. </em>Maury, for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b601-16\">See monographic note on \u201cIndictments, Informations and Presentments\u201d appended to Boyle <em>v. </em>Com., 14 Gratt. 674 (Va.

For whilst, as was said in Lazier\u2019s Case, 10 Gratt. 711, there are provisions in the Code dispensing with the necessity of merely formal allegations in the information or indictment, and declaring that \u201cno indictment or other accusation shall be quashed or deemed invalid\u201d for any of certain enumerated causes, it is still necessary that the jurisdiction shall be made to appear. Code 1873, ch. 201, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">The information is radically defective in failing to allege all the facts and circumstances necessary to constitute the offence with which it is sought, to charge the defendant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>error ; for example, that the defendant was an attorney-at-law, and was acting in that capacity in bringing the suit; that the suit was brought in a court in which the Commonwealth would be properly sued, etc. Hord v. The Commonwealth, 4 Leigh 674; Comm. v. Israel, Id. 675; Robert\u2019s Case, 10 Leigh 720; Clark\u2019s Case, 6 Gratt. 677; Bishop\u2019s Case, 13 Gratt. 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Bor these reasons the court is unanimously of opinion to affirm the judgment of the hustings court of the city of Richmond, sustaining the demurrer of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
