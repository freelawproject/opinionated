In 1851, Erwin sold the grist-mill, with the preference to a certain quantity of water, to Clarke, Miller &amp; Hall, and they changed the grist-mill to a paper-mill, and changed the water wheels from breast to overshot wheels, which required taking the water from the dam on a higher level. Soon after the fitting up of the paper-mill, Clarke, Miller &amp; Hall filed their bill against Hannah and Erwin, alleging that Hannah was running his sawmill so as to interfere with the working of their paper-mill, and praying for an injunction to restrain him from so doing, and Hannah replied that Clarke, &amp;c., were using more water in running their paper-mill than was used in running the grist-mill, or convej'ed to them by Erwin. The circuit court dismissed the bill, as to Erwin, and perpetuated the injunction as to Hannah, but without prejudice to his right to sue at law, &amp;c., and thereupon Hannah applied for and obtained an appeal from said decree: held,:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b342-11\">Same \u2014 Same\u2014Same\u2014Same.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b342-12\">1.
