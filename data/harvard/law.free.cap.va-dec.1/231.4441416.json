XI, sec. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">This is confined to a \u201chouseholder or head of a family.\u201d For what purpose ? Manifestly, in the interests of society, and for the comfort, maintenance and shelter of the family, as well as the head of that family ; and hence the discrimination made by the constitution between \u201chouseholders or heads of families,\u201d and other debtors not thus situated. And for that reason, doubtless, it was wisely provided that the general assembly shall prescribe in what manner, and on what conditions, the said \u201chouseholder or head of a family\u201d shall thereafter set apart and hold for himself and -family a homestead out of any property hereby exempted ; and may, in its discretion, determine in what manner and on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>what conditions he may thereafter hold for the benefit of himself and family such personal property as he may have, and coming within the exemption hereby made. Art. XI, sec. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">If the constitution had stopped here, there might be much force in the view that the \u201chouseholder or head of a family\u201d might waive the benefit of, or otherwise encumber the said homestead. But the same section goes on to provide that \u201cthis section shall not be construed as authorizing the general assembly to defeat or impair the benefits intended to be conferred by the provisions of this article and the 7th section requires that \u201cthe provisions of this article shall be construed liberally, to the end that all the intents thereof shall be fully and perfectly carried out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The authority to \u201cprescribe in what manner and on what . conditions\u201d the homestead may be set apart and held for \u201chimself and family,\u201d is limited and controlled by the subsequent clause of the same section, which inhibits the general assembly from \u201cdefeating or impairing the benefits intended to be conferred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">What were those benefits ? Clearly, to secure to every family a home and the ordinary means of support, and to protect them in thosg pursuits necessary to the existence and well-being of every community. The power to do so must reside in every state. Taney, Ch. J., in Brownson v. Kinzie, 1 How. 311. It was to effectuate this purpose that the constitution pointed out the mode of its own construction \u2014 i. e., \u00a3 \u2018liberally, to the end that all the intents thereof be fully and perfectly carried out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">The object clearly was to secure to the family, as well as the head, a home and shelter from want and exposure, and to make that provision permanent by providing that it shall be held for the benefit of \u201chimself and family;\u201d not \u201cimpaired or defeated;\u201d not parted with, given or conveyed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>away ; not destroyed by \u2018 \u2018waiving its benefits\u201d to the exclusion and deprivation of those t\u00e9nder and helpless members of the family who were the chief objects of care and concern to the framers of the constitution ; but \u201cheld,\u201d kept, retained, secured. The terms implies fixedness, permanence, stability, security, continuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The only authority the general assembly has over the subject is derived from section 5 of article XI, which limits their power to prescribing the manner and conditions of \u2018 \u2018setting apart\u201d and \u201cholding\u201d the homestead for the \u201chouseholder or head of a family\u2019 \u2019 and \u2018 \u2018his family. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">In pursuance of the authority thereby conferred, the general assembly proceeded to \u2018 \u2018prescribe \u2018in what manner and on what conditions\u2019 the homestead should be set apart,\u201d &amp;c. (Sessions Acts 1869-70, chap. 157, \u00a7 1, p. 198), and in the same statute declared that \u2018 \u2018it shall continue after his (the householder\u2019s) death for the benefit of the widow and children of the deceased,\u201d &amp;c. (Code 1873, p. 1171, ch. 183, sec. 8), and \u201cif such householder or head of a family shall have departed this life since the adoption of the present constitution, leaving a widow or infant children, and such homestead shall have not been selected or assigned in the lifetime of such householder,\u201d the widow or such infant children shall be entitled to claim the same. Code, p. 1172, ch. 183, sec. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The 7th section of the same act points out the only mode by which the \u201chomestead so set apart,\u201d may be encumbered or aliened. In the case of a married man, it requires a joint deed of husband and wife, with privy examination of the wife.'</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Both the constitutions and the act of assembly referred to, recognize \u201cthe family,\u201d as interested in, and entitled to, the benefit of the \u201chomestead.\u201d The authority to waive such benefit, by one member of the family, intended to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>provided for, to the exclusion and detriment of others jointly interested, would be to \u201cdefeat and impair\u201d the benefits intended to be conferred by art. XI, which by its terms should be construed liberally, to the end that all the intents thereof may be \u2018 \u2018fully and perfectly carried out. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The object and intent of the \u201cwaiver,\u201d is to \u201cdefeat and impair\u201d the benefits of the homestead <em>\u201cpro tanto.\u201d </em>If this purpose is not to be effectuated, then it is nugatory and void ; if it is to be effectuated, then it is contrary to the 5th sec. of art. XI of the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">If a total \u201cwaiver\u201d of the benefits intended to be conferred, does not \u201cimpair or defeat\u201d it, I am at a loss to conceive what language will express that purpose. There might be plausibility for such a construction, if \u2018 \u2018the benefits intended to be conferred,\u201d were confined to the \u201chead of the family. \u201d But they are equally intended for his family, and the act itself recognizes this by providing for its assignment, even after the death of the \u201chead of the family,\u201d and its continuance \u201ctill the youngest child becomes 21 years of age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The third section of article XI provides that \u201cnothing contained therein shall be construed to interfere with the sale of the property aforesaid, or any part thereof, by virtue of \u2018any mortgage, deed of trust, pledge, or other security thereon.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">And it is insisted that this section was intended to give to the \u201chouseholder or head of a family,\u201d the right to encumber the homestead by \u2018 \u2018mortgage, deed of trust, pledge, or other security.\u201d I do not so understand it. The constitution meant to leave the property liable to existing liens, and not to create new liens to the destruction of the rights of homestead to the family by one member of that family in disregard of the interests of others. The general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>assembly must so have understood it, when they provided the mode of encumbering the same by joint deed of husband and wife, and investing the proceeds of any sale made thereof in \u201canother homestead.\u201d The stipulation in a promissory note \u201cto waive the benefit\u201d of an exemption, \u201cm futuro,\u201d of a homestead not yet assigned or set apart, is an executory contract which cannot operate as an estoppel from subsequently claiming the exemption. (See Moxley v. Ragun et al. recently decided by \u201cthe court of appeals\u201d of Kentucky, and not yet reported. American Law Eegister, December, 1874, p. 743.) Shapley v. Abbot, 42 N. Y. Rep. Such an agreement is in disregard of the policy of the law, and if. operative annuls the law itself, so far as it affects the debt sought to be recovered. If upheld, the homestead exemption would be a blank upon our statute-book, and deprive the destitute of all claim they have to its beneficent provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">A stipulation in a note never to take the benefit of the bankrupt law, or that land should be forfeited and never after subject to redemption, could not be enforced or work an estoppel. An agreement to waive this right is illegal and void ; must be regarded as made under a species of duress between parties in unequal circumstances, in which the creditor has great facility for gaining an unjust advantage over the oppressed debtor ; is liable to general abuse by creditors, which cannot be properly upheld by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Judge Eedfield\u2019s note in American Law Eegister, Dec., 1874, p. 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\u00a3 \u2018The law does not permit its process to be used to accomplish ends which its policy forbids, though the parties may, by a prospective contract, agree to such use.\u201d Dennis, Jr., in \u201cKnutter v. Newcomb,\u201d 31 Barbour, 170; 9 Howard, 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">I am full well aware of the delicacy of the task of hold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>ing an act of the legislature void, and enter upon it with reluctance and hesitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The courts sit not to revise or review legislative action, but to enforce legislative will; and in declaring what is the law, they must enforce the constitution as the paramount law whenever the legislative action comes in conflict with it. \u201cRice v. State,\u201d 7 Ind. 334; \u201cBloodgood v. Mohawk and Hudson Railroad Company,\u201d 18 Wend. 53; \u201cCooley on Cons. Limitations,\u201d page 160. Note 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">It is the duty of the court, in a proper case, so to declare. <em>Ita scrvpta lex </em>is imperative and controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">In the act under consideration, the legislature has undertaken to exercise a power which the people, by the constitution, have been careful to withhold, in providing for a \u201cwaiver of the homestead,\u201d in the face of a positive inhibition upon them, to \u2018 \u2018defeat or impair the benefits intended to be conferred\u201d thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">It is much to be regretted that the court of last resort in this state has not pronounced any opinion on this question. I regret it the more, since, by a singular coincidence, it has fallen to my lot to take the initiative in deciding several of the most delicate and difficult questions which have arisen under the new constitution, in advance of any expressed opinion of the supreme court, or any other circuit judge of the state. It is a relief to me to know that any error I may commit can be corrected by a higher tribunal. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">(Judge Dickinson then refers to Judge Bouldin\u2019s opinion in Sirely by, &amp;c., <em>v. </em>Campbell, &amp;c., 23 Gratt. 902, and says that an intimation is there given that if the requirement of the purchaser to waive the homestead exemption had prejudiced the appellant, the court of appeals would have corrected the decree in that respect.) \u2014 Ed.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Upon a review of the whole subject, yielding every doubt in favor of legislative power, so much of sec. 3 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>chap. 183 of Code of 1873, p. 1169, as provides for a \u201cwaiver of the homestead exemption,\u201d is to my mind so clearly intended to \u201cdefeat and impair the benefits intended to be conferred by the provisions of art. XI, sec. 5 of the constitution, I am constrained to regard it as unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\"><em>Note by the Court. </em>\u2014 The supreme court of Georgia has recently decided that, \u201cThe homestead (in this state) cannot be alienated even by order of court, except for the purpose of changing the investment. The act of the legislature which permits parties to waive the homestead, and to dispose of property which had been set apart, under the exemption law, was unconstitutional.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
