Fox appeals the journal entry entered December 14, 2016 in the Washington County Court of Common Pleas, whereby his amended complaint to terminate an oil and gas lease was dismissed with prejudice. In the first assignment\n   of error, Appellant asserts the trial court erred as a matter of law in failing to apply the implied covenant to conduct operations affecting his royalty interest with reasonable care and due diligence. In the second assignment of error, Appellant asserts the trial court erred as a matter of law in failing to apply the implied covenants to protect the lease from drainage and to explore further and reasonable development. Appellant's third assignment of error challenges the trial court's finding that Appellant was required to give 10 days' written notice of failure to pay shut in payments, before filing his complaint to terminate the lease. Having reviewed the record, we find the trial court's factual determination is supported by competent, credible evidence. Accordingly, we find no merit to Appellant's assignments of error and hereby affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant is a resident of Tennessee. Appellant's parents owned real property in Salem Township, Washington County, Ohio. He has experience working on oil and gas wells and has taught classes in oil and gas drilling and in the operations of oil and gas wells. Appellee Positron Energy Resources, Inc., is the owner of the deep well at issue in this case. Appellee Stonebridge Operating Co., LLC, is the operator of the subject well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In 1972, Appellant's parents granted a lease for the oil and gas mineral rights below the Berea Sand Formation. This leased tract of land was 113 acres. One well, the Bartlett-Fagg well, was drilled subject to the first lease. The Bartlett-Fagg well was drilled to a depth of 4,011 feet from the surface, and is considered a deep well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In 1978, a second lease, on a 116-acre tract, was granted by Appellant and his mother, now deceased. One well was drilled on the second lease. In 2000, Appellant and his mother deeded 29.803 acres of their property to Ernest and Shelby Farkas. Both wells are on property which Appellant and his mother deeded to the Farkases. However, Appellant's land is subject to the aforesaid leases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The wells are in close proximity. Appellant owns 86.357 acres of both original tracts. He seeks cancellation of the leases only as to the property he owns. The well pursuant to the second lease is not at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On April 3, 2014, Appellant filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that the first oil and gas lease terminated due to breach of implied covenants to reasonably develop, explore, and conduct all operations affecting Appellant's royalty interest with reasonable care and due diligence. In the alternative, Appellant sought a partial horizontal forfeiture of the lease. The parties engaged in written discovery and motion practice. The trial court found genuine issues of material fact precluded summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On October 26, 2016, the parties presented evidence at a bench trial. On December 14, 2016, the trial court issued a journal entry dismissing Appellant's complaint. The trial court stated it could not find a preponderance of evidence to support the allegations of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} This timely appeal followed. Where pertinent, additional facts will be set forth below. Appellant requests the trial court decision be reversed and the\n   first lease terminated for breach of the implied covenants. In the alternative, Appellant requests a partial horizontal forfeiture of the first lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"I.

By his twenties, he was engaged in work including well completion, casings, cement placement, well logging, perforating, and fracking. Appellant was hired by Hocking State College to teach oil and gas well drilling and production. He actually utilized a\n   working rotary rig on the campus of the college, physically drilling wells with student help, as well as classroom teaching.

There's a rise, a one inch steel riser pipe it looks, coming out of that with open valves, going in and out, and the pipe coming up has nothing on it. It's just open to the air.

Appellant stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"There's a-another-a condenser tank, another valve. The top valve in the center of the photo is clearly in the open position, and you can follow the piping over to the meter and then out of the meter and through an open pipe on the other side.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Appellant further explained that any gas being produced by the well would come out of the open place. He further described the absence of a separator at the site: \"Well, gas and oil, you would have a separator there on the site. * * * To separate any oil from gas or fluids that come up out of the well.\" When asked whether at the time the photograph was taken, \"If there was any gas being produced, this would show it's not connected to a line, is that right?\" Appellant responded: \"It doesn't appear that way to me.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Appellant also discussed Exhibit 13 as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"The main valve, coming out of the wellhead, the four-and-a-half inch casing, to a two inch swedge, (sic) there's a valve there that's clearly closed and the handle's been removed. And also, right next to it, on the discharge side, there's another two inch ball valve and the handle's been removed and it's in the off and closed position. * * * No gas can come out of the well, with those valves closed.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 19} To further support his contentions, Appellant submitted Exhibit 14, a photograph of the well drilled on the first lease, taken in September 2016. Appellant testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"I'd like to point out the eight-and-five-eighths surface casing, which is visible above-just above the conductor pipe, is rusted almost completely through. Heavy corrosion there that will eventually\n   turn into an environmental problem if it's not addressed.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Appellant concluded his testimony, indicating that from the year 2000 to the date he filed his complaint in 2014, the condition of the wells was as his testimony provided and his photographs depicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 21} At trial, Appellees' countered Appellant's evidence with the testimony of John Schneider, a petroleum engineer for Appellee Stonebridge. Schneider's work for Stonebridge is in engineering and field operations. He is in charge of pipeline and production operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Schneider testified he studied petroleum engineering at Marietta College and holds a degree. He has worked as a petroleum engineer for over 20 years, except during a \"down-turn\" in the industry between 1987 through 1994. Schneider owns 21 of his own wells and has \"hands on\" experience. The trial court accepted Schneider as an expert in drilling, recompleting wells, setting up production facilities, and maintaining wells and pipelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Generally, Schneider testified as to the operational status of the wells at issue. He testified he was familiar with both free-flowing wells. The Bartlett-Fagg well produces from the Devonian Shale (Ohio Shale). The wells are \"a short walk\" apart. Schneider identified Appellees' Exhibit H, a service record of routine maintenance work performed on the Bartlett-Fagg deep well. He testified to his knowledge, it produced only gas, not oil. He also identified Appellees' Exhibit I, a service record for the shallow well. That record indicated typical day-to-day maintenance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Schneider testified both wells flowed through a combined meter, known as a lease meter. The wells eventually moved upstream into a gathering system to a sales point. He testified the deep well is a \"pretty decent producer.\" Nothing in the documentation or other evidence suggested to him that the well had not been in production for the last 5-6 years or had not been selling gas for 5-6 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Eddy Biehl also testified on behalf of Appellees. He is employed by Stonebridge as a manager and serves as custodian of their records, including records acquired from previous companies. Biehl was also qualified as an expert in the gas and oil industry, and specifically in production operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Biehl's education and experience were also extensive. Biehl testified he is a geologist and has worked as a pumper, worked on a rig, and he has supervised drilling completions and productions. Biehl holds a bachelor's degree from Harvard in geological sciences with a major in economic geology. Biehl also serves on various local, state, and national organizations, in committee and board positions, developing and promoting better safety measures in the oil and gas industry. Biehl is often called upon as a consultant to offer perspective on the industry in Appalachia. He has served on the Ohio Oil and Gas Association and was appointed by Ohio's governor in the late 1980's to the Oil and Gas Regulatory Review Commissions. He has presented for the Department of Energy in Washington D.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Biehl testified at one time, there was a separate meter for the deep well. When Columbia Gas, who had a previous interest in the wells, filed bankruptcy, the meter was shut-off. As Schneider had testified, Biehl also explained the Bartlett-Fagg deep well was tied into the same branch of the gathering line as the shallow well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Biehl opined, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, that the deep well had economically produced during the entire time of operation. He further testified there is a whole range of production\n   methods and an operator determines what is best, based on the actual well. Biehl's testimony conflicted with Appellant's, as to the need for an apparatus called a pump jack. Appellant had testified there was no pump jack on either well, which caused him speculation as to whether oil could be produced. However, Biehl testified there was nothing to justify installing a pump jack. Biehl explained here, the prior production method actually reduced the amount of production. Therefore, Stonebridge removed the pump jack and actually improved the well performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Biehl further testified that the well produced in paying quantities and had done so the entire time Stonebridge operated it. Based upon his review of prior records, the well had also produced in paying quantities prior to that time. Biehl testified he had analyzed state records as to production levels for similar shale wells as to the Bartlett-Fagg well. He testified the Bartlett-Fagg well was in the upper half of performance for similar Devonian Shale wells in the State of Ohio.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 30} On cross-examination, Biehl admitted he had never done an analysis of the income on the deep well versus the cost of maintaining the well. Biehl was also asked about work done on the well in October 2016, approximately 3 weeks prior to trial. Biehl explained that when he reviewed Appellant's sworn affidavit that the well was full of water, he became concerned and wanted to verify the status of the well. In doing so, he learned the well was not full of water. However, while the wellhead was torn apart, he went ahead and re-plumbed it and installed flow meters on it in order to visually check it more easily. He testified the work done had no effect on well production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Appellees argue the evidence presented supported the trial court's findings of lack of breach of the implied covenants. We agree. The trial court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   \"The Plaintiff is concerned about the lack of certain production fixtures at these well sites. In fact, these are solely gas wells and do not produce oil. When Columbia Gas went bankrupt to get out from under these leases and similar leases on other wells, the Defendant tied these two wells together and then fed the gas into one of the Defendant's pipelines. The Defendant's pipeline has a compressor on its line so the gas from these and other low pressure wells can flow freely into its line. This compressor reduces the line pressure. The wells are metered where they go into the line, not at the well head.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   The Defendants' records show that maintenance has been performed on these wells. Both of the Defendants' witnesses have extensive education, experience and training in all aspects of the oil and gas industry. They belong to numerous professional organizations. As noted above, these are free flowing wells. They are tied into each other. There is old plumbing on the wells that has never been removed. Since the Columbia bankruptcy they have flowed through one meter. The Defendants checked the corporate records prior to purchasing these wells and those records showed continuous production. The State of Ohio's records are incomplete. Some records have been lost and some were disposed of because they blocked a fire exit. These wells are in the top 50% of the Defendant's\n   wells in production and profitability. They cost little to operate.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 32} In his brief, Appellant also asserts there was no economic benefit to him from the two wells. At trial, Appellant offered Defendant's Exhibit M, a composite of copies of returned royalty checks. Essentially, Appellant testified the wells had never been profitable in any way. He denied receiving royalties from the Appellees in 16 years. However, he acknowledged his mother, who died in 2008, may have received royalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 33} At trial, Appellees also disputed Appellant's assertion regarding the royalty payments, pointing to evidence of payment and Appellant's correspondence with Appellees to insure payment after Appellant's mother's death. On cross-examination, Appellant was confronted with several exhibits compiled by Appellees: F, G, and J. Appellant identified and acknowledged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   1) Exhibit F, a 2008 letter from him to Jennifer Duty, an employee of Stonebridge. The letter advised Stonebridge to send royalty checks \"if there are checks\" to his mother to avoid \"check endorsement complications\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   2) Exhibit G, correspondence to Jennifer Duty, advising that his mother had died and providing a death certificate; and,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   3) Exhibit J, a group of documents of correspondence to Stonebridge, including a tax form he signed. He acknowledged the purpose of the tax form was \"probably for taxes on production.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 34} However, after identifying the documents, Appellant continued to maintain he did not remember receiving royalty checks from Stonebridge and did not remember giving his attorney royalty checks to return to Stonebridge, although it could have happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Biehl provided additional testimony as to the royalty issue. Biehl identified Appellees' Exhibit M, a letter from Appellant in September 2013 returning 6 royalty checks for production and royalties off the Bartlett-Fagg deep well. Biehl testified Stonebridge had mailed royalty checks to Appellant from 2010 until the ones returned in 2013. He testified quite a number of checks were sent and all but one were cashed. Biehl also identified Appellees' Exhibit E, a request of change of payee from the estate of Laura Bartlett to Appellant in 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Appellees argue the record was sufficient to support a finding that Appellant derived economic benefit from the wells. We agree. On this issue, the trial court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \"The Plaintiff asserted in his testimony in his case in chief that he had not received royalty checks in the last 16 years. This testimony was not supported in other testimony given in this case. * * * In fact, the Plaintiff has no knowledge of what monies his mother got under these leases. When his father died he had all checks sent to his mother, including those for his interest in these leases. * * * There are gaps in the Plaintiff's knowledge of past production and royalty payments. He admits he doesn't know what was and wasn't paid to his mother.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 37} In conclusion, the trial court heard conflicting evidence and found that the well at issue was in production and in proper repair. The trial court also agreed that Appellant derived an economic benefit from the well. We are mindful of the presumption in favor of the finder of fact. In particular, we observe the trial court's comment regarding credibility of the witnesses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \"In the Defendant's final cross examination of the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff admitted\n   that * * * he believed that the testimony on the Defendant's operations manager, Mr. John Schneider, a petroleum engineer, was truthful. The Plaintiff also admitted at trial that the affidavits he submitted in support of his Motion for Summary Judgment in this action were not correct.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 38} For the foregoing reasons, we find competent credible evidence supports the trial court's judgment. We do not find the fact-finder clearly lost its way or created a manifest miscarriage of justice necessitating reversal of the judgment. As such, we overrule the first assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Appellant argues the lease covered 113 acres and only one well was drilled, on the acreage no longer owned by him. Appellant also argues he is not even entitled to royalties from the well. Appellant concludes that forfeiture or cancellation of the lease is compelling, in order to do justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 42} In response, Appellees point out Appellant has neither, in writing or verbally, complained about the lack of development of his property nor requested further development. Notably, Appellees interpret Appellant's argument herein as an attempt to compel partial horizontal forfeiture of the deep rights. Appellees point to Appellant's testimony that he has made an attempt to sever the \"deep rights,\" and to lease the \"deep\" horizons, ignoring the clear precedent of the\n   <em>\n    Collins-McGregor\n   </em>\n   decision,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Regarding partial horizontal forfeiture of Appellant's lease, the trial court's decision spoke to the authority of the\n   <em>\n    Collins-McGregor\n   </em>\n   decision as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \"There are two leases involved in this case.

These wells are close in proximity. Both well heads are physically on the land that was severed and are not on the Plaintiff's land. However, his land is subject to the aforesaid leases. Both of these leases are in their secondary terms. The issue for this Court is whether there has been continuous production in paying quantities. The Plaintiff now owns 86.357 acres of both the original leased tract of 113 acres on the first lease and 116 acres on the second lease. He seeks cancellation of the leases only as to the property he owns. The well on the first lease is a shallow well\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and was drilled to a depth of 4,011 feet and the well and the second lease is simply referred to as a \"shallow well.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   The shallow well that was drilled pursuant to the second lease is not at issue in this case.

However, the thrust of the trial court's decision in favor of Appellees was that Appellant failed to prove the well at issue was non-producing. The trial court's finding that Appellant failed to provide written notice was \"an additional basis,\" for dismissal of Appellant's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 52} The notice requirement arises from certain language in Paragraph 3 of the parties' lease agreement.

Our role is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the parties, which is presumed to lie in the contract language.\n   <em>\n    Arnott,\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. In our context, \"[t]he rights and remedies of the parties to an oil or gas lease must be determined by the terms of the written instrument\" and \"[s]uch leases are contracts, and the terms of the contract with the law applicable to such terms must govern the rights and remedies of the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Collins-McGregor,supra,\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12, quoting\n   <em>\n    Harris v.

The parties appear to agree that the language of the shut in clause provides that if the lessor has not been receiving payment for non-production, lessor has to provide written notice by registered mail, 10 days prior to filing suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant argues that he was not obligated to give the required notice because there is no evidence in the record indicating a lack of transmission facilities requiring Appellees to make shut in payments. Appellees point to Appellant's admission that he demanded no payments of any kind, despite evidence that he corresponded with Appellees frequently over other issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 54} The trial court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   \"Additionally, the lease at question (the deep well) contains a provision that the lessor (i.e. the Plaintiff) make a demand for delay or shut in payments if the lessor objects to an issue of payment. The Plaintiff offered no evidence that such a demand was ever made.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Appellant admitted he never gave written notice. The trial court found the well at issue was in its secondary term and was producing in paying quantities. Given the trial court's findings that Appellant's lease was not forfeited for lack of production, the notice provision applied. And, Appellant admitted he did not provide notice. Therefore, the trial court did not err in its finding that Appellant failed to give requisite notice prior to filing his complaint. Accordingly, we find no merit to Appellant's third assignment of error and it is\n   hereby overruled.

The Supreme Court held that the lessee's breach forfeited all but the 40-acre tract associated with its producing well. In light of significant further efforts necessary to develop the resources and the amount of unexploited acreage, the trial court reasoned the lessee's financial and operating difficulties would render a mere damage award inadequate; thus \"forfeiture of lessee's interest is warranted in order to assure the development of the land and the protection of lessor's interests.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Beer, supra,\n    </em>\n    at 61 Ohio St.2d at 122,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=399%20N.E.2d%201227\">\n     399 N.E.2d 1227\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Williams, Oil and Gas Law, Vol. 8 Manual of Terms, defines a shut in well as a producing well that is closed down.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gelb. v.Santa Fe Drilling Co.,\n    </em>\n    4th Dist.
