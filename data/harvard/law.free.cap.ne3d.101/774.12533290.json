In August 2015, Flynn requested documents from plaintiff, the City of Danville (the City), pertaining to the Danville Housing Task Force (Housing Task Force). The City denied Flynn's request, and he sought administrative review with defendant, the office of the Illinois Attorney General. The Attorney General subsequently issued a binding opinion, finding that the City improperly denied Flynn's request. The City then sought administrative review in Sangamon County circuit court, which affirmed the decision of the Attorney General.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 The City appeals, arguing that (1) the Housing Task Force is not a \"public body\" subject to FOIA disclosure requirements and (2) the requested records do not constitute \"public records\" as defined by the Act. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 In December 2014, the Housing Task Force convened to identify housing issues and trends in the city of Danville, Illinois. Eighteen community members were asked to participate in the Housing Task Force in addition to four City employees. The Housing Task Force met several times between December 2014 and July 2015. At these meetings, the Housing Task Force discussed the availability of public housing and the population loss that the City had experienced. The objective of the Housing Task Force was to develop strategic goals and objectives to improve housing conditions within the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 In July 2015, the City's engineering and urban services department sent a memorandum to the City's council members. The memorandum summarized the Housing Task Force's findings and recommendations, stating, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"With the assistance of city staff, we have extensively reviewed existing data associated with our neighborhoods, our public housing authority, and our city's policies. This document is not intended to be a comprehensive housing analysis; rather, it is a conglomeration of current issues, goals, and recommendations to alleviate said issues. * * * We are now pleased to present to you our findings and recommendations for improvements.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 On July 24, 2015, the Housing Task Force submitted its final report to the city council, which was made available to the public. The introduction to the report stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Together, [the] goals, objectives and recommendations are intended to comprise the City's housing strategy for the 2015-2020 planning period, and will\n   guide daily decision-making by City officials and staff, while equipping citizens with the awareness of the housing programs that the City will be initiating to meet its overall housing goals.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 On August 31, 2015, Kevin Flynn, a private citizen, requested documents from the City pursuant to the Act ( 5 ILCS 140/11(e) (West 2014) ). Specifically, he requested the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"1. Please provide all meeting times, locations and meeting notices for the Danville Housing Task Force that completed the July 24, 2015 report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   2. Provide copies of all minutes, notes and documents created during the meetings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   3. Provide all communication[s], electronic or otherwise, between any member of said task force and any city of Danville employee, city staff or elected official.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 That same day, the City denied Flynn's request on the basis that \"the Housing Task Force is not a [p]ublic [b]ody and therefore not subject to FOIA.\" Flynn subsequently challenged the denial and sought administrative review with the Attorney General's Public Access Counselor. See\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 In a binding opinion dated December 15, 2015 (2015 Ill. Att'y Gen. Pub. Access Op. No. 15-014, at 1, http://foia.ilattorneygeneral.net/pdf/opinions/2015/15-014.pdf), the Attorney General found that the City \"violated the requirements of FOIA by improperly withholding records responsive to [Flynn's] FOIA request relating to the Danville Housing Task Force.\" The Attorney General noted that Flynn's request was submitted to the City, which was a public body. The Attorney General's opinion further stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[T]he Housing Task Force was organized by a City department to assist that department in planning the City's five-year housing strategy. The City's Corporation Counsel has confirmed that the City's [Danville Area Transportation Study] Director coordinated the Housing Task Force using City resources during business hours. Based on these facts, it is clear that records relating to the activities of City officials and employees who convened the Housing Task Force and who continue to work on its objectives pertain to the transaction of public business of the City.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Attorney General concluded that the requested records pertained to the public business of the City and were in the City's possession. As such, the records were subject to disclosure under the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 10 In January 2016, the City filed the underlying complaint seeking administrative review in the circuit court, alleging that the documents requested were not subject to disclosure. In October 2016, the City filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that the Housing Task Force was not a \"public body\" and the requested records were not \"public records\" as defined by the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 11 In February 2017, the circuit court denied the City's motion for summary judgment and granted the Attorney General's cross-motion for summary judgment, finding that the City had possession of the requested records and the FOIA request was properly made upon a public body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 12 This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 13 II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 14 Defendant argues on appeal that (1) the Housing Task Force is not a \"public body\" subject to FOIA disclosure requirements and (2) the requested records do not constitute \"public records\" as defined by the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 15 On review, the binding opinion issued by the Attorney General is considered a \"final decision of an administrative agency, for purposes of administrative review under the Administrative Review Law.\" See 5 ILCS 140/11.5 (West 2014). \"In an appeal from a final administrative decision, the applicable standard of review depends on whether the issue involves a question of fact, a question of law, or a mixed question of law and fact.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Champaign v.

The City argues on appeal that the Housing Task Force does not constitute a \"public body\" and thus it is not subject to the disclosure requirements under the Act. However, as the Attorney General explained in the binding opinion, Flynn submitted his FOIA request directly to the City-not the Housing Task Force. Thus, the relevant inquiry is whether the City, not the Housing Task Force, is a \"public body.\" Under the Act, the term \"public body\" expressly includes cities: \" 'Public body' means all legislative, executive, administrative, or advisory bodies of the State, state universities and colleges, counties, townships,\n   <em>\n    cities\n   </em>\n   , * * * committees, or commissions of this State, [and] any subsidiary bodies of any of the foregoing * * *.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=680%20N.E.2d%20374\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2(a).

Our holding today does not have the far-reaching implications that the City suggests. When a FOIA request is submitted to a public body and the requested record is possessed by the public body, the record is subject to disclosure only if it qualifies as a \"public record\" that pertains to public business. There is not an unrestricted right to examine all documents possessed by a public body. If a record possessed by a public body pertains to private information or falls under one of the other enumerated exemptions within section 7(1) of the Act, then its disclosure is not required by the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 25 III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 26 For the reasons stated, we affirm the circuit court's judgment affirming the Attorney General's binding opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 27 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Justices Holder White and DeArmond concurred in the judgment and opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
