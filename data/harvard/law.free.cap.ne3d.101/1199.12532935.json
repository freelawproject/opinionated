Defendant Liberty Mutual Insurance Company insured her home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Charles Lusher, Breech's grandson, was granted a power of attorney by Breech. Lusher retained the services of Defendant Finnicum Adjusting Company, Inc. to assist Breech in presenting a claim to Liberty Mutual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Lusher hired Defendant-Appellee First Response Restoration to put a tarp on the roof of Breech's home. While the tarp was on the roof, a dispute arose between Breech's representatives and Liberty\n   Mutual as to the coverage for the property damage and value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The parties were unable to resolve the claim for property damage to Breech's home. On April 22, 2015, Breech filed a complaint against Liberty Mutual in the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas. The complaint was removed to federal court and dismissed. On February 12, 2016, Breech filed a complaint in the Stark County Court of Common Pleas against Defendants Liberty Mutual, Stephen Johnson, Finnicum, Steven Hillman, James Garrity, and First Response. Breech alleged First Response negligently applied the roof tarp to her home. Breech claimed breach of contract and bad faith against Liberty Mutual and employees. As to Finnicum and its employees, Breech claimed breach of contract, fraud, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, civil conspiracy, and violations of the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The trial court set the matter for mediation on August 25, 2016. In the Stark County Court of Common Pleas, a court mediator conducts the mediation. Lusher and counsel represented Breech at the mediation. Breech was unable to resolve her claims against Liberty Mutual and Finnicum. As to First Response, the \"Report of Mediation\" stated, \"A mediation conference took place on the 25th day of August, 2016. The result of the conference is as follows: 1. Case settled CONTINGENT on the following terms: CONFIDENTIAL.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On October 17, 2016, First Response filed a Motion to Enforce the Settlement Agreement. In the motion, First Response provided details of its understanding of the settlement negotiations between Breech and First Response. First Response stated that at the mediation, Breech agreed to settle her claims and release First Response in exchange for a confidential amount of money to be paid by Crum &amp; Forster Insurance Company on behalf of its insured, First Response. The adjuster for Crum &amp; Forster participated in the mediation via telephone. After the mediation, counsel for First Response emailed counsel for Breech a draft settlement release. Counsel for Breech objected to the draft release because it failed to include a confidentiality clause. Counsel for First Response agreed to include confidentiality language. Breech did not sign the release. Counsel for the parties spoke again and counsel for Breech requested additional changes to the release. The changes included revised language as to the release of Crum &amp; Forster. Counsel for Breech stated his client would not agree to release Crum &amp; Forster from liability due to concerns that Crum &amp; Forster insured another party, currently unknown, involved in Breech's cause of action. Counsel for First Response offered to draft a release that would release Crum &amp; Forster only in its capacity as the insurer to First Response. Counsel for Breech stated his client would not sign the release document that included language releasing Crum &amp; Forster of its liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Breech responded on October 24, 2016. Breech argued that at mediation, Breech agreed only to release First Response. Crum &amp; Forster was not a party to the action merely because it was the insurer of First Response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The trial court held an oral hearing on November 10, 2016. William Harter, counsel for Liberty Mutual, testified first on behalf of First Response. He had no knowledge of the terms of the alleged settlement agreement between Breech and First Response. He testified that based on his experience in insurance defense work, it was customary for the insurer to be released when the insurer pays a settlement on behalf of the insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} John Farnan, counsel for First Response, testified over the objection of Breech. Farnan was present at the mediation as counsel for First Response. He testified that it was understood and accepted as common practice in litigation that the client and the entity paying the money were released after a settlement. He recalled the negotiations between counsel for Breech and himself:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   So we spent hours, Mr. Seebohm and I, going back and forth negotiating; and I tried to tailor it as narrowly as possible to accommodate the concerns that he expressed as relayed by Mr. Lusher, her POA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   So for that reason we offered to limit it to this claim, this insured, on this claim only.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   * * * We are only asking the Court to confirm that * * * he is releasing First Response Restoration and the paying insurer in its capacity as the insurer of this particular claim that we have been sued on. Nothing else.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   I am willing to limit it to that and that's it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   For that reason I am here because I couldn't get that agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (T. 23-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Farnan was asked by counsel for Breech, \"Did we at any time during the [mediation] discuss Crum &amp; Forster being released from this case?\" Farnan answered, \"We did not discuss who was going to be released at all is my recollection. * * We also didn't discuss whose names were going to be on the release. * * * We didn't discuss the timing of the payment. All those things were understood between experienced counsel in the case both from the Plaintiff's side and the Defense side.\" (T. 29-30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Neither Breech nor her power of attorney, Lusher, testified at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On November 18, 2016, the trial court issued a redacted judgment entry (omitting the settlement amount) and a judgment entry filed under seal (including the confidential settlement amount). In its judgment entry, the trial court granted the motion to enforce the settlement. It acknowledged the parties disputed whether Crum &amp; Forster should be released. The trial court found the confidential mediation report did not contain any details of the settlement agreement. It relied on the testimony of Farnan that the mediation report was not a fully integrated contract, it did not contain all the terms necessary to effectuate a settlement, and the parties anticipated a formal written release. Breech did not present any contrary evidence as to what occurred at mediation; therefore, the trial court found the parole evidence rule did not bar the consideration of Farnan's testimony as to the terms of the settlement agreement. The trial court concluded that the parties entered into a settlement agreement at mediation and the release of Crum &amp; Forster was one of the terms of the settlement agreement. In its judgment entry, the trial court recited the terms of the settlement agreement, which included a release of Crum &amp; Forster. It ordered Crum &amp; Forster pay Breech the settlement amount within ten days of the judgment entry. The judgment entry did not contain Civ.R. 54(B) language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On December 8, 2016, First Response filed a motion requesting the trial court dismiss Breech's claims against First Response. In the motion, First Response stated that Breech received a draft of the settlement agreement but Breech would not sign the agreement. Breech also would not agree to dismiss First Response from the action. In its motion, First Response states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   This refusal leaves First Response in the position of having fully funded a\n   settlement, but unable to get a signed release or dismissal. Given that the terms of the release are specified in the Court's order, and that order is an interlocutory order, it cannot be appealed until the end of the case, when the plaintiff's claims against the other defendant, Liberty Mutual, are resolved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Motion, Dec. 8, 2016). First Response stated it would honor the settlement if the trial court would dismiss it from the action with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On December 22, 2016, the trial court issued a judgment entry dismissing Breech's claims against First Response. The judgment entry stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   In a November 18, 2016 Judgment Entry, after an evidentiary hearing, the Court found that plaintiff Lois Breech fully settled all of her claims against defendant First Response and the Court's November 18, 2016 Order specified the terms of the settlement. Since that time, no one disputes that defendant First Response's insurer, Crum &amp; Forster, fully funded the settlement that the Court found existed between Plaintiff Lois Breech and defendant First Response. Accordingly, the Court finds defendant First Response's Motion well taken and hereby orders all of plaintiff Lois Breech's claims against defendant First Response are hereby dismissed, \"with prejudice\", with each such party to bear her/its own cost.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Judgment Entry, Dec. 22, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Breech filed a Notice of Appeal on January 23, 2017 stating she was appealing the December 22, 2016 judgment entry. No other trial court order is referenced in the notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On January 31, 2017, Breech dismissed without prejudice her claims against Liberty Mutual. Her claims against the remaining parties had been previously dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Breech raises two Assignments of Error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 19} \"I.

Her second Assignment of Error contends the trial court committed plain error when it allowed counsel for First Response testify at the hearing on its motion to enforce the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Before we consider Breech's Assignments of Error, we must first address whether we have jurisdiction to consider these Assignments of Error. Breech's arguments both relate to the trial court's judgment entry issued on November 18, 2016. First Response argues that Breech's Assignments of Error are not properly before this court because Breech's Notice of appeal does not indicate that she seeks to appeal from the trial court's November 18, 2016 interlocutory order granting the motion to enforce the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 23} App.R. 3(A) states, \"An appeal as of right shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the trial court within the time allowed by [App.R.] 4.\" App.R. 3(D) provides in pertinent part that the \"notice of appeal shall specify the party or parties taking the appeal; shall designate the judgment, order or part thereof appealed from; and shall name the court to which the appeal is taken.\" Ohio appellate courts have jurisdiction to review only final appealable orders of lower courts within their districts.\n   <em>\n    Pla v.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Conley\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist. Stark No. 2004CA00068,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004-Ohio-7057\">\n    2004-Ohio-7057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%202980361\">\n    2004 WL 2980361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    rev'd on other grounds\n   </em>\n   , we held that where the notice of appeal referenced only the judgment entry granting summary judgment in favor of appellee, under App.R. 3(D) the appellant could not also argue the trial court erred when it granted appellee's leave to plead and denied appellant's motion for default judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.

The appellant filed a post-sentence motion to withdraw his guilty plea and a petition for post-conviction relief. On November 25, 2003, the trial court denied the motion to withdraw the plea and petition for post-conviction relief. On December 5, 2003, the appellant filed a notice of appeal of his conviction and sentence. In his assignments of error, the appellant argued the trial court erred in denying his post-sentence motion to withdraw his guilty plea and ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Because the appellant did not file a notice of appeal of the November 25, 2003 judgment entry denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, we applied App.R. 3(D) and found we were without jurisdiction to review the November 25, 2003 judgment entry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 25} A review of Ohio case law, however, shows a different approach to the appeal of interlocutory orders and the application of App.R. 3(D). It begins with\n   <em>\n    Grover v. Bartsch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3851268\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/170/188/\">\n    170 Ohio App.3d 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006-Ohio-6115\">\n    2006-Ohio-6115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=866%20N.E.2d%20547\">\n    866 N.E.2d 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2nd Dist.). In\n   <em>\n    Grover\n   </em>\n   , the appellee filed a motion to dismiss the appellant's complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and as\n   being outside the statute of limitations. The appellee simultaneously filed a motion for protective order, which the trial court granted. The trial court later granted the motion to dismiss and the appellant appealed. In their notice of appeal, the appellant referenced only the judgment of dismissal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. In the appellant's first assignment of error, however, the appellant stated the trial court erred in granting the protective order. The appellee argued the appellant failed to raise the protective order in the notice of appeal and was therefore barred from raising the matter on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Second District Court of Appeals found the appellee's argument lacked merit. It held, \"Interlocutory orders, such as most discovery orders, are merged into the final judgment. Thus, an appeal from the final judgment includes all interlocutory orders merged with it, such as the trial court's protective order.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 26} The Tenth District Court of Appeals next examined the application of App.R. 3(D) to an interlocutory order in\n   <em>\n    Beatley v.

In their first assignment of error, however, the appellants challenged the March 19, 2008 entry granting summary judgment in favor of appellees. The appellees argued the court should limit the appeal to the July 18, 2008 judgment because the appellants did not designate the March 19, 2008 judgment entry as an order being appealed. The Tenth District declined to limit the appellant's appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.

Case law, however, requires a narrower characterization of a term of an agreement and the trial court's authority to enforce it.

In this case, the limited evidence demonstrates the essential terms of this settlement agreement were the payment of money to end litigation and release of First Response and Crum &amp; Forster from further litigation. The evidence shows there was no meeting of the minds as to the release of Crum &amp; Forster from further litigation. First Response admitted it could not reach an agreement with Breech as to this term of the settlement agreement. While there was testimony that the release of the insurer is common practice, that it is common practice does not make the release of the insurer a less essential term of this agreement. Because the release was an essential term of the settlement agreement to which the parties could not agree, we find the trial court erred when it fashioned the release of Crum &amp; Forster in the November 18, 2016 judgment entry granting the motion to enforce the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Breech's first Assignment of Error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The trial court properly determined the parties intended to be bound by the agreement and the trial court was free to fashion the release terms to restrict the scope of the release of Crum &amp; Forster in accordance with the acknowledgment set forth by Attorney Farnan at the hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    I would also overrule Appellant's second assignment of error.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
