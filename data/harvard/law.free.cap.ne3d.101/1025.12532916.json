Larry Flynt's Hustler Club, appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas affirming orders of appellee-appellee, Ohio State Liquor Control Commission (\"commission\"), issued on September 9 and October 19, 2016 and April 25, 2017. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant operates an adult night club in Cleveland, Ohio. At all relevant times, appellant held a valid D-5 and D-6 liquor permit issued by the Ohio division of Liquor Control (\"division\"). According to appellant, the club operates a bar on the premises where patrons can sit and purchase alcoholic beverages. In addition to the bar area, the club contains a stage featuring female entertainers performing choreographed erotic dance. The club also contains a VIP area where entertainers can perform personal one-on-one dances for patrons who pay a fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On August 29, 2015, liquor control agent Kevin J. Cesaratto entered the club posing as a patron, and he paid the required fee for a personal one-on-one dance in the VIP area. According to Cesaratto's September 3, 2015 investigation report, during the private dance, the female entertainer \"expos[ed] her naked breasts, * * * rubbed her bare nipple over [his] lips * * * and pulled away the clothing exposing her vagina [and] exposing her anus.\" Liquor control agents subsequently cited appellant for two violations of Ohio Adm.Code 4301:1-1-52, otherwise known as \"Rule 52.\" Agents cited appellant for prohibited conduct in knowingly or willfully allowing dancers to \"[a]ppear in a state of nudity,\" in violation of Ohio Adm.Code 4301:1-1-52(B)(2), and to \"[e]ngage in sexual activity,\" in violation of Ohio Adm.Code 4301:1-1-52(B)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The commission held a hearing on August 11, 2016 regarding the two charges\n   stemming from the August 29, 2015 investigation, as well as two other charges arising out of a similar investigation on February 7, 2015. As a result of the hearing, appellant denied the August 29, 2015 charge alleging nudity but stipulated to the facts contained in agent Ceseratto's report. The commission dismissed the second charge of \"sexual activity\" arising from the August 29, 2015 investigation. The commission also dismissed the two charges arising out of the February 7, 2015 investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On August 25, 2016, the commission issued an order finding that appellant committed one violation of Rule 52 and imposing the following penalty:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   It is the order of this Commission that the Permit Holder has the option to either pay a forfeiture in the amount of $100,000.00, or the permit will be REVOKED if the Permit Holder shall elect to pay the forfeiture, the Permit Holder has twenty-one (21) days after the date on which this order is sent to pay the full amount of the forfeiture.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Order at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The commission subsequently denied appellant's motion for reconsideration on October 19, 2016. On November 1, 2016, appellant filed a notice of appeal to the common pleas court pursuant to R.C. 119.12. The notice of appeal alleges the following errors by the commission:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The grounds for the appeal are that the decisions below are not supported by reliable, substantial and probative evidence; that the decisions below are contrary to law; that Regulation 4301:1-1-52 is unconstitutional on its face and as applied under Art. I, \u00a7 11 of the Ohio Constitution ; that the forfeiture imposed is excessive and far greater than forfeitures imposed on permit holders that are similarly situated or whose violations were more egregious and denies HDV equal protection of the laws, as well as procedural and substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Notice of Appeal at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On November 4, 2016, the trial court stayed the commission's order pending appeal. On December 19, 2016, appellant moved the trial court to supplement the administrative record with evidence in support of its contention that Rule 52 is unconstitutional. On April 25, 2017, the trial court issued a decision and entry affirming the commission's order and denying appellant's motion to supplement the administrative record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellant timely appealed to this court from the trial court judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellant sets forth the following three assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   1. Rule 52 is unconstitutional on its face and as applied under Art. I, \u00a7 11 of the Ohio Constitution, and the court below erred in concluding otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   2. The court erred in sustaining the penalty imposed by the Commission that HDV pay $100,000 or have its license revoked because the penalty violated HDV's right to due process and equal protection under the United States and Ohio Constitutions and because it was not supported by substantial, reliable and probative evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   3. The Court erred in denying HDV the opportunity to supplement the administrative record at an evidentiary hearing on the issue of the unconstitutionality of Rule 52 on its face under Art. I, \u00a7 11 of the Ohio Constitution,\n   and of the unconstitutionality of the penalty that it imposed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

LEGAL ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. First Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In appellant's first assignment of error, appellant contends the trial court erred when it concluded that Rule 52 does not violate Article I, Section 11 of the Ohio Constitution either on its face or as applied to appellant. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Rule 52 contains the following prohibition against improper conduct by permit holders:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (B) Prohibited activities; no permit holder, his agent, or employee shall knowingly or willfully allow in and upon his licensed permit premises any persons to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (2) Appear in a state of nudity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Ohio Adm. Code 4301:1-1-52(A)(2) defines nudity as \"the showing of the human male or female genital, pubic area or buttocks with less than a fully opaque covering; the showing of the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any part of the nipple and/or areola.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 15} As noted above, appellant stipulated to the investigator's report, which sets forth sufficient facts to support the commission's finding that appellant committed a violation of Ohio Adm.Code 4301:1-1-52(B)(2). Appellant does not deny that conduct amounting to a violation of Rule 52 occurred. Rather, appellant challenges the constitutionality of Rule 52 on grounds that the rule violates appellant's right to freedom of expression guaranteed by Article I, Section 11 of the Ohio Constitution. According to appellant, Rule 52 is an unconstitutional prior restraint on appellant's freedom of expression both on its face and as applied to appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Constitutionality of Rule 52 Under the United States Constitution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Appellant concedes that Rule 52, in its current form, has previously withstood constitutional scrutiny under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. In\n   <em>\n    WCI, Inc. v.

Cheeks, appealed a decision of the common pleas court affirming the commission's order requiring it to either pay a forfeiture of $25,000 or lose its liquor license due to a violation of Rule 52. In\n   <em>\n    WCI\n   </em>\n   , an investigator for the Department of Public Safety reported while he was posing as a customer, one of appellant's dancers knowingly touched him while nude or semi-nude and that she subsequently led the investigator to a table located at the entrance of the private area where she gave another employee an undetermined amount of money. Appellant was cited for a violation of Ohio Adm.Code 4301:1-1-52(B)(2), nudity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Appellant appealed the penalty imposed by the commission on several grounds, including the constitutionality of Rule 52 under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The common pleas court found that Rule 52 was constitutional and the commission's order was supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and was in accordance with law. In disposing of appellant's third assignment of error on appeal, this court noted that \"[t]he question of whether Rule 52 violates the First and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution has already been settled.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.

We find no merit in appellant's argument that the Ohio Constitution provides more protection to expressive conduct in the form of choreographed erotic dance simply because it includes the words \"restrain or abridge,\" as opposed to simply the word \"abridge.\" As previously noted, though nude dancing is recognized as a\n   protected form of expressive conduct, \"it falls only within the outer ambit of the First Amendment's protection.\"\n   <em>\n    34 N.

Either the cameras were malfunctioning or were not being monitored.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%20832127\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The investigator's report stated that at the end of the private dance the performer led the investigator to a table that was located at the entrance of the private area where she gave another employee an undetermined amount of money. (Public Safety Report at 2.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   The Commission also noted at the hearing that WCI was recently before them for actions that occurred on January 3, 2013 in which WCI's liquor license would have been revoked unless they paid a $10,000 forfeiture. (Tr. at 19.) The evidence indicates that the Commission has required substantial forfeitures from WCI before for similar violations. The Commission chose to impose an increased forfeiture of $25,000 rather than a $10,000 forfeiture that was imposed less than one year before.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 40} The facts are similar in this case. Here, as in\n   <em>\n    WCI\n   </em>\n   , appellant stipulated to the facts contained in the investigation report. Appellant does not deny one of its dancers appeared in a state of nudity while providing a one-on-one dance for Cesaratto in the club's VIP area. Appellant does not deny such conduct violated Ohio Adm.Code 4301:1-1-52(B)(2) prohibiting appellant from knowingly or willfully allowing dancers to \"[a]ppear in a state of nudity.\" Though the commission found appellant guilty of only one violation, the unrefuted information contained in Cesaratto's investigation report establishes that additional conduct occurred on appellant's premises that arguably supported a finding of further Rule 52 violations. For example, Cesaratto's investigation report establishes that appellant's dancer engaged in the following conduct: repeatedly \"straddled his legs, sat on [his] groin and rubbed back and forth simulating a sexual act\"; \"started gyrating her hips in a circular motion * * * simulating a sexual act\"; rubbed her exposed nipple on his lips; rubbed her finger on her clothed anus and vagina; went to her knees in front of Cesaratto and proceeded to rub her lips over his clothed penis while \"humming to make a vibrating sensation\"; and rubbed her head on his clothed penis. (Sept. 1, 2015 Investigation\n   Report at 1.) After performing these activities during two songs, the dancer asked for $60, which Cesarrato paid. Such conduct is far well beyond simply allowing a dancer to \"[a]ppear in a state of nudity,\" and it involved sexual touching.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 41} The record also contains evidence appellant has been cited for four Rule 52 violations in the past four years. In addition to the two citations issued by the division arising from the August 2015 investigation, an investigation in February 2015 resulted in two citations, one for nudity and the other for sexual activity. Though the commission did not find appellant guilty of those violations, the fact remains the division cited appellant for similar Rule 52 violations roughly seven months prior to the violation at issue. Additionally, the record shows the division issued citations to appellant for Rule 52 violations on June 14, July 17, and October 24, 2014. Appellant acknowledges the three separate violations were consolidated for purposes of punishment, and appellant paid a forfeiture amount of $10,000 in lieu of revocation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 42} In the administrative hearing on the Rule 52 violation arising from the February investigation, appellant maintained it had taken steps following the 2014 violations to educate staff and to increase surveillance of the VIP area to ensure compliance with the relevant regulations. According to appellant's manager, Jadranko Cvetovac, there are real-time cameras monitoring virtually the entire club, including the VIP area, but the cameras do not record. Cvetovac testified that prior to the violations in 2014, a single employee monitored all the cameras from inside the camera room. In response to the chairperson's question regarding any additional measures taken subsequent to the 2014 violations, Cvetovac stated that one additional employee had been assigned to monitor the cameras from an iPad. Our review of the hearing transcript reveals, however, that appellant allows staff monitoring those cameras to receive tips from the dancers for referring customers. Neither of the two employees monitoring the cameras on August 29, 2015, recalled having observed the nudity violation detailed in Cesaratto's investigation report, even though the conduct described in the report occurred over the space of two song tracks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Based on the foregoing, we find that substantial, reliable, and probative evidence supports the commission's decision to revoke appellant's liquor permit or, in lieu of revocation, forfeiture. We acknowledge that the $100,000 forfeiture in this case is much steeper than the $10,000 forfeiture previously imposed by the commission for appellant's prior Rule 52 violations and the $25,000 forfeiture imposed by the commission for the Rule 52 violations in\n   <em>\n    WCI\n   </em>\n   .

Nevertheless, appellant asks this court to review the severity of the forfeiture under the due process and equal protection clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Appellant argues that this court, in reviewing the size of a forfeiture order issued by the commission, should apply the test courts apply when reviewing the validity of punitive damage awards in a civil proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. Gore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745877\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/559/\">\n    517 U.S. 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745877\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/559/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745877\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/559/\">\n    134 L.Ed.2d 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996) ;\n   <em>\n    Cooper Industries, Inc. v.

Appellant asks us to compare the size of the forfeiture in this case to other forfeiture orders issued by the commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 46} In\n   <em>\n    Lindner\n   </em>\n   , the commission revoked the permit holder's liquor permit because gambling had occurred on the premises. The permit holder admitted the violation but appealed to the common pleas court arguing that the sanction was excessive given the fact that the permit holder had no prior violations. The common pleas court found that substantial, reliable, and probative evidence supported the commission's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 47} In her appeal to this court, the permit holder argued that the penalty of revocation was too severe. In rejecting appellant's argument, this court made the following observations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   Having properly found the commission's order was supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence, the common pleas court had no authority to modify the penalty lawfully imposed by the commission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   As a practical matter, courts have no power to review penalties meted out by the commission. Thus, we have little or no ability to review a penalty even if it seems on the surface to be unreasonable or unduly harsh. Though she had no prior violations, appellant had her liquor license revoked, not suspended for a period of time. Perhaps the time to reconsider\n   <em>\n    Henry's Cafe\n   </em>\n   has arrived, but the Supreme Court of Ohio must be the court to do\n   that reconsideration. We, as an intermediate appellate court, are required to follow the syllabus of\n   <em>\n    Henry's Cafe\n   </em>\n   unless or until such reconsideration occurs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    Lindner\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 48} The Supreme Court of Ohio has not reconsidered the rule of law set forth in\n   <em>\n    Henry's Cafe\n   </em>\n   . Appellant's due process and equal protection arguments in this case are a thinly veiled attempt to circumvent the holding of the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Henry's Cafe\n   </em>\n   . As an intermediate appellate court, this court is required to follow the syllabus of\n   <em>\n    Henry's Cafe\n   </em>\n   unless or until such reconsideration occurs.\n   <em>\n    Lindner.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, we find that appellant's due process and equal protection challenges to the amount of the forfeiture are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Because we have found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that the commission's order was supported by substantial, reliable, and probative evidence and because the commission's order is in accordance with law, we overrule appellant's second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Third Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 50} In appellant's third assignment of error, appellant argues the trial court erred by denying appellant's motion to supplement the administrative record with evidence in support of its contention that Rule 52 is unconstitutionally overbroad. More particularly, appellant sought leave to submit evidence there are approximately 2,400 permit holders in Ohio and only about 1 percent of those permit holders operate adult-oriented businesses. According to appellant, some of those permit holders include theaters and opera houses that occasionally feature performances containing nudity. Appellant argues Rule 52 might be impermissibly applied to suppress speech of great artistic merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 51} This is precisely the argument this court considered and rejected in\n   <em>\n    34 N. Jefferson.\n   </em>\n   As we previously noted in\n   <em>\n    34 N. Jefferson\n   </em>\n   , \"the Supreme Court has vigorously enforced the requirement that a statute's overbreadth be substantial, * * * and cautioned that invalidation for overbreadth be deployed sparingly and only as a last resort. * * * [O]nly if a plaintiff demonstrates from the text of the statute and from actual fact that a substantial number of instances exist in which the law cannot be applied constitutionally, is facial invalidation on overbreadth grounds appropriate.\" (Internal citations and quotations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29. In\n   <em>\n    34 N. Jefferson\n   </em>\n   , this court agreed with the commission that the \"ability to conceive of arguably impermissible applications of the rule or statute to constitutionally protected expression does not amount to real or substantial overbreadth.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 52} For the reasons set forth in\n   <em>\n    34 N. Jefferson\n   </em>\n   , we hold the trial court did not err when it denied appellant's motion to supplement the administrative record. Accordingly, appellant's third assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Having overruled appellant's three assignments of error, we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   KLATT and BRUNNER, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Brunner, J., concurred as to the majority's resolution of appellant's first, third, and fourth assignments of error but dissented, in part, as to appellant's second assignment of error regarding the property rights of permit holders.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    This court did find that the provision in former Ohio Adm.Code 4301:1-1-52 pertaining to \"lewd activities\" was unconstitutionally overbroad.
