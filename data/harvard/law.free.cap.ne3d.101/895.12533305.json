On March 30, 2017, the Indiana Board of Tax Review issued a final determination that reviewed those appraisals and, ultimately, formulated its own value conclusion. Belterra and the Assessor have each separately appealed the Indiana Board's final determination, which the Court now affirms in part and reverses in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    RELEVANT FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Belterra owns and operates the Belterra Casino Resort in Florence, Indiana. For purposes of this appeal, the Resort consists of a Riverboat,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   a Hotel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   a Golf Course,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a total of 250.22 acres of land. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1811-23.) The vast majority of the Resort's total gross revenue is generated by gaming. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   generally Cert. Admin. R. at 1950-53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During the years at issue, the Assessor's original assessment valued the Resort as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-12\"><em>2009:</em> $109,276,900 <em>2010:</em> $108,775,300 <em>2011:</em> $108,226,700 <em>2012:</em> $ 92,505,200 <em>2013:</em> $ 95,843,400 <em>2014:</em> $ 93,170,100</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 12 \u00b6 10, 1827,\n   4186-87, 4194-95, 4199-4200, 4205-06, 4211-12, 4217-18.) Believing those values to be too high, Belterra initiated appeals with the Switzerland County Property Tax Assessment Board of Appeals (PTABOA). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 4189, 4197, 4202, 4208, 4214, 4220.) On June 24, 2015, Belterra transitioned its appeals to the Indiana Board.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 4183.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In May of 2016, the Indiana Board conducted a consolidated hearing on all of Belterra's appeals. For purposes of the hearing, Belterra and the Assessor agreed to litigate only the Resort's 2009 and 2014 assessments, stipulating that the 2010 through 2013 assessments could then be determined with a trending formula based on the finally-determined 2009 and 2014 assessed values. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 4231-32.) Consequently, both Belterra and the Assessor's evidentiary presentations consisted of appraisals valuing the Resort for the 2009 and 2014 tax years alone. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 10 - 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Indiana Board Hearing: Belterra's Evidentiary Presentation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Belterra presented appraisals by Robert Herman and David Lennhoff. Herman, a member of the Appraisal Institute (MAI), valued the Riverboat and Golf Course while Lennhoff, also an MAI, valued the Hotel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 520, 979, 1659, 2337-39, 2783-84.) Both Herman and Lennhoff certified that their appraisals conformed to the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). (Cert. Admin. R. at 525-26, 984-85, 1660.) The appraisals indicated a total Resort value of $44,402,000 for 2009 and $48,675,000 for 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 28 \u00b6 69 n. 20, 357 \u00b6 12, 525-26, 984-85, 1660, 2636-41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Herman's Riverboat Valuations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   There are three generally accepted appraisal techniques for valuing real property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In valuing the Riverboat, Herman's appraisals employed two of them: the sales comparison approach and the cost approach. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 527, 986.) Under the sales comparison approach, Herman estimated the Riverboat's market value-in-use to be $4,500,000 in 2009 and $3,500,000 in 2014 based on the price it would have garnered on the open market. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 574-602, 1033-86.) Under the cost approach, Herman estimated the Riverboat's market value-in-use as $8,600,000 for 2009 and $3,700,000 for 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 604-16, 1088-1100.) Herman testified that he considered the third technique, the\n   income approach, to be inappropriate to value the Riverboat because the Riverboat had no \"discrete rental [income] stream\" and it did not constitute a substantial portion of the Resort's total going concern value. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 527, 986, 2370-74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Herman reconciled his two values for each year into one final value conclusion: $4,327,000 for 2009 and $3,500,000 for 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 617-18, 1100-02.) More specifically, he chose the lowest value of the two approaches indicated for each year (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the $4,500,000 for 2009 and the $3,500,000 for 2014), and then trended the 2009 value back to its valuation date of January 1, 2008. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 618, 1102.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   IND. CODE \u00a7 6-1.1-4-39.5(b) (2009) ; IND. CODE \u00a7 4-33-2-17 (2009) (together explaining that the assessed value of a riverboat was the lowest valuation determined under the cost, sales comparison, and income approaches); 50 IND. ADMIN. CODE 21-3-3(b) (2006) (indicating that prior to 2010, a property's March 1 assessment was to reflect a property's market value-in-use on January 1 of the preceding year) (repealed 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Herman's Golf Course Valuations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To value the Golf Course for 2009, Herman's appraisal used the cost approach and arrived at a value of $2,500,000. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 533, 535, 2519-30.) For 2014, however, Herman's appraisal used the income approach and arrived at a value of $3,000,000. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 985, 992, 1604-07, 2530-45, 2636-41.) Herman testified during the Indiana Board hearing that Indiana's Assessment Manual and Guidelines required him to value the Golf Course in 2009 using the cost schedules it provided, but for 2014, he used the income approach to value the Golf Course as mandated by the newly enacted Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-4-42. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 2518-19, 2531-33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Lennhoff's Hotel Valuation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Lennhoff's appraisal used the income approach to value the Hotel. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 1733-34 (explaining why he believed the sales comparison and cost approaches were not applicable to valuing the Hotel).) Under this approach, Lennhoff valued the Hotel at $37,575,000 for 2009 and $42,175,000 for 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1731, 1769.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Lennhoff explained that in completing his income approach, he treated the Hotel as if it were a \"stand-alone,\" full-service hotel owned and operated independently of the casino operation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1720-21 (stating that this premise was necessary to extract any value that solely benefitted the casino operation because Belterra operated the Hotel as a marketing tool for the casino and, thus, as a \"loss-leader\").) Moreover, he relied on market income and expense data published in national investor surveys for full-service hotels as opposed to the Hotel's actual operating data, given the Hotel's prevalent practice of \"comping\" rooms in order to generate gaming business. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 1739-49 (indicating that paying guests represented only a small percentage of the Hotel's total annual occupancy), 2885-86 (implying that had he used the Hotel's actual operating data, he would have produced a negative value), 2910 (stating that he put very little weight on the Hotel's actual income and expense figures).) Lennhoff noted that several other hotels that operated near casinos, but were owned independently from the casinos,\n   generally performed about the same as full-service hotels. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 2860-61, 2895-97, 2908-25.) Lennhoff acknowledged, however, that as a \"stand-alone\" hotel, the Hotel was \"super-adequate\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   over-improved) in relation to other full-service hotels. (Cert. Admin. R. at 1708, 1720-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Indiana Board Hearing: The Assessor's Evidentiary Presentation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Assessor offered her own evidence, presenting the USPAP-certified appraisals of Michael Cahill, MAI, that estimated the market value-in-use of the Resort's real property as $134,300,000 for the 2009 tax year and $127,000,000 for 2014 tax year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1840-41, 1846-47, 2062-63, 2068-69.) These values were notably higher than the 2009 and 2014 assessed values she initially assigned to the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Cahill's appraisals first used the income approach to determine that the going concern value of the entire Resort was $220,000,000 in 2009 and $190,000,000 in 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1843-45, 2065-67.) (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 1934-37, 1942, 1949 (explaining in part why he did not believe either the cost approach or the sales comparison approach were applicable to valuing casino properties), 3203-04, 3207-09 (explaining his view that appraising casino properties based on their going concern values was the most accurate method to reflect the relationship between tangible and intangible assets and that market participants rely upon this measure of value when deciding whether to invest).) More specifically, Cahill used a discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") analysis to calculate the present value of the Resort's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   over a 10-year holding period, to which he then added the present value of proceeds received from a hypothetical sale of the Resort in year 11. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 1949, 1961, 1967, 2177, 2189, 2196.) For his 2009 valuation of the Resort, Cahill projected that EBITDA would grow by 19.6% between 2009 and 2012, and then 3% in each of the remaining seven years, for a total of 46.6% over the 10-year projection period. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1961, 1963, 1967, 3766-67.) For his 2014 valuation, Cahill projected the Resort's EBITDA would grow by 17.8% between 2014 and 2017, and then 3% in each of the remaining seven years, for a total of 44.7% over the 10-year projection period. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 2189, 2191, 2196, 3767-68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   From the going concern values, Cahill deducted the value he attributed to each of the Resort's non-realty components (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the personal property, the gaming license, and the business enterprise) to arrive at the market value-in-use of the Resort's real property of $134,300,000 for 2009 and $127,000,000 for 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 1843-45, 1970-78, 2065-68, 2201-11.) Specifically, Cahill valued the\n   Resort's personal property relying on the personal property tax returns Belterra previously filed with the Assessor. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1970-71, 2201-02.) To determine the value of the gaming license, Cahill applied a multiplier to the Resort's EBITDA to account for its monopolistic value in a restricted market casino state. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 104 \u00b6 296, 1971-75, 2202-07.) To determine the value of the business enterprise, Cahill used a \"Dark Casino Theory,\" which computed two income capitalization approaches: one for the property as if closed, the other for the property upon reopening, attributing the difference between the two, plus any \"pre-opening costs,\" as the business enterprise value. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1975-77, 2207-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Cahill then allocated approximately 55% of these real property values to the Riverboat and the other 45% to the Hotel and Golf Course. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1979-81, 2212-13.) He based his allocations on the relative percentages of developmental income derived from, and costs incurred by, the Riverboat, Hotel, and Golf Course. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1979-81, 2212-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Indiana Board's Final Determination\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   By the end of the administrative hearing, Belterra and the Assessor had presented the Indiana Board with two competing market value-in-use estimates derived from entirely different methodologies. Those positions were, again, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-32\"><em>Belterra</em> <em>Assessor</em> 2009 Riverboat: $ 4,327,000 $76,200,000 2009 Golf Course: $ 2,500,000 2009 Hotel: $37,575,000 2009 Hotel &amp; Golf Course Combined: $58,100,000 ___________ ___________ 2009 Total: <strong>$44,402,000</strong> <strong>$134,300,000</strong> <em>Belterra</em> <em>Assessor</em> 2014 Riverboat: $ 3,500,000 $68,100,000 2014 Golf Course: $ 3,000,000 2014 Hotel: $42,175,000 2014 Hotel &amp; Golf Course Combined: $58,400,000 ___________ ___________ 2014 Total: <strong>$48,675,000</strong> <strong>$127,000,000</strong><sup>10</sup></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Editor's Note:\n   </strong>\n   The preceding image contains the reference for footnote\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert.

Before it arrived at this result, the Indiana Board expressed how difficult it perceived its task to be:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The [Indiana] Board must determine the value of the real estate of a casino: a type of property that is not rented, not sold separate from business assets except [when] in distress, and where there is sparse law on how it should be valued. There is no rental income, there are no comparable sales, and the market never considers the value of the real property separate from the business assets. Highly credentialed experts disagree on the most basic points of approach, method, and technique, and reach values nearly $100M apart.... In the task at hand, the [Indiana] Board finds a certain affinity with the Roman haruspex as we must divine [the Resort's market value-in-use].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (Cert. Admin.

The Indiana Board's Analysis of Belterra's Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Indiana Board rejected Herman's cost approaches valuing the Riverboat for 2009 and 2014 and the Golf Course for 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite disagreements with some minor points, however, the Indiana Board found that Herman's sales approach was probative in demonstrating the market value-in-use of the Riverboat for both 2009 and 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 79-82 \u00b6\u00b6 235-44.) The Indiana Board also found Herman's income approach valuing the Golf Course for 2014 probative. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 84 \u00b6 249.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   With respect to the Hotel, the Indiana Board determined that Lennhoff's valuation was not probative for two main reasons. First, the Indiana Board explained that in relying upon the income and expense data for full-service hotels, Lennhoff failed to value the Hotel for what it really was: a luxury destination resort hotel with amenities otherwise not available at full-service hotels. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 84 \u00b6 250, 86-87 \u00b6\u00b6 254-57.) Second, the Indiana Board stated that \"[e]ven if [ ] Lennhoff's use of full-service hotel data was sound, his projections of income and expenses were not credible.\" (Cert. Admin. R. at 89 \u00b6 262.) For instance, the Indiana\n   Board found that Lennhoff systematically underestimated the income attributable to the Hotel by using average daily room rates and occupancy rates much lower than those rates published in the investor surveys for full-service hotels. (Cert. Admin. R. at 89-91 \u00b6\u00b6 262-63.) In addition, the Indiana Board found that Lennhoff overestimated the Hotel's expenses in relation to the data published for full-service hotels. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 92 \u00b6 266.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Indiana Board's Analysis of the Assessor's Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Turning to the Assessor's evidence, the Indiana Board found Cahill's going concern income methodology a valid means of valuing the Resort. (Cert. Admin. R. at 74-78 \u00b6\u00b6 221, 226-31, 97 \u00b6 281.) The Indiana Board adopted Cahill's conclusions regarding the Resort's going concern value, finding the assumptions underlying his income and expense projections (and upon which his EBITDA calculations were based) \"reasonable.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Cert.

Consequently, the Indiana Board synthesized the probative evidence into one final value conclusion for 2009 and another for 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   First, the Indiana Board adjusted Cahill's real property valuation by deducting the increased business enterprise value it calculated using the Rushmore approach.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 114-15 \u00b6\u00b6 316-17.) The remainder values-$94,173,000 for 2009 and $92,000,000 for 2014-were then allocated to the rest of the Resort. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 114-15 \u00b6\u00b6 316-17.)

Upon reviewing those arguments, however, the Court consolidates and restates them as: whether the Indiana Board erred when it 1) rejected Lennhoff's Hotel valuation and 2) adopted Cahill's going concern valuation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Did the Indiana Board Err in Rejecting Lennhoff's Hotel Valuation?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   On appeal, Belterra maintains that the Indiana Board's decision to give no weight to Lennhoff's Hotel valuation must be reversed because it is not supported by\n   substantial and reliable evidence. Belterra explains that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   [t]he [Indiana] Board fundamentally misunderstood the testimony and approach taken by ... Lennhoff. As a result, in both its findings of fact and conclusions of law, the [Indiana] Board substantially mischaracterized key aspects of Lennhoff's appraisal and testimony-and then relied on th[o]se mischaracterizations to reject the ... appraisal. In short, errors the [Indiana] Board characterized as central to Lennhoff's appraisal were not errors Lennhoff committed; they were the [Indiana] Board's misconception of what he did. As a result, the [Indiana] Board failed to meaningfully consider Lennhoff's actual approach, rendering its conclusions unsupported by the record evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   (Belterra Br. at 38.) More specifically, Belterra contends that the Indiana Board's misunderstanding is revealed by its conclusion that Lennhoff valued the Hotel as a full-service hotel rather than a resort hotel, a conclusion unsupported by the evidence in the administrative record. (Belterra Br. at 39.) For instance, Belterra explains that because Lennhoff's income analysis valued the revenue streams from each of the Hotel's amenities (restaurants, salon, retail outlets, etc.), he necessarily valued the Hotel as a resort hotel and not as a full-service hotel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Belterra Br. at 39-40.) Belterra also notes that while the investor surveys Lennhoff relied on included data on full-service hotels, they \"certainly [were] not limited to 'full[-]service hotels[.]' \" (Belterra Br. at 40.) Finally, Belterra asserts that the evidence shows that Lennhoff performed a qualitative analysis of all of the data contained in the investor surveys to forecast an average daily rate for the Hotel that reflected its location and amenity offerings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Belterra Br. at 40-41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Indiana Board's final determination explains, however, that it rejected Lennhoff's valuation not because it used income and expense data for full-service hotels\n   <em>\n    per\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   , but because it used this data\n   <em>\n    without making any adjustments\n   </em>\n   to account for the inherent differences between the Hotel and full-service hotel properties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 87 \u00b6 256 (explaining that \"non-luxury, cookie-cutter franchised hotels\" have \"irreconcilably different physical attributes, amenities, and business models\" than the Hotel), 89 \u00b6 261 (noting that the Indiana Board was \"sympathetic\" with the difficulty in finding \"reliable [income and expense] data because comparable casino-hotels all have the same issue with comping[,]\" but that Lennhoff needed to \"either find a reliable way to adjust the data to account for the differences between resorts and full-service hotels, or choose a different approach\" altogether).) The evidence shows that Lennhoff recognized that there were inherent differences between the Hotel and full-service hotels. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 1720 (where Lennhoff defines a full-service hotel as one that \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   operate an on-site restaurant/bar, a coffee kiosk, and a small retail store\" (emphasis added) ), 1727 (where Lennhoff states that the Hotel provides design and amenities superior to any full-service hotel).) Nonetheless, the administrative record does not show that Lennhoff accounted\n   for those differences when he valued the Hotel. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 1729-30 (demonstrating Lennhoff relied on income and expense figures from a Kentucky Ramada Inn and a Kansas Hampton Inn-despite the fact that the figures for those hotels were even lower than other full-service hotels in the region-simply because they were \"destination\" hotels), 1739-47 (indicating that Lennhoff used average daily room rates for the Hotel that were lower than the published benchmarks for full-service hotels in the region and that his expense projections for the Hotel were merely calculated as a percentage of his room revenue).) Moreover, Lennhoff himself testified that he valued the Hotel as a market-based, full-service hotel. (Cert. Admin. R. at 2911.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Belterra has not persuaded the Court that the Indiana Board misunderstood Lennhoff's evidence or position. Moreover, a reasonable person would find evidence that Lenhoff did not adjust for the differences between the Hotel and the data upon which he based his valuation. Accordingly, the Indiana Board's decision to give Lennhoff's valuation no weight is supported by the evidence, and the Court will not reverse its determination on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Did the Indiana Board Err in Adopting Cahill's Going Concern Valuation?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In adopting Cahill's going concern valuation of the Resort, the Indiana Board necessarily adopted his EBITDA growth projections for the Resort.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , page 900-01. On appeal, Belterra claims those EBITDA growth projections are \"directly at odds with all objectively verifiable record evidence indicating\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     declining\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   market conditions and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     declining\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   EBITDA at the [Resort].\" (Belterra Br. at 3.) Indeed, Belterra points to evidence in the administrative record showing that between 2006 and 2014 the economic climate surrounding Belterra's hotel and casino business-as well as that of its competitors-was bleak. For instance, the \"Great Recession\" was in full swing, unemployment was high, and fewer people were gambling. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 1889-91, 1922, 2146, 3726, 3771-72, 3789-91.) As a result, gaming revenues generally were down and were even lower for Belterra. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 1799, 1805, 1920-22, 1926, 2146, 3787-91.) (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Cert.

Concomitant with declines in gaming revenue, Belterra's EBITDA\n   <em>\n    decreased\n   </em>\n   during the relevant time period. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Assessor Reply Br. at 10-11, 15-17 (citations omitted).) Specifically, she explains that her evidence shows that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   1) for purposes of its budget, Belterra projected an EBITDA increase between 2008 and 2009 while Cahill projected a decrease, and that between 2013 and 2014, Cahill projected a greater EBITDA decrease than Belterra budgeted (\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1953-54\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   1967, 2181-82\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   2196);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   2) retail sales and population were expected to grow in the Louisville and Cincinnati markets between 2009 and 2015 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1886, 1892, 2107, 2112, 3310 (implying that if the population is growing, the number of people gambling is growing), 3317-18 (implying that if retail sales are increasing,\n   people have more disposable income to spend on activities such as gambling) ); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   3) the Resort had \"upside potential\" to increase its market share. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1901, 1917-18, 2121, 2142, 3337-38, 3341-42, 3344, 3358-60 (indicating the Resort's market penetration rates in 2008 and 2013).)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   After considering this evidence, however, the Court is not persuaded that a reasonable person would find it supports Cahill's EBITDA growth projections for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   First, with respect to her evidence regarding the parties' EBITDA projections, the Assessor argues that because Belterra budgeted greater EBITDA growth between 2008 and 2009 than Cahill and Cahill projected greater EBITDA decline between 2013 and 2014 than Belterra, Belterra obviously believed that the economic market was not as \"turbulent\" as it claimed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Assessor's Reply Br. at 10-11.) The Court notes, however, that Belterra's projections were developed internally for budgeting purposes. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 1953-54, 2181-82.) Accordingly, it was imperative that the Assessor provide an explanation or citation to authority showing how such projections consider the same or similar elements to EBITDA growth projections developed by a third-party for purposes of estimating the appraisal value of real property. Without that, a reasonable person would find the Assessor's claim that Belterra's budget evidence supports Cahill's EBITDA growth projections, and thus the Indiana Board's determination on the issue, merely speculative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Second, even though the Assessor's evidence indicates positive retail sales and population growth in the Louisville and Cincinnati markets between 2008 and 2015, it indicates much lower growth than Cahill used,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the average annual compounded rate of growth between 2008 and 2015 was less than 2% for retail sales and less than 1% for population growth. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1886, 1892, 2107, 2112.) These small growth increases do not reasonably support Cahill's total EBITDA growth projections of 46.6% over the course of his first 10-year DCF projection period and 44.7% over his second 10-year DCF projection period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Third, the Assessor claims that her evidence regarding the Resort's market penetration rate demonstrates that potential investors would have considered the Resort's upside potential for increasing its market share, and thus its potential increased revenues. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Assessor Reply Br. at 16.) Nonetheless, the Indiana Board determined that the measure Cahill used to calculate his market penetration rate-wins per unit per day (\"WPUPD\")-was unreliable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 98 \u00b6 283 (explaining that \"because taking machines and tables in or out of service does not change overall demand ...[g]ross gaming revenue is a more reliable gauge\").) To that end, the Assessor's own evidence shows that the Resort's gross gaming revenue in 2009 was only a small percentage of the total gaming revenue dollars spent in the southern Indiana market, and the Resort's gross gaming revenue in 2014 was even less than what it was in 2009. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1901, 2121.) As a result, the Assessor's evidence does not support Cahill's increased market penetration rates, but actually demonstrates that the Resort lost market penetration between 2009 and 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Finally, the reasonableness of Cahill's EBITDA growth projections is called into question by his own testimony. For instance, Cahill explained during the Indiana Board hearing that when conducting a DCF analysis, growth projections must be\n   calculated with an eye towards the specific property within its specific market. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 3681-82.) He admitted, however, that the 3% annual growth rate he applied to the last seven years of each of his two 10-year projection periods was not based on property or market specifics, but rather was based on an arbitrary inflationary rate his appraisal firm frequently applied in practice, unrelated to the specific property or its market. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 3430, 3815-17 (stating that his firm chose to use the 3% rate because \"[m]ost investors use 3[%]\").) In addition, while Cahill's growth projections for his two 10-year projection periods were very similar, he admitted that Belterra was affected by very different market conditions during each 10-year period. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 3817, 3821-22.) Cahill testified that between 2009 and 2010, the transactional markets for both hotels and gaming properties were \"horrible and getting worse[,]\" as sales transactions were falling apart or properties were selling for a fraction of their pre-Great Recession sales prices. (Cert. Admin. R. at 3726-27, 3772.) In fact, he further testified that things were so bad on both the 2009 and 2014 assessment dates that the \"gaming industry's equity and debt financing markets [ ] economically prohibit[ed] the development/replication of an asset such as the [Resort.]\" (Cert. Admin. R. at 1969, 2200, 3843.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The EBITDA projections that Cahill used to compute the Resort's going concern value are not supported by substantial and reliable evidence. As a result, the Court reverses the Indiana Board's determination adopting Cahill's going concern valuation of the Resort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Indiana Board's finding that Lennhoff's Hotel appraisal was not probative is AFFIRMED. The Indiana Board's finding that Cahill's appraisal valuing the Resort was probative, however, is REVERSED. Given that 1) the Resort's assessment increased by more than 5% between 2008 and 2009 and 2) neither party proved an assessment for the Resort in its entirety, the property's 2008 assessed value of $102,295,300 is reinstated (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   IND.
