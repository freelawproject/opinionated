Gallagher Sharp (the law firm) appeals the decision of the Mahoning County Common Pleas Court granting summary judgment to Samuel D. Pipino et al. (the clients) on the law firm's quantum meruit counterclaim. The trial court held the quantum meruit claim was not sustainable as the parties' agreement set forth the fees. The law firm points to a Supreme Court precedent stating termination of the attorney-client relationship and the accompanying contingency agreement\n   does not preclude the attorney from recovering the reasonable value of services rendered prior to discharge, whether the termination was with or without just cause. The law firm states the claim for recovery of fees is not on the prior contract and the terms of a \"stipulation\" allegedly attached to the contract were in dispute. We conclude the clients were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the quantum meruit counterclaim. Accordingly, the entry of summary judgment for the clients on the law firm's counterclaim is reversed, and the counterclaim is remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The clients appeal the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the law firm and Attorney Forrest A. Norman on the clients' legal malpractice claim. The trial court held the clients' settlement in the underlying case after termination of the attorney-client relationship was fatal to the malpractice claim. The court also found a waiver principle applicable due to the settlement. The clients contend the attorney's negligence diminished the value of their underlying case or at least caused damages from loss of use of the money during the delay. The issue is whether there was any evidence the attorney's negligence proximately caused damages after taking into consideration a settlement was entered in the underlying case after the attorney was terminated. For the reasons explained infra, we hereby uphold the grant of summary judgment entered against the clients on their legal malpractice claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The clients filed a complaint alleging legal malpractice against Attorney Norman and the law firm where he was employed. A counterclaim was filed seeking recovery of attorneys' fees under the doctrine of quantum meruit. The underlying case involved the clients' dissatisfaction with investments made by First Merit Bank in the clients' trust portfolios from 2007 through 2009. The clients instructed the bank to make safe and conservative investments. The bank suggested exchange-traded funds (ETFs); the clients consented while reiterating their instructions as to safe and conservative investments. The bank invested in ETFs; at least one of the ETFs was comprised of derivatives (was leveraged) rather than merely stocks. When the $2 million beginning balance incurred $1.29 million in losses, the clients instructed the bank to sell the investments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In 2010, the clients hired Attorney Norman of Gallagher Sharp to represent them in a breach of fiduciary duty suit against the bank and certain bank employees. Attorney Apelis, a partner at Gallagher Sharp, assisted Attorney Norman. The agreed compensation was a one-third contingency fee plus expenses. Attorney Norman filed a complaint on behalf of the clients against the bank and the bank's employees, resulting in\n   <em>\n    Pipino v. Onuska\n   </em>\n   , Mah. Cty. C.P. No. 10CV3548. The case was voluntarily dismissed on April 4, 2012, after the trial court refused to extend a previously-extended discovery deadline. Private mediation with the bank proceeded in November 2012, after which the bank filed a declaratory judgment action against the clients in Cuyahoga County. The clients filed a counterclaim. The clients also attempted to refile the Mahoning County lawsuit against the bank, but the court dismissed this action due to the pending Cuyahoga County case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The clients say they terminated Attorney Norman on March 26, 2013 and used other attorneys at the law firm; the law firm states other attorneys at the law firm took over the case when Attorney Norman left the firm. The clients terminated\n   the law firm's representation in July 2013 and hired a new attorney. On September 18, 2013, the clients settled the case against the bank, and the Cuyahoga County suit was dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In November 2013, the clients filed the within legal malpractice action against Attorney Norman and Gallagher Sharp (for vicarious liability). The complaint claimed Attorney Norman committed legal malpractice by: failing to complete discovery, interview an expert witness, and prepare for trial in the Mahoning County action against the bank, all necessitating voluntary dismissal; disobeying the clients' instruction to immediately refile the suit in Mahoning County, while assuring the clients venue would not be lost; and agreeing to schedule mediation with the bank instead of immediately refiling the suit without first consulting with the clients. Regarding the Cuyahoga County suit, the clients complained Attorney Norman failed to engage in discovery and scheduled their depositions in contravention of their instructions that they not be deposed until the bank provided discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The quantum meruit counterclaim filed by Attorney Norman and the law firm asked for the reasonable value of legal services and advanced expenses. The counterclaim pointed out: the action against the bank was filed in 2010; the bank's efforts to remove the suit to federal court were successfully opposed; upon remand to state court, there was extensive discovery conducted; interrogatories and requests for production were served on the bank; responses were submitted to the bank's interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admissions; experts were engaged; numerous court appearances were made; motions to compel discovery were filed and defended; the clients elected to voluntarily dismiss due to an impasse in discovery; and mediation lasted for several hours, after which the clients rejected a settlement offer. After the Cuyahoga County action was filed, the action was defended, a counterclaim was filed, discovery was conducted (with multiple depositions), and a motion to compel discovery was filed on behalf of the clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On April 20, 2015, Attorney Norman and the law firm filed a motion for summary judgment on the clients' legal malpractice claim. They asserted: the alleged discovery omissions in the original action that was voluntarily dismissed did not harm the case against the bank; instead of completing discovery in the second action and taking the case to trial, the clients settled with the bank; the clients waived their malpractice claim by settling the underlying case, citing the Eighth District's\n   <em>\n    Sawchyn v. Westerhaus\n   </em>\n   case; loss of venue in one county is not a basis for malpractice; proximate cause was lacking as there was no showing the alleged negligence caused a loss since nothing prohibited the clients from taking their case against the bank to trial; and the underlying case required expert testimony on the standard of care for a financial professional, but the clients failed to provide an expert report by the deadline in order to prove their \"case within a case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} An affidavit was provided to confirm the clients failed to provide an expert report on the bank's breach of fiduciary duty in the underlying case. In addition, the affidavit of Attorney Apelis attested: extensive discovery was conducted in both cases; a financial expert was retained in both cases; Attorney Norman left the firm on March 26, 2013; the court in Cuyahoga County ordered the clients to submit to deposition over objection after non-party depositions had been taken; and no discovery deadlines were set in the Cuyahoga County case at the time the law firm was terminated. The motion also pointed to Mr.\n   Pipino's deposition testimony where he vaguely stated he lost three years and his case was hurt by not getting discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On May 5, 2015, the clients responded to the motion for summary judgment as to their legal malpractice claim. A reply in support of the motion for summary judgment was filed on July 1, 2015. The clients then received leave to file a cross-motion for summary judgment on the quantum meruit counterclaim filed against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On August 18, 2015, the clients filed a motion for summary judgment on the counterclaim, arguing the existence of the express contract nullified the quasi-contractual quantum meruit claim. They cited to Mr. Pipino's deposition at page 51, where he said he told Attorney Norman when he hired him that he would not agree to a settlement unless they recovered all of their losses (as he would rather take the case to trial); he said Attorney Norman advised he would have to check with the law firm's partners and called him later to say he received their approval. The clients suggested a quasi-contractual quantum meruit claim would have been nullified by a written agreement, noting an attorney is to have the client sign a written contingency fee agreement pursuant to Rule of Professional Conduct 1.5. The clients alternatively argued the elements of a quantum meruit claim could not be established because there was no benefit conferred and the equities do not favor recovery for services rendered due to the malpractice committed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The September 1, 2015 response to the motion for summary judgment on the counterclaim cited to the Supreme Court's\n   <em>\n    Fox\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   cases, which held attorneys' fees can be recovered through quantum meruit where a contractual relationship (whether express or implied) was terminated (whether with or without just cause). The law firm and attorney argued the disputed terms of a contingency fee agreement are irrelevant after the relationship is prematurely terminated. They also stated the quality of work is a distinct issue which could relate to the reasonable value of services rendered but which would not bar the quantum meruit action. They set forth itemized evidence of 1,061.4 hours of work with hourly rates for each item, totaling $143,714, plus $20,706.63 in expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} More than one year later, on September 12, 2016, the trial court granted both summary judgment motions in separate entries, resulting in the disposal of the entire case. Both entries stated there was no just reason for delay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civ.R. 54(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In granting the clients' motion for summary judgment on the counterclaim, the court held: \"the agreement between Plaintiff and Defendants set forth their agreement with respect to fees. As such, no quantum meruit claim is sustainable.\" The law firm filed a timely notice of appeal from this entry on October 11, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In separately granting the motion for summary judgment filed by the attorney and the law firm on the clients' legal malpractice claim, the court held: \"the acceptance of the settlement agreement by Plaintiff, which included a release provision, is fatal to the present claims submitted by Plaintiff. Moreover, the 8th District Court holding in\n   <em>\n    Westerhaus\n   </em>\n   , is applicable to the facts in the case at bar.\" The clients filed what they termed a notice of cross-appeal from this entry on October 17, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Preliminary Issue as to Notice of Cross-Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} App.R. 3(C)(1) provides: \"Cross Appeal Required. A person who intends to defend a judgment or order against an\n   appeal taken by an appellant and who also seeks to change the judgment or order or, in the event the judgment or order may be reversed or modified, an interlocutory ruling merged into the judgment or order, shall file a notice of cross appeal within the time allowed by App.R. 4.\"\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   App.R. 3(C)(2) (\"Cross Appeal and Cross-Assignment of Error Not Required. A person who intends to defend a judgment or order appealed by an appellant on a ground other than that relied on by the trial court but who does not seek to change the judgment or order is not required to file a notice of cross appeal or to raise a cross-assignment of error.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Here, the clients' appeal of the entry of summary judgment on their legal malpractice claim is not the defense of the judgment appealed by the law firm; they are not seeking to change the judgment appealed by the law firm or seeking to change an interlocutory order that merged with the final judgment in the event the final judgment (appealed by the law firm) is reversed. Rather, they are appealing a different final judgment in the case. Accordingly, the clients should have filed a separate notice of appeal, which would have been assigned its own case number, rather than a notice of cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 18} This situation is similar to the situation in this court's\n   <em>\n    Estate of Pizzoferrato\n   </em>\n   case, where the trial court issued two judgment entries on the same day. One entry overruled party A's exception to a final account; party A filed a notice of appeal from this entry. The other entry granted judgment for party B in his concealment action; party B filed a notice of cross-appeal from this separate entry (as he contested the amount of his recovery). We stated: \"As a preliminary matter, it must be noted that [party B] should have filed a separate appeal in this matter and not a notice of cross-appeal. His claims do not fall within the purview of a true cross-appeal, since he is appealing an issue arising from a judgment entry wholly separate and distinct from the entry referred to in appellant's notice of appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Pizzoferrato\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3871801\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/190/123/\">\n    190 Ohio App.3d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-4848\">\n    2010-Ohio-4848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=940%20N.E.2d%201018\">\n    940 N.E.2d 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14 (7th Dist.). We then exercised our discretion to proceed in spite of this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 19} We explained this was permissible because the mistitled notice of cross-appeal was filed within the time for filing a direct appeal under App.R. 4(A), implying the extra time provided for multiple appeals or cross-appeals was not available in the appeal from two separate final entries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. Notably, App.R. 4(B)(1) applies to qualifying multiple appeals as well as cross-appeals. Specifically, the rule provides: \"Multiple or Cross Appeals. If a notice of appeal is timely filed by a party, another party may file a notice of appeal within the appeal time period otherwise prescribed by this rule or within ten days of the filing of the first notice of appeal.\" App.R. 4(B)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 20} This division requires reference to the time requirements in App.R. 4(A). For instance, \"a party who wishes to appeal from an order that is final upon its entry shall file the notice of appeal required by App.R. 3 within 30 days of that entry.\" App.R. 4(A)(1).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   App.R. 4(A)(2) (\"a party who wishes to appeal from an order that is not final upon its entry but subsequently becomes final-such as an order that merges into a final order entered by the clerk or that becomes final upon dismissal of the action-shall file the notice of appeal required by App.R. 3 within 30 days of the date on which the order becomes final.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Construing the\n   <em>\n    Pizzoferrato\n   </em>\n   holding and reading App.R. 4(B)(1) in conjunction with App.R. 4(A), it would appear the\n   ten-day alternative in App.R. 4(B)(1) cannot be used to extend the time for filing a second notice of appeal in the same lower court case where the second notice of appeal is filed from a separate final judgment entered in the case. In other words, the multiple appeals referred to in App.R. 4(B)(1) are multiple appeals from the same final judgment (or appeals from orders that became final due to the same final judgment) not multiple appeals from separate final entries in the same case. Although the clients' notice of appeal at first glance appears to have relied on the ten-day alternative, there is an issue with the court's judgment and the clerk's docket which would make the clients' appeal timely as a direct appeal from the final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 22} That is, the notice of cross-appeal was filed within the time for filing an original appeal because the trial court's judgment entry failed to instruct the clerk to serve the parties and the clerk never noted service in the docket. \"When the court signs a judgment, the court shall endorse thereon a direction to the clerk to serve upon all parties not in default for failure to appear notice of the judgment and its date of entry upon the journal.\" Civ.R. 58(B). \"Within three days of entering the judgment upon the journal, the clerk shall serve the parties in a manner prescribed by Civ.R. 5(B) and note the service in the appearance docket.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"In a civil case, if the clerk has not completed service of the order within the three-day period prescribed in Civ.R. 58(B), the 30 -day periods referenced in App.R. 4(A)(1) and 4(A)(2) begin to run on the date when the clerk actually completes service.\" App.R. 4(A)(3). Consequently, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Pizzoferrato\n   </em>\n   , the clients' appeal was filed within the time for filing an original appeal from the judgment being appealed, without resort to the ten-day alternative in App.R. 4(B)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 23} In sum, this court will exercise our discretion to proceed with the case in its current state, as we did in\n   <em>\n    Pizzoferrato\n   </em>\n   . We are effectively sua sponte amending the clients' notice of cross-appeal into a notice of appeal by eliminating the word \"cross\" from the title of the notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Summary judgment can be granted when there remains no genuine issue of material fact and reasonable minds can only conclude the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

An affidavit attested the reasonable value of these services amounted to $143,714 and expenses were advanced for the benefit of the clients in the amount of $20,706.63. The clients claimed they owed nothing due to the express contract and the malpractice (which allegedly eliminated any benefit or inequity). The clients' reply to the counterclaim admitted there was an express contract which was not honored, but said the equitable doctrine of quantum meruit did not apply because: \"The express contract between the Pipinos and Gallager Sharp provided that there would be no legal fees or expenses paid by the Pipinos unless the Pipinos received all of their losses and had pursued punitive damages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 32} In moving for summary judgment on the counterclaim, however, the clients reframed the \"stipulation to the contingency fee contract\" to be that the clients would not agree to a settlement unless the law firm was able to recover all of the money the clients lost and cited only to page 51 of Mr. Pipino's deposition. The summary judgment motion urged this express contract vitiated the claim for quantum meruit. In the alternative, the clients claimed, due to the legal malpractice, there was no benefit conferred on them or their retention of any benefit would not be inequitable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 33} In granting the clients summary judgment on the quantum meruit counterclaim, the trial court concluded: \"the agreement between Plaintiff and Defendants set forth their agreement with respect to fees. As such, no quantum meruit claim is sustainable.\" To the extent the trial court's holding could be read as finding there can be no quantum meruit claim due to the mere existence of a contingency agreement prior to termination, both sides agree the Ohio Supreme Court's\n   <em>\n    Fox\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   cases permit recovery in quantum meruit where an attorney operating under a contingency fee agreement has been terminated prior to resolution in the underlying case. In defending the trial court's judgment, the clients urge the trial court was not suggesting a rule at odds with Supreme Court precedent but was applying the specific terms of the express agreement which purportedly covers this situation and specifies how the firm must earn any fee. The clients rely on their initial allegation that a particular term within the express agreement provided \"that if Gallagher Sharp did not recover all of the Pipinos' losses, Gallagher Sharp could not be paid.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 34} The law firm states an express contingency agreement does not govern where the client terminates the relationship and the attorney sues in quantum meruit. On this point, it should be noted the agreement remains relevant as: the discharged attorney can recover only after\n   the contingency occurs (the client recovers in the underlying case); the attorney is not usually compensated if the client recovers nothing; and the attorney's recovery in quantum meruit can be limited by the amount provided in the disavowed contract.\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1726297\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/68/570/#p574\">\n    68 Ohio St.3d at 575-576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=629%20N.E.2d%20431\">\n    629 N.E.2d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 35} In any event, the alleged \"stipulation\" (of full recovery) to the express agreement did not govern the occurrences in this case. The clients did not establish the allegation made in their reply to the counterclaim, which is reasserted in their appellee's brief. In these documents, the clients make a more extreme allegation than they made in their summary judgment motion. The motion pointed only to page 51 of Mr. Pipino's deposition and fairly construed his deposition testimony. He did not testify the law firm agreed no fees would be paid unless they recovered all of the clients' alleged losses from the bank, and the clients' motion for summary judgment did not assert this proposition. Rather, Mr. Pipino testified: \"Because when I hired him, I told him either get all my money back or we'll go to court. There's no in between. His whole agreement was based on that, and I told him that up front. He said he would have to get approval from his partners. And he called me one or two days later and said he got it.\" (Mr. Pipino Depo. 51). Contrary to the clients' contention on appeal, Mr. Pipino's testimony does not express the law firm would receive no fees if the firm was terminated or if clients did not receive all of their alleged $1.3 million in losses. The only available construction of the testimony is that, at the time of retention, the clients had no intention of settling for less and would take their chances at trial (where recovery could be less than the amount of loss they believed was caused by the bank's breach of fiduciary duty).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Even if such testimony could be dispositive if true, it was disputed by the non-movant. Attorney Apelis (a partner at Gallagher Sharp who assisted Attorney Norman in the clients' underlying case involving the bank) attested in an affidavit attached to the response to the clients' motion for summary judgment: \"I am personally aware of the nature of the agreement for legal services that the Pipinos entered into with Gallagher Sharp in connection with the litigation referenced above. At no time did I, Mr. Norman, or Gallagher Sharp agree to represent the Pipinos with a stipulation that the Pipinos would accept a settlement no less than the full amount of the claimed losses in their investment portfolio.\" He also opined the law firm would never agree to undertake representation with such a stipulation. The trial court was to view this testimony in the light most favorable to the non-movant. The clients were not entitled to summary judgment where the parties disputed the existence of a particular, unusual term claimed by the clients/movants to be a part of the contingency fee agreement (for which no writing was produced).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Furthermore, Mr. Pipino's testimony would not be dispositive even if it had been undisputed. Coming to an understanding that counsel will take a case to trial if the defendant will not make a certain settlement offer does not preclude a client from later agreeing to settle. Initially, it should be pointed out the clients consented to mediation with the bank after the voluntary dismissal. Mr. Pipino said he attended mediation to see what the bank would offer after discussing with his attorney that the offer would not reimburse him for all losses. (Although he wanted his attorney to refile the voluntarily dismissed case regardless of the scheduled mediation and although the bank refused to mediate if he refiled first, he could have chosen to\n   refile and not participate in the private mediation.) More importantly, after terminating Attorney Norman and Gallagher Sharp and hiring a different attorney, the clients permitted their new attorney to settle with the bank for less than the total alleged loss rather than taking their chances with trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Even viewing the unsupported assertion about an extreme stipulation allegedly attached to the contingency fee agreement, a total recovery by counsel was no longer possible upon termination, just as recovery by counsel in the underlying suit was no longer possible after termination in the\n   <em>\n    Fox\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   cases. At that point, the potential recovery became quantum meruit. In sum, the failure to earn a fee under a contingency contract due to termination prior to recovery does not preclude an action in quantum meruit, and the terms of the particular express agreement alleged by Mr. Pipino's testimony did not govern the termination of counsel and subsequent settlement with the bank or otherwise nullify the accrual of the quantum meruit claim for the recovery of the reasonable value of services rendered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 39} The clients alternatively argue they were entitled to summary judgment on the quantum meruit counterclaim because the law firm could not establish the benefit or inequity elements of quantum meruit. In supporting this argument, the clients focus on the alleged malpractice and also suggest the terms in the underlying agreement (addressed supra) are relevant to any equitable considerations. The law firm points out it provided evidence on the reasonable value of services rendered, noting an attorney discharged from a contingency fee agreement may \"pursue a recovery on the basis of\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   for the reasonable value of services rendered up to the time of discharge.\"\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1726297\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/68/570/#p574\">\n    68 Ohio St.3d at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=629%20N.E.2d%20431\">\n    629 N.E.2d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

By the plain language of such holdings, allegations the attorney was discharged due to malpractice does not act as an absolute bar to the attorney's suit in quantum meruit.

Discovery was conducted, even if not completed to the extent originally contemplated. The affidavit of Attorney Apelis said extensive discovery was conducted and included thousands of pages of documents. The clients' claim was further preserved in the counterclaim asserted within the bank's declaratory judgment action after the initial action was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. The client settled with the bank within three months of terminating the law firm's representation. A reasonable person could find the circumstances suggest it would be inequitable to find the law firm is not entitled to compensation for any of its legal services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 49} For all of these reasons, the law firm's assignment of error has merit as the clients were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the law firm's quantum meruit claim.

The clients complain counsel voluntarily dismissed their Mahoning County lawsuit against the bank because he was not prepared to go to trial due to his failure to timely proceed through the discovery process. Attorney Norman's answer to an interrogatory explained an extension was sought due to ongoing discovery disputes and due to the preference to pursue additional discovery. The case was voluntarily dismissed on April 4, 2012, but the scheduled trial date was still six months away. However, certain documents had not been obtained in discovery, and no expert report was submitted. The trial court denied counsel's motion seeking a further discovery extension, which was not filed until after the previously-extended deadline passed. Specifically, a June 2, 2011 order provided a December 2, 2011 discovery deadline. A January 20, 2012 order resolved several discovery issues and extended the discovery deadline until March 2, 2012. It was not until March 14, 2012 that Attorney Norman moved for an extension of the discovery deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 53} At deposition, Mr. Pipino testified Attorney Norman informed him the suit had been dismissed by the trial court. Mr. Pipino said he wanted to immediately refile the suit but Attorney Norman said they should wait until at least July to refile in order to avoid upsetting the court; counsel thereafter recommended the clients proceed to mediation instead of immediately refiling, stating he promised the bank's counsel he would not refile prior to mediation, which was not scheduled until November 2012. This cleared the path for the bank to file a declaratory judgment action in Cuyahoga County the day after mediation. In their appellate brief, the clients say they sued for legal malpractice based on acts relating to the Mahoning County lawsuit. (2/17/17 Br. at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 54} The clients point to their expert report by Attorney Engler concluding Attorney Norman breached his duty by violating court orders, failing to inform his clients of the status of the case, failing to follow up on discovery rulings made by the court or timely alert the court of discovery disputes, failing to seek the clients' approval for dismissing the action, and failing to refile the action. The clients conclude the evidence shows a genuine issue of material fact as to whether counsel breached the standard of care, urging a reasonable person could find he committed malpractice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 55} While denying there existed a failure to pursue adequate discovery or\n   other breach, Attorney Norman and the law firm respond that they do not contest a genuine issue existed as to breach.

The Court then reversed the jury verdict and entered judgment notwithstanding the verdict for the attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 60} The clients initially frame their theory of the case as: the legal malpractice diminished the value of their case against the bank. They read the\n   <em>\n    Environmental Network\n   </em>\n   decision as implicitly meaning a client does not waive a legal malpractice claim by settling. In response, it is noted said case involved an allegation of a coerced settlement by counsel prompted by his own malpractice. Here, the trial court granted summary judgment on the legal malpractice claim by holding: \"the acceptance of the settlement agreement by Plaintiff, which included a release provision, is fatal to the present claims submitted by Plaintiff. Moreover, the 8th District Court holding in\n   <em>\n    Westerhaus\n   </em>\n   , is applicable to the facts in the case at bar.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 61} Attorney Norman and the law firm cite this Eighth District case on appeal in support of their argument that the clients' settlement with the bank after termination of the law firm waived the clients' malpractice claim. This ties in with their other argument that the clients' failed to show the alleged breach of duty proximately caused injury and resulting damages because: the voluntary dismissal was without prejudice; the claims were pending in the Cuyahoga County action at the time of termination; case law provides a loss of venue to a different trial court in the same state does not establish malpractice where, as here, there was no loss from having to litigate in a different county\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; no discovery deadlines had been set in the Cuyahoga County case at the time the clients chose to settle; the clients hired new counsel who settled the case rather than take the case to trial; and the prior stage of discovery in a suit voluntarily dismissed without prejudice was irrelevant as new counsel was not prohibited from fully advancing the merits of the suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 62} The clients cite to the expert report of Attorney Engler who concluded the conduct causing the Mahoning County case to be voluntarily dismissed \"resulted in a substantial diminution of the value\" of the case against the bank. He said the settlement is merely evidence of mitigation for the $1.3 million total loss (originally incurred as a result of the bank's alleged breach of fiduciary duty). However, he also seemed to be proceeding under the impression that the merits of a malpractice action did not depend on the merits of the underlying action. The report cited\n   <em>\n    Vahila\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that there is no need to prove the underlying merits without recognizing the implicit holding in\n   <em>\n    Vahila\n   </em>\n   (that some cases\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   implicate the case within a case doctrine) and without citing to the explicit holding in\n   <em>\n    Environmental Network\n   </em>\n   . In any event, the clients admit they are required to prove their case within a case to show they would have recovered more (at trial or a bigger settlement) absent the malpractice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 63} On the topic of injury proximately caused by the alleged breach of duty, the expert report did not suggest how the value of the case against the bank was diminished by Attorney Norman. Whether or not an expert was needed on the proximate cause element, summary judgment evidence must establish a loss was proximately caused by the breach of duty. The element of proximate cause cannot be presumed here. The mere presentation of summary judgment evidence that there was breach of a duty by the attorney's performance does not create a presumption that the breach proximately caused a loss. (This is not a strict liability claim.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 64} As an aspect of proximate cause, the premise waiver is also discussed by the parties. In\n   <em>\n    Sawchyn v.

After a jury found the client liable for $30,000 in compensatory damages and $216,000 in punitive damages, an appeal was filed. The client sued for malpractice, complaining the lawyer failed to enter settlement negotiations in the tort suit prior to trial. The client then settled the tort action and dismissed the appeal. The lawyer successfully filed a motion for summary judgment in the malpractice action alleging the client waived the malpractice claim by settling the case rather than proceeding through the appeal.

As they lost no opportunity to try their case as a result of Attorney Norman's alleged malpractice, it is asserted that proximate cause is lacking, i.e., there is no evidence to show a causal connection between the amount of settlement or inability to take the case to trial and Attorney Norman's conduct as the case remained pending at the time of his termination with no discovery deadlines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The clients point to their assertion that the settlement ($300,000) was a fraction of their total investment losses without showing how this was proximately caused by Attorney Norman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 69} The clients cite to the factual setting of\n   <em>\n    Environmental Network\n   </em>\n   as pertinent to the trial court's holding on waiver or lacking proximate cause due to the settlement with the bank.\n   <em>\n    Environmental Network\n   </em>\n   dealt with an attorney (who was later accused of malpractice) coercing the clients to settle on the second day of trial rather than proceeding through trial. Again, Attorney Norman and the law firm were not representing the clients when they decided to settle their case against the bank, and the discovery deadlines were not yet set in the case.\n   <em>\n    Environmental Network\n   </em>\n   , although involving proximate cause, did not involve a replacement attorney settling rather than taking the case to trial without an explanation as to why the terminated attorney caused the need to settle or diminished the value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 70} The clients are essentially asking this court to hold that delay in a pending case due to counsel's negligence necessarily diminishes the value of a breach of fiduciary duty suit. This is not to say delay can never diminish the value of the underlying suit, but summary judgment evidence must allow a reasonable person to find proximate cause between the delay and the diminished settlement. Here, the bare assertion that counsel's conduct caused loss is mere speculation or assumption. This client is essentially saying, \"Because I was tired of dealing with attorneys and the suit I filed, I settled for less than I deserved; the reason I experienced this exhaustion with the process was my prior attorney's delay\" (which delay we could assume was a breach for purposes of summary judgment). It is not for this court to theorize how the alleged breach of duty by Attorney Norman could have proximately caused the value of the suit against the bank to diminish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 71} The parties also raise the issue of whether the clients' evidence satisfied the case within a case doctrine.

The case against the bank was for breach of fiduciary duty. It is asserted testimony by a qualified expert was required on the investments in order to avoid summary judgment. Attorney Norman notes the clients provided a report by a certified public accountant, who was their personal accountant, attesting to the total loss from the investments. The accountant stated the bank invested over $2 million in 2009 into leveraged ETFs and the clients lost $1.29 million. The accountant provided a definition of a leveraged ETF, quoting an unnamed source as follows: \"an exchange traded fund that uses financial derivatives and debt to amplify the returns of an underlying index.\" The accountant added, \"It is leveraged by the investor funds and additional funds from the debt. It is a sophisticated and volatile investment instrument.\" He said the clients were not high risk investors and requested the ETFs be sold when they realized where their assets were invested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 74} In moving for summary judgment, Attorney Norman and the law firm noted the accountant's report did not contain an opinion on the standard of care or breach of fiduciary duty in the underlying suit. Attached to the April 20, 2015 motion for summary judgment, was an affidavit stating, \"Despite the Court's deadline of February 15, 2015 for Plaintiffs to produce expert reports, Plaintiffs did not submit an expert report opining the First Merit Bank, Jeffrey P.

Attorney Norman and the law firm asked the trial court to strike any new opinions as untimely. They also stated the accountant failed to recite how he was qualified to render an opinion on sophisticated financial products or the standard of care for financial advisers in making investments and trading funds, noting the accountant's affidavit disclosed, \"I am not a sophisticated investor and have a basic knowledge of a Traded Fund.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 76} On appeal, the clients do not contend the accountant provided an expert opinion on breach of the standard of care for financial advisers. Rather, they refer to\n   the accountant's affidavit along with Mr. Pipino's affidavit to prove factual matters. The clients insist these affidavits are sufficient to raise jury questions on the facts, positing expert testimony is not required to prove the bank and the sued employees breached their fiduciary duties to the clients. Mr. Pipino stated: he instructed the bank to make safe and conservative investments; the bank promoted a leveraged ETF as the investment choice; he was not familiar with the product; in response to their recommendation, he reiterated his concern that the trust should contain safe and conservative investments; the bank assured him the suggested investments were safe and the return would be significant, espousing superior knowledge; and he consented to the investments.

Attorney Norman and the law firm conclude the financial advice relative to investing in ETFs or leveraged ETFs and whether the bank breached its standard of care in so advising is clearly beyond the common knowledge of a layperson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 81} Notably, the clients' expert report on Attorney Norman's malpractice contained an opinion on Attorney Norman's failure to provide an expert report to the bank by the deadline in the Mahoning County action:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   It would have been imperative that the Plaintiffs hired an expert, and produced an expert report showing that Defendants [bank and employees] were negligent, reckless and without authority to make the investments in the Trusts which led directly to the 1.3 Million Dollar loss. The allegation was that the type of investment was risky and not well suited for the needs of the Trusts where the main fiduciary concern was safety of the investment. First Merit invested trust funds into speculative products. No report was ever produced. This was a direct violation of the Court's order and without such a report the case could not go forward.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Consequently, the clients' own expert on legal malpractice was opining an expert affidavit on breach of fiduciary duty was required in the underlying action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 82} In their reply brief, the clients claim an attorney who files a lawsuit against a bank for breach of fiduciary duty necessarily admits there was a breach of fiduciary duty by the mere filing of the lawsuit, citing e.g., Civ.R. 11. However, this was not specified in the clients' initial brief, and this position would seem to eviscerate the case within a case doctrine. If the original filing of the suit for the clients by counsel constitutes an admission in a later malpractice case and thereby satisfies the case within a case doctrine, then the\n   <em>\n    Environmental Network\n   </em>\n   Court would not have reversed a jury verdict due to the lack of evidence on the merits of the underlying lawsuit filed by the attorney now being sued by his clients. This court concludes the clients breach of fiduciary duty claim required qualified expert testimony in order to satisfy the case within the case doctrine (as to the allegation that the legal malpractice caused the case to diminish in value).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 83} Alternatively, on the concept of whether any loss was proximately caused by the malpractice, there is a suggestion the clients, at least, sufficiently showed damages were proximately caused by malpractice due to loss of use of the money during the delay caused by Attorney Norman. Attorney Engler's report\n   stated the malpractice-induced delay in resolving the case could be seen as causing damage for loss of use of the money they would have received sooner but for the malpractice. The clients believe this premise is supported by\n   <em>\n    Paterek\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 84} The circumstances existing in this case, however, do not support the clients' contention. Whether the trial against the bank would have proceeded in October 2012 as scheduled is speculative. Additionally, the clients settled the case against the bank in September 2013. This settlement was much more ($200,000 more) than the bank's offer at mediation in November 2012. Moreover, the loss of use of the money (money alleged to be unavailable for future investment as a result of the bank's breach of fiduciary duty) can be considered part of the settlement. Finally, the portion of\n   <em>\n    Paterek\n   </em>\n   relied upon by the clients must be read in context of the case before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 85} The clients rely on the following statement: \"courts need not-and should-overlook the possibility of settlement or the passage of time in determining damages suffered by a malpractice plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Paterek v.

Passage of time referred to the fact that a defendant may have been uncollectable but is now collectable or vice versa. Likewise, the ability to consider that the clients may have entered a settlement with the original defendant (before or after judgment) was a reference to the considerations in evaluating collectability. The Court was referring to the possibility of a settlement that never materialized due to the dismissal of the lawsuit with prejudice and the collectability of such a settlement. The Court did not suggest the mere passage of time due to delay caused by an attorney automatically means damages were proximately caused due to the temporary loss of use of money thereafter collected in a settlement. Nor did the Court issue a holding where a client settles a case after terminating an attorney and sues the attorney for malpractice without explaining how the attorney diminished the value of the underlying case where the case still remained pending and awaiting trial with discovery deadlines yet to be set.
