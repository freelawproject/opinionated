Upon review, the Court reverses the Indiana Board's final determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   During the years at issue, Nova Tube owned two parcels of land in Clark County, Jeffersonville, Indiana. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 451-59.) Together, the parcels were comprised of 29.1 acres of land with rail spurs that provided access to the nearby railroad and a 109,443 square foot industrial warehouse. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 195, 215, 616-17, 622-624.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2010, the property was assessed at $2,245,900. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 452, 459.) In 2011, however, the Clark County Assessor increased the property's assessment by over 50%, assigning it a total assessed value of $4,653,100. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 452, 459, 522.) Over the next two years, the property's assessments increased incrementally, with it being assessed at $4,767,200 in 2012 and $4,767,300 in 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 522-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 3, 2013, Nova Tube appealed its assessments for the years at issue to the Clark County Property Tax Assessment Board of Appeals (the PTABOA). In May of 2014, while the appeals were still pending with the PTABOA, Nova Tube sold the property to the Port of Indiana for $6,125,000. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 650-54.) The PTABOA subsequently affirmed all three of Nova Tube's assessments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Nova Tube appealed the PTABOA's determinations to the Indiana Board on July 18, 2014. After conducting a hearing on the appeals, the Indiana Board issued a final determination in the matter on June 30, 2017. In that final determination, the Indiana Board explained that with respect to the 2011 appeal, the Assessor bore the burden of proving that the assessment increase was correct under Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-15-17.2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 97-98 \u00b6 36.) The Indiana Board then determined that the Assessor met her burden because the evidence that the property was sold in a \"market value\" transaction in May 2014 and that the market was relatively stable during the years at issue supported her assessment values. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 97 \u00b6\u00b6 34-35, 99-102 \u00b6\u00b6 41-46.) Consequently, the burden shifted to Nova Tube to rebut the Assessor's\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 101-02 \u00b6 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In its rebuttal presentation, Nova Tube asserted that the May 2014 sale was not a market value transaction because the buyer, the Port of Indiana, was atypically motivated given that it was a government entity that already owned \"the vast majority of the land in that area[,]\" including land adjacent to Nova Tube's property. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 100-01 \u00b6 43, 651-57.) Nova Tube also asserted that the Assessor had admitted that the May 2014 sales price did not actually reflect the property's market value-in-use because the property record cards stated that the sale was \"invalid.\" (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 596-601, 656-57.) Finally, Nova Tube presented an appraisal, completed in conformance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), that\n   valued the property at $2,900,000 for 2011. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 194-280, 561-62, 644-806.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Indiana Board weighed the competing evidence and determined that Nova Tube did not persuasively rebut the Assessor's\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   case, explaining that the lack of support for certain adjustments and valuations in Nova Tube's 2011 appraisal, particularly the land valuations, had diminished its probative value. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 102-03 \u00b6\u00b6 47-53.) Consequently, the Indiana Board upheld the property's 2011 assessment of $4,653,100. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 100-05 \u00b6\u00b6 43-46, 54-57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   With respect to Nova Tube's 2012 and 2013 appeals, the Indiana Board did not state which party bore the burden of proof; rather, it stated that the Assessor had made a\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   case for 2012 and 2013 by using the same evidence offered to support her 2011 assessment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 101-02 \u00b6 46.) The Indiana Board determined that Nova Tube's 2012 and 2013 appraisals, which valued the property at $3,000,000 for 2012 and $3,100,000 for 2013, did not persuasively rebut the Assessor's\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   case because they suffered from the same infirmities as its 2011 appraisal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 101-04 \u00b6\u00b6 46-53, 55.) (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 836-37, 859-60.) Accordingly, the Indiana Board also upheld the property's 2012 assessment of $4,767,200 as well as its 2013 assessment of $4,767,300. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 104-05 \u00b6 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 17, 2017, Nova Tube filed a Request for Rehearing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 106-17.) On July 31, 2017, the Indiana Board denied Nova Tube's Request for Rehearing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 123-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 11, 2017, Nova Tube initiated this original tax appeal. The Court heard oral argument on February 14, 2018. Additional facts will be supplied if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The party seeking to overturn a final determination of the Indiana Board bears the burden of demonstrating its invalidity.\n   <em>\n    Osolo Twp.

Tax Ct. 2003). Thus, Nova Tube must demonstrate to the Court that the Indiana Board's final determination is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; in excess of or short of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations; without observance of the procedure required by law; or unsupported by substantial or reliable evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   IND. CODE \u00a7 33-26-6-6(e)(1)-(5) (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On appeal, Nova Tube asks the Court to reverse the Indiana Board's final determination, claiming it is contrary to law, unsupported by substantial or reliable evidence, and constitutes an abuse of discretion. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Oral Arg. Tr. at 11; Pet'r Initial Br. (\"Pet'r Br.\") at 15-16, 21-22.) More specifically, Nova Tube contends that the Indiana Board erred in upholding the assessments because the Assessor did not meet her initial burden of proving that the assessment increases were correct given that: 1) she failed to demonstrate that the property sold in a market value transaction in May 2014; and 2) she failed to relate the property's May 2014 sales price to the relevant valuation dates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 12-22; Pet'r Reply Br. at 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Market Value Transaction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During the years at issue, Indiana defined \"market value\" for purposes of its property tax assessment system as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The most probable price, as of a specified date, in cash, or in terms equivalent to cash, or in other precisely revealed terms, for which the specified property rights should sell after reasonable exposure in a competitive market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, with the buyer and seller each acting prudently, knowledgeably, and for self-interest, and assuming that neither is under undue duress.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   2011 REAL PROPERTY ASSESSMENT MANUAL (\"2011 Manual\") (incorporated by reference at 50 IND. ADMIN. CODE 2.4-1-2 (2011) ) at 5-6. The definition specified the conditions required for fair sales, including that the buyer and seller be typically motivated, without duress, compulsion, or pressure to act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   2002 REAL PROPERTY ASSESSMENT MANUAL (2004 Reprint) (\"2002 Manual\") (incorporated by reference at 50 IND.

Tax Ct. 2016) (construing Indiana's definition of market value); INT'L ASS'N OF ASSESSING OFFICERS, PROPERTY ASSESSMENT VALUATION 100 (2nd ed. 1996) (stating that market value sales require, among other things, that buyers and sellers be typically motivated).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Nova Tube accordingly maintains that to establish that a sale is a market value transaction one must, among other things, show that the parties to the transaction are typically motivated. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 12; Pet'r Reply Br. at 10-11.) Nova Tube claims that because the evidence in this case\n   <em>\n    indisputably\n   </em>\n   showed that the buyer, the Port of Indiana, was atypically motivated, the Indiana Board abused its discretion in finding that the May 2014 sale was a market value transaction. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pet'r Reply Br. at 1; Oral Arg. Tr. at 11.) Indeed, Nova Tube maintains the Port of Indiana's atypical motivation was manifest given its status as both a government entity and adjacent landowner. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pet'r Reply Br. at 7-11.) Moreover, Nova Tube claims that the parties' expert witnesses agreed that the Port of Indiana was atypically motivated during the administrative hearing\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that the Assessor tacitly conceded the point by noting on the property record cards that the sale was \"invalid\" for purposes of the mass appraisal process. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 15-20.) Nova Tube further asserts that the Assessor failed to rebut its evidence because she focused on factors unrelated to a buyer's atypical motivation, namely whether the property was sold in an \"arm's length\" or \"open market\" transaction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 13-16; Pet'r Reply Br. at 9-11.) Nova Tube's claims, however, are unpersuasive for three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, the certified administrative record reveals that both parties' expert witnesses stated that the mere fact that one of the parties to a transaction is a government entity or adjacent landowner does not in itself demonstrate that the party is atypically motivated. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 905-07, 937-39, 967, 972-78 (providing that sales to government entities and adjacent landowners may be used to appraise property under certain conditions,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , after\n   researching the sale to verify that it reflects a property's market value).) Moreover, the International Association of Assessing Officers' 2007 Standard on Ratio Studies provides that sales to government agencies\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be used in performing a ratio study\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   after researching the sales to verify that they are market value transactions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 114.) Here, the Assessor initially deemed the May 2014 sale of the subject property invalid for use in the mass appraisal/ratio study process presumably because the sales disclosure form indicated that the buyer was both a government entity and adjacent landowner. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. 469-72, 955-68.) Upon a more in-depth investigation, however, she determined that the May 2014 sale was equivalent to a market value transaction that supported her assessment increases. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 976-77, 1009-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Second, while Nova Tube asserts that the parties' expert witnesses agreed that the Port of Indiana was atypically motivated, it has not cited the portion of the record containing that agreement, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pet'r Br.), and this Court's review of the record uncovered no such agreement. The totality of the evidence, therefore, does not support Nova Tube's claim that the Assessor's notation on the property record cards was an admission of the Port of Indiana's atypical motivation and her acknowledgment that the May 2014 sales price was inconsistent with the property's market value for all purposes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 16-19; Oral Arg. Tr. at 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, the parties offered conflicting evidence on the issue of whether the property's May 2014 sale constituted a market value transaction. (\n   <em>\n    Compare,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 650-54\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 972-76.) Nova Tube presented evidence that indicated the May 2014 sale was not a market value transaction. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 650-54, 656-57, 1026-28 (indicating that the Port of Indiana was the sole party interested in purchasing the property, that its business model was to purchase all nearby land to control its use, and that the property record cards stated that the May 2014 sale was \"invalid\").) Conversely, the Assessor presented evidence that: a) the property's asking price of $6,950,000 was based on an independent appraisal, b) the property sold after being on the market for 373 days, c) there were \"a number of lookers[,]\" d) the property ultimately sold for $825,000 less than the asking price, and e) the personal property (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   cranes) advertised as part of the sale were not actually included in the sale. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 473-76, 972-76, 1007-09.) The record indicates that the Indiana Board considered and weighed the competing evidence, making its finding based on the facts and circumstances before it. Thus, this Court cannot reweigh the evidence on this issue and replace the Indiana Board's finding with one of its own.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hubler Realty Co. v. Hendricks Cnty. Assessor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7163034\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/938/311/\">\n    938 N.E.2d 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 315 n.5 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2010) (providing that an abuse of discretion occurs when the Indiana Board either misinterprets the law or acted clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances before it). Accordingly, the Court finds that the Indiana Board's determination is supported by substantial\n   evidence, and it did not abuse its discretion in finding that Nova Tube's property sold in a market value transaction in May 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Relationship to the Valuation Dates\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Nova Tube also claims that the Indiana Board abused its discretion in finding, contrary to law, that the May 2014 sales price was sufficiently related to each of the relevant valuation dates because the Assessor did not trend that sale and affirmatively link the sales price to the valuation dates. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 22-23; Pet'r Reply Br. at 13-14; Oral Arg. Tr. at 29-31.) \"Trending\" is the process that applies an adjustment factor\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the value of a property to estimate its market value-in-use on a specific date.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 50 IND. ADMIN. CODE 27-5-1 (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Assessor, on the other hand, contends that Nova Tube's claim is meritless because she demonstrated to the Indiana Board that trending was unnecessary. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 516.) More specifically, the Assessor explains that she presented evidence that the rate of growth in the market ranged from only 0% to 1% between 2011 and 2013, as the market continued to recover from the recession, and that the pattern of limited growth continued in 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp't Br. at 14-15; Oral Arg. Tr. at 39-45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   When, as here, a taxpayer appeals an assessment that increased by more than 5% from one year to the next, Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-15-17.2 automatically shifts the burden of proof\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the taxpayer to the assessing official.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   IND. CODE \u00a7 6-1.1-15-17.2 (2014). Accordingly, the assessing official bears the initial burden of proving to the Indiana Board that the assessment increase, and thus the assessment, is correct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7163034\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/938/311/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To meet its initial burden, the assessing official must submit evidence relevant to the property's market value-in-use (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the property's value \"for its current use, as reflected by the utility received by the owner or by a similar user, from the property\") for the appropriate valuation date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2011 Manual at 2 (stating that March 1 is the valuation date for the years at issue). Consequently, the Assessor had to demonstrate that the evidence supporting her assessment increases reflected the subject property's market value-in-use as of the March 1, 2011, 2012, and 2013 valuation dates as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2011 Manual at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In support of her assessment increases, the Assessor provided information about general industrial market trends, residential demographics (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , population, income, and sales activities), and building permits issued between 2009 and 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Admin. R. at 477-508, 980-81, 989-98.) Her evidence also indicated that the market was recovering from the recession between 2009 and 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 125, 493, 995-97.) The Assessor's evidence showed both that the market was relatively stable from 2009 to 2014 (no more than 1% annual rate of growth in real estate values from 2011 to 2013) and that the difference between the property's 2013 assessment of $4,653,100 and its 2014 sales price of $6,125,000 represented roughly a 22% increase in value. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Oral Arg. Tr. at 43.) Nonetheless, the Assessor's evidence failed to show that the property's May 2014 sales price was directly related to any of the appropriate valuation dates for the years at issue. Moreover, the evidence did not indicate why the property's 2011 assessment of $4,653,100, which was more than double its 2010 assessment of $2,245,900, was correct given that the evidence showed that the market's general growth was relatively flat from 2009 to 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Assessor also urges the Court to affirm the Indiana Board's finding as to this issue based on the proximate relationship between the property's assessments of $4,653,100 in 2011, $4,767,200 in 2012, and $4,767,300 in 2013 and its May 2014 sales price of $6,125,000. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Tr. at 43-45.) The Assessor explains that the 22% increase in value from one year to the next is of little consequence because all these figures are close in value. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Tr. at 43-45.) The Assessor further states that to the extent the property was overvalued when it sold in May 2014, that fact would simply increase the reliability of her assessments because she did not request that the property be assessed at that higher value. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp't Br. at 14.) Consequently, the Assessor claims that the Indiana Board, consistent with both its own and this Court's case law, appropriately relied on an objective indicator of value (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the May 2014 sales price) and the figures closer to the objective measure rather than the figures derived from three subjective indicators of value (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   Nova Tube's appraisals). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp't Br. at 12-15 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hubler Realty Co. v. Hendricks Cnty. Assessor\n   </em>\n   , Nos. 32-012-06-1-4-00015,\n   <em>\n    et\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    al.\n   </em>\n   , (Ind. Bd. Tax Review Dec. 17, 2009);\n   <em>\n    Fisher v. Carroll Cnty. Assessor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12355616\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/74/582/\">\n    74 N.E.3d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ind. Tax Ct. 2017) ).) The Assessor's claims, however, are unpersuasive for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Initially, while the property's May 2014 sales price and the assessments at issue are relatively close in value, it is equally true that the property's 2010 assessment of $2,245,900 and its appraised values of $2,9000,000 for 2011, $3,000,000 for 2012, and $3,100,000 for 2013 are similarly close in value. Thus, the mere proximity of certain figures does not indicate whether an assessment reflects a property's market value-in-use as of a specific valuation date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In addition, the cases that the Assessor cited as support for her position are not persuasive here because their facts and issues on appeal fundamentally differ from the facts and issues on appeal in this case. Specifically, in\n   <em>\n    Hubler Realty\n   </em>\n   the Indiana Board found that the parties' evidence, which consisted of an appraisal and sales data, was probative because the stated valuations were deemed to be contemporaneous to the relevant valuation date (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   within three to five months of the relevant valuation date).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hubler Realty\n   </em>\n   , No. 32-012-06-1-4-000115, slip op., at 7 \u00b6 15(g). The Indiana Board's finding as to the probative value of that evidence was not challenged on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hubler Realty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7163034\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/938/311/\">\n    938 N.E.2d at 313-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, however, the Indiana Board did not base the probative value of the May 2014 sales price on a temporal proximity to the March 1 valuation dates at issue. Moreover, the Indiana Board's finding regarding\n   the probative value of the May 2014 sales evidence has been challenged on appeal due in large part to this lack of proximity and failure to analyze the direct relationship between that sale and each of the March 1 valuation dates. Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Hubler Realty\n   </em>\n   does not support the Assessor's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   With respect to the\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   case, the Court upheld an assessing official's assessment increases because they were corroborated by her market-based evidence:\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   two appraisals that valued a taxpayer's property on the relevant valuation dates for amounts that exceeded both assessments.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12355616\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/74/582/\">\n    74 N.E.3d at 585-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, however, the Assessor's market-based evidence, the May 2014 sales data, only indicates the value of Nova Tube's property on the date of sale because the Assessor did not trend that sale or provide other market-based evidence that affirmatively related the sales price to the March 1 valuation dates. Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Fisher\n   </em>\n   does not support the Assessor's position either. Therefore, the Court finds that the Indiana Board abused its discretion by finding that the May 2014 sales price was sufficiently related to each of the March 1 valuation dates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peters v. Garoffolo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6866409\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/32/847/#p852\">\n    32 N.E.3d 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 852 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2015) (providing that a\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   case is one in which the evidence is \" 'sufficient to establish a given fact and\n   <em>\n    which if not contradicted\n   </em>\n   will remain sufficient' \" (citation omitted).) Consequently, the Assessor did not meet her initial burden of proving that her assessment increases were correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-15-17.2 provides that when an assessing official fails to meet her burden of proof, a taxpayer may present evidence to prove the actual market value-in-use of its property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7 6-1.1-15-17.2(b). During the administrative hearing, Nova Tube offered three appraisals to establish that its property should be valued at $2,9000,000 for 2011, $3,000,000 for 2012, and $3,100,000 for 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 194-450.) The Indiana Board found that each of the appraisals, despite certain flaws, had probative value. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 103-04 \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.) While the Assessor has restated the Indiana Board's criticisms of Nova Tube's appraisals on appeal, she has not challenged the Indiana Board's finding as to their overall probative value. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Resp't Br. at 15-17\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 102-03 \u00b6\u00b6 47-53.) Therefore, the Court concludes that Nova Tube's property should be assessed at $2,9000,000 for 2011, $3,000,000 for 2012, and $3,100,000 for 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For the forgoing reasons, the final determination of the Indiana Board is REVERSED.
