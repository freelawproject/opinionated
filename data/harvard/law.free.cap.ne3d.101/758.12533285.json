Clark, appeals from the March 16, 2017 judgment of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas, in which he was sentenced to 12 months incarceration for violating R.C. 2925.03(A)(2), (C)(3)(e), a felony of the third degree.

Appellant and the driver were allegedly returning to Akron from visiting their aunt in Toledo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 4} While traveling in the center lane, the vehicle passed a stationary highway patrol car. In that patrol car was Trooper Alejo Romero III, who testified he was observing eastbound traffic when he noticed the vehicle slowing as it passed him while in the center lane. Romero admitted that, other than the vehicle slowing down, the driver's behavior was not alarming or indicative of criminality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Romero proceeded to follow the vehicle closely, in an effort to pace the vehicle and determine its speed. Romero testified there was no other traffic around the vehicle, although the dash-cam video shows a car and truck close ahead of the vehicle as Romero followed. Romero testified that he paced the vehicle at about 66 to 69 m.p.h., and that the posted speed limit was 70 m.p.h.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Romero followed for approximately one and one-half minutes before activating his patrol lights and signaling for the vehicle to pull over. Romero testified that he believed the driver of the vehicle had violated R.C. 4511.25 and Ohio Adm. Code 5537-2-09. He was only going to issue a warning. The stop occurred during daylight hours, and there was no precipitation or unusual weather conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The dash-cam video reveals the vehicle immediately complied with the signal and pulled over to the outer shoulder. Romero and another trooper, Kirk Beidelschies, exited the patrol car and approached the passenger side of the vehicle. Romero engaged in conversation with the driver and Beidelschies assessed the interior of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Romero testified he knew the vehicle was a rental, so he asked the driver for his license and the rental agreement. The\n   driver produced both. Romero said, and the video shows, that Romero assessed the interior of the vehicle as he stood and requested and reviewed the information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Romero said he began to detect indicia of criminal activity. Specifically, Romero said he sensed a strong odor of deodorizers, which he stated was atypical of rental cars based on his experience. Furthermore, Romero said he noticed two smartphones and three flip phones, and that both the driver and appellant were visibly nervous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Romero asked the driver to step out of the vehicle, and the driver did so. Romero frisked and escorted the driver to his patrol car. Romero testified that he was only going to issue a warning at that point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Trooper Beidelschies stood and observed the driver's pat-down, and then re-approached the passenger side of the vehicle. He again seemed to be assessing the interior of the vehicle. Beidelschies questioned appellant while standing at the passenger side of the vehicle, and then returned to the patrol car to request from Romero a piece of paper to write down appellant's information because appellant had no identification. Beidelschies again approached appellant, and stood at the passenger side window conversing with appellant for about a minute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} According to Romero's testimony, Beidelschies noticed \"raw marijuana flakes\" in the passenger door handle and requested appellant to step out of the vehicle. Appellant was then frisked and placed in the trooper car. Beidelschies proceeded to search the entire vehicle, and there were approximately 21 pounds of cannabis found in the trunk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On March 6, 2014, an indictment was filed charging appellant with possession of cannabis in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A) and (C)(3)(e), a felony of the third degree, and trafficking in cannabis in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2) and (C)(3)(e), also a felony of the third degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellant moved to suppress the 21 pounds of cannabis on June 26, 2015. A suppression hearing was held on October 17, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} At the hearing, Romero and appellant provided their testimony and the court reviewed the dash-cam video. The court further recognized and made the parties stipulate that as Romero followed the vehicle they passed both a truck and a trooper car who had pulled over another vehicle and was parked in the outer shoulder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On October 20, 2016, the trial court denied the motion to suppress. The primary rationale was that Romero had probable cause to conduct the search where the original stop was to enforce Ohio Adm. Code 5537-2-09 and R.C. 4511.25(B). The court further noted that even if Romero made a mistake in interpreting and enforcing those laws, that such a mistake would be reasonable and would not render the stop invalid. The court also determined the officers had probable cause to search the vehicle because cannabis flakes were in plain view when the officers assessed the interior of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On November 4, 2016, appellant entered a no-contest plea. The parties stipulated that the possession conviction would merge with the trafficking conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The court sentenced appellant to 12 months incarceration and a 6-month license suspension, with the possibility of 3 years postrelease control. The sentencing entry was journalized on March 16, 2017, and appellant timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 19} \"Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents mixed questions of law\n   and fact.

Code 5537-2-09 and R.C. 4511.25(B) when stopping the vehicle. Specifically, the transcript of the suppression hearing reflects as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [Tr. Romero]: Well, there's two different rules. One of them is the Ohio Administrative Code and it's 5537-2-09 and that is travel lanes and that is as it relates to the turnpike. As I understand that rule, a driver shall stay in the right lane and shall not move from that lane\n   unless they are passing somebody or at least going the speed limit. So as I understand that rule, if you are going below the speed limit and you are not passing anybody, you are supposed to be in the right lane. That rule also indicates that you cannot be in the far left lane at all unless you are passing. So even if you are going below the speed limit or above the speed limit or anything, you can't be in the far left lane at all unless you are passing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [Prosecutor]: Is that any different than the Ohio Revised Code?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [Tr. Romero]: The Ohio Revised Code-and that's-I think that section is entitled Lanes of Travel. That is 4511.25 and subsection B. It indicates that a driver shall stay in the right lane and shall not deviate unless they are turning left or passing. So it doesn't indicate anything about speed as the Ohio Administrative Code does.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [Prosecutor]: And were you familiar with those-that Administrative Code and that statute back on January 30th of 2014?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [Tr. Romero]: Yes, sir. That was the reason for the stop.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Ohio Adm. Code 5537-2-09 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   The operator of a motor vehicle shall drive in the outer and center traffic lanes in the designated direction for traffic, except when lawfully crossing from one lane to another. The operator of a motor vehicle shall use the inner traffic lanes for passing only. Where three traffic lanes are provided for the same direction of travel, heavy commercial vehicles and vehicles operated at a rate of speed below the maximum in effect shall drive in the outer lane and shall use the center lane for passing only.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 29} R.C. 4511.25(B), in pertinent part, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (1) Upon all roadways any vehicle or trackless trolley proceeding at less than the prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following circumstances:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (a) When overtaking and passing another vehicle or trackless trolley proceeding in the same direction;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (b) When preparing for a left turn;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (c) When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the right-hand lane to continue on the driver's intended route.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 4511.25(B)(1)(a)-(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 30} In this case, and based on review of the language of Ohio Adm.

R.C. 4511.25 does not restrict use of the center lane on a three-lane highway to only traveling at the exact rate indicated by the posted speed limit, because it only requires a driver to be in the\n   far-right lane when he or she is not traveling at a rate of speed comparable to other reasonable and lawful drivers at that time and under those conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Based on review of the record, including the dash-cam video and testimony of Romero and appellant, we find no competent, credible evidence to support the claim that the vehicle appellant was in was traveling \"less than the prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the conditions then existing.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 4511.25(B)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Our review of the video reflects other vehicles not only traveled in the center lane ahead of the trooper and vehicle, but also that those other vehicles were traveling at a comparable rate of speed. Thus, we find the vehicle appellant was in traveled at the prevailing speed of traffic comparable to other reasonable and lawful drivers, at that time and under those weather conditions, in compliance with R.C. 4511.25(B)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Consequently, our review of whether Romero had reason to stop appellant solely regards whether the vehicle was operated in violation of Ohio Adm.

Ohio Adm. Code 4731-24-04(A)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   was adopted by the State Medical Board of Ohio (\"the Board\") under the authority given in R.C. 4760.19, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The state medical board may adopt any rules necessary to govern the practice of anesthesiologist assistants, the supervisory relationship between anesthesiologist assistants and supervising anesthesiologists, and the administration and enforcement of this chapter. Rules adopted under this section shall be adopted in accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 41} At that time, Ohio Adm. Code 4731-24-04(A)(2007) stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Nothing in this chapter of the Administrative Code or Chapter 4760. of the Revised Code shall permit an anesthesiologist assistant to perform any anesthetic procedure not specifically authorized by Chapter 4760. of the Revised Code, including epidural and spinal anesthetic procedures and invasive medically accepted monitoring techniques. For purposes of this chapter of the Administrative Code, 'invasive medically accepted monitoring techniques' means pulmonary artery catheterization, central venous catheterization, and all forms of arterial catheterization with the exception of brachial, radial and dorsalis pedis cannulation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 42} The Board argued this regulation was valid, and that it explicitly prohibited anesthesiologist assistants from performing epidural and spinal anesthetic procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. The appellant, Joseph Hoffman, a certified anesthesiologist's assistant, argued the regulation conflicted with R.C. 4760.09, which lists the authorized activities of anesthesiologist assistants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 43} The Board pointed to the legislative history of the statute to support that no conflict existed. The Board argued that the legislature did not intend to allow assistants to perform the procedures, and the argument hinged on the meaning of the word \"assist\" in the statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Hoffman, to the contrary, argued that use of the word \"assist\" was to allow assistants to \"insert the needle under the direct supervision of the anesthesiologist during epidural or spinal anesthetic procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 45} The\n   <em>\n    Hoffman\n   </em>\n   court agreed the outcome depended on the meaning of the word \"assist.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. In analyzing the meaning, the court determined \"assist\" meant \"[t]o carry out procedures as requested by the supervising anesthesiologist.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25. The court then stated that \"[b]ecause the administrative rule prohibits anesthesiologist assistants from performing procedures that the statute permits, the rule clearly conflicts with the statute[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34. The regulation was held to be invalid and, thus, unenforceable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Here, Romero's interpretation of Ohio Adm. Code 5537-2-09 requires that only those cars traveling exactly 70 m.p.h. may use the center lane of a three-lane highway (assuming 70 m.p.h. is the posted speed limit). Anyone traveling 69 m.p.h. or under in that center lane, where the posted limit is 70 m.p.h., hence, is subject to being stopped pursuant to this regulation unless he or she is actively passing or overtaking another vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 47} R.C. 4511.25(B) does not have this strict speed requirement. Even Romero recognized this twice in open court. First, he responded in the negative to a question of whether speed was relevant to R.C. 4511.25(B).

As applied, the regulation thus must have been comprehensible to the driver of the vehicle in which appellant was, to the extent that it would inform the driver what conduct is prohibited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 57} At issue here is the language of Ohio Adm. Code 5537-2-09,\n   <em>\n    su\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    pra\n   </em>\n   . As articulated above, we find the regulation prohibits vehicles from traveling at a speed below the posted limit, in the center lane of a three-lane roadway, unless the vehicle is passing and overtaking another vehicle to its right. Although we find Ohio Adm. Code 5537-2-09 indicates what is prohibited, we are yet concerned as applied to the particular facts of appellant's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 58} Specifically, we find that a large traffic sign was located within a reasonable distance from where the vehicle was stopped.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ohio Adm. Code 5537-2-02 (\"No person shall fail to comply with any traffic-control sign, signal, marking or device, unless otherwise directed by a police officer.\"); R.C. 4511.12(A) (\"No pedestrian, driver of a vehicle, or operator of a streetcar or trackless trolley shall disobey the instructions of any traffic control device[.]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 59} The sign at issue requests trucks and slower traffic to use the right two lanes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 4511.351(B) (\"The director of transportation shall erect 'keep right except to pass' signs along the right-hand roadway of a freeway that consists of at least three lanes and is part of the interstate system.\"). There are two arrows pointing and directing such drivers to stay in these lanes. Appellant saw the sign, although he could not confirm the driver did. The same type of sign was visible in the dash-cam video, on the opposite side of the turnpike, after appellant was placed in the trooper car and arrested. We find this sign would certainly cause confusion with regard to, and even contradict, the regulation promulgated in Ohio Adm. Code 5537-2-09.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Moreover, there was evidence in the record showing the vehicle actually passed another car and, as stipulated to in open court, also passed an active traffic stop while driving in the center lane and being followed by Romero.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 4511.213(A)(1), (C) (requiring drivers, if possible, to \"change lanes into a lane that is not adjacent to that of the stationary public safety vehicle\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 61} Consequently, we find the various applicable laws and directive in the sign, under the circumstances, would certainly cause confusion as to what conduct is proscribed. Accordingly, appellant's third assignment of error is well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    Fourth Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 62} Appellant's last argument is that despite whether the traffic stop was lawful the subsequent investigatory search and seizure of appellant were unconstitutional because the arresting officers were on a fishing expedition. Appellee contends the arresting officers noticed indicia of criminal activity subsequent to making the stop and, thus, had reasonable, articulable suspicion to conduct the search and make the seizure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 63} As stated in our analysis of the first assigned error, we find Trooper Romero did not have a lawful basis to stop the vehicle.

McLaughlin was no longer in the parking lot, however, his vehicle was running, unattended and parked on a public street. A pat down ensued and nothing was found on McLaughlin's person. However, the officer began shining his flashlight in the general area to see if any contraband had been discarded.
