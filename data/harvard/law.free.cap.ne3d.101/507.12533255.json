The arresting male trooper testified that a female dispatcher, who witnessed the accused, Kennedi Woltz, provide the urine sample, gave the sample to him immediately upon leaving the restroom. Woltz argued that the state is required to establish an unbroken chain of custody and that the female dispatcher's testimony was necessary to authenticate the sample.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The law requires the state to show substantial compliance with the regulations governing the collection and handling of urine specimens, not strict compliance. The arresting trooper's testimony was sufficient to establish at least substantial compliance with the regulation requiring the witnessing of the urine collection. Moreover, objections challenging authenticity/chain of custody based on the Rules of Evidence are not within the scope of the suppression hearing, but are properly raised in a motion in limine and determined with finality at trial. Therefore, we sustain the state's sole assignment of error, reverse the trial court's decision, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Sergeant Nathan Dennis of the Ohio State Highway Patrol stopped Woltz for speeding. After noticing indicators of impairment and performing field sobriety tests, Dennis arrested Woltz for operating a vehicle under the influence in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a). Woltz voluntarily provided a urine sample at the patrol post. The urine toxicology report contained negative results for alcohol but positive results for marijuana, cocaine, and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, also known as \"ecstasy\"). The state amended its charges to include violations of relevant subsections of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(j).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Woltz filed a motion to suppress the urine test results on the grounds that\n   the state failed to substantially comply with eight different provisions of the applicable regulations. Among her challenges, Woltz alleged that the \"collection of the urine specimen was not witnessed to assure that the sample can be authenticated, as required by [Ohio Adm.Code] 3701-53-05(D). No discovery has been provided to the defense as to whether the urine was witnessed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} At the suppression hearing the state presented testimony of Sergeant Dennis, who testified that he and Warren, a female dispatcher working at the patrol post, collected the urine sample from Woltz. Dennis testified that he took a vial collection kit, inspected it, broke the seal, and handed the vial to Warren. Dennis testified that Warren and Woltz immediately entered the restroom and closed the door. Dennis testified that he waited directly outside the door to ensure no one else entered during the collection. After a few minutes Warren and Woltz exited the restroom and Warren handed the urine sample to Dennis in the same vial he gave to her. Dennis testified that after Warren gave him the sample, he placed a sodium chloride capsule in it, placed the cap on it, sealed it with evidence tape across the top, placed it in a box, and mailed it to the lab. Dennis testified that he filled out a property control form on which he wrote that he and Warren collected the urine sample. Dennis testified that Warren accompanied Woltz into the restroom because Woltz is female and it is against the Ohio State Highway Patrol's policy to allow a male to witness a urine collection of a female.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Because Warren did not testify, Woltz argued that the state did not prove substantial compliance with the regulation requiring that the collection of a urine specimen must be witnessed. The state responded that the rules of evidence do not apply to a suppression hearing and Dennis's testimony established that the collection was witnessed. The trial court concluded that Warren's testimony was necessary to establish the chain of custody to authenticate the sample, and granted Woltz's motion to suppress the urine test results. The trial court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The defense motion to suppress specifically challenged, among other items, compliance with OAC 3701-53-05(D), which requires that the collection of the urine specimen be witnessed to assure authentication. The State did not call the person who is believed to have witnessed the collection of the sample to provide testimony on the challenged element of OAC compliance. * * * The State did not present any evidence to rebut the challenge from the defendant that the urine specimen was not witnessed to assure authentication. The State has failed to meet its burden of proof and the defendant's motion to suppress is Granted with regards to the urine results.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The state appealed as a matter of right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2945.67(A) ; Crim.R. 12(K).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.

However, Woltz's argument confuses objections based on regulatory compliance under Ohio Adm.Code 3701-53-05 with objections based on admissibility under the Rules of Evidence, specifically Evid.R. 901 (authenticity/chain of custody). Sergeant Dennis testified that he and Warren witnessed the collection and described the roles each had in the process.

The facts of\n   <em>\n    Vermillion\n   </em>\n   are almost identical to the facts here. The male officer who stood outside the door during the collection testified at the suppression hearing, but the female officer who went into the restroom and witnessed the urine collection of the female defendant did not. The only difference is that in\n   <em>\n    Vermillion\n   </em>\n   , the female defendant testified that she gave the urine sample to the female officer. Nevertheless, both cases have a missing link in the chain of custody-the female witnessing officer. The court held that the female officer's testimony was not needed to authenticate the urine sample-direct testimony and inference established the chain of custody such that it is reasonably certain that no alternation, substitution, or tampering of the sample occurred.\n   <em>\n    Vermillion\n   </em>\n   at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 20}\n   <em>\n    Vermillion\n   </em>\n   addresses the evidentiary question concerning admissibility under Evid.R. 901 (authentication/chain of custody), but it would be premature for our court to render an opinion on the merits of that decision.

At this stage of the proceeding we will not engage in speculation: The state may present Warren's testimony at trial and render the question moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   , the witnessing officer stood on the other side of a hospital curtain while the defendant provided a urine sample. No one was on the same side of the curtain with the defendant. The court held that \"substantial compliance with the regulation does not require the officer to watch the suspect while he urinates, as long as the sample is otherwise collected\n   under circumstances that do not raise suspicions about the sample's authenticity.\"\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18-19.\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   is legally distinguishable because the issue in\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   was whether the collection was properly \"witnessed,\" a regulatory requirement. Here the trial court held that the specimen was not properly \"authenticated\" by the witness Warren, which is an evidentiary issue.\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   is factually distinguishable from our case because Sergeant Dennis testified that Warren was inside with Woltz to witness the collection. Woltz was not on the other side of the bathroom door alone, while Dennis stood outside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The state argues hypothetically that based on the holding in\n   <em>\n    Gordon\n   </em>\n   , Sergeant Dennis's presence outside the door while Woltz went alone into the restroom would be sufficient for him to be the witnessing officer and to authenticate the urine sample. This requires us to speculate about facts not presently before us on the issue of witnessing, and determine authentication questions not ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   IV. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 23} A motion to suppress is the proper procedural device to challenge the state's substantial compliance with regulations governing the collection and handling of urine samples, but not to challenge admissibility based on evidentiary grounds such as authentication and chain of custody under Evid.R. 901. The state substantially complied with the requirement under Ohio Adm.Code 3701-53-05 that the collection of a urine sample be witnessed. The trial court erred in granting Woltz's motion to suppress the test results on the ground the state failed to properly authenticate the urine sample. We sustain the state's sole assignment of error and reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   JUDGMENT REVERSED AND CAUSE REMANDED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    We take no position on the merits of an evidentiary objection on that ground.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
