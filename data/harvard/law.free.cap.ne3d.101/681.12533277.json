Appellant argues that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to dismiss the charges based on the state's failure to provide discovery and the failure of the citing officer to indicate how Appellant's speed was tracked. Appellant also argues that his conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence. Because the state failed to introduce any evidence to demonstrate that the radar device was scientifically reliable, Appellant's conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence. Accordingly, Appellant's argument regarding sufficiency of the evidence has merit and the judgment of the trial court is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On January 19, 2016, Sergeant Charles Butch (\"Sgt. Butch\") initiated a traffic stop after observing Appellant driving 39 mph in a 25 mph zone and issued a traffic citation. Sgt. Butch tracked Appellant's speed through radar. On February 2,\n   2016, Appellant pleaded not guilty. On February 11, 2016, Appellant served the Campbell Municipal Court and Campbell Police Department with a request for discovery. In response, the city prosecutor provided a copy of the front and back of Appellant's citation. Appellant moved for dismissal of the charges based on the state's failure to provide adequate discovery and the citing officer's failure to indicate how Appellant's speed was measured. The trial court denied Appellant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On April 8, 2016, the case was tried before a judge. Appellant renewed his motion for dismissal which the trial court again denied. The state presented one witness, Sgt. Butch. Appellant testified on his own behalf. The trial court found Appellant guilty and ordered him to pay a $125 fine within thirty days. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   THE CAMPBELL CITY MUNICIPAL COURT DENIED THE APPELLANT'S MOTION FOR THIS CASE TO BE DISMISSED ON THE GROUNDS OF THE CAMPBELL CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT IGNORING HIS REQUEST FOR DISCOVERY WHICH IS A VIOLATION OF THE APPELLANT'S DUE PROCESS RIGHTS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellant argues that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to dismiss the charges. Appellant argues that the state failed to provide adequate discovery. Without proper discovery, Appellant argues that it was impossible to defend himself in court. The state did not file a response brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Pursuant to Crim.R. 16(B) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Upon receipt of a written demand for discovery by the defendant, and except as provided in division (C), (D), (E), (F), or (J) of this rule, the prosecuting attorney shall provide copies or photographs, or permit counsel for the defendant to copy or photograph, the following items related to the particular case indictment, information, or complaint, and which are material to the preparation of a defense, or are intended for use by the prosecuting attorney as evidence at the trial, or were obtained from or belong to the defendant, within the possession of, or reasonably available to the state, subject to the provisions of this rule:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) Any written or recorded statement by the defendant or a co-defendant, including police summaries of such statements, and including grand jury testimony by either the defendant or co-defendant;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (2) Criminal records of the defendant, a co-defendant, and the record of prior convictions that could be admissible under Rule 609 of the Ohio Rules of Evidence of a witness in the state's case-in-chief, or that it reasonably anticipates calling as a witness in rebuttal;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (3) Subject to divisions (D)(4) and (E) of this rule, all laboratory or hospital reports, books, papers, documents, photographs, tangible objects, buildings, or places;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (4) Subject to division (D)(4) and (E) of this rule, results of physical or mental examinations, experiments or scientific tests;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (5) Any evidence favorable to the defendant and material to guilt or punishment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (6) All reports from peace officers, the Ohio State Highway Patrol, and federal law enforcement agents, provided however, that a document prepared by a person other than the witness testifying will not be considered to be the witness's prior statement for purposes of the cross examination of that particular witness\n   under the Rules of Evidence unless explicitly adopted by the witness;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (7) Any written or recorded statement by a witness in the state's case-in-chief, or that it reasonably anticipates calling as a witness in rebuttal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 6} As noted by the trial court, the sole evidence presented at trial was the traffic citation, which the prosecutor provided to Appellant. Appellant appears to assume that the state possessed additional evidence. Specifically, Appellant requested \"copies of any and all relevant written or recorded statements of witnesses, including any statements, diagrams, or drawings made by the citing officer on any piece of paper-including the reverse of his/her copy of the citation-or other medium of information storage.\" (2/11/16 Request for Discovery.) However, there is nothing within the record to indicate that such evidence exists beyond the citation. As to the request that was sent to the Campbell Police Department, the record is devoid of any evidence that the police department possessed discoverable evidence. As the state provided the sole evidence it intended to use at trial, it complied with Crim.R. 12. Appellant's first assignment of error is without merit and is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 2\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   THE CAMPBELL CITY MUNICIPAL COURT DENIED THE APPELLANT'S MOTION FOR THIS CASE TO BE DISMISSED ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE CITING OFFICER NEGLECTED TO RECORD ON THE TRAFFIC CITATION HOW HE RECORDED THE APPELLANT'S SPEED MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE APPELLANT TO DEFEND HIMSELF IN COURT.

Sgt. Butch testified that there are three methods used to test a device to ensure that it is working properly. First, the device itself automatically completes an audible and display test. Second, a manual test is performed. Third, tuning forks are used. Sgt. Butch testified that he did not use the tuning forks, but that the automatic and manual tests were completed. Sgt. Butch also testified that he did not recall any malfunction with his device on that date. There is also substantial evidence that Sgt. Butch, who is a radar instructor, was qualified\n   to operate the device. Applying\n   <em>\n    Danvers\n   </em>\n   , this record reflects that the device was set up by a technician trained by experience to do so and was functioning properly at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 16} As to the second part of the test, however, this record is devoid of any evidence that the device was scientifically reliable.

Here, the state failed to introduce testimony to demonstrate the scientific reliability of the device or even provide a description of the type of device used. Additionally, the trial court failed to take judicial notice of the device's reliability. As such, the state has failed to meet its burden.

The record demonstrates that the state complied with Crim.R. 16. Further, the failure of the citing officer to indicate how the defendant's speed was measured is not grounds for dismissal. Appellant also argues that his conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence. As the state failed to produce evidence that the radar device was scientifically reliable, Appellant's conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence.

Regarding calibration, the following exchange occurred with Sgt. Butch on the stand.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Q: Now, when you go out on traffic enforcement, let's say, specifically as relates to speeding offenses, what is that you use to calibrate speed?

Then you activate the radar.

As can be seen from Sgt. Butch's testimony, set out above, he did not conduct the performance tests necessary to calibrate the radar equipment used. Specifically, Sgt. Butch testified that he \"did not use the tuning forks\" on that day. In this case, appellant's conviction was based on an unreliable radar reading, and thus the evidence was insufficient to find him guilty of speeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In order for a speed detection device to be properly calibrated, an internal and an external test must be completed to determine that the device was accurate and in working order.

No. 55537,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1988%20WL%20124999\">\n    1988 WL 124999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Nov. 23, 1988). In this case, the trial court's statement at the conclusion of the hearing that the radar had been properly tuned was not supported by the evidence. I would find that the evidence on which appellant's conviction was based was legally insufficient for this reason as well as for the reason set forth by the majority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 22} I further agree with the majority opinion that evidence, whether by stipulation, judicial notice, or expert testimony, regarding the scientific reliability of speed detection devices is required in order to convict a defendant for speeding. But equally important to evidence of the science being reliable is evidence that the machine at issue, in any prosecution for speeding, must be proven to be properly calibrated and in working order.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
