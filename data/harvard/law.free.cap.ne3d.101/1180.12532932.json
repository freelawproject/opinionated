Their sole assignment of error states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court erred by dismissing this administrative appeal for lack of standing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 2} We find no merit to the appeal and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellants own a home in the historic Ohio City neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio. In 2015, Triban Investment, L.L.C. (\"Triban\") applied for zoning variances to construct a six-unit, four-story condominium building on property located at 3703-3707 Clinton Avenue, in Cleveland. The property is located in a B1 zoning district, which limits housing to one or two-family residences under the Cleveland Codified Ordinances (\"C.C.O.\"). Appellants' home is located one block away from the subject property. (Tr. 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In August 2015, the Cleveland Board of Zoning Appeals (\"the board\") held a public hearing on Triban's application. Notice of the public hearing was published as required by law. Sandoval attended the hearing and identified what he viewed as several problems with the proposed construction. In his opinion, the six-unit condominium structure would increase parking difficulties, overburden the sewer system, and adversely affect government services such as garbage collection and snow removal. He also testified that he\n   believed the proposed condominiums would diminish the value of neighboring properties. He stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   I believe that the granting of the [v]ariances will negatively impact the property values of nearby homes in the long term, including my home because they are in direct contradiction to the 20/20 Plan and existing [o]rdinances that protect the quality of life of the residents of this area of Cleveland. They prevent unnecessary density from overdevelopment and promote a responsible project that contributes to the integrity and quality of life in the neighborhood.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Tr. 53.) Philbin, who was unable to attend the meeting due to his employment, sent a letter to the board, which states in relevant part: \"I fear that my home value will be diminished by the construction of condominiums in my historic neighborhood.\" Neither Sandoval, Philbin, nor any other resident, offered expert testimony regarding the impact the proposed condominiums would have on nearby property values.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 5} William Sanderson, an officer of Triban, testified that before Triban applied for the variances, it worked with the city's Landmarks Commission to ensure \"that the building is of high quality and high value for the neighborhood\" and that it reinforces \"the residential characteristics of the neighborhood.\" (Tr.16.) Sanderson also stated that Triban met with neighbors and that the majority of the neighborhood \"block club,\" known as the Clifton/Franklin Block Club, voted in favor of the project. (Tr. 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Kerry McCormack, then director of community affairs of Ohio City, Inc. and a resident who lives directly across the street from the proposed condominiums, stated that the Clifton/Franklin Block Club approved Triban's project by a vote of 16 to six. (Tr. 33, 39.) However, a couple of residents who attended the hearing and also live very close to the proposed condominiums expressed concern that some members of Clifton/Franklin Block Club who voted in favor of the project live further away and would not be directly impacted by it. (Tr. 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Ben Trimble, also from Ohio City, Inc., stated that the Ohio City Design Review Committee supported Triban's plans for the six-unit condominiums because the plans have a historic design, and the condominiums would meet the demand for people who want to live in Ohio City but do not want single family homes. Trimble explained that the project suits the \"character of the neighborhood\" in part because the subject property was once home to a multifamily structure that burned in a fire in the 1970s. (Tr. 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Trevor Hunt, a neighborhood planner, explained that the supplemental plans submitted to the city's long-term \"20/20 Plan\" call for more dense populations near Detroit Road and Lorain Avenue in order to \"activate those streets\" with retail. In his opinion, the six-unit condominiums \"would support walkability to those establishments up and down both Detroit and Lorain Avenue.\" (Tr. 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 9} At the conclusion of the hearing, the five-member board voted unanimously to grant the variances. Sandoval and Philbin filed a timely notice of appeal to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. Cleveland filed a motion to dismiss their appeal, arguing that Sandoval and Philbin lacked standing to challenge the board's decision because they are not adjacent property owners, and they have not demonstrated that they will be directly affected by the variances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 10} While the motion was pending, Knez Construction Inc. (\"Knez\") filed a motion to substitute itself as a party to the proceedings, alleging that it was the transferee\n   of Triban's interest in the property. The trial court simultaneously granted the motion to substitute Knez and the city's motion to dismiss the appeal. In its journal entry dismissing the appeal, the trial court stated, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Appellees the city of Cleveland and B.R. Knez Construction, Inc.'s motion to dismiss the appeal are granted. Appellants lack standing to appeal the Cleveland Board of Zoning Appeals' (BZA) decision in this case because they have not demonstrated that they have suffered a unique harm as a result of the BZA's decision. * * * A property owner is directly affected by the decision \"when the party can demonstrate a unique harm.\" * * * This injury \"must be more than speculation and supported by credible evidence.\" * * * While plaintiffs speculate that the proposed development will adversely affect their property values, they have failed to present to this court any credible evidence to support their assertion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Judgment entry dated December 29, 2016, quoting\n   <em>\n    Kurtock v.

The city argues that Philbin did not attend the hearing in person and therefore\n   does not have standing. However, Philbin participated at the hearing through Sandoval as his representative, who read Philbin's letter to the board. A written copy of Philbin's letter was also submitted to the board. We recognize that zoning boards cannot accommodate everyone's schedules, and to preclude someone from participation simply because his physical presence was not possible is neither practical nor just. Moreover, the city has not provided any legal authority for its position that an individual must be physically present in order to \"actively participate\" at administrative hearings. Therefore, Philbin's letter, which was submitted in writing and spoken through a personal representative, constituted active participation at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The city also contends, citing\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1750103\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st/173/168/\">\n    173 Ohio St. 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=180%20N.E.2d%20591\">\n    180 N.E.2d 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that appellants failed to actively participate at the hearing because they were not represented by lawyers. Although the appellant in\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   was represented by counsel at the zoning hearing, representation by counsel is not a requirement of active participation at such a hearing. Individuals often represent their own interests pro se. To hold that legal representation at a zoning hearing is required for standing to file an administrative appeal would deny many aggrieved citizens access to the courts. Therefore, appellants have established that they actively participated at the hearing before the Cleveland Board of Zoning Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The more difficult question is whether appellants are directly affected by the variances in this case. Appellants contend, quoting the \"as the crow flies\" language from the dissenting opinion in\n   <em>\n    Kurtock\n   </em>\n   , that they are directly harmed by the proposed condominiums due to the close proximity of the condominiums to their home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kurtock\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

Sandoval testified that while there were no single family homes for sale in the neighborhood at the time of the hearing, there were four condominiums for sale \"according to the total 4 Realtor lockboxes on the outside of the building * * * on Franklin and 32nd.\" Appellants also provided information regarding recent sale prices of single-family homes built by Knez. This information was offered to show that the proposed condominiums are unnecessary because Knez could make a profit by building single-family homes on the property. However, appellants failed to explain how any of this evidence related to the impact the six-unit condominium building would have on the value of their single-family home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Moreover, appellants did not provide any expert evidence to support their contention that property values will decline if the condominiums are built.
