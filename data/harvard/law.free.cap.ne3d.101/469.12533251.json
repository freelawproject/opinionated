Gembarski. At issue is whether a class defined as all current and former employees who earned commissions from the sales of medical equipment and whose earned commissions were subject to rescission if the accounts were not paid within a ninety-day period satisfies the requirements of Civ.R. 23 for certification. We affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On October 1, 2012, appellee filed a class-action complaint for damages against appellee in the Summit County Court of Common Pleas. Appellee filed an answer and the case was transferred to the Portage County Court of Common Pleas by stipulation of the parties. On September 22, 2015, appellee filed a motion to certify class action and a motion to modify/amend class definition. Appellee\n   opposed the motion. On March 31, 2016, the motion to modify/amend class definition was granted On May 2, 2016, appellant filed a brief in opposition to appellee's motion to certify class action and, on June 23, 2016, a class certification hearing was held before the magistrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On September 30, 2016, the magistrate issued findings of fact and conclusions of law. The following are taken from the magistrate's findings:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} \"Mr. Gembarski was an Account Representative, i.e., salesman, who sold medical replacement parts. PartsSource is in the business of selling medical equipment replacement parts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} \"Mr. Gembarski was paid by commission only. He did not receive a salary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} \"There were allegedly at least 75 persons who were in the same position as Mr. Gembarski and earned their commissions in the same manner he did. Other employees have placed that number, to their knowledge, at anywhere between 45-65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} \"Commissions are allegedly earned when a part is sold and then delivered to a customer, and then paid to the Account Manager within 30 days therefrom on the next commission statement. Then, that money actually went into the Account Manager's paycheck and allegedly became their personal property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 8} \"PartsSource allegedly took back the commissions allegedly earned by Plaintiff and the putative class, and that money has never been returned. And this same alleged wrongful taking of the alleged earned commissions happened to Mr. Gembarski as well as approximately 75-120 other Account Managers. Mr. Gembarski has personal knowledge of the list of Account Managers PartsSource regularly sent out advising that they were having their commissions pulled, and whose complaints were exactly the same as Mr. Gembarski's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The court certified the class and defined the same as follows: \"All current and/or former PartsSource, Inc. Account Managers and/or employees who are or ever have been subject to Defendant PartsSource, Inc.'s policy and wrongful practice of reducing, withholding or deducting, i.e. taking back or 'pulling' earned commissions on sales of medical equipment and/or supplies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellant filed objections to the magistrate's decision, which were opposed by appellee. Ultimately, the trial court overruled appellant's objections and adopted the magistrate's decision. Appellant now appeals and assigns three errors for our review. Its first assignment of error provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 11} \"The trial court abused its discretion by adopting the magistrate's findings, which adopted appellee's proposed findings verbatim, over appellant's objection where the record does not contain competent and credible evidence supporting those findings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 12} \"A trial court must conduct a rigorous analysis when determining whether to certify a class pursuant to Civ.R. 23 and may grant certification only after finding that all of the requirements of the rule are satisfied; the analysis requires the court to resolve factual disputes relative to each requirement and to find, based upon those determinations, other relevant facts and the applicable legal standard, that the requirement is met.\"\n   <em>\n    Cullen v.

Appellant also notes that Charles Koch, its Chief Administrative Officer, testified that different categories of employees were compensated differently so that the titles were not interchangeable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 19} We find the objection fails to identify a recognizable error. The class certified by the trial court includes any of appellant's employees who received commissions\n   from the sale of medical equipment and/or supplies and who were subject to an allegedly improper policy of having earned commissions rescinded. Membership in the class does not depend on job title, responsibilities, or overall compensation package. Moreover, Koch testified by deposition that there were a variety of titles that were applied to salespersons who were, nonetheless, paid by commission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Appellant next asserts the magistrate erred when it found that appellee was employed with it through 2011 when, in fact, he was employed through 2012. Appellant acknowledges that the trial court recognized this objection as valid and corrected the error, but counters that if the court had conducted a thorough review of the Magistrate's Decision before adopting it, there would have been no need to raise an objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Appellant also maintains the magistrate erred when it identified appellee as an Account Representative, not acknowledging that he held other positions and/or titles during his employment with it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 22} These objections are inconsequential to the ultimate issue of class certification. As such, any error is harmless as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Next, appellant argues the magistrate erred in finding that at least 75 persons \"were in the same position as Mr. Gembarski and earned their commissions in the same manner he did.\" Appellant counters that appellee testified that he only had personal knowledge of six other employees' compensation plans and, therefore, speculated about the actual number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 24} We discern no error in the foregoing. The magistrate's finding fairly reflects appellee's testimony, which was based on complaints he heard from approximately 50 or 60 other salespersons (\"100 percent\" of them) who had commissions \"pulled back.\" The magistrate also cited the deposition testimony of Daniel Brenner, the Director of Customer Implementation for appellant, who estimated that there were between 45 and 65 persons who sell medical parts for commission at any given time. Koch in his deposition testimony referred to \"140 or so sales reps\" who had received reduced commissions over a number of years. The magistrate's finding is therefore adequately supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Appellant next contends the magistrate's finding that a salesperson's \"money actually went into the Account Manager's paycheck and allegedly became their personal property\" is based only on appellee's opinion. We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 26} The magistrate properly conditioned the status of the money that went into a salesperson's paycheck by the use of the qualifying adverb \"allegedly.\" That such money became the salesperson's personal property was not only Gembarski's opinion, but that of Brenner and Koch as well. The point at which a commission is actually earned is, of course, one of the ultimate factual issues to be decided in this case. For the purpose of class certification, the magistrate is not deciding the ultimate issues of the case, but merely describing appellee's theory of recovery. Such analysis\n   is expressly sanctioned by the Ohio Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stammco, L.L.C. v. United Tel.

After all, a class action cannot proceed without certification of a class and, in his complaint, appellee specified the details, including appellant's alleged misconduct and harm suffered by potential class members, that would be used to qualify the potential putative class members for certification. Although appellee was not a party to the arbitration provision, an issue going to typicality and adequacy, appellant had notice that other potential class members who suffered from the harm alleged in the complaint would be bound by the arbitration clause. We maintain appellant's failure to assert the arbitration defense in its answer, or a supplement thereto, or seek to enforce the right to arbitration at some point prior to its opposition to the certification was fundamentally inconsistent with its right to assert the defense. We therefore conclude the magistrate was not unreasonable in concluding appellant waived the arbitration defense to the typicality and adequacy elements of class certification.

The magistrate further determined the class action was superior to other methods of fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy because (1) no other person within the putative class expressed an interest in separately prosecuting the allegations in this matter; (2) appellee is the only current or former employee to have commenced suit relating to the alleged wrongdoing; (3) appellee sought out the forum in which the case was being prosecuted, without objection, thereby suggesting the concentration of the litigation was desirable; and (4) there would be no significant difficulty in managing the class action because each class member has a claim arising from the same nucleus of operative facts and legal theories-\"all of which can be resolved in a single stroke under the class action mechanism.\" The foregoing findings are reasonable and, as a result, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in adopting the magistrate's decision certifying the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 75} Appellant's final assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 76} For the reasons discussed in this opinion, the judgment of the Portage County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   COLLEEN MARY O'TOOLE, J., concurs with a Concurring Opinion,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   DIANE V.

It would have been premature for PartsSource to plead affirmative defenses that had no relevance to Gembarski's claims, such as the right to arbitrate, considering that Gembarski, as a non-party to the arbitration agreements, could neither have compelled or been compelled to arbitrate.
