The common pleas court dismissed the appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. After a thorough review of the record and law, this court reverses and remands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The Landmarks Commission reviewed plans for the construction of a nine-unit building in a historic district within the Ohio City neighborhood of Cleveland submitted by Vine Court Townhomes, L.L.C. (\"Vine Court\"). Vine Court sought a certificate of appropriateness from the Landmarks Commission. The commission imposed several requirements, but issued a certificate of appropriateness on November 7, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} An adjoining neighbor to the project, Carol Vang, filed an appeal to the BZA. She was the only party to file a notice of appeal, and the notice listed her as the only appellant. However, appellants participated in the hearing and offered testimony. The BZA upheld the issuance of the certificate on January 30, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Following this determination, appellants filed a notice of appeal from that decision with the common pleas court on March 1, 2017. Appellees, Vine Court and the city of Cleveland (the \"city\"), responded by filing motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On April 12, 2017, the trial court granted the motions to dismiss, finding that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the appeal because the BZA lacked jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a decision of the Landmarks Commission that did not include a request for a zoning variance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Following the dismissal of the appeal, appellants appealed to this court, assigning one error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court erred in dismissing the administrative appeal of appellants * * * as the [BZA] has subject matter jurisdiction to hear appeals from decisions regarding Certificates of Appropriateness granted or denied by the City of\n   Cleveland, Ohio Landmarks Commission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

While the city of Dayton's landmarks ordinances are structurally different from that of Cleveland's, this case informs our analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The ultimate authority for the regulation of historic structures and districts flows from a municipality's home rule authority provided by Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution. A landmarks commission is the designated body of enforcement of the above-stated goals, which deal with how a proposed project fits within the overall character of the historic district. A board of zoning appeals is the appropriate body to oversee decisions of a landmarks commission in this regard. Indeed, that has been the practice in Cleveland as testified to in the present case by a member of the Landmarks Commission at the hearing before the BZA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Vine Court and the city argue that this case presents a unique situation where a project only implicates building materials and design-a matter wholly within the jurisdiction of the BSBA. They cite to\n   <em>\n    Moore v. Bd. of Bldg. Stds. &amp; Bldg. Appeals of Cleveland\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 38360,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1979%20WL%20209956\">\n    1979 WL 209956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mar. 9, 1979), for support. In that case, this court set forth the jurisdictions of the BSBA and the BZA and found that the BSBA could not hear matters related to zoning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. However, a building plan may meet all building code requirements and still fail to satisfy criteria the Landmarks Commission uses to determine whether a project is suitable for a given landmark district.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C.C.O. 161.05(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 17} For instance, one of the changes suggested by the Landmarks Commission was for the increased setback along West 32nd Street, the addition of trim elements between units on the exterior of the building, and horizontal breaks between floors. These requirements do not come from the city's building code, but from the Landmarks Commission's review of the plans and how they fit within the historic district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Appellees claim that the Landmarks Chapter of Cleveland's Codified Ordinances is incorporated into the city's building code. C.C.O. 161.09(e) provides that \"[t]he provisions of [the Landmarks Chapter] shall be in addition to all other applicable provisions of the Building Code of the City of Cleveland.\" The provision does not incorporate the Landmarks Chapter into the city's building code, but acknowledges that is a separate requirement. Further, the building code does not regulate the activity at issue, and Vine Court's allusions to C.C.O. 3101.02 are unavailing. The portion cited by Vine Court provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   The provisions of this Building Code shall apply to the location, design, materials, construction, alteration, repair, equipment, use and occupancy, maintenance, removal and demolition of every building and other structure, and to any appurtenances connected or attached to such buildings and other structures, except as such matters are otherwise\n   specifically provided for in the Charter or under other titles of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   However, the Landmarks Chapter specifically provides for regulation of landmark districts and buildings within the city's ordinances, i.e. are \"such matters are otherwise specifically provided for in the Charter or under other titles of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The city and Vine Court also point to the language in Section 76-6 of the Cleveland Charter and claim that it clearly indicates that the BSBA has jurisdiction over the determination of the Landmarks Commission in this case. Specifically, the reservation of authority to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   hear and decide appeals from, and to review upon motion of any member of the Board, any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Commissioner of Building and Housing, or of any other administrative official or agency of the City,\n   <em>\n    relating to the location, design, materials, construction, alteration, repair, equipment, use or occupancy, maintenance, removal or demolition, of any building or other structure\n   </em>\n   * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Cleveland Charter, Section 76-6(d). However, appellees appear to ignore the modifying clause \"regulated by the Building Code of the City of Cleveland, and any rule or regulation or amendment or repeals thereof made by said officials or agencies under the authority conferred upon them by the Building Code of the City of Cleveland * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Whether a proposed building project adheres to the aesthetic character of a historic district is not a matter contained within the Building Code of the city of Cleveland.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, as set forth above, a building code is not the source of authority for the Landmarks Commission or its rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Where the Division of Building and Housing has authority over a given section of the landmarks ordinances, their authority is specifically referenced. In the section of the ordinances that set forth minimum maintenance requirements, the Division of Building and Housing is specifically called on to enforce such minimum requirements. C.C.O. 161.09(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Here, the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness was in essence a zoning determination. The property in question is a vacant lot. The determination of the Landmarks Commission necessarily involved only whether the proposed construction fits within the overall character of the historic district because there was no modification of existing historic structures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In a case where a proposed project does not require a variance from an applicable zoning regulation set forth in C.C.O. Chapter 329, but may be inappropriate for a landmark district, the considerations necessarily include whether the proposed project would adversely affect the historic and aesthetic nature of the property and the landmarks district. C.C.O. 161.05(d). This is a matter of zoning within the historic district. Indeed, Vine Court acknowledged in its letter to the BZA that the Landmarks Commission decision \"focused on making certain Vine Court's proposed town homes would not change the character of the area.\" This is not a matter related to the building code. This is a matter with which the BZA is familiar and entrusted by the municipality to undertake. The BZA found as much in overruling Vine Court's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 23} While the Landmarks Chapter does not specify which entity has jurisdiction over an appeal from its decisions, the Landmarks Commission's decisions derive,\n   in part, from the municipality's zoning authority, which is the province of the BZA. The city is free to specify in its ordinances to which board an appeal from a decision of the Landmarks Commission should be taken. The fact that it does not leads to situations where aggrieved property owners and project developers are left without meaningful review of the decisions of the Landmarks Commission if they guess wrong in attempting to divine to which board they should appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 24} A member of the Landmarks Commission testified before the BZA, and stated that, traditionally, the BZA has heard appeals from Landmarks Commission decisions. The city and Vine Court have not set forth a sound justification for bifurcating jurisdiction between various boards of review where a zoning variance is not requested, because the decision draws its essence from zoning considerations, and not from the city's building code. The city's charter does not offer that justification where decisions regarding the preservation of historic districts are akin to zoning determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Here, the common pleas court accepted the argument that because no variance was requested, the BZA was not the appropriate body to hear the appeal. Even where no variance is sought, the BZA still has the authority to review decisions about whether a project complies with the existing character of the historic district. The common pleas court did not address the merits of the appeal before it. Therefore, we must remand for the court to consider the merits of the appeal.\n   <em>\n    Lycan v.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 26} The common pleas court erred when it determined the BZA, and by implication of the court itself, did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal before it. The BZA is the appropriate entity to review decisions of the Landmarks Commission. However, this court makes no ruling on the merits of the appeal. That decision, in the first instance, must be made by the common pleas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 27} This cause is reversed and remanded to the lower court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   KATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH, P.J., and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   PATRICIA ANN BLACKMON, J., CONCUR\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The city uses the building codes of Ohio.
