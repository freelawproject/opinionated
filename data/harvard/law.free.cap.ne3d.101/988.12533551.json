Emmerling, individually and as the personal representative of the Estate of Robert M. Emmerling (\"Emmerling\"), appeals the decision of the Mahoning County Common Pleas Court granting summary judgment to Appellee, Mahoning County Board of Commissioners. This matter involves a wrongful death action based on road signs placed under Appellee's authority. Because the signs in questions are not mandatory pursuant to the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (\"OMUTCD\"), Appellant has not established that any exception to general governmental immunity exists. Moreover, Appellant has failed to establish any proximate causation between the actions of Appellee and the incident in question. Therefore, Appellant's assignment of error is without merit and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The following facts are derived from the record. On March 21, 2012, Appellant's spouse, Robert M. Emmerling, was operating a motorcycle in the left-hand lane of southbound South Avenue approaching McClurg Road in Boardman, Ohio. At the same time, Alex Tareshawty (\"Tareshawty\"), operating a minivan, was waiting to turn left onto northbound South Avenue. Traffic on South Avenue did not have any \"stop\" indicator at the McClurg Road intersection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} After stopping in the marked lane on McClurg Road preparatory to making his left turn onto South Avenue, Tareshawty slowly moved his vehicle forward in an effort to better see the traffic on South Avenue. Tareshawty looked to the left and to the right multiple times before proceeding to make his left turn onto northbound South Avenue. When Tareshawty entered South Avenue, Emmerling's motorcycle collided with the side of Tareshawty's minivan. From the time he began his left turn until the moment of collision, Tareshawty continued to look only to his left, toward the direction Emmerling was proceeding. When Tareshawty first saw the motorcycle, it was too late to stop so he attempted to speed up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Tareshawty testified that the motorcycle \"seemed to appear out of nowhere.\" (Tareshawty Depo., p. 80.) Tareshawty specifically testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Q. Was there anything that in your experience before the date of the collision, that obstructed a driver's view to the left, when preparing to make a turn from McClurg onto north bound South Avenue?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Q. Did any of the signs or telephone poles in your estimation obstruct a driver's view when turning from McClurg onto north bound South Avenue?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Tareshawty Depo., pp. 46-47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Tareshawty further testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Q. Is it correct then that from the time you decided to try to pull out to make your turn until the time of impact, you were looking left towards the direction where the motorcycle was coming from?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q. Do you have any idea why you didn't see the motorcycle until the front end of your car was in that center turn lane* * *?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Q. Do you know why you failed to see the motorcycle before it was too late to avoid the collision?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   MR. MEOLA: Objection. Asked and answered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE WITNESS: I don't know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Tareshawty Depo., pp. 87, 89.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Emmerling passed away on April 19, 2012. Appellant filed a complaint against Appellee on March 20, 2014, seeking, among other things, damages for the wrongful death of her spouse. Appellant contends that Tareshawty's view of oncoming traffic was obstructed by signs erected by Appellee on the west side of South Avenue that were put in place contrary to the requirements of the OMUTCD, and that this obstruction was a proximate cause of her husband's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The three signs in contention were mounted on the same two posts. At the top was a two-way left turn sign. In the middle was a hospital sign. Below the hospital sign was a directional arrow sign indicating the direction of the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In 2010, before the accident in question, Appellee hired DLZ Ohio, Inc., professional engineers, to study the intersection. This site had been an area where other accidents had occurred. The purpose of the study was to identify problems, determine countermeasures, and set up reasonable time periods to implement the proposed countermeasures. In October 2010, Appellee received a report from DLZ. A copy of the report was entered into evidence and an engineer employed by Appellee testified at deposition as to the report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q The safety study that the Mahoning County Engineer hired DLZ to perform explained what the most frequent type of crash was at that intersection; right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Q What kind of crash was that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A Left turn crashes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Q The most-strike that. The safety study the Mahoning County engineer commissioned to have done told Mahoning County well before Robert Emmerling's fatal crash that the most common type of crash was the very type that he had; right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A Oh, yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (Donham Depo., p. 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 9} During deposition, Robert Donham II, traffic engineer for the Mahoning County Engineer's Office, stated that from 2005 to 2012, there were 62 crashes at the intersection. The DLZ report recommended that the signs be moved as a short term countermeasure. While Donham instructed that the hospital sign and arrow sign should be moved, he also instructed that no special trip needed to be made to the intersection to carry out this instruction. The signs were not moved until after the Emmerling accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Donham testified further that the bottom of the highest sign, the two-way left turn sign, was supposed to be at least seven feet from the ground. Any signs mounted below this sign could only be set one foot lower than the minimum height, which in this case meant set at six feet. Donham stated that on the date of the accident, the bottom of the hospital sign was five feet from the ground and the bottom of the directional arrow for the hospital was four and one half feet from the ground. Paul W. Dorothy, one of Appellee's expert witnesses, testified at deposition that the bottom of the directional arrow for the hospital was lower, approximately four feet two and one-half inches from the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Both parties presented the opinions of accident reconstruction experts on the issue of whether or not these signs played any role in the accident. Appellant's expert, Michael Sutton, P.E., gave his opinion that the location of the hospital and accompanying directional arrow signs explain why Tareshawty stated that Emmerling\n   appeared to come out of nowhere. He opined that these signs blocked Tareshawty's view, thus contributing to the accident. Sean A. Doyle, P.E., Appellee's expert, on the other hand opined that the existence and signage location played absolutely no role in the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On March 16, 2015, Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that, as a political subdivision, it was immune from tort liability, that there were no exceptions to its immunity, and that Appellant had no evidence to establish a proximate cause between any alleged negligence of Appellee and the accident. Appellant filed a memorandum in opposition, to which Appellee replied. On August 19, 2015, the trial court granted Appellee's motion for summary judgment, concluding that Appellee was immune from any tort liability and Appellant could not establish that a proximate cause existed between the location of the signs and the accident. Appellant filed this timely appeal setting forth a single assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF APPELLEE BASED UPON AN IMPROPER APPLICATION OF POLITICAL SUBDIVISION IMMUNITY AND BASED UPON IMPROPERLY RESOLVING QUESTIONS OF FACT IN APPELLEE'S FAVOR.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 13} An appellate court conducts a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of a trial court's decision to grant summary judgment, using the same standards as the trial court, set forth in Civ.R. 56(C).\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

Before summary judgment can be granted, the trial court must determine that: (1) no genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing the evidence most favorably in favor of the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, the conclusion is adverse to that party.\n   <em>\n    Temple v.

The first tier requires a determination of whether the political subdivision is immune from liability because the alleged negligent acts occur in connection with a governmental or proprietary function pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(A). If immunity is found to exist after this first tier review, determination under the second tier requires an examination of whether any of the five exceptions to immunity listed in R.C. 2744.02(B) are involved.\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. If one of these exceptions applies, then there must be a third tier examination to see whether any defenses found in R.C. 2744.03 reinstate immunity from suit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Regarding the first tier, the parties agree that in providing and maintaining public roadways, Appellee is a political subdivision engaged in governmental or proprietary conduct and is entitled to immunity from tort liability under R.C. 2744.02(A).

Under R.C. 2744.02(B)(3), the \"negligent failure\" to keep the signs \"in repair\" would expose Appellee to liability for injury, death, or loss to person caused by its negligence. The trial court, in granting Appellee's motion for summary judgment, concluded that none of the three signs at issue here are mandatory pursuant to the OMUTCD. Therefore, the exception to immunity found in R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) does not apply to expose Appellee to suit. (The proximate cause of this accident was also at issue, and is separately discussed). Although Appellant\n   does not maintain that the two-way left turn directional sign is mandatory, Appellant does assert that the hospital sign and/or its accompanying directional sign are mandated by the OMUTCD. Appellee argues that none of these three signs are mandated, and the trial court properly granted summary judgment on this issue to Appellee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The OMUTCD includes text headings to classify and categorize the nature of its accompanying text.

OMUTCD 2TC-1. Chapter 2D is titled \"Guide Signs-Conventional Roads.\" Section 2D.45 is titled \"General Service Signs.\" OMUTCD, p. 2D-27. This section explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   On conventional roads, commercial services such as gas, food, and lodging generally are within sight and are available to the road user at reasonably frequent intervals along the route. Consequently, on this class of road there usually is no need for special signs calling attention to these services. Moreover, General Service signing is usually not required in urban areas except for hospitals, law enforcement assistance, tourist information centers, and camping.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   OMUTCD, p. 2D-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Appellant contends that the hospital sign in question is \"mandated\" by the section quoted above because of the use of the word \"required.\" Thus, she believes the hospital and/or arrow signs are \"mandatory\" for our purposes pursuant to the OMUTCD, and the incorrect placement of these signs, alone, amounts to a failure of Appellee to keep the roadway in repair, triggering an exception to immunity. However, this language falls under the general heading of \"Support,\" the lowest classification of signage, which Appellee says reflects that there is no degree of mandate, recommendation, authorization, prohibition, or enforceable condition.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206036950\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, none of this language is in bold type.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Appellant attached to its brief in opposition to summary judgment a report from Eric A.

In it, Hulme opines that the disputed language \"provides a necessity to install the general services sign for hospitals in urban areas.\" (5/15/15 Opp. to S.J., Exh. N, p. 14). Thus, the question presented is whether the language stating that general service signing \"is usually not required in urban areas except for hospitals\" makes the hospital sign mandatory in the OMUTCD despite\n   the fact that it clearly falls under the heading of \"Support\" and is not printed in bold type.

In\n   <em>\n    Deitz\n   </em>\n   a representative of the estate of a motorist killed in an automobile accident brought suit against a township board of trustees alleging that the failure to remove foliage obstructing a stop sign and the failure to place a \"stop\n   ahead\" sign at a sufficient distance from the stop sign caused the motorist's death, and that this failure triggered an exception to the immunity of the political subdivision. The Third District held that the stop sign was not mandatory, hence the failure to place a \"stop ahead\" sign did not fit within the definition of the requirement to keep the \"public roads \"in repair\" in order to trigger the exception to political subdivision immunity found in R.C. 2744.02(B)(3). The court determined that the general assembly, in amending R.C. 2744 in 2003, added the definition of \"public roads\" but removed the \"nuisance\" language previously found in R.C. 2744.02(B)(3), replacing it with \"obstruction.\" Prior to 2003, this section read:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   (3) Political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to persons or property caused by their failure to keep public roads, highways, streets, avenues, alleys, sidewalks, bridges, aqueducts, viaducts, or public grounds within the political subdivisions open, in repair, and free from nuisance, except that it is a full defense to such liability, when a bridge within a municipal corporation is involved, that the municipal corporation does not have the responsibility for maintaining or inspecting the bridge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 32} After 2003, this section now states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (3) Except as otherwise provided in section 3746.24 of the Revised Code, political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by their negligent failure to keep public roads in repair and other negligent failure to remove obstructions from public roads, except that it is a full defense to that liability, when a bridge within a municipal corporation is involved, that the municipal corporation does not have the responsibility for maintaining or inspecting the bridge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Thus, the general assembly did not intend all erected traffic control devices to be considered part of a public road.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b629.

The phrase has not been held broad enough to encompass the design or construction of roadways and, as such, we cannot conclude that the erection of the hospital or arrow signs in question fall within the meaning of keeping this roadway \"in repair\". Neither of these signs falls within the highest category of the OMUTCD; the \"Standard\" classification. Despite the manual's use of the word \"required\" when discussing hospital\n   signage in the lowest, or \"Support\" classification, none of this language is found in bold face. Hence, the hospital and arrow sign placement was discretionary with Appellee. There is no genuine issue of material fact that the signs were deteriorated or disassembled. Appellant contends that the signs should have been placed in a different position, but this involves use of discretion and an issue of roadway design or construction. The phrase \"in repair\" does not create a duty to change the position of the signs at issue. The trial court correctly determined that no exception to Appellee's immunity exists, here. We must note that even if we were to hold that the sign placements were included within the duty to keep roadways \"in repair\" and found that Appellee's action in placing these signs created an exception to immunity, immunity would be restored by the defense of Appellee's use of discretion as codified in R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) and (5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 34} R.C. 2744.03(A) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (A) In a civil action brought against a political subdivision or an employee of a political subdivision to recover damages for injury, death, or loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or omission in connection with a governmental or proprietary function, the following defenses or immunities may be asserted to establish nonliability:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (3) The political subdivision is immune from liability if the action or failure to act by the employee involved that gave rise to the claim of liability was within the discretion of the employee with respect to policy-making, planning, or enforcement powers by virtue of the duties and responsibilities of the office or position of the employee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (5) The political subdivision is immune from liability if the injury, death, or loss to person or property resulted from the exercise of judgment or discretion in determining whether to acquire, or how to use, equipment, supplies, materials, personnel, facilities, and other resources unless the judgment or discretion was exercised with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 35} The Supreme Court of Ohio distinguished between R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) and (5) noting:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Although both R.C. 2744.03(A)(5) and 2744.03(A)(3) concern an employee's discretionary acts, the focus of subsection (A)(3) is that the employee be engaged in policy-making, planning, or enforcement. Also unlike R.C. 2744.03(A)(5), R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) does not have language limiting its grant of immunity. In other words, a political subdivision may assert the immunity defense when an employee who has the duty and responsibility for policy-making, planning or enforcement by virtue of office or position actually exercises discretion with respect to that power. This immunity exists even if the discretionary actions were done recklessly or with bad faith or malice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    Elston v.

Appellant urges that the removal or correction of the height of the hospital and arrow signs are directly analogous to the failure to fill a pothole.

(Appellee's Brf., p. 19.) Appellee is correct, here. The very evidence on which Appellant relies, the DLZ study, leads to the conclusion that moving the signs was discretionary with Appellee. Further, neither the study nor the statute impose \"reasonable time\" limitations on Appellee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Lastly, Appellant complains the trial court erred because it resolved disputed questions of fact in favor of Appellee with regard to the issue of causation.

The record showed the accident was caused by a tortfeasor who was speeding and looking the other way. In\n   <em>\n    Abbuhl\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that summary judgment was appropriate even if there was negligence with regard to the installation of the lighting, because the lighting was not a proximate cause of the accident.

Appellant argues that the trial court premised its decision entirely on Tareshawty's testimony that the signs did not block his view. In so doing, Appellant complains that the court ignored Tareshawty's testimony that although he repeatedly looked left before his turn, he did not see the approaching motorcycle; that from the time he began his turn until the collision he was looking in the direction of the oncoming motorcycle and, despite this, the motorcycle seemed to appear out of nowhere. Tareshawty was unable to explain why he did not see the motorcycle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Appellant posits that her accident reconstruction expert, Sutton, based his opinion on Tareshawty's testimony. It was Sutton's opinion the hospital sign and the directional arrow sign blocked Tareshawty's view during the most critical few seconds when Tareshawty was making the decision to enter the intersection. Sutton testified that if you accept Tareshawty's testimony, when he crept up to the intersection he was put into an area where the sign would block a view of the victim's motorcycle. Sutton concluded that the most logical explanation is that the motorcycle was not in view because the sign blocked it. Sutton relies heavily on the fact that at the time of the accident, Tareshawty was only sixteen years old. Appellant also complains that the trial court, in concluding that there was no genuine issue of material fact, failed to consider the DLZ report and recommendation. The recommendation to correct the height of the signs was made more than one year before the accident and Donham gave instructions more than one year before the accident that the height of the signs should be corrected. Appellant argues that this combination of facts create a genuine issue of material fact whether the signs were a proximate cause of the accident and ultimate death of Emmerling. Appellant emphasizes that Tareshawty's testimony is but the testimony of one witness. Appellant urges that the jury should be allowed to weigh his testimony along with all of the foregoing facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 42} In response, Appellee contends that the trial court was correct in its determination that Sutton's opinion is mere speculation and conjecture. Appellee cites\n   <em>\n    Allen v. USA Parking Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 7th Dist. No. 10 MA 0175,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011-Ohio-6642\">\n    2011-Ohio-6642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206793694\">\n    2011 WL 6793694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 46, as support for this position.\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   concerned a plaintiff's alternative theory that loose concrete had contributed to the plaintiff's fall. The plaintiff could not see the pavement below the layer of ice and snow that covered the area in which he fell, but saw loose concrete in some other area of the parking lot. We concluded that plaintiff's belief that there \"must be\" loose concrete in the area he actually fell was mere speculation on the part of the plaintiff. As such, it could not serve to raise a genuine issue of material fact. Appellee also relies on our decision in\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins. Co. v. Sears\n   </em>\n   , 7th Dist. No. 06 BE 0010,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007-Ohio-4977\">\n    2007-Ohio-4977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202758700\">\n    2007 WL 2758700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 74, where we noted that Allstate failed to present any evidence, despite an opportunity to submit additional evidence, that Sears breached a duty or that some act or failure to act on the part of Sears caused the fire in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Appellee is correct that Appellant's expert relies on mere conjecture. Appellant's witness, Tareshawty, directly stated under oath that his view was not obstructed and that he had no idea why he did not see the decedent and his motorcycle. While Appellant's expert speculates that this must be due to the signage blocking Tareshawty's view, the direct and unwavering testimony of the eyewitness directly\n   contradicts this theory. This is not a case where there is no witness testimony on an issue, or the witness' memory is somehow impaired giving rise to the use of an expert to reconstruct events. This witness, the tortfeasor, stated under oath that he was constantly looking in the direction of the deceased and that no \"signs or telephone poles\" obstructed his view of South Avenue as he attempted to turn onto that street. Tareshawty did not equivocate. Hence, the expert's opinion that these signs could obstruct the view of any other driver is meaningless in this case where the driver states that the facts are otherwise. As to Tareshawty's youth or the length of time that passed between the decision of Appellee's employee to move the signs and the actual date they were moved, these facts are also immaterial to this case. The driver's view was not obstructed. He simply failed to see the motorcyclist until it was too late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 44} \"[T]he proximate cause of an event is that which in a natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by any new, independent cause, produces that event and without which that event would not have occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Aiken v. Indus. Comm.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1031887\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st/143/113/#p117\">\n    143 Ohio St. 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 117,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20N.E.2d%201018\">\n    53 N.E.2d 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1944). The driver unequivocally states the signs played no role in this accident. Appellant's expert issued an affidavit stating that his logical deduction was that placement of the signs caused this accident. In so doing, that expert analyzed only a drawing of the incident. While he testified that with a reasonable degree of engineering certainty the signs must have played a role in obstructing Tareshawty's view, this was directly contradicted by the only person who could testify with absolute certainty as to the facts. Sutton's testimony cannot serve to create a conflict of fact where none exists. Appellee's expert, who actually went to the site of the accident and utilized the same calculations as Appellant's expert, concluded that the driver's view would not be obstructed by the signs. If this matter involved only the two expert opinions, genuine issues of fact would be raised by these opinions. These opinions are immaterial, however, given the concise testimony of Tareshawty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Based on the foregoing, Appellee is immune from suit. The parties admit that, unless an exception to immunity can be found, blanket immunity exists. The signs in question are not subject to mandatory requirements of the OMUTCD, and hence the manner and mode of placement were discretionary acts by Appellee and do not run afoul of their duty to keep the public roadways in repair. Even if the signs were considered mandatory, Appellant has not established a causal connection between the driver's conduct and any actionable conduct by Appellee. Appellant's expert witness provides mere conjecture, here, which cannot create a material dispute in fact. The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to Appellee. Appellant's assignment of error is without merit and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Donofrio, J., dissents; see dissenting opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   DeGenaro, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-96\">\n   DONOFRIO, J. dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Because I would find that genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment, I respectfully dissent from the majority's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 47} The determination of whether or not a political subdivision is generally immune from tort liability for injuries or death to a person is a three-tiered analysis.\n   <em>\n    Rastaedt v.

Thus, I will address the second and third tiers of the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 49} As to the second tier, appellant argues that R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) removes the immunity protection enjoyed by appellee. That section provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by their negligent failure to keep public roads in repair and other negligent failure to remove obstructions from public roads[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 50} \"Public roads\" are defined in R.C. 2744.01(H) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   \"Public roads\" means public roads, highways, streets, avenues, alleys, and bridges within a political subdivision. \"Public roads\" does not include berms, shoulders, rights-of-way, or traffic control devices unless the traffic control devices are mandated by the Ohio manual of uniform traffic control devices.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 51} If the signs in this case are mandated by the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (\"OMUTCD\"), they are included in the definition of a public road.

The negligent failure to keep the signs [public roads] \"in repair\" would expose appellee to liability for injury, death, or loss to person caused by its negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 52} The trial court, in granting appellee's motion for summary judgment, concluded that none of the three signs questioned here are mandatory and, therefore, appellee's immunity was not excepted by R.C. 2744.02(B)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Appellant argues that either, or both, the hospital sign and the accompanying directional sign are mandated by the OMUTCD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Whether or not the hospital sign was mandatory, once appellee erected the hospital sign, it was mandatory that a directional message be posted. The General Service Signs section provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    General Service signs, if used at intersections, shall be accompanied by a directional message.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   (Emphasis in original). This section is not only in bold type, it is under the heading \"Standard\", meaning that it is mandatory or required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Once the hospital sign was installed, a directional message became mandatory. Although appellee may have had discretion as to what type of \"directional message\" to employ, once it made that decision, its directional message had to comply with the height requirements of the OMUTCD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   {\u00b6 56} As to the part of R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) that makes political subdivisions liable for injury or death \"caused by their negligent failure to keep public roads in repair,\" the statute does not define \"in repair.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   {\u00b6 57} The trial court, and appellee, rely upon our decision in\n   <em>\n    Bonace v. Springfield Twp\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3437775\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/179/736/\">\n    179 Ohio App.3d 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-6364\">\n    2008-Ohio-6364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20N.E.2d%20683\">\n    903 N.E.2d 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Dist.). The trial court emphasized the example given in\n   <em>\n    Bonace\n   </em>\n   of fixing holes and crumbling pavement in a street with regard to the meaning of \"in repair.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29. Appellee argues that the ordinary meaning of \"in repair\" does not include a sign that is not in conformity with the height requirements of the OMUTCD. However, this court did not limit the meaning of the words \"in repair\" to only situations of deterioration or disrepair. This was the interpretation of the trial court. (Judgment Entry, p. 7). Further, this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Bonace\n   </em>\n   did not rest upon an interpretation of the words \"in repair.\" Rather, we concluded that the township did not lose its immunity there because the conditions at issue in\n   <em>\n    Bonace\n   </em>\n   did \"not deal with a failure to make a repair, but rather constitute failures to construct or problems with design.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31. And we concluded that the conditions involved ditches and berms, which are not part of a public road as defined in R.C. 2744.02(B)(3). The parties do not dispute that the signs here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Bonace\n   </em>\n   , were installed after the original road construction and were not a part of the original design and construction. Based on the facts in this case, a jury could find that an improperly installed sign constituted a negligent failure to keep a public road in repair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   {\u00b6 58} The trial court concluded that even if appellant established an exception to immunity pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(B)(3), appellee was nevertheless entitled to summary judgment since it had a defense under R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) and R.C. 2744.03(A)(5). This is the third tier of analysis.\n   <em>\n    Rastaedt\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   {\u00b6 59} R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the action or failure to act by the employee involved that gave rise to the claim of liability was within the discretion of the employee with respect to policy-making, planning, or enforcement powers by virtue of the duties and responsibilities of the office or position of the employee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   And R.C. 2744.03(A)(5) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the injury, death, or loss to person or property resulted from the exercise of judgment or discretion in determining whether to acquire, or how to use, equipment, supplies, materials, personnel, facilities, and other resources unless the judgment or discretion was exercised with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   {\u00b6 60} The trial court found that the decision to either raise or remove the signs was discretionary. The trial court then concluded that appellant offered no evidence that this decision was made with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner. Thus, the trial court held that these two statutes reinstated sovereign immunity and summary judgment for appellee was appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b6 61} Once appellee knew the height of the sign was contrary to the requirements of the OMUTCD, any decisions about how to correct the problem were not the type of judgment or discretion intended in R.C. 2744.03(A)(5). How to correct the height problem was not an executive or planning function, nor did it require a policy decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   {\u00b6 62} Even if the decision to correct the problem with the height requirements was discretionary, appellee still had a duty to correct the situation within a reasonable time.

(Donham Dep. 71). A year later, at the time of the accident, they had not been moved. (Donham Dep. 71). According to Donham, the cost to remove the two signs was \"incidental * * * virtually nothing.\" (Donham Dep. 60-61). It was \"a pretty easy thing to do.\" (Donham Dep. 87-88). Thus, appellee had to implement its decision to move the sign in a reasonable amount of time and, considering the above\n   facts, whether it did so is a genuine issue of material fact making summary judgment inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   {\u00b6 64} Moreover, I would find the trial court erred by resolving disputed questions of fact in favor of appellee with regard to the issue of causation. Another reason offered by the trial court for granting summary judgment was that appellant could not establish probable cause. The trial court concluded that the accident reconstruction expert's opinion offered by appellant was mere speculation because the expert never visited the site and did not have specific information regarding where Tareshawty was located in the roadway prior to the accident.

This is the testimony emphasized by the trial court. But we must consider the balance of Tareshawty's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   {\u00b6 67} Tareshawty further testified that on the day of the collision he first stopped at the white line on the pavement marking the point at which he should stop. (Tareshawty Depo. 59). He then \"creeped\" his vehicle forward in order to see the north bound traffic proceeding down a hill. (Tareshawty Depo. 59-60). The reason he crept forward is because cars in the far right hand lane on McClurg proceeding in the same direction (easterly) as Tareshawty were blocking his view of the north bound traffic on South Avenue. (Tareshawty Dep. 59-60). Tareshawty continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   Q How did creeping forward affect your ability to see traffic coming from your left, if at all?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   A Um, I really don't remember.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   (Tareshawty Dep. 61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   {\u00b6 68} Tareshawty testified that traffic in both directions was heavy that day and that he could not tell how long he waited before attempting his left hand turn. (Tareshawty Dep. 61). But, he said, it seemed like a long time. (Tareshawty Dep. 61). He testified that he looked left and right multiple times. (Tareshawty Dep. 66). He also testified that there were no distractions with regard to his ability to focus on his driving. (Tareshawty Dep. 67-71). When he concluded that it was safe to enter the intersection and make his turn, Tareshawty said there was a car in the western most\n   lane of South Avenue traveling south which was slowing down, with the right turn signal on, to make a right hand turn onto McClurg. (Tareshawty Dep. 72, 79). At this point he decided he had enough room with regard to the oncoming north bound traffic on South Avenue to make his turn. (Tareshawty Dep. 80).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   {\u00b6 69} When he proceeded, he said the motorcycle seemed to appear out of nowhere. (Tareshawty Dep. 80). He first saw the motorcycle while he was turning. (Tareshawty Dep. 83). From the moment he first saw the motorcycle until the impact was \"maybe a second, not much more than that.\" (Tareshawty Dep. 84-85). Once he began his turn, he never looked back to the right but was looking to the left the entire time. (Tareshawty Dep. 86-87).

STRAUCH:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   Q Do you know why you failed to see the motorcycle before it was too late to avoid the collision?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   MR. MEOLA: Objection. Asked and answered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   THE WITNESS: I don't know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   (Tareshawty Dep. 89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   {\u00b6 70} Although his estimation was that there were no telephone poles or signs that blocked his view, Tareshawty clearly was at a loss to explain what he did wrong or why the motorcycle appeared out of nowhere. (Tareshawty Dep. 80, 89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   {\u00b6 71} Not only did the trial court fail to consider the balance of Tareshawty's testimony, it improperly gave greater weight to only a portion of Tareshawty's testimony, especially when considered in light of the other evidence offered by appellant. Michael Sutton, a licensed professional engineer employed by Accident Research Specialists, PLLC, provided an affidavit which stated, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   In addition, I also concluded that based on the location where Mr. Tareshawty testified he stopped, Mr. Emmerling's speed and location, as well as the geometry of the sight obstruction created by the location of the signs, all explained why Mr. Tareshawty did not see the motorcycle when he looked to his left prior to pulling into the intersection while he was making the decision to pull into traffic.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   (Sutton Affidavit, \u00b6 4). Sutton stated that he was not addressing why the sign was or was not there but, rather, the question of whether the location of the sign is consistent with why Tareshawty looked and did not see the motorcycle. (Sutton Dep. 31). He concluded that the signs not only blocked the view on South Avenue, but they blocked the view at a critical time. (Sutton Dep. 31-32). It was his opinion, within a reasonable degree of engineering certainty, that it was the arrow sign that blocked Tareshawty's view. (Sutton Dep. 32). Sutton opined that, looking at the physical evidence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   [I]f you look at his [Tareshawty's] deposition testimony about where he crept up to, it puts him right in the area where that sign will block the motorcycle for a period of time. So when the-when the driver of the van tells me that he looked several times back and forth, he didn't see anything coming, the most likely and the most logical explanation is the motorcycle wasn't in view because of the sign.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   (Sutton Dep. 33). When confronted with Tareshawty's testimony that in his [Tareshawty's] estimation the signs did not obstruct a driver's view, Sutton explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   [E]ither the signs blocked his view of traffic or he was in a position where the signs were not a factor and he looked right at the motorcycle and pulled out in front of it. But, I think, based on every-everything that has been documented about these signs and the-and, for instance, the safety report I reviewed, acknowledges that the signs block oncoming traffic. And it fits this accident, because he says, (as read) \"I looked and I never saw the motorcycle till it was hitting me.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   (Sutton Dep. 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   {\u00b6 72} By emphasizing only Tareshawty's estimation about the signs, and ignoring the balance of Tareshawty's testimony, the expert's opinions, and the other attendant facts, the trial court weighed the evidence, which it is not permitted to do in ruling on a summary judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   {\u00b6 73} For these reasons, I would reverse the decision granting summary judgment and would remand the matter to the trial court.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
