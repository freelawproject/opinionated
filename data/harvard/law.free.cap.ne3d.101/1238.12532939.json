On appeal, ODJFS raises one assignment of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Because Mr. Clark's agency-level appeal request was untimely, the lower court erred by failing to either affirm the Administrative Appeal Decision, which dismissed Mr. Clark's administrative appeal request, or dismiss Mr. Clark's appeal to court for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} We find merit to ODJFS's assignment of error and reverse and remand for the common pleas court to dismiss Clark's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural History and Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Clark applied for Medicaid benefits with ODJFS in February 2015. Clark was a resident of Walton Manor, a nursing home, and sought the benefits to pay for the cost of care. On June 8, 2015, however, ODJFS denied Clark's application, finding\n   that his resources exceeded the maximum allowed for eligibility. Clark appealed ODJFS's denial, but ODJFS overruled Clark's appeal on September 1, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Attached to ODJFS's state hearing decision was a notice, explaining the decision as well as the formal steps that Clark needed to take if he disagreed with the decision and wanted to file an appeal. Specifically, the notice stated, \"Your written request must be received by the Bureau of State Hearings within 15 calendar days from the mailing date of this notice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} After the hearing, but before the appeal deadline passed, the nursing facility policy administrator for the Ohio Department of Medicaid, Cheryl Guyman, emailed Walton Manor, informing the staff member in charge of Clark's case that ODJFS's denial of benefits was improper. Guyman stated, \"The hearing officer is not basing his decision on the most recent CMS guidance which is in the State Medical Director Letters. You need to request an Administrative Appeal Request by email or phone.\" Unfortunately, when the staff member tried to forward this information to Clark's attorney, she sent it to the incorrect email address. As a result, Clark's attorney did not receive it until September 18, 2015. Upon receiving this information, Clark's counsel and Walton Manor appealed the administrative decision on behalf of Clark on September 18, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On September 22, 2015, ODJFS dismissed Clark's request as untimely. Clark appealed to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, contesting the dismissal as error. The court determined that Clark's \"request for an administrative appeal with the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services was improperly denied as being untimely\" and remanded the appeal to ODJFS for a hearing on the merits in accordance with the correct eligibility criteria. On April 6, 2017, ODJFS appealed the lower court's decision to this court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

A similar argument was raised in\n   <em>\n    Stoyer v. Ohio Dept. of Job &amp; Family Servs.\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. Franklin No. 08AP-1118,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-2658\">\n    2009-Ohio-2658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201637684\">\n    2009 WL 1637684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There, the Tenth District Court of Appeals reviewed a nearly identical case, where the appellant appealed ODJFS's decision one day after the 15-day deadline. ODJFS dismissed the appeal as untimely and, on appeal, the common pleas court affirmed the dismissal. On review, the Tenth District noted that \"[t]he Ninth District Court of Appeals has concluded that if the request is even one day late * * * the appeal must be dismissed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9, citing\n   <em>\n    Grill II,\n   </em>\n   9th Dist. Summit No. 02CA0039-M,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003-Ohio-1139\">\n    2003-Ohio-1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%201041343\">\n    2003 WL 1041343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    B.B.\n   </em>\n   The Tenth District noted, however, that Ohio Adm.Code 5101:6-8-01(C)(4) and (E)(1), \"when read in conjunction[,]\" may infer \"that timeliness of the request is within the sound discretion of the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. Nevertheless, the Tenth District ultimately found that \"it [was] uncontested that Stoyer did not mail his notice until after the time period had\n   run.\" As a result, the court concluded \"that the court of common pleas did not abuse its discretion in affirming the dismissal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Subsection (C)(4) requires that ODJFS receive an administrative appeal within 15 days after the decision being appealed. Subsection (E)(1) gives ODJFS the discretion to dismiss an appeal if it does not comply with subsection (C)(4)'s requirements. Those two provisions do not conflict-one defines the time limits of appealing an administrative decision, and the other governs ODJFS's power to accept or dismiss an appeal based on the timeliness or lack thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 13} While\n   <em>\n    Stoyer\n   </em>\n   is instructive, we reach a different conclusion when applying Ohio Adm.Code 5101:6-8-01(C)(4) and (E)(1) to the facts of this case. Because the state hearing decision was issued on September 1, 2015, the Bureau of State Hearings had to receive Clark's request for an appeal by September 16, 2015. The evidence makes it clear-and the parties agree-that ODJFS did not receive Clark's request for an administrative appeal until September 18, 2015, two days after the September 16, 2015 deadline. Like\n   <em>\n    Stoyer\n   </em>\n   , Clark filed his administrative appeal after the deadline and ODJFS dismissed his appeal. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Stoyer\n   </em>\n   , however, the common pleas court in this case found that ODJFS's dismissal was not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and that Clark's appeal was timely. While the facts of this case certainly evoke sympathy for Clark, the evidence shows that his appeal was late, and under Ohio Adm.Code 5101:6-8-01, ODJFS's dismissal based on that late filing was a permissible use of its discretion. Further, our review is limited to the common pleas court decision finding ODJFS's dismissal as improper, and in light of the evidence presented, it is clear that the common pleas court abused its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Mistaken Good Faith\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In his brief, Clark also argues that his appeal was filed untimely because of the hearing officer's good-faith mistake and his representative's clerical error, and therefore, he should not be penalized. Although Clark's representative, not Clark, sent the request in late, that mistake is imputed to Clark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faulkner v.
