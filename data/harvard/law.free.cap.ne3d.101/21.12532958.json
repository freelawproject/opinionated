Appellant assigns the following errors for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DETERMINING THAT THE PHRASE 'NEW SCHOOL FACILITY' WAS NOT AMBIGUOUS AND OPEN TO OTHER REASONABLE INTERPRETATIONS.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DETERMINING THAT THE SCHOOL BOARD'S AMENDED COMPLAINT DID NOT ASSERT SUFFICIENT FACTS TO STATE ANY CAUSE OF ACTION.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ITS RELIANCE ON\n   <em>\n    SLIFE V. KUNDTZ PROPERTIES, INC.\n   </em>\n   TO SUPPORT ITS GRANT OF THE VILLAGE'S MOTION TO DISMISS.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This appeal arises out of appellant's 2015 application to connect its newly-designed Wellness Center to appellee's sewer system. According to the complaint, in 2015 appellee denied appellant's application to connect its newly-designed Wellness Center to appellee's sewer system. Appellee asserted that a 2010 village ordinance prohibited the issuance of sewer taps outside the village unless the property served by the tap is annexed into the village. The village mayor drafted a letter to inform appellant that appellee \"will not accept the application for the tap at the Wellness Center as you * * * have been told many [sic] the District must annex into the village before any tap will be approved. You have been provided with a copy of the ordinance that pertains to this. The village will not accept the application or its fee until the District annexs [sic] into the village.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellant subsequently filed an amended complaint against appellee that asserted four claims for relief: (1) a declaratory judgment that requested the trial court to declare the parties' rights and obligations created pursuant to a 2004 village resolution, written communications, and subsequently-enacted ordinances; (2) the breach of an agreement to allow the district to connect the Wellness Center to the sewer system and enacting ordinances that conflict with the agreement; (3) a request that the court to issue an injunction to prohibit appellee from imposing conditions for service that are contrary to, or that impair appellant's rights, under the sewer agreement; and (4) a writ of mandamus to order appellee to permit appellant to connect the Wellness Center to the sewer system without requiring appellant to annex, and further ordering appellee to issue a letter to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in order to facilitate appellant obtaining approval for the Wellness Center project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellant premised its complaint upon an allegation that a 2004 resolution created a sewer services agreement between the parties. As background, appellant's complaint asserted that in 2004, it renovated and added onto its Ayers Road\n   school facility. Appellant alleged that part of the project included constructing a sanitary sewer line that, for the first time, enabled it to discharge sanitary sewage from the school facility into appellee's sewer system. Appellant claimed that in the 2004 resolution, appellee agreed to provide it with a sewer tap, located on Rossiter Road, for appellant's school facility and authorized appellant to connect its sewer line to the tap and to discharge sewage into appellee's system. Appellee further averred that it paid appellee $95,000 for the sewer tap and that appellee authorized it to discharge flow through the tap in the amount of 111 Equivalent Dwelling Units (EDUs). Appellant attached the 2004 resolution to its complaint, as well as written communications between appellant and appellee concerning appellant's right to tap into the village sewer system and the amount of EDUs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The 2004 resolution states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   A resolution authorizing the Alexander School District to connect into the Albany waste water treatment system and to begin discharging waste water flow into the said system, but requiring all issues relating to the tap fee and other matters raised in Village correspondence dated March 26, 2004, to the engineer for the Alexander School District, to be resolved within 60 days of the date of connection, which 60 days is to commence not later than August 30, 2004.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Be it resolved by the Council of the Village of Albany, State of Ohio:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Section 1. The Alexander School District is hereby authorized to connect its new school facility located in Alexander Township, Section 33, on Ayers Road, into the Albany Waste Water Treatment System and to begin discharging waste water flow into the said system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Section 2. The above approval and authorization shall expire 60 days following the date of connection/commencement of flow. The said 60 days shall commence not later than August 30, 2004. Within the said 60 days the said Alexander School District shall cause all requirements of the Village of Albany to be complied with, and all issues relating to tap fee and other matters raised in Village correspondence dated March 26, 2004, (a copy of which is attached) to Mr. James F. Barry III, P.E. C.F. Bird &amp; R.J. Bull Inc., engineer for the Alexander School District, shall be resolved to the satisfaction of the Village of Albany.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 3. The above authorization is contingent upon the Alexander School District shall bear [sic] all expense of constructing, replacing, and maintaining the sewer line to the sewer tap, provided however, that the Village may at any time be permitted to take complete ownership of any such line. For purposes hereof, and for purposes of any extension of the sewer line to adjacent or other properties, the Alexander School District shall agree to grant such easements for sewer line and pumping purposes as may be necessary therefor as determined by the Village.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant's complaint also incorporated a May 13, 2004 letter from the village mayor to the school superintendent, which states that appellant\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   is approved for physical connection to the Albany Waste Water Treatment collection system. The School District may therefore cause its contractor to tap into the Village sewer line on Rossiter Road in accordance with the plans and specifications\n   of the Albany Waste Water Treatment Project, copies of which your Engineer and your contractor have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   This letter is specifically for authorization to cause physical tap in to the sewer line. Authorization for use of that tap and hook in is not here given, but rather is held in abeyance pending resolution of the Tap Fee to be charged by the Village to the School District. It is anticipated that the Village will determine the Tap Fee to be charged shortly, but this will need to be resolved prior to the School District's commencement of usage. * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The School District will otherwise need to comply, with respect to the sewer line it constructed, with the terms of the April 8, 2004 Letter to Neil Pratt * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Also attached to appellant's complaint is a June 30, 2004 letter that explains appellee's calculation of the Equivalent Dwelling Units (EDUs) for the school. The letter states that the village engineer expected the school to create 22,200 gallons per day of sewage, which equals 111 EDUs per day. Appellant additionally attached copies of documents evidencing its payment of $95,000 to appellee, as well as copies of recent sewer bills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellee filed a motion to dismiss appellant's amended complaint and alleged that appellant's complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. In particular, appellee asserted that the complaint is based upon the assertion that the 2004 resolution granted appellant the right to tap the Wellness Center into appellee's sewer system. Appellee contended, however, that the plain and unambiguous language of the resolution does not give appellant the right to connect the Wellness Center to the sewer system, and thus, all of its claims must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellee argued that appellant's claims for relief are all premised upon its supposition that the Wellness Center falls within the terms of the 2004 resolution that permitted appellant to connect its \"new school facility\" to the sewer system. Appellee argued that appellant's Wellness Center, constructed more than ten years from the date of the resolution, does not constitute part of appellant's \"new school facility\" as contemplated in the 2004 resolution. Instead, appellee claimed that the phrase \"new school facility\" clearly and unambiguously authorized appellant to connect only \"the School that had newly been renovated in 2004.\" Appellee also asserted that the resolution used the verb \"located\" in the past tense to manifest its intention that the resolution only authorized appellant \"to connect its new school facility, as it existed as of the date the resolution was passed, to [appellee]'s sewer system.\" Appellee further contended that the Wellness Center does not constitute a \"school facility\" because appellant alleged that the Wellness Center would also serve the community, as well as students. Appellee thus argued that even if the resolution represents a contract or an agreement between the parties, appellant could prove no set of facts to show that it has any right to connect the Wellness Center to appellee's sewer system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Additionally, appellee asserted that the trial court should reject appellant's request to consider additional written documents when construing the resolution. Appellee contended that the language of the resolution is plain and unambiguous, and thus, the court may not consider the additional documents to ascertain the resolution's meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellee additionally argued that the resolution provided appellant with a sixty-day window within which to connect its \"new school facility.\" Appellee asserted\n   that once the sixty-day window expired, appellant no longer possessed the authority to make any additional connections to its sewer system. Appellee contended that appellant's 2015 application to connect the Wellness Center clearly fell far outside the sixty-day window.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellee also claimed that because it does not have a contractual obligation to provide sewer services to appellant, it has the right to require appellant to annex to the village in order to receive sewer services. Appellee alternatively contended that it gave appellant reasonable notice that appellee terminated any agreement that existed between the parties. Appellee claimed that it posted a 2010 ordinance limiting sewer taps to property owners who annex their property into the village and publicly posted the ordinance in various locations throughout the village. Appellee argued that publicly posting the ordinance provided appellant with constructive notice. Appellee also asserted that appellant received actual notice during a May 20, 2015 Village Council Meeting. Appellee claimed that during the meeting, the council and the mayor advised appellant's representatives of the ordinance and its applicability to the Wellness Center, and that the council further informed appellant that the Wellness Center could not tap into appellee's sewer system, unless appellant annexed its property into the village.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In opposition, appellant argued that its complaint sets forth valid claims for relief. Appellant contended that the complaint alleges \"(1) the existence of a contract for sanitary sewer services; (2) the terms of the contract; (3) the consideration paid for the contract; (4) Defendant's breach of the contract; (5) damages resulting from Defendant's breach; and (6) Defendant's duties to Plaintiff by virtue of the contract and its sewer use regulations.\" Appellant claimed, in essence, that the 2004 resolution constitutes the essential contract between the parties, and that additional documents supply the precise terms of the contract, i.e., payment of $95,000 and the number of EDUs the school may discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellant further disagreed with appellee's assertion that the 2004 resolution clearly and unambiguously prohibits it from connecting the Wellness Center to the sewer system. Appellant contended that none of the language contained in the resolution clearly and unambiguously restricted its authority to connect only the school buildings that existed in 2004. Instead, appellant asserted that the resolution uses ambiguous language that fails to clearly indicate that appellant lacks authority to connect future buildings, such as the Wellness Center, to appellee's sewer system. Appellant argued that the phrase \"new school facility\" as used in the resolution does not mean only the buildings that existed in 2004, but rather also includes buildings that appellant may renovate, demolish, construct, or reconstruct as part of its overall school facility. Appellant additionally asserted that the Wellness Center is a school facility according to the definition of a classroom facility set forth in R.C. 3318.01(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Appellant also disagreed with appellee's argument that the 2004 resolution contains a sixty-day window within which appellant could connect and discharge into the system, and that after that sixty-day period, appellant no longer possessed authority to connect or discharge into the system. Appellant claimed that appellee's interpretation is contrary to the plain language of the resolution, contrary to the parties' actions, and contrary to common sense. Appellant asserted that the sixty-day time period referred to the amount of time appellant had to pay the sewer tap fee and to fulfill various other requirements,\n   not to provide a window of authorization for discharging into the sewer system that would expire and then forever prevent appellant from using the sewer tap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In response, appellee reiterated its position that the resolution is not a contract between the parties. Appellee asserted that the resolution does not contain the words \"contract\" or \"agreement,\" does not identify an offer, does not reflect an acceptance, does not show a meeting of the minds, and does not contain any essential terms of a purported contract. Appellee claimed that the resolution is instead a legislative enactment that clearly manifests its intent \"to authorize [appellant] to connect its school facility, which was newly renovated in 2004, to [appellee]'s sewer system,\" and not to connect a building constructed more than ten years later. Appellee argued that the 2004 resolution does not authorize future connections to its sewer system resulting from the construction of additional buildings on school property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The trial court agreed with appellee and determined that the phrase \"new school facility\" clearly and unambiguously does not include a building constructed more than ten years after the resolution that authorized appellant to tap into appellee's sewer system. The court found \"[w]ithout question\" that \"new school facility,\" as used in the 2004 resolution, referred to the 2004 construction project and thus, the 2015 Wellness Center could not reasonably be construed to fall within the meaning of \"new school facility.\" The trial court concluded that the resolution contemplated connecting appellant's new school facility as it existed in 2004, and did not authorize appellant to connect future facilities to the system. The trial court determined that appellant \"has no viable claim against the Village under any cause of action set forth in the complaint.\" Thus, the court dismissed appellant's complaint. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Appellant's three assignments of error assert, in essence, that the trial court erred by granting appellee's Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the three assignments of error share the same basic legal principles, for ease of discussion we consider them together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In its first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court incorrectly determined that the 2004 resolution clearly and unambiguously prevents appellant from connecting the 2015 Wellness Center to appellee's sewer system. More particularly, appellant argues that the trial court erroneously construed the phrase \"new school facility\" to mean only those buildings constructed during appellant's 2004 renovations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 20} In its second assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court wrongly concluded that its complaint failed to state any valid claim for relief. Appellant asserts that its complaint sufficiently sets forth a breach of contract claim, as well as requests for declaratory and injunctive relief and for the issuance of a writ of mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In its third assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court incorrectly relied upon\n   <em>\n    Slife v.

We initially observe that appellee did not argue that any contract that might exist between the parties failed to comply with statutory formalities. We therefore presume, solely in the limited context of reviewing appellee's Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion, that any statutory formalities were met. We further point out that R.C. 731.14 states: \"All contracts made by the legislative authority of a village shall be executed in the name of the village and signed on its behalf by the mayor and clerk.\" The resolution that appellant alleges creates the contracts contains the village's name and is signed by both the mayor and the clerk of council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 31} While we recognize that appellant's complaint alleges the existence of a contract, the existence of a contract is a question of law.\n   <em>\n    Union Stock Yards\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.

We therefore must examine whether the complaint alleges sufficient facts such that appellant might be able to prove a set of facts to establish the existence of a contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 32} In the case sub judice, we do not believe that the resolution, on its own, establishes all of the elements of a contract. However, the allegations in appellant's\n   complaint and the attached documents show that appellant could arguably prove a set of facts to establish the existence of a contract. The resolution reflects appellee's consent to allow appellant to connect into its waste water treatment system and refers to an extraneous \"village correspondence dated March 26, 2004\" that defines appellant's obligations before it may connect to the sewer system. This correspondence is not attached to the resolution or to appellant's complaint. Appellant's complaint asserts, however, that one of its obligations was the payment of a $95,000 tap fee. Appellant's complaint alleges that the other condition concerned the tap flow capacity. Appellant averred that it paid $95,000 for the flow capacity of 111 EDUs. Appellant thus alleges that under the sewer service agreement, it has \"a right to discharge flow\" through the tap for the school facility in the amount of 111 EDUs. In accordance with the Civ.R. 12(B)(6) standard, we must construe these allegation as true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Appellant did attach to its complaint a May 13, 2004 letter, signed by the mayor, stating that appellant may tap into the sewer line \"in accordance with the plans and specifications of the Albany Waste Water Treatment Project, copies of which your Engineer and your contractor have.\" This language suggests that appellee and appellant had reached some type of agreement, with specifications, that allowed appellant to tap into appellee's sewer system. Although appellant apparently did not include all of the documentation exchanged between the parties relating to the 2004 resolution, appellant's complaint sufficiently pleads the existence of a contract. Once again, construing all allegations in appellant's favor, we must conclude that appellant's complaint sufficiently alleges facts that might establish the existence of a contract for sewer services. The complaint and attachments show that appellant might be able to present a series of facts establishing that the parties reached an agreement for sewer services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 34} We next consider whether the documents purporting to establish a contract contain clear and unambiguous language showing to a certainty that appellee performed in accordance with the terms of the alleged contract, or whether the language is ambiguous and fails to show, beyond doubt, that appellant can prove no set of facts establishing that appellee failed to perform in accordance with the alleged contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 35} We initially note that the parties dispute whether we should construe the resolution as a legislative enactment or as a contract. However, when we review a motion to dismiss, we must construe all reasonable inferences in appellant's favor. As we explained above, we believe that the complaint sufficiently alleges the existence of a contract, and thus, that we should construe the documents according to principles of contract interpretation. In the case at bar, however, we do not find it necessary to determine whether to construe the resolution as a legislative enactment or as part of a contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   While we recognize that the interpretation of legislation differs from the interpretation of a contract, we do not believe that the initial question concerning whether language is unambiguous or ambiguous significantly differs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 36} The first question we must answer when reviewing either legislation\n   or written instruments is whether the language used is plain and unambiguous.\n   <em>\n    Bohlen v.

As we indicated earlier, the resolution itself refers to an extraneous document and this document is not attached to appellant's complaint. Nevertheless, appellant has alleged the terms of the purported agreement in its complaint. Additionally, the parties' main dispute focuses upon whether the language used in the resolution clearly and unambiguously means that appellant does not have any contractual right to connect the Wellness Center to appellee's sewer system. We therefore believe that we may consider whether the documents attached to appellant's complaint reasonably support its interpretation of the agreement, or whether the documents plainly and unambiguously show that appellant cannot prove any set of facts showing that it is entitled to the requested relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Appellant argues that the 2004 resolution provided it with the authority to connect the 2004 newly-renovated school facility to appellee's sewer system via a main sewer line, and that nothing in the resolution prohibits future connections to its main sewer line. Appellant appears to contend that the parties' agreement was limited only by the number of EDUs it could discharge into appellee's sewer system. Appellant thus posits that under the parties' agreement, it can add future connections to its sewer line, located on school property, as long as the discharge to appellee's sewer system does not exceed 111 EDUs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Appellee argues that first and foremost, the resolution did not create a sewer services contract between appellee and appellant. Appellee contends that the resolution does not spell out any terms of a purported contract and fails to evince a meeting of the minds. Appellee asserts that even if the resolution constitutes a contract, the resolution unambiguously provided that appellant could connect its \"new school facility\" as it existed in 2004 into appellee's sewer system. Appellee claims that because the Wellness Center did not exist when appellee enacted the resolution, the Wellness Center necessarily is not included in the phrase \"new school facility.\" Appellee further contends that the resolution does not contain any language indicating that appellee granted appellant perpetual authority to connect any\n   and all future buildings located on the property into the sewer system. Instead, appellee argues that the resolution granted appellant a sixty-day window within which to connect to appellee's system and that after the sixty days elapsed, appellant no longer had any authority to connect any buildings located on its property to the sewer system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 43} While all of appellee's propositions may be reasonable interpretations of the 2004 resolution, they are not the only interpretations. The 2004 resolution generally authorizes appellant \"to connect into\" appellee's sewer system and \"to begin discharging waste water flow into the said system.\" Although appellant's complaint does not indicate on what date it connected into the sewer system and began to discharge into it, neither party has alleged that appellant has not connected into the system and begun discharging into it. Thus, presumably, these two things happened sometime in 2004-shortly after the resolution was enacted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Section 1 of the resolution states that appellant is \"authorized to connect its new school facility located in Alexander Township, Section 33, on Ayers Road, into [appellee's sewer system] and to begin discharging waste water flow into the said system.\" Again, presumably, these two things already happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Section 2 states that \"[t]he approval date and authorization shall expire 60 days following the date of connection/commencement of flow\" and that the \"60 days shall commence not later than August 30, 2004.\" This language appears to mean that appellant had a 60-day window within which to connect its new school facility to appellee's sewer system and to begin discharging. We again point out that appellant's complaint does not contain the date it connected its new school facility as it existed in 2004 to appellee's sewer system. Apparently, however, appellant did connect the 2004 new school facility and begin to discharge into appellee's system some time ago. Thus, construing all of the facts most favorably to appellant, appellant already has connected the 2004 new school facility to appellee's sewer system and begun to discharge into the system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 46} The question now is whether appellant may connect a newly-constructed building to a sewer line located within the boundaries of the new school facility, which would then connect to appellee's sewer system. We do not believe the resolution contains any explicit language that purports to limit appellant's ability to connect future sewer lines that connect to future buildings added onto school property. Instead, the resolution addresses the connection of the 2004 \"new school facility\" to appellee's sewer system. While the resolution does seem to provide appellant with a sixty-day window within which to connect its \"new school facility,\" appellant apparently did so sometime in 2004, after the resolution's enactment. The resolution, however, does not plainly and unambiguously prohibit appellant from connecting a newly-constructed building that appellant added onto the property housing its 2004 \"new school facility.\" The resolution does not contain any language to suggest that appellant cannot add future buildings to its \"new school facility\" and connect those buildings to the tap serving the \"new school facility.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Furthermore, appellant alleges that the parties' agreement allows it to discharge up to 111 EDUs and that adding the Wellness Center will not exceed this amount. Thus, appellant can equally prove a set of facts that might show that appellee failed to perform in accordance with the parties' agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Consequently, we do not believe that the resolution and other writings are\n   sufficiently clear and unambiguous terms so as to create an insuperable bar to appellant's claims for relief. We cannot state that, as a matter of law, the writings clearly and unambiguously preclude appellant's claims for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Appellee nevertheless asserts that its 2010 and 2015 ordinances\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   demonstrate that appellant cannot possibly prove any set of facts to show that it is entitled to relief. Appellee claims that the ordinances terminated any agreement that it may have had with appellant. Appellee alleges that it had the right to terminate, with reasonable notice, any contract that it may have entered to provide sewer services to appellant. Assuming, arguendo, that appellee's proposition is a correct statement of the law, whether appellee gave appellant reasonable notice that it terminated the purported agreement appears to be an inappropriate issue to determine in the context of a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ferrando v.

Instead, a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion requires a court to examine whether the complaint states a claim, not whether the plaintiff ultimately will prevail. In the case judice, we believe that for purposes of Civ.R. 12(B)(6) appellant's complaint adequately states a claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Appellee agrees that appellant's additional claims for relief-declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and mandamus-\"rise and fall with the trial court's * * * determination that the sewer tap authorization for the School District's 'new school facility' did not include the yet-to-be conceived 2015 community Wellness Center.\" If appellee possesses no contractual obligation to allow appellant to connect the Wellness Center to the sewer system, then appellee is not entitled to a declaration to the contrary, to injunctive relief requiring appellee to allow the connection, or to a writ of mandamus compelling appellee to allow the connection. We determined, however, that appellant's complaint sufficiently sets forth a claim for relief founded upon a contractual obligation. Thus, appellant's remaining claims for relief founded upon the alleged contractual obligation also state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Therefore, we conclude that for purposes of Civ.R. 12(B)(6) analysis appellant's complaint sufficiently pleads its claims for relief and that it could prove a set of facts that establish its entitlement to relief. We, however, emphasize that our decision is not an opinion regarding whether appellant ultimately will prevail. Rather, we simply conclude that appellant's complaint satisfies the liberal pleading requirements of Civ.R. 8(A) and adequately states a claim for relief. Once again, we emphasize that in general a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion is viewed with disfavor, rarely granted and reserved for those rare cases that cannot possibly succeed.\n   <em>\n    Wilson, supra\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Tri-State Computer Exchange, supra.\n   </em>\n   The case sub judice is not one of those cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we sustain appellant's three assignments of error and reverse the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   JUDGMENT REVERSED AND CAUSE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Abele, J., McFarland, J. &amp; Hoover, J.: Concur in Judgment &amp; Opinion\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Although the resolution indicates that a copy of the letter is attached, a copy of the letter is not attached to the copy of the resolution appellant attached to its complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    We observe that the day after the trial court entered its judgment dismissing appellant's complaint, appellant filed a Civ.R. 41(A) notice of dismissal.
