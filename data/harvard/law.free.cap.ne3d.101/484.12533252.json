She does not identify the area in the restaurant that she previously encountered greasy and filmy floors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Further, Allen's daughter-in-law, Taylor Rupeka, states in her affidavit that she visited the restaurant on several occasions and that she had slipped two to three times on the floor. She states: \"I have previously been a customer of the restaurant of Defendant and have slipped on the surface of the floor between 2 and 3 times prior to Carly [Allen] falling. The floor was not wet but just felt slippery.\" Rupeka does not give a date or time period when she experienced these slippery floors and does not indicate which part of the restaurant she was in when she slipped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Pablo Martinez, the restaurant manager, testified that employees sweep and mop the floor with bleach every morning before opening. Martinez also confirmed that the restaurant always keeps a yellow \"wet floor\" sign displayed on the floor near the entrance to alert customers of a potentially slippery floor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is unclear whether Martinez was present when Allen fell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 46} We disagree with Allen's argument that she presented evidence that Peno or his agents created the hazard. Contrary to Allen's argument, Martinez did not testify that grease spatters all over the restaurant when fajitas are served. To the contrary, Martinez explained that the restaurant cooks the fajita meat in butter, which does not splatter:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 47} \"Q.

You have to use oil in order to cook the meat a little bit so it doesn't stick?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 53} \"A. Not oil. It's like butter, because oil is like-I don't know.

As the moving party, Peno satisfied its initial burden of identifying the portions of the record demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of fact on Allen's negligence claims. While Allen produced evidence that she slipped on a greasy grimy substance on the floor of the restaurant, she did not come forward with evidence that the restaurant caused the greasy substance to be on the floor or that it had actual or constructive notice of the substance prior to her fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 66} Accordingly, Allen failed to carry the reciprocal burden setting forth specific facts demonstrating a genuine issue for trial.
