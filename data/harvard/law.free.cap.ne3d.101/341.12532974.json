In the agreement establishing a partnership, the partners can chart\n   their own course. New York's Partnership Law creates default provisions that fill gaps in partnership agreements, but where the agreement clearly states the means by which a partnership will dissolve, or other aspects of partnership dissolution, it is the agreement that governs the change in relations between partners and the future of the business. We hold that the partnership agreement in this case dictates the conclusion that defendant Marc A. Malfitano, a partner, wrongfully dissolved the partnership, but we conclude that it was error to include the legal fees incurred by the remaining partners in the damages owed to them by defendant. In other respects, we uphold the Appellate Division's valuation of defendant's interest in the partnership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1985, defendant and seven others entered into a written agreement (the agreement) to form a general partnership known as \"Poughkeepsie Galleria Company\" (the Partnership), for the ownership, operation, and management of a shopping mall. The mall opened in 1987 and continues to operate today. Defendant initially had a 2.25% ownership interest in the\n   Partnership, which increased to 3.08% by the mid-2000s. In addition to the minority partners, the Partnership had a majority owner, Moselle Associates, which controlled a little over 56% of the Partnership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The agreement provided that the Partnership \"shall continue until it is terminated as hereinafter provided.\" In a subsequent provision, the agreement stated that the Partnership would dissolve upon \"[t]he election by the Partners to dissolve the Partnership\" or \"[t]he happening of any event which makes it unlawful for the business of the Partnership to be carried on or for the Partners to carry it on in Partnership.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The agreement further stated that \"[a]ll decisions to be made by the Partners shall be made by the casting of votes at a meeting of such Partners\" and that \"[t]he affirmative vote of no less than fifty-one percent (51%)\" of the partners \"shall be required to approve any matter presented for decision.\" Day-to-day control of the Partnership was vested in a three-member Executive Committee, comprised of Robert J. Congel, Bruce A. Kenan, and James A. Tuozzolo, the plaintiffs in this case. The Executive Committee had \"the exclusive right to manage the business of the Partnership,\" although a majority of partners had the authority to \"overrule or modify\" the Committee's decisions,\n   \"withdraw or modify\" any power granted to the Committee, or remove its members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the mid-2000s, defendant decided to withdraw from the Partnership. Defendant asserts that certain conduct by plaintiffs related to the Partnership troubled him, and that when he challenged plaintiffs, they did not address his concerns. He explored the option of a buyout of his interest, but negotiations failed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 24, 2006, defendant wrote to his partners: \"[I]n accordance with Section 62 (1) (b) of the Partnership Law, and as a general partner of the Partnership I hereby elect to dissolve the Partnership and by this notice the Partnership is hereby dissolved.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Partnership Law \u00a7 62 (1) (b) states that a partner may unilaterally dissolve a partnership, without violating the partnership agreement, if \"no definite term or particular undertaking is specified\" in the agreement and the partnership is therefore \"at will.\" Defendant insisted that his partners were compelled to liquidate. The Partnership was in the process of negotiating a mortgage refinancing, and defendant recorded a notice of pendency on the Poughkeepsie Galleria property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The partners took the position that defendant had wrongfully dissolved the Partnership,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and they continued the business, in the same name as before, pursuant to Partnership Law \u00a7 69 (2) (b). That provision states, with certain conditions, that when dissolution is caused in violation of a partnership agreement, \"[t]he partners who have not caused the dissolution wrongfully, if they all desire to continue the business in the same name ... may do so, during the agreed term for the partnership and for that purpose may possess the partnership property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In January 2007, plaintiffs, as the Partnership's Executive Committee and on behalf of the Partnership, commenced this breach of contract action, seeking a declaratory\n   ruling that defendant had wrongfully dissolved the Partnership, as well as damages. Plaintiffs also moved for an order canceling the notice\n   of pendency. It was only after the lawsuit was commenced that a mortgage lender was willing to proceed with refinancing of the mall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant answered and interposed several counterclaims, including the allegation that the dissolution precluded the Partnership from refinancing or taking any business actions other than winding up, and a claim for judicial dissolution under Partnership Law \u00a7 63 (1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant also cross-moved to dismiss the complaint under CPLR 3211 (a) (7) for failure to state a cause of action, insisting that the Partnership qualified as an \"at-will\" partnership, which can be dissolved without violation of the partnership agreement, under Partnership Law \u00a7 62 (1) (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After Supreme Court denied defendant's cross motion to dismiss and canceled the notice of pendency, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on their wrongful dissolution and breach of contract claims, asserting that the agreement provided for only two methods whereby the Partnership would dissolve without violation of the agreement, and that defendant's unilateral dissolution breached the agreement. Defendant cross-moved for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Supreme Court granted summary judgment to plaintiffs, holding that the Partnership was not an \"at-will\" partnership, because it specified a \"particular undertaking\" within the meaning of Partnership Law \u00a7 62 (1) (b), and that defendant's dissolution of the Partnership breached the agreement. Supreme Court dismissed defendant's counterclaims, including his claim for judicial dissolution, and denied his cross motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In April 2009, the Appellate Division upheld Supreme Court's ruling on the wrongfulness of the dissolution, albeit on different grounds, finding that the agreement specified a \"definite term\" or temporal limit under Partnership Law \u00a7 62 (1) (b) (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3926038\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/61/807/#p808\">\n    61 A.D.3d 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 808-809,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3926038\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/61/807/#p808\">\n    877 N.Y.S.2d 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2d Dept. 2009] ). In a separate order issued on the same date, the Appellate Division affirmed Supreme Court's order granting summary judgment to plaintiffs, holding that plaintiffs had satisfied their prima facie burden of\n   showing that defendant had dissolved the Partnership in contravention of the agreement, and that defendant had failed to raise a triable issue of fact (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3920646\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/61/810/#p811\">\n    61 A.D.3d 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 811,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3920646\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/61/810/#p811\">\n    877 N.Y.S.2d 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2d Dept. 2009] ). The Appellate Division also affirmed dismissal of defendant's counterclaims, including his judicial dissolution claim ( 61 A.D.3d at 812,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3920646\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/61/810/#p811\">\n    877 N.Y.S.2d 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The Appellate Division remitted for further proceedings on, among other things, the issue of damages for breach of contract (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3920646\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/61/810/#p811\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On remittal in Supreme Court, defendant moved for partial summary judgment, seeking a declaration that plaintiffs were not entitled to attorneys' fees related to their lawsuit. In response, plaintiffs contended that they were entitled to fees on any actions they were compelled to take so as to avoid liquidation. They sought $2,717,314.50 in attorneys' fees and $79,705.50 in experts' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Supreme Court ruled that plaintiffs were entitled to attorneys' fees and experts' fees, as part of their damages, reasoning\n   that those costs \"are not incidental to the litigation\" but instead are \"damages caused by the defendant's breach\" of the agreement. However, Supreme Court did not award the full amount of attorneys' fees sought, awarding $1,516,452 in attorneys' fees, as well as experts' fees in the requested amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Partnership Law \u00a7 69 (2) (c) (II) states that when a partner dissolves a partnership in contravention of the partnership agreement, and the remaining partners continue the business in the same name, the dissolving partner has\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"the right as against his copartners ... to have the value of his interest in the partnership, less any damages caused to his copartners by the dissolution, ascertained and paid to him in cash, or the payment secured by bond approved by the court, and to be released from all existing liabilities of the partnership; but in ascertaining the value of the partner's interest the value of the good-will of the business shall not be considered.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Consequently, in November 2011, Supreme Court conducted a bench trial to establish the value of defendant's interest in the Partnership, taking into account the value of goodwill, and the amount of damages, if any, that defendant owed to plaintiffs. At the outset of trial, the parties stipulated that the value of defendant's interest in the Partnership as of November 24, 2006 was $4,850,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Both parties offered expert witness testimony on the applicability and amounts of certain deductions in value, including whether the stipulated value of defendant's interest in the Partnership included a component of goodwill, for which a deduction would be required under Partnership Law \u00a7 69 (2) (c) (II), and whether defendant's interest should be reduced to account for lack of marketability, in light of the absence of a readily available market to sell the partnership interest, and to account for his status as a minority partner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs' valuation expert testified that the value of the Partnership contained goodwill of 44%, by which amount the value of defendant's interest should be proportionately reduced, and that his interest should be further reduced by, successively, a marketability discount of 35% and a minority discount of 66%. In testifying that a minority discount was applicable, based upon defendant's lack of control in the Partnership, the expert witness emphasized what he described as \"draconian\" restrictions on transferability under the agreement, and in particular a provision, which the expert testified he had never before seen in his 40-year career, that if a partner sold his or her interest, then for five years after the date of sale, the partner would be jointly and severally liable, with the buyer, for any capital costs. The expert testified that this restriction was relevant not only to the marketability of defendant's interest, but also to the minority status of the interest, in that a minority owner has no say in whether there would be a capital call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant's valuation expert testified that the Partnership-as a real estate holding company-did not have goodwill, but conceded that he did not regularly value assets of that type. The expert witness further testified that he had been \"advised, under the relevant statutes, that a minority discount was not applicable,\" adding that while a minority discount \"would be applicable\" if the court were determining \"fair market value,\" it did not apply when determining \"fair value.\" Because of this \"advice,\" the expert witness did not argue, in the alternative, that the amount of the minority discount proposed by plaintiffs' expert, i.e., 66%, was unreasonable or in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Conversely, defendant's expert did not contest that a marketability discount would apply, but valued it at 25%, rather than 35%. Notably, in posttrial papers, defendant failed to preserve any general objection to the marketability discount as legally inapplicable, focusing instead on the amount of that discount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A second plaintiffs' witness testified about plaintiffs' legal fees, insisting that the fees had been incurred as a direct result of defendant's wrongful dissolution, including time and labor required to prevent the consequences that would have ensued if the dissolution had not been deemed wrongful. Defendant himself testified, and challenged the inclusion of plaintiffs' legal fees as damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Supreme Court ruled that the stipulated value of $4,850,000 would be reduced by 15% or $727,500 to represent the value of the Partnership's goodwill. The trial court reasoned \"that the partnership does indeed possess goodwill of its own,\" because the mall \"and its tenants attract regular, loyal shoppers, which point towards the existence of some goodwill.\" The trial court explained that \"[a] potential purchaser of the Poughkeepsie Galleria would more than likely pay more for an established going concern that already has tenant retail stores that attract a loyal customer base,\" and in this manner \"would pay extra for the acquisition of goodwill.\" However, the court disagreed with plaintiffs' figure of 44% for the goodwill deduction, and concluded that \"the 'premium' a buyer would likely pay for goodwill under the facts of this case is 15%.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Next, Supreme Court applied a 35% or $1,442,875 marketability discount, to the stipulated value as reduced by goodwill, to account for the limited marketability of defendant's interest, generating a discounted value of $2,679,625. The trial court explained that it had taken into consideration all factors inhibiting transfer of defendant's partnership interest \"resulting from a limited market.\" However, the trial court declined to apply a minority discount, citing cases that have barred the use of a minority discount in evaluation of a minority shareholder's stock in a closely held corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, Supreme Court ruled that defendant owed damages in the amount of $1,516,452 in plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and $79,705.50 in plaintiffs' experts' fees. The trial court reasoned that the Partnership was required \"to incur enormous legal fees\" to avoid the \"devastating consequence\" of a forced liquidation, and wrote that, although \"[b]oth parties contributed to the litigious nature of this case,\" defendant was \"clearly much more responsible than the plaintiffs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The net result was a judgment in favor of defendant and against plaintiffs in the amount of $1,083,467.50, to be reduced\n   by prejudgment interest of 9% in favor of plaintiffs on the fees award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant appealed, and plaintiffs cross-appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant contended, among other things, that the Appellate Division should overturn its 2009 rulings holding that he had wrongfully dissolved the Partnership, in light of this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Gelman v. Buehler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754339\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/20/534/\">\n    20 N.Y.3d 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754339\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/20/534/\">\n    964 N.Y.S.2d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754339\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/20/534/\">\n    986 N.E.2d 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), which provides a detailed analysis of the nature of an \"at-will\" partnership.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   For their part, plaintiffs\n   contended, among other things, that a minority discount should have been applied to the valuation of defendant's interest in the Partnership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In May 2016, the Appellate Division modified Supreme Court's judgment, by deleting the provision in favor of defendant and against plaintiffs, affirmed as modified, and remitted to the trial court for a new calculation incorporating a 66% minority discount, applied to the discounted value of defendant's interest in the partnership, and for entry of a new judgment (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787294\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/64/#p76\">\n    141 A.D.3d 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 76,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787294\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/141/64/#p76\">\n    32 N.Y.S.3d 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2d Dept. 2016] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Appellate Division adhered to its earlier determination that defendant had wrongfully dissolved the Partnership, noting that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"[t]he facts of\n   <em>\n    Gelman\n   </em>\n   , involving an alleged oral partnership agreement which lacked a definite term of duration, are plainly distinguishable from the facts of this case.

The trial court and the Appellate Division both ruled that the dissolution was wrongful, but focused on whether the agreement specified a \"definite term\" or \"particular undertaking\" under Partnership Law \u00a7 62 (1) (b). Defendant contends that the Partnership was \"at will\" because the agreement did not contain a \"definite term\" or \"particular undertaking\" under the statute.

For example, if a partnership agreement provides that the agreement will terminate on a certain date, then the dissolution of the partnership on that date will be in accordance with the agreement. Moreover, if \"no definite term or particular undertaking is specified\" in the partnership agreement, then the partnership is said to be an \"at-will\" partnership, and a unilateral dissolution \"[b]y the express will of any partner\" does not violate the partnership agreement ( Partnership Law \u00a7 62 [1 ] [b] ). \"[W]hen a partnership has no definite term or particular objective to be achieved, it may be dissolved at any time by the express will of one or more of the partners\" (\n   <em>\n    Harshman v.

In other words, \"[w]hen the agreement specifies a durational term, or a defined project, an attempt unilaterally to dissolve the\n   partnership would violate the partnership agreement\" (\n   <em>\n    Scholastic, Inc. v.

Here, the trial court found, based on the expert testimony and other evidence, that the shopping mall and the mall's tenants attract regular, loyal shoppers, and there is record support for the affirmed finding that the value of the Partnership included, in addition to its real property and cash, a goodwill component.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    V.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The next issue is whether the lower courts erred in applying a discount for lack of marketability, i.e., a deduction from the value of defendant's ownership interest reflecting the relative illiquidity or deficit in marketability of the interest. Defendant urges this Court to adopt the holding of the Louisiana Supreme Court that such \"discounts must be used sparingly and only when the facts support their use\" (\n   <em>\n    Cannon v.

Defendant, however, failed to preserve any challenge to the applicability of a marketability discount to the value of a partnership interest after wrongful dissolution. At trial, his expert conceded that a marketability discount would apply and defendant did not depart from this in his posttrial motion papers. The parties' dispute before the trial court was over the percentage. Because the broader issue was not preserved, the application of the marketability discount is not properly before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    VI.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The final question we must resolve is whether a minority discount may be applied in the calculation of the value of a wrongfully dissolving partner's interest in a partnership, pursuant to Partnership Law \u00a7 69 (2) (c) (II), when the remaining partners continue the business under Partnership Law \u00a7 69 (2) (b). A minority discount is a standard tool in valuation of a financial interest, designed to reflect the fact that the price an investor is willing to pay for a minority ownership interest in a\n   business, whether a corporation or a partnership, is less because the owner of a minority interest lacks control of the business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant contends that, as a matter of law, minority discounts are not applicable in the valuation of a minority partner's interest after the partner exits a business that remains a going concern. This issue is properly preserved, but we cannot agree with defendant on the merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In requiring the minority discount, the Appellate Division relied on\n   <em>\n    Anastos v.

There, the plaintiff dissolved a partnership in violation of the partnership agreement, and, as here, the other partners continued the partnership business, rather than liquidate. The trial court in\n   <em>\n    Anastos\n   </em>\n   , in determining the value of the plaintiff's interest, applied a minority discount to reflect that there was \"no ready market for the purchase of an interest in a general partnership whose primary asset is real estate where the partnership agreement contains limitations and restrictions on the control that any minority owner can exercise\" (\n   <em>\n    Anastos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1276682\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/443/146/\">\n    443 Mass. at 147-148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=819%20N.E.2d%20587\">\n    819 N.E.2d 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts upheld this decision, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   \"In this case, the remaining partners chose to exercise their statutory right to continue the partnership business for the remainder of the partnership term, so the partnership business is not 'winding up' and must therefore be treated as a going concern. Because the plaintiff cannot compel liquidation of the business at the point of dissolution, we read [ Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 108A, \u00a7 38 (2) (c) (II) ] as offering a nonliquidation based method of calculating the value of his partnership interest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Anastos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1276682\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/443/146/\">\n    443 Mass. at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=819%20N.E.2d%20587\">\n    819 N.E.2d 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Here, similarly, Partnership Law \u00a7 69 (2) (c) (II) contemplates a valuation of a wrongfully dissolving partner's interest based on treating the partnership as a going concern, rather than an asset to be liquidated. In other words, the statute does not contemplate a valuation of the entire business as if it were being sold on the open market, but rather a determination of the fair market value of the wrongfully dissolving partner's interest as if that interest were being sold piecemeal and the rest of the business continuing as a going concern.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given that the focus is on one partner's interest in a persisting concern, we agree with the Massachusetts high court that a minority discount is applicable, because a minority interest is worth less to anyone buying that interest alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Notably, New York, like Massachusetts, has not adopted the 1997 Uniform Partnership Act commonly known as RUPA. The dissent's discussion of RUPA and of cases from states that have adopted RUPA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   does not illuminate the law in New York. In particular, while RUPA, \"[b]y focusing on a top-down valuation keyed to a sale of all of the assets of the partnership, ...directs the analysis away from a valuation of the interests of a particular partner,\" so that \"a minority discount is inappropriate\" (dissenting op. at 302, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 892, 101 N.E.3d at 360 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted] ), we conclude that the same cannot be said of the UPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   It is true, of course, that in the Partnership Law \u00a7 69 (2) (c) (II) context the wrongfully dissolving partner's interest may simply be absorbed by the remaining partners. In our view, this does not render the value generated by application of a minority discount an inaccurate valuation of the intrinsic worth of that partner's interest. To repeat, the exiting partner's interest may appropriately be valued in light of the fair market value of that minority interest given that the partner is departing and the partnership continuing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As defendant observes, the closest this Court has come to examining the issue is\n   <em>\n    Matter of Friedman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8593951\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/161/\">\n    87 N.Y.2d 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8593951\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/161/\">\n    638 N.Y.S.2d 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8593951\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/161/\">\n    661 N.E.2d 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). There, we held that the use of a minority discount should be rejected in the context of valuing the interests of dissenting shareholders in a closely held\n   corporation. That context, however, is clearly distinguishable from ours.\n   <em>\n    Friedman\n   </em>\n   involved a proceeding under Business Corporation Law \u00a7 623, which gives \"minority stockholders the right to withdraw from a corporation and be compensated for the value of their interests when the corporate majority takes significant action deemed inimical to the position of the minority\" (\n   <em>\n    Friedman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8593951\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/161/\">\n    87 N.Y.2d at 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8593951\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/161/\">\n    638 N.Y.S.2d 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8593951\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/161/\">\n    661 N.E.2d 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Business Corporation Law \u00a7 623 invokes a statutory term of art, \"fair value,\" in requiring that a dissenting shareholder who exercises appraisal rights be paid the \"fair value\" of his or her shares ( Business Corporation Law \u00a7 623 [e] ), as opposed to their fair market value. The term \"fair value\" is not present in the statute under review here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The terminological difference reflects an underlying difference in statutory scheme. As plaintiffs note, Business Corporation Law \u00a7 623 contemplates a significant change to a business that the majority of shareholders have adopted over the minority's dissent. The value of the corporation's stock will likely be very different from the value prior to dissent and appraisal. This provides the rationale for the statutory requirement that the dissenter be paid \"fair value,\" as opposed to fair market value, as a remedial matter. By contrast, wrongful dissolution of a partnership may happen at any time, and valuation of a partner's interest occurs only if the remaining partners have agreed to continue their business as if nothing changed. Unlike shareholder dissent and appraisal, wrongful dissolution is not necessarily preceded by upheaval \"inimical to the position of the minority\" (\n   <em>\n    Friedman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8593951\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/161/\">\n    87 N.Y.2d at 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8593951\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/161/\">\n    638 N.Y.S.2d 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8593951\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/161/\">\n    661 N.E.2d 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), so trial courts need not substitute a \"fair value\" for the actual value a third party would pay. Indeed, here the upheaval took the form of an action by a minority partner inimical to the majority's interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In short,\n   <em>\n    Friedman\n   </em>\n   does not offer a rationale for rejecting the view that third-party market value is the compensation to which a wrongful dissolver is entitled, a view consistent with the use of a minority discount to capture any impact that a lack of control may have on that market price. While \"[t]he application of minority discounts is a matter of some debate in close corporations\" (Bromberg &amp; Ribstein on Partnership [2017-2 Supp.], at 7:168, \u00a7 7.13 [B] [1], n 17), \"courts usually allow\n   the application of a minority discount\" in determining the value of an interest in a partnership (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , at 7:167, \u00a7 7.13 [B] [1], n 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Defendant also draws our attention to a decision by the Maryland Court of Special Appeals,\n   <em>\n    E.

In that case, partners withdrew from a limited partnership under a statute providing that a partner could do so without dissolution, and \"receive, within a reasonable time after withdrawal, the fair value of the partner's partnership interest in the limited partnership as of the date of withdrawal, based on the partner's right to share in distributions from the limited partnership\" (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Corps.%20%26%20Ass%27ns%20%C2%A7%2010-604\">\n    Md.

Again, as in\n   <em>\n    Friedman\n   </em>\n   , it is clear that a different statutory scheme, involving cashing out an interest for \"fair value,\" was at work. By contrast, the statute we are analyzing relates to wrongful dissolution, rather than a statutory right to withdraw, and it makes no mention of \"fair value.\" Of course, this is not to say that the assessed value should not be fair. The point is simply that the statutory scheme in the Partnership Law is consistent with the application of a fair market value assessment of the particular partnership interest, and the use of standard valuation tools including a minority discount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In sum, defendant provides no basis for concluding that a minority discount is inapplicable as a matter of law to the valuation of the interest of a wrongfully dissolving partner when the remaining partners continue the partnership.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   We note, finally, that the parties to a partnership agreement may contract out of application of a minority discount to the valuation of their interests, just as they may contract around statutory provisions.

Jun. 30, 1982] ). As the majority observes, where, as here, the agreement is silent as to the amount payable to a dissolving partner, we must look to the default rules contained in Partnership Law \u00a7 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Section 69 distinguishes between wrongful and non-wrongful dissolutions. If the partnership's dissolution was not wrongful, then \"each partner ... may have the partnership property applied to discharge its liabilities, and the surplus applied to pay in cash the net amount owing to the respective partners\" ( Partnership Law \u00a7 69[1] ). In effect, \"the withdrawing partner, unless otherwise agreed, has the right, upon dissolution, to compel the 'winding up' or liquidation of the company, and receive the value of [its] interest in the partnership\" (\n   <em>\n    Estate of Watts v. C.I.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1736304\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/823/483/#p486\">\n    823 F.2d 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 486 [11th Cir. 1987] [emphasis omitted] [construing substantially identical provisions of the Oregon Uniform Partnership Act] ). Where dissolution is wrongful and the partners do not elect to continue the existence of the partnership under \u00a7 69(2)(b), the result is the same, except that the wrongful dissolver's right to payment must be set off against \"damages for breach of the agreement\" ( Partnership Law \u00a7 69[2][a][I]-[II], [c][I] ). If the partnership is continued, however, the Partnership Law states only that the wrongful dissolver is entitled to \"the value of [the partner's] interest in the partnership,\" excluding goodwill and set off against contractual damages (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1736304\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/823/483/#p486\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 69[2][c][II] ). Although this procedure results in a technical dissolution, its economic effect in most cases is that a partner is allowed\n   to cash out of the partnership and withdraw at any time, subject to its obligation to compensate the remaining partners for any losses they incur as a result of the breach of the partnership agreement. In this context, whether the \"value of [the partner's] interest in the partnership\" is subject to a discount for that partner's lack of control is the issue now before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Here, the majority insists that the \"value of [the partner's] interest in the partnership\" could only mean \"the price at which [the interest] would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller\" \"as if that interest were being sold piecemeal and the rest of the business continuing as a going concern\" (majority op. at 296 and 296 n. 12, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 887 and 887 n. 12, 101 N.E.3d at 355 and 355 n. 12). But the majority does not explain why this is so. It may be true that,\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   we were to adhere to this definition, it would lead to the conclusion that minority partnership interests should be discounted for lack of control (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Andrews v.

This ambiguity was explored during the process of drafting what would become the Uniform Partnership Act (1997) (\"Revised Uniform Partnership Act\" or \"RUPA\"), and attempts to arrive at an appropriate definition were made (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Allan Donn, Robert W. Hillman and Donald J. Weidner,\n   <em>\n    The Revised\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Uniform Partnership Act\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 701 Authors' Comment 2 [2017-2018 ed.] ). As the Reporters for the RUPA acknowledged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   \"The UPA says little about the buyout of a partner. UPA section 38(2) provides that, if there is a wrongful dissolution, the partners who have not dissolved wrongfully may continue the business 'during the agreed term' if they unanimously agree to do so. To do so, they must 'secure the payment by the bond approved by the court, or pay to any partner who has caused the dissolution wrongfully, the value of his interest in the partnership at the dissolution, less any damages recoverable ... and in like manner indemnify him against all present or future partnership liabilities.' There is no further definition of the buyout in the statute and the case law leaves many uncertainties about how the UPA rules apply.\" (Donald J Weidner &amp; John W Larson,\n   <em>\n    The Revised Uniform Partnership Act: The Reporters' Overview\n   </em>\n   , 49 Bus Law 1, 10-11 [1993] ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The RUPA resolved this ambiguity by explicitly defining the \"buyout price\" of a withdrawing partner as \"the amount that would have been distributable to the dissociating partner ... if, on the date of dissociation, the assets of the partnership\n   were sold at a price equal to the greater of the liquidation value or the value based on a sale of the entire business as a going concern\" ( RUPA \u00a7 701 [b] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, a\n   dissociating partner would be entitled to its proportionate share in the value of the business as a going concern, set off against contractual damages, but without an individualized inquiry into the marketability of its particular slice of the partnership. Consistent with this definition, the Official Comment stated that \"[t]he notion of a minority discount in determining the buyout price is negated by valuing the business as a going concern\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 701 [b] cmt). As one leading treatise on the RUPA explained, \"[b]y focusing on a top-down valuation keyed to a sale of all of the assets of the partnership, [RUPA] directs the analysis away from a valuation of the interests of a particular partner. Because the valuation inquiry is not directed to the value of an individual interest, a minority discount is inappropriate\" (Donn,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 701 Authors' Comment 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Although New York has not adopted the RUPA, \"[l]egislative inaction is a weak reed upon which to lean in determining legislative intent\" (\n   <em>\n    Flanagan v. Mount Eden General Hospital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2289744\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/24/427/#p433\">\n    24 N.Y.2d 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 433,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=301%20N.Y.S.2d%2023\">\n    301 N.Y.S.2d 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=248%20N.E.2d%20871\">\n    248 N.E.2d 871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1969] ). By excluding minority discounts, it does not appear that the drafters of the RUPA necessarily intended a change in the computation of the buyout price. The only departures from the UPA specifically noted in the Official Comment are the exclusion of the goodwill discount and the elimination of a partner's right to elect profits in lieu of interest under UPA \u00a7 42 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   RUPA \u00a7 701 [b] cmt). A 1986 report by the American Bar Association's UPA Revision Subcommittee stated that it was \"unlikely that a different measure [of value] was intended\" between UPA \u00a7\u00a7 38(2)(c)(II) and 38(1) -the amounts payable to wrongful and non-wrongful dissolvers, respectively-\"and there is no reason for the terms to be different\" (UPA Revision Subcommittee of the Committee on Partnerships and Unincorporated Business Organizations,\n   <em>\n    Should the Uniform Partnership Act Be Revised?\n   </em>\n   , 43 Bus Law 121, 174-175 and n 119 [1987], citing J Crane &amp; A Bromberg,\n   <em>\n    Law of Partnership\n   </em>\n   476 n 54 [1968] ). This would suggest that \"value,\" under UPA \u00a7 38(2)(c)(II), means a\n   pro rata share of the partnership's value as a whole. As another commentator opined, while it was \"not clear that the [UPA] mandates a pro rata share,\" \"a strong argument can be made that the 'default' valuation under the UPA should be pro rata\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Larry E. Ribstein,\n   <em>\n    A Statutory Approach to Partner Dissociation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Wash.%20U.%20L.Q.%20357\">\n    65 Wash U L Q 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 383 n 85 [1987] ). As Professor Ribstein explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   \"Partnership interests, unlike corporate stock, are not normally freely transferable. Giving each partner a right to sell his interest back to the firm, depending on how the buyout price is determined and the transaction costs of exercising the put, serves as a substitute for the efficient market for corporate stock in containing exploitation. In fact, a buyout price that represents the partner's pro rata share of the partnership is a better counter to exploitation than an efficient market price because the pro rata price prevents the controlling faction from taking advantage of its own exploitive conduct by purchasing the minority's interest at a discount.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Wash.%20U.%20L.Q.%20357\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Wash.%20U.%20L.Q.%20357\">\n    at 382-383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [footnotes omitted] ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Because this valuation would simply entitle the dissolving partner to its allocable share of the value of the partnership as a whole, it would be incompatible with a minority discount (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vick v.

The majority may be correct that these concerns are attenuated in the partnership context; a wrongful dissolution happens at the dissolving partner's initiative and is not necessarily triggered by a sale of the business or a determination that the partnership engaged in misconduct (\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Business Corporation Law \u00a7\u00a7 623, 1104-a ;\n   <em>\n    Hansen v. 75 Ranch Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"561184\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/288/310/#p325\">\n    288 Mont. 310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 325,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=957%20P.2d%2032\">\n    957 P.2d 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 41 [Mont. 1998] [\"(D)iscounts at the shareholder level are inherently unfair to the minority shareholder who did not pick the timing of the transaction and is not in the position of a willing seller\"];\n   <em>\n    Cavalier Oil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11358151\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/564/1137/#p1144\">\n    564 A.2d at 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"(T)he appraisal process is not intended to reconstruct a pro forma sale but to assume that the shareholder was willing to maintain (its) investment position\"] ). Nevertheless, the dissenter-like status of a dissociating partner should not be completely ignored. By organizing their business as a general partnership, principals sacrifice limited liability and the free transferability of their equity interests in exchange for, among other things, a statutory right to cash out at any time, subject to their obligation to pay damages if the dissolution is wrongful (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Partnership Law \u00a7 69 ; Larry E. Ribstein,\n   <em>\n    The Evolving Partnership\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20J.%20Corp.%20L.%20819\">\n    26 J Corp L 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 823-824, 849-850 [2001] ). Imposing too great a punishment for exit \"swings the pendulum toward permitting oppression of locked-in partners. Indeed, close corporations were long plagued by such problems\" (Ribstein, 26 J Corp L at 851 ).\n   \"[T]he problem is one of finding the appropriate balance between these costs of exit and of continuity\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 850 ). Again, although New York has not adopted the RUPA, it is noteworthy that \"[t]he strong support for the statutory buyout [in the RUPA] was influenced by trends in corporate law providing liquidity for a minority participant who wanted out of the business\" (Donn, \u00a7 701 Author's Comment 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The second rationale transposes much more easily to the partnership context. As many courts have observed, there is an analytical flaw in applying a minority discount where the actual purchasers of the minority interest are the remaining shareholders, rather than a hypothetical \"willing buyer.\" The purchasers are not entering into a noncontrolling position, but merely consolidating and increasing whatever degree of control they already have over the business. The Montana Supreme Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Hansen v. 75 Ranch Co.\n   </em>\n   is commonly cited:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   \"Applying a discount is inappropriate when the shareholder is selling her shares to a majority shareholder or to the corporation. The sale differs from a sale to a third party and, thus, different interests must be recognized. When selling to a third party, the value of the shares is either the same as or less than it was in the hands of the transferor because the third party gains no right to control or manage the corporation. However, a sale to a majority shareholder or to the corporation simply consolidates or increases the interests of those already in control. Therefore, requiring the application of a minority discount when selling to an 'insider' would result in a windfall to the transferee. This is particularly true since the transferring shareholder would expect that the shares would have at least the same value in her hands as in the hands of the transferee.... Since there is no 'market' involved in an inside transfer of shares, the minority discount should not be applied\" (\n   <em>\n    Hansen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=957%20P.2d%2032\">\n    957 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   41 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8469182\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/141/673/\">\n    2006 WY 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 41,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8469182\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/141/673/\">\n    141 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   687 ;\n   <em>\n    Arnaud v.

Indeed, by the majority's own logic, if a wrongful dissolver is a majority or controlling partner-precisely the kind of partner whose dissociation will most damage the business-that partner may now be entitled to a\n   <em>\n    control premium\n   </em>\n   under Partnership Law \u00a7 69(2)(c)(II), since this would reflect the amount that a willing third-party buyer would pay for a majority stake (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   majority op. at 296 and 296 n. 12, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 887 and 887 n. 12, 101 N.E.3d at 355 and 355 n. 12). The structure of Partnership Law \u00a7 69(2)(c)(II) already deters wrongful dissolution in two ways: by requiring the dissolving partner to pay damages, and by discounting the value of its partnership interests attributable to goodwill. A further discount for a lack of control is cumulative and unnecessary in light of these other provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In defining the \"value of [the partner's] interest in the partnership,\" the question does not turn on whether a particular method of valuation is 'accurate,' but whether that valuation will lead to an allocation of wealth as between these partners that best advances the legislative scheme. \"Value\" can mean many different things, and the definition we embrace should be guided by the ends that the legislature sought to implement when it enacted the Partnership Law. Here, the court applied a minority discount of $1,768,552.50 to appel\n   lant's\n   partnership interests, which were stipulated to be worth $4,850,000 without adjustments (see majority op. at 284, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 879, 101 N.E.3d at 347). The question is, in an action for wrongful dissolution, where the partnership is continued as a going concern, which party has the greater right to that $1,768,552.50 portion of appellant's interests-the controlling partners, or appellant himself? For the reasons discussed above, I believe this question should resolve in appellant's favor, and the order of the Appellate Division should be modified accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Judgment appealed from, and orders of the Appellate Division brought up for review, modified, without costs, by remitting the case to Supreme Court, Dutchess County, for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Judges Rivera, Stein, Garcia and Wilson concur.
