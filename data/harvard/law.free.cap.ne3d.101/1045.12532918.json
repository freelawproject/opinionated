For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On May 21, 2012, a Cuyahoga County Grand Jury indicted Hodges on two counts of aggravated murder, two counts of aggravated robbery, one count of improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle and one count of having weapons while under disability. The aggravated murder and aggravated robbery counts included one-year and three-year firearm specifications. The charges arose out of a March 14, 2012 incident in which Hodges, along with two co-defendants, Deante Kidd and John Johnson, robbed, shot and killed Christopher Johnson as a result of a drug deal \"gone bad.\" Hodges shot the victim in the back of the head at close range while the victim was driving a vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In September 2012, defense counsel stipulated to the court psychiatric clinic's findings that Hodges was sane at the time of the act and competent to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In December 2012, Hodges and the state reached a plea agreement. Hodges pled guilty to an amended count of murder with a three-year firearm specification and to one count each of aggravated robbery with a three-year firearm specification, improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle and having weapons while under disability. In exchange for Hodges' guilty pleas, the one-year firearm specifications were deleted and the remaining counts were nolled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The murder, aggravated robbery and improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle counts were merged and the state elected to proceed to sentencing on the murder count. The trial court sentenced\n   Hodges to an aggregate prison term of 20 years to life that incorporated three years on the firearm specification, to be served prior to and consecutively to a sentence of 15 years to life on the murder charge, and 24 months on the having weapons while under disability count, to be served consecutively to the sentence on the murder count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Hodges appealed his sentences, arguing that the trial court had failed to properly consider and apply the principles and purposes of sentencing under R.C. 2929.11 and the sentencing factors under R.C. 2929.12, had failed to merge the murder and having weapons while under disability counts and had failed make the necessary findings for the imposition of consecutive sentences pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(C)(4).\n   <em>\n    Hodges I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-5025\">\n    2013-Ohio-5025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 6. Finding that the trial court did not comply with R.C. 2929.14(C)(4), this court reversed Hodges' consecutive_sentences and remanded for resentencing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26-29. After the trial court sentenced Hodges to consecutive sentences on remand, Hodges once again appealed the consecutive sentences.\n   <em>\n    State v. Hodges\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

He argued that his guilty pleas were not made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily because he was \"under the heavy influence of mind-altering drugs\" at the time he entered his guilty pleas and did not receive effective assistance of counsel. Hodges contended that his trial counsel was ineffective because he:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"fail[ed] to discuss the facts of the case with him; did not interview potential witnesses; disregarded information identifying the true offender(s); told the defendant that he would be found guilty and sentenced to the maximum sentence regardless of whether he had committed the crime(s); failed to discuss defense tactics, strategies or the nature and effect of his guilty pleas(s) and made no effort to produce mitigation evidence at the sentencing hearing(s).\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   He also claimed that defense counsel had \"promised\" him that he would receive a plea deal to a reduced charge of involuntary manslaughter \"as his co-defendants received such.\" No affidavits or other evidentiary materials were submitted in support of the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On June 14, 2016, Hodges filed a \"supplemental motion\" to withdraw his guilty pleas citing additional legal authority and purporting to attach an affidavit from codefendant Kidd in support of his motion. No such affidavit was attached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The state opposed Hodges' motion to withdraw his guilty pleas, arguing that the motion lacked evidentiary support, was untimely and was barred by res judicata. The trial court summarily denied Hodges' supplemental motion on November 1, 2016. On April 19, 2017, the trial court summarily denied Hodges' original motion to withdraw his guilty pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Hodges appealed from the trial court's April 19, 2017 order, raising the following assignments of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Counsel's ineffectiveness in the plea bargain phase.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 2:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Counsel was ineffective for not bringing forth appellant's well documented mental health issues.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In his first assignment of error, Hodges contends that his trial counsel misled him into believing that he would be pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter rather than to murder. He contends that, were it not for the ineffective assistance of his trial counsel, he would have accepted a plea offer for \"a definite term of imprisonment in this matter of eleven years\" and he, therefore, should have been permitted to withdraw his guilty pleas and accept the state's \"original plea offer\" of involuntary manslaughter\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Motion to Withdraw Guilty Pleas\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Motions to withdraw guilty pleas are governed by Crim.R. 32.1. Crim.R. 32.1 provides: \"A motion to withdraw a plea of guilty may be made only before sentence is imposed; but to correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.\" Accordingly, a defendant seeks to withdraw a guilty plea after sentence has been imposed, he or she must demonstrate \"manifest injustice.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

During the plea colloquy, he trial court identified each of the offenses to which Hodges would be pleading guilty and again outlined the penalties he faced on each count, including that Hodges faced a minimum sentence of 18 years to life on the murder charge with the three-year firearm specification.

Hodges also acknowledged that his guilty pleas were voluntary based on his \"own free will and desire.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Hodges' motion to withdraw his guilty pleas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hodges' assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Failure to Bring Mental Health Issues to the Attention of the Trial Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 20} In his second assignment of error, Hodges contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to bring his \"well-documented mental health issues\" to the attention of the trial court. He asserts that if the findings from the court psychiatric clinic's report had been \"properly placed before a jury,\" it would have \"mitigated the sentence\" imposed. Hodges' arguments are meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 21} First, Hodges did not specifically raise this issue below. It is well-established that, except for a claim of plain error-which has not been made here-an appellant cannot raise an issue for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1742867,1742991\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/74/72/\">\n    74 Ohio St.3d 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 93,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=656%20N.E.2d%20643\">\n    656 N.E.2d 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995) (\"An issue is waived, absent a showing of plain error, if it is not raised at the trial level.\"). Second, Hodges is appealing from the trial court's denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas, not his sentences. Third, because Hodges could have raised the issue in his prior direct appeal, it is barred by res judicata.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kraatz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-2640\">\n    2016-Ohio-2640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 9. Finally, it is clear from the record that the trial court received and reviewed the report from the court psychiatric clinic prior to sentencing Hodges in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Based on the record before us, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in denying Hodges' motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. Hodges' assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   TIM McCORMACK, J., and FRANK D.

Further, the state specifically referenced the transcript in its opposition to Hodges' motion to withdraw his guilty pleas.

Hodges abandoned these arguments on appeal. However, even if he had not abandoned them, they would not have constituted grounds for vacating his guilty pleas for the same reasons as Hodges' involuntary manslaughter argument, i.e., the res judicata bar and lack of evidentiary support.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
