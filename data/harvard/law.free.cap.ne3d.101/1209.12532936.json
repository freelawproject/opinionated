On appeal, he raises two assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. The court erred when it denied the motion to suppress and for the return of illegally seized property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. Given the state cannot seize money from an individual, with or without probable cause, and require the person from whom it was seized to prove it was lawfully acquired, it follows the court erred when it forfeited this money to the state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Finding no merit to the assignments of error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural History and Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On March 11, 2016, the state filed a complaint for civil forfeiture of the $75,000 found in Katz's vehicle pursuant to R.C. 2981.05. On May 31, 2016, Katz filed a motion to suppress the money found during the traffic stop. At the hearing on both the motion to suppress and forfeiture, the following evidence was presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In January 2016, Detective Payne with the city of Broadview Heights was assigned to the Cleveland, Ohio high intensity drug trafficking area (\"HIDTA\"). Along with other HIDTA assigned officers, Detective Payne was conducting surveillance on a number of individuals suspected of drug trafficking who were traveling to and from the Cleveland Hopkins Airport and leaving and entering multiple hotels and residences throughout their stays in Cleveland. During his surveillance, Detective Payne conducted criminal history checks of the observed individuals and even approached them in the airport and searched their bags after receiving their consent to do so; however, he and the other officers found nothing of evidentiary value in their bags. Detective Payne and HIDTA officers also searched one of the hotel rooms where the individuals stayed, finding drug residue and other materials that Detective Payne testified were commonly used to package and transport drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On February 15, 2016, HIDTA officers observed one of the individuals pick up two males at the airport, one being Katz. The individual dropped Katz off at a hotel in Cleveland, where Katz paid cash for a one night's stay. The next day, HIDTA officers observed Katz travel to a Cleveland residence with the same males\n   from the day before. At the residence, Katz entered a 2014 Toyota Camry with California license plates and drove away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} HIDTA officers continued to follow Katz and informed a local Ohio State Highway Patrol officer, Lieutenant Hughes, that they suspected Katz to be a drug courier and gave him a description of the vehicle. Lieutenant Hughes subsequently observed Katz's vehicle traveling over the speed limit on Interstate 71. Lieutenant Hughes paced Katz's vehicle at a speed over the speed limit for a short distance and then activated his emergency lights and conducted a traffic stop at approximately 1:39 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} After approaching the vehicle and asking for Katz's license and registration, Lieutenant Hughes requested Katz to accompany him to his vehicle and conducted a pat down of Katz's person. While sitting in the police cruiser, Lieutenant Hughes ran Katz's information. During this time, Katz asked for a break, but did not deny that he was speeding. Approximately five minutes after Lieutenant Hughes stopped Katz and during the time that Lieutenant Hughes was running Katz's information, Officer Andrejack of the Cleveland Police Department and his canine partner arrived at the scene upon request from HIDTA officers. While encircling the vehicle, the canine positively alerted. Subsequent to that alert, Lieutenant Hughes read Katz his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and asked him if there were drugs or money in the vehicle. Katz stated, \"Not that I know of.\" Katz was then securely placed in the back of a patrol car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Lieutenant Hughes and other officers began to search the vehicle on the side of Interstate 71; however, due to weather conditions and safety concerns, the officers requested a tow, deciding to conduct the search at the Brookpark State Highway Patrol post instead. Katz was also transported to the post and held in a separate room while the police conducted their search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} A search of the vehicle yielded 13 bundles of U.S. currency, totaling $75,000, which was hidden in the vehicle's rear rocker panels.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The money was vacuum sealed, covered in brake grease, and then vacuum sealed again.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon finding the money and confirming that he was already\n   <em>\n    Mirandized\n   </em>\n   and understood his rights, Detective Payne then interviewed Katz. When Detective Payne asked him about the money, Katz stated that it was \"absolutely not\" his and denied knowing about the hidden compartments in the vehicle. Katz provided a signed statement to Detective Payne, stating, \"I never knew about money found in car. It's not my money. 2014 Camry.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Before letting Katz-who was not placed under arrest-leave for the airport, the officers gave Katz a receipt for the money, vehicle, and other property inside the car.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As for the speeding violation, Lieutenant Hughes only issued Katz a written warning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} At the forfeiture hearing and contrary to his earlier statements to police, Katz claimed that the money belonged to him and was his life savings. Specifically, the following exchange took place at the hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ATTORNEY: [W]ho owned the money?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   MR. KATZ: Me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   ATTORNEY: And how long had that money been in that car?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   MR. KATZ: In that car for two years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ATTORNEY: Yes. And what's the source of that money?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   MR. KATZ: It's been income I've been earning for the last 25, 30 years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ATTORNEY: Your life savings?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   MR. KATZ: Yes. I lost a lot of money in 2008, in the crash, because I had most of my funds in the stock market[.] * * * So I decided to keep my money, to hide it, and I paid taxes on the money anyway, because it was income. So it was my hard-earned money for 44 years[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Further, when asked why he initially denied knowledge and ownership of the money, Katz explained that he believed he would be arrested for a hidden-compartments violation if he claimed the money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In its opinion and judgment entry, the trial court denied Katz's motion to suppress, finding that the traffic stop was constitutional because Katz was speeding, the traffic stop was not unlawfully prolonged, the police had probable cause to search the vehicle because the canine alerted, and the police's removal of the vehicle to the patrol post was lawful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Additionally, the trial court found that Katz failed to establish his ownership of the funds. Nevertheless, the trial court considered the merits of the forfeiture action and additionally found that the state proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the money was subject to forfeiture. Specifically, the court stated that it was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   more probable than not * * * that $75,000 in currency, wrapped in plastic, coated with brake grease to avoid scent detection, then vacuum sealed and placed in [a] hidden compartment in a vehicle, is either proceeds derived from or acquired through the commission of an offense or an instrumentality that was used in or intended to be used in the commission or facilitation of a felony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 14} It is from this judgment that Katz appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Motion to Suppress\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In his first assignment of error, Katz argues that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress the money seized from his vehicle during the March 11, 2016 traffic stop because the officers' claim of a traffic violation was pretext, the drug dog did not actually alert to drugs, the officers unconstitutionally delayed their search, the officers lacked a search warrant, and the officers took statements from Katz in violation of his constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Standard of Review\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact. When considering a motion to suppress, the trial court assumes the role of trier of fact and is therefore in the best position to resolve factual questions and evaluate the credibility of witnesses. Consequently, an appellate court must accept the trial court's findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible\n   evidence. Accepting these facts as true, the appellate court must then independently determine, without deference to the conclusion of the trial court, whether the facts satisfy the applicable legal standard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

In that case, the Twelfth District Court of Appeals, reviewing a nuisance action filed by the state against a local adult arcade, stated, \" '[G]enerally, the exclusionary rule has not been applied in civil cases; we see no reason to expand the exclusionary rule to the facts of this case.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 786,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=627%20N.E.2d%20629\">\n    627 N.E.2d 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

If we were to adopt the state's position, that adoption would directly conflict with the United States Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    One 1958 Plymouth Sedan.\n   </em>\n   Further, the Twelfth District's use of \"generally\" shows that the exclusionary rule is sometimes applied in civil cases, such as forfeiture actions.\n   <em>\n    Roszmann\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable in that it-as well as the case it cites to,\n   <em>\n    Rear Door\n   </em>\n   -concerned a nuisance action, which, unlike forfeiture actions, is not recognized as a \"quasi-criminal\" proceeding in Ohio.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamilton v.

When asked why the officers moved the vehicle to the trooper post, Officer Payne testified that \"[i]t was pretty cold and snowy, rainy that day, it was on the side of the highway, so I presume they wanted to take it back there to be able to search it in a little bit safer of a place.\" Lieutenant Hughes testified that one trooper \"had flagged a car over to tell it to move over because it was in the right-hand lane, and in a controlled environment we can conduct a search more safely and thoroughly as opposed to on the side of the road a few feet from traffic on the interstate.\" The dash cam video from Lieutenant Hughes's police car confirms the officers' testimony citing the hazardous conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 38} At oral argument, Katz set forth a \"slippery-slope\" argument, contending that should the officer's removal of his vehicle stand, officers will have free range to relocate any vehicle that is the subject of a traffic stop. That argument has no merit based on the cases previously discussed. Once again, the removal of a vehicle from the side of the road to a safer location must be reasonable, which is a determination that will be made on a case-by-case basis. For example, in cases where road conditions are safe, visibility is optimal, and officer safety is not in jeopardy, removal of a vehicle to another location may not be reasonable. But, as stated above, the conditions in this case establish that removing the vehicle from the side of the road to conduct a search was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Further, the probable cause to search the vehicle established by the canine's alert did not dissipate during the time that it took to tow the vehicle to the patrol post.

After a thorough reading of\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   , however, we find it uninformative.\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   concerned the taking of a blood sample from a suspected intoxicated driver without a warrant, which the state argued was not needed based on the exigency exception to the warrant requirement. In that case, the United States Supreme Court stated that \"technological developments that enable police officers to secure warrants more quickly, and do so without undermining the neutral magistrate judge's essential role as a check on police discretion, are relevant to an assessment of exigency.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1562. This case, however, concerns the search of a car after a positive alert by a canine. As already discussed, the officers here did not need a warrant after establishing probable cause through that canine alert, and they were able to search the car without a warrant under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement, not the exigency exception. Moreover,\n   <em>\n    McNeely\n   </em>\n   sets forth no rule of law concerning the relocation of a stopped vehicle to effectuate a search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Katz's Statements\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Finally, Katz vaguely argues that his statements denying ownership of the seized money should be suppressed because they were taken in violation of his right to counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Here, the trial court found that \"[t]he only evidence of [the] request [for counsel] is Katz's testimony, which is controverted by two taped interactions where Katz was advised of his rights, acknowledged understanding his rights, and proceeded to talk with law enforcement officers without mentioning an attorney.\" Once again, because the trial court is the trier of fact and weighs the credibility of the evidence, we must defer to its factual and credibility findings if supported by competent, credible evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Mayfield Hts.\n   </em>\n   , we discussed two federal circuit court of appeals cases:\n   <em>\n    United States v. $5,000 in U.S. Currency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526924\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/40/846/\">\n    40 F.3d 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir.1994), and\n   <em>\n    United States v. $639,558.00 in United States Currency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11289936,3495804\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/955/712/\">\n    955 F.2d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C.Cir.1992). In those cases, the courts relied on evidence showing that most U.S. currency is tainted with traces of drugs. In\n   <em>\n    $639,558.00\n   </em>\n   ,\"the court cited the testimony of an expert, * * * who testified that 90% of all cash in the United States contains sufficient quantities of cocaine to alert a trained dog.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. Based on that case law, we refused to consider a drug dog's alert as an indication that money is connected to drug trafficking activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Here, in its opinion and judgment entry, the trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   The evidence before the Court demonstrates that this was not merely cash in the passenger compartment or even in the vehicle's trunk. Nor was the amount of cash such that it could be reasonably explained under ordinary circumstances. Rather, it was $75,000 in 1-3 packets, (wrapped in plastic, coated with brake grease to mask its odor, and wrapped again in plastic) secreted within two hidden compartments in the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   The amount of currency, its manner of packaging, and the efforts at deception in both packaging and storage are compelling evidence that the money was used for or derived from illegal activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   The attendant circumstances of Mr. Katz's activities bolster this conclusion. As Det. Payne recounted, substantial activity associated with drug trafficking was occurring around Mr. Katz [sic] disclaimed all knowledge of the compartments or the currency at the time of the search.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Standing alone, this pattern of conduct strongly indicates drug trafficking. The Court cannot hypothesize a reasonable explanation for creating hidden compartments in a vehicle to store cash or to package the cash to avoid detection by law enforcement. Additionally, the creation of hidden compartments in a leased vehicle is even more suspect since such material alteration voids the terms of the lease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   If there were a reasonable explanation for hiding substantial sums of money in hidden compartments in one's car, Mr. Katz had ample opportunity to establish it as well as to establish his claim to the money. He did neither. Mr. Katz offered conflicting versions of why he was in Cleveland and how he arrived here. First, he told officers he drove here frequently, then he told them he flew in to pick up his car to drive to an auto-auction, and finally it was to retrieve his car that had been damaged during his last visit to a friend in Amherst even though he frequently disclaimed that any body work had been done on the car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Additionally, the explanation that the vehicle was used as a \"car-bank\" is incredible. No reasonable person, living in the State with one of the highest theft rates (https://www.nicb.org/newsroom/news-releases/2015-hot~spots-vehicle-theft-report), driving one of the most frequently stolen vehicles (NICB's Hot Wheels: America's 10 Most Stolen Vehicles, https://www.nicb.org/newsroom/news-releases), would seal his life savings in an easily destructible object, much less leave that vehicle with a stranger to perform body work for a period of weeks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In concluding its opinion, the trial court found \"that it is more probable than not, * * * that $75,000 in currency, wrapped in plastic, coated with brake grease to avoid scent detection, then vacuum sealed and placed in hidden compartment [sic] in a vehicle, is either proceeds * * * or an instrumentality * * * intended to facilitate drug trafficking.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 57} To summarize, the trial court found that the state met its burden based on (1) the amount of the money found, (2) the way the money was wrapped and hidden, (3) the prior activity of Katz's acquaintances observed by HIDTA officers, (4) Katz's inconsistent explanations for being in Cleveland, and (5) Katz's lack of a credible explanation for the money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 58} Here, the trial court's conclusion is supported by evidence presented at the forfeiture hearing and delineated in its judgment entry and opinion. The significant amount, location, and packaging of the money found in Katz's vehicle was\n   more indicative of drug trafficking than that in\n   <em>\n    Marmet.\n   </em>\n   While no drugs were ultimately found on Katz or in his vehicle, the surrounding circumstances and observations made by HIDTA officers also strongly indicate a nexus between the money and drug trafficking activity.
