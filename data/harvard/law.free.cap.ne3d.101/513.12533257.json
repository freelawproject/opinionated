For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On May 12, 2017, Link was stopped for allegedly running a stop sign at the intersection of Polk Hollow Road and US-50 in Ross County, Ohio. Link was cited for disobeying the instructions of a traffic control device, i.e., a stop sign, while driving a vehicle, in violation of R.C. 4511.12. The roadway on which Link was operating his vehicle, Polk Hollow Road, was marked with a stop sign but did not have a marked \"stop bar\" or \"crosswalk\". The stop sign is set back from the intersection by approximately 28 feet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} At a bench trial, Trooper Efaw with the Ohio State Highway Patrol and Link apparently provided conflicting testimony\n   as to whether Link stopped at the stop sign. Because the full transcript was not ordered, the record on appeal does not contain a transcript of Efaw or Link's exact testimony. A dashcam video from Trooper Efaw's cruiser was also played for the trial court. The dashcam video was also not provided with the appellate record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} At the conclusion of the bench trial the trial court found Link guilty, noting as follows\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   COURT: Alright, we're back on the record in Case TRD1703962, the State against Jason Link. I've had a chance to review the video a few more times to try to see if it's any better indication of what it shows, and frankly I can't tell for sure much more than what I've already seen. It does appear that the stop sign is back a little ways from the intersection and I'll accept your measurement, Mr. Link, that it's 28 feet. Looks like to be about that far in the video. I don't see a cross walk or a stop bar anywhere marked on the roadway, and it does appear that your car is moving before the stop sign. If you stopped, you didn't stop right at the stop sign, but I can't tell more than a few feet before the stop sign what your car is doing from the video. So, and I can't tell how far the officer saw before the stop sign either, because I don't think she testified to that. She just said that she saw the car rolling up through the stop sign and making a turn, which it does. So I think it's possible that you stopped and I suspect you probably did because I don't think you'd lie to me about it. I won't say I've never heard a lie in the court room before. Alright, so the charge here is a charge of violating a traffic control device in violation of 4511.12, which seems like an odd charge to start with, but that section simply says, \"no pedestrian, driver of a vehicle, operator of a streetcar or trackless trolley shall disobey the instruction of any traffic control device placed in accordance with this chapter unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.\" So I assume we're talking about a stop sign and then there is a section of the law that deals with stop signs, which is 4511.43 which says, \"except when directed to proceed by a law enforcement officer, every driver of a vehicle or trackless trolley approaching a stop sign shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the cross walk on either side of the intersection or if none, at the point nearest the intersection roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering it. After having stopped, the driver shall yield the right of way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time the driver is moving across within the intersection or junction of roadways.\" Frankly, Mr. Link, you're probably in violation of that, technically in violation of that statute because, although the language is a little bit confusing, it says you must stop at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where you have a view of approaching traffic, which means I guess you would have to pull right up the edge and stop there before going. Clearly, you didn't do that. You stopped back prior to the stop sign and if you did that though, you didn't have a clear view of traffic. I'm not sure why the law would require you to stop again, but apparently that's the way the statute is written. So, I guess I have to find you guilty on the charge and I do. But given the situation, I'm not going to impose a fine and in fact, I'll even waive the court costs\n   because I believe that you likely did stop, even though it was a ways, at least 30 feet back from the intersection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   MR. LINK: With all due respect, obviously you know the law much better than I do. If the law states that you have to have a clear sight line, Polk Hollow Road, is not a road that I travel all that frequently, but there's a very clear sight line at the stop sign to the left. You can see at least a quarter of a mile down the road. If there's no stop line, if there's no cross walk, I'm not sure how the new charge that you're charging me with comes into play[?]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   COURT: Well, I guess you're going to quibble with me on that and that's fine. I'm not charging you with a new charge. I am interpreting the charge that you were charged with. You know, I'm interpreting it in the way that the statute is written with respect to stop signs because I find that the stop sign is a traffic control device and specifically, when you stop for a stop sign, you're required to stop at the stop bar, the cross walk, or if those aren't there, at a point nearest the intersection. You didn't. You stopped at least 30 feet before the intersection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   MR. LINK: So, what would the point nearest the intersection be?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   COURT: Well, that's a good question. And it's not specified in the statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   MR. LINK: And that's why I'm asking the questions I'm asking because I'm trying to understand why I'm being charged with something, Number 1 other than what I was charged with by the trooper, and Number 2 trying to understand why you're charging me with that when it's not clear and understandable even to yourself, as you've admitted, what the statute really says or doesn't say.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   COURT: Well, I think if you had stopped within a few feet or 10 feet of the intersection, I'd say that's fine. But you stopped at least two car lengths before the intersection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   MR. LINK: I stopped at the stop sign, which is where I always\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   COURT: No, you didn't stop at the stop sign. You stopped before the stop sign. Because I can see on the video that, I can't judge the distance specifically, but there is a gap between where I can first see your car and the stop sign and your car is moving when I first see it. I can see it moving coming to the stop sign, passing the stop sign, and going out. So, you didn't stop right at the stop sign. You stopped prior to the stop sign and I can't say whether it was 3 feet, 5 feet, 6 feet, or 10 feet. But it was before the stop sign, so you're at least 30 feet from the intersection, if your measurement is correct. If it's 28 feet to the stop sign, you're at least 30 feet before the intersection. You know, obviously you disagree with my decision. That's fine. Frankly, I sort of, I don't like the decision I'm making, but I don't know how else to interpret the statute. I don't think 30 feet is the point nearest the intersection to stop. So technically, as I said, you violated the statute, but taking all that into consideration, as I said, I'm not going to impose a fine. I'll waive the court costs. So you won't owe anything, but I guess you will get a conviction on your record. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Link then filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Because determination of Link's third assignment of error is dispositive of this case, we address the assignments of error out of order. In his third assignment of error, Link essentially contends that the trial court erred in finding him guilty of disobeying the instructions of a traffic control device even though it also determined that he had stopped at or just prior to the stop sign. We construe this assignment of error as a challenge to the trial court's interpretation of the revised code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Generally, the interpretation of a statute involves a purely legal question. Thus, an appellate court will conduct a de novo review of a trial court's judgment interpreting a statute and will afford no deference whatsoever to a trial court's interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Oliver v.

R.C. 1.49 provides that if a statute is ambiguous, in determining the intention of the legislature, we \"may consider among other matters: (A) The object sought to be attained; (B) The circumstances under which the statute was enacted; (C) The legislative history; (D) The common law or former statutory provisions, including laws upon the same or similar subjects; (E) The consequences of a particular construction; [and] (F) The administrative construction of the statute.\" Under R.C. 1.42, we must read words and phrases in context and construe them according to the rules of grammar and common usage unless they have acquired a technical or particular meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Link was charged with violating R.C. 4511.12(A), which provides that no driver of a vehicle \"shall disobey the instructions of any traffic control device placed in accordance with [R.C. Chapter 4511], unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.\" Here, the device was a stop sign, and R.C. 4511.43(A) contains the instructions for it that the trial court concluded Link did not follow. R.C. 4511.43(A) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Except when directed to proceed by a law enforcement officer, every driver of a vehicle or trackless trolley approaching\n   a stop sign shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering it. After having stopped, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time the driver is moving across or within the intersection or junction of roadways.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The trial court specifically found that there was no \"stop bar\" or \"crosswalk\" on the roadway, but that Link disobeyed the instructions of a traffic control device, i.e., a stop sign, because he failed to stop at the point nearest the intersecting roadway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 11} There is little guidance available regarding the common, ordinary, and accepted meaning of what it means to stop \"at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering it.\" A review by this writing judge reveals no published case law from the Ohio Supreme Court or any other Ohio court addressing the proper interpretation of what it means to stop at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway. A cursory reading of the language can mean a multitude of things depending on the reader. Accordingly, we conclude that R.C. 4511.43(A)'s requirement that a motorist stop \"at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering it\" is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Because we conclude that the statute is unclear and ambiguous, we must apply the principles of statutory interpretation to determine what R.C. 4511.43(A) requires of a motorist when a stop sign is not accompanied by a marked stop line or crosswalk. To determine the General Assembly's legislative intent, we will consider the consequences of a particular construction of the statute, and the object sought to be obtained by the statute. R.C. 1.49(A) and (E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 13} We conclude that the General Assembly did not intend that motorists stopping well past the marked stop sign and at the point nearest the intersection would constitute compliance with R.C. 4511.43(A). Rather, we hold that when the stop sign is not accompanied by a marked stop line or crosswalk, the motorist must stop his or her vehicle at the point nearest the stop sign where they have a clear view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 14} First, if we were to interpret the statute to require a motorist to stop numerous feet past the stop sign and at the brink of the intersection, the consequence would be to put many motorists and pedestrians in perilous situations. Stopping so close to the intersection could make for unsafe road conditions. It is illogical that the General Assembly would want to establish a stopping point for a motorist that would put them, pedestrians, and other motorists in danger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 15} \"[T]he object sought to be attained in regulating Ohio's [roadways] is the safety of motorists and pedestrians\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, if the trial court's interpretation of the statute is correct, the stop sign at issue in this case should have been placed much closer to the intersection in order to conform to the OMUTCD.
