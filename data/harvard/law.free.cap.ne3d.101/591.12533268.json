(\"Swan Cleaners\"), appeals from the decision of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas holding Swan Cleaners' discovery motions moot, granting summary judgment for defendant-appellee, Franklin County Board of Commissioners (\"Board\"), and granting summary judgment for defendant-appellee, Pelican Cleaners d.b.a. Dale Cleaners (\"Dale Cleaners\"). For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Case History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The Franklin County Board of Commissioners, Commissioner John O'Grady, Commissioner Paula Brooks, and Commissioner Marilyn Brown, posted an invitation to bid on a contract to provide cleaning services for the Franklin County Sheriff's Department. The deadline for the bid was May 12, 2016. Swan Cleaners and Dale Cleaners submitted the only two bids. The Board determined that Dale Cleaners was the lowest and best bid and awarded the contract on July 5, 2016. The contract stated that cleaning services were to begin on August 1, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On May 17, 2016, Swan Cleaners wrote a letter indicating that they suspected Dale Cleaners was using what they believed was an improper laundering method other than dry cleaning in fulfilling the previous version of the contract and that Dale Cleaners should be disqualified from bidding. The inference from the letter was that Dale Cleaners would continue to use improper methods on the contract being bid on. Swan Cleaners then filed the original lawsuit complaint on June 30, 2016. The Board was the only defendant named in the complaint. On July 1, 2016,\n   Swan Cleaners' motion for a temporary restraining order pursuant to Civ.R. 65 was denied. The contract was awarded four days later on July 5, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The lawsuit was referred to a magistrate for a preliminary injunction hearing to be held on July 18, 2016 after the contract had been awarded, but prior to the anticipated implementation of the contract on August 1, 2016. However, the hearing was continued at the request of Swan Cleaners' counsel to August 18, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On July 13, 2016, Swan Cleaners filed an amended complaint which added Dale Cleaners as a defendant and sought a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining the Board from awarding the contract which had already been awarded. The amended complaint also sought an order declaring an award of the contract instead to Swan Cleaners, or a declaration that the entire bidding process be rebid. Again, the amended complaint naming Dale Cleaners and seeking an injunction was filed more than one week after the contract had been awarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On August 1, 2016, Dale Cleaners began performance of the contract. On October 11, 2016, the Board filed a motion for summary judgment. On November 15, 2016, Dale Cleaners filed a motion for summary judgment and a motion to stay discovery. A status conference was held on January 24, 2017, at which time Dale Cleaners agreed to a deposition of one of its representatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On February 13, 2017, Dale Cleaners stated that its motion for continuance pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F) was moot. (Swan Cleaners' brief, Ex. A.) On February 14, 2017, the trial court issued its decision granting the motions for summary judgment for both appellees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Swan Cleaners timely appealed this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The amended complaint sought a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining the Board from awarding the contract to Dale Cleaners, an order declaring that Dale Cleaners' bid is noncompliant under section 2.14 of the invitation to bid while Swan Cleaners' bid is compliant, a declaration that the invitation to bid is ambiguous, an order declaring an award of the contract to Swan Cleaners, or a declaration that the entire bidding process must be rebid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Swan Cleaners sought relief only concerning the bidding phase of the contract. Swan Cleaners' initial attempt to thwart the awarding of contract was unsuccessful. The contract had been awarded to Dale Cleaners on July 5, 2016, while Swan Cleaners' amended complaint was filed on July 13, 2016. Swan Cleaners effectively ended its pursuit of a preliminary injunction on July 18, 2016, when it continued the magistrate's hearing to a date after the implementation of the contract. Again, in the amended complaint, Swan Cleaners sought relief that only concerned the bidding or award of the contract. If we were to decide in favor of Swan Cleaners, the only relief that could be granted would concern the bidding phase of the contract, which had passed by the time Swan Cleaners had filed the amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 18} We find that, following the denial of Swan Cleaners' motion for a temporary restraining order, Swan Cleaners failed to obtain an injunction pending appeal and was not improperly denied an injunction. Because the contract was awarded and Swan Cleaners was not successful in its pursuit of available remedies, we find that Swan Cleaners' appeal is rendered moot. The relief sought only concerns actions that concern the bidding of the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meccon, Inc. v.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Having found the assignments of error moot and hence overruled, we affirm the decision of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   HORTON, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   DORRIAN, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n  <author id=\"p-48\">\n   DORRIAN, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 23} I concur in part and dissent in part from the opinion of the majority. I respectfully dissent and would sustain the first and second assignments of error as to appellant's request for (1) declaratory judgment that Resolution 496-16 was unlawful and void (Amended Complaint at \u00b6 40(d)); and (2) writ of mandamus ordering that the Commissioners unlawfully passed Resolution 496-16 (Amended Complaint at \u00b6 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 24} I would reject appellee's argument that appellant's requested relief is moot because it was directed solely at the bidding phase of the contract which was completed. The claims outlined above address more than the bidding phase of the contract. They address the actual award of the contract. Furthermore, I would reject appellee's argument that appellant's requested relief is moot because performance has already begun on the contract. The authority to which appellee cites in support of this argument involved public contracts for construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Gaylor, Inc. v.

Franklin Cty. Bd. of Commrs.\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 08AP-108,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-6824\">\n    2008-Ohio-6824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%205381926\">\n    2008 WL 5381926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20 (\"In a\n   <em>\n    construction-related case\n   </em>\n   , if an unsuccessful bidder seeking to enjoin the construction of a public-works project fails to obtain a stay of the construction pending judicial resolution of its claims challenging the decision, and construction commences, the unsuccessful bidder's\n   action will be dismissed as moot.\"). (Emphasis added.) Appellees point to no authority that mootness applies for this reason in non-construction-related cases, and it is not clear to me that the same logic would apply to the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Finally, I note that Exhibit A, attached to appellant's brief, reveals that while appellant agreed that appellee's motion for continuance, pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F), was moot, appellant informed the court that the parties \"have agreed to very limited discovery and have a deposition scheduled for March 1 [2017].\" Notwithstanding, being aware that the parties had worked out a discovery schedule, the trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment on February 14, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Therefore, as to these limited claims for relief only, I would find the trial court erred in finding them to be moot. I would reverse and remand these claims and instruct the trial court to allow appellant to complete discovery regarding the same. Accordingly, I would sustain the first and second assignments of error. I would not address the third assignment of error as to these limited claims as to do so would be premature until after discovery is completed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
