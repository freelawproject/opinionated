Bradford (\"appellant\") appeals his bench trial convictions for two felonies of the third degree: shooting a firearm over a public road with gun specifications, and having a weapon while under disability. Appellant was sentenced to a prison term of four years and nine months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reverse the judgment of the trial court and vacate the convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background and Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-15-600941-D\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant, generally known by the nickname \"T. Bear,\" short for \"Teddy Bear,\" was originally indicted on August 17, 2015, in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-15-598409-A as part of an 85-count secret indictment naming 17 individuals. The case was dismissed and reindicted in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-15-600941-D charging appellant and codefendants Andre Ingram (\"Ingram\"); Bradford's brothers, Bradley Bradford (\"Bradley\") and Lawrence Black (\"Black\"); and Edwina Neal (\"Neal\"), the mother of the three brothers, with counts relating to several shooting incidents. The counts included charges of gang activity (\"\n   <em>\n    Gang Case\n   </em>\n   \"). Appellant was named in a single incident charged in the\n   <em>\n    Gang Case.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The indictments related to a series of shootings allegedly related to gang activity between the Broadway Gang (\"Broadway\") and Fleet Boys (\"Fleet\") from January to November 2015. The gangs' names were adopted based on the geographic areas in the southeast area of Cleveland in which the members resided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-16-604662-A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On March 23, 2016, a 10-count indictment was issued against appellant in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-16-604662 (\"\n   <em>\n    Superior Case\n   </em>\n   \"). The state alleged that on July 3, 2015, appellant was involved \"in a gun battle with another vehicle\" in the area of Superior Avenue and East 92nd Street, causing injury to the hand of a seven-year-old boy. (Tr. 124.) Appellant was charged with attempted murder, two counts of felonious assault, two counts of discharge of firearm on prohibited premises, four counts of improperly discharging a firearm into a habitation, and one count of having a weapon while under disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} At the time of the indictment, appellant was awaiting sentencing for a guilty plea entered on April 14, 2015, to a fifth-degree felony drug possession ( R.C. 2925.11(A) ) in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-14-584927. The case was assigned to the mental health and developmental disabilities docket based on the medical report of Dr. Michael Aronoff upon examining appellant. Appellant was prescribed Risperdal and Lexapro. Sentencing for that case was stayed until the time of the verdict in the instant case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On September 14, 2016, Ingram, Neal, Bradley, Black, and appellant signed jury waivers. Neal entered a guilty plea to Count 46 of the\n   <em>\n    Gang Case\n   </em>\n   indictment for improper handling of firearms in a motor vehicle. The indictment stated that on July 6, 2015, Neal knowingly transported a loaded .40 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson handgun in a 2004 black Ford SUV that was accessible to any individual in the vehicle ( R.C. 2923.16(B) ), a fourth-degree felony. The weapon and vehicle were forfeited, and the remaining charges dismissed. Neal was sentenced on October 31, 2016, to community control with conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Nineteen-year-old Ingram entered a guilty plea to Count 1, participating in a criminal gang ( R.C. 2923.42(A) ), a second-degree felony, and Count 24, felonious assault ( R.C. 2903.11(A)(2) ), a second-degree felony, with a three-year firearm specification. The five-year agreed sentence ran consecutive to Ingram's then current five-year sentence in\n   <em>\n    State v. Ingram\n   </em>\n   , Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-15-598906, for felonious assault ( R.C. 2903.11(A)(1) ). The remaining charges were dismissed. Ingram did not agree to testify against the remaining defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellant, Bradley, and Black rejected plea deals involving 5- to 15-year-incarceration-recommendations in the\n   <em>\n    Gang Case.\n   </em>\n   (Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-15-600941.) The\n   <em>\n    Gang Case\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    Superior Case\n   </em>\n   against appellant only (Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-16-604662) were consolidated for purposes of the bench trial. The majority of the evidence related to codefendants Bradley and Black.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The trial court held that appellant was not guilty of all counts in the\n   <em>\n    Gang Case\n   </em>\n   , including finding that appellant was not a participant in a criminal gang, as even \"the state's own witnesses suggested otherwise.\" (Tr. 1487.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Superior Case\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In light of appellant's exoneration in the\n   <em>\n    Gang Case\n   </em>\n   , we focus our analysis on the evidence pertinent to the convictions underlying the instant appeal in the\n   <em>\n    Superior Case\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Fred Booker (\"Booker\") testified as part of a plea agreement. Booker stated that he would \"hang out\" with individuals in the Fleet gang including Black and Bradley, but as to appellant \"Teddy Bear,\" Booker stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   PROSECUTOR: How about Maurice Bradford?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   BOOKER: Yeah, I be around him but I never sincerely, like we never hung out together, like was in the streets together.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   PROSECUTOR: All right. So he was different than the other ones you hung out with?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   BOOKER: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Tr. 584.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Booker confirmed during cross-examination that appellant did not hang out with the group. Appellant was never involved in discussions about shooting or retaliating, and was devoted to caring for his brother Larry Bradford, a wheelchair bound paraplegic, and appellant's two children. Booker never heard appellant talk about having or using guns or saw him with one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Booker was aware that appellant had been shot at several times.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   COUNSEL: And do you know why he's been shot at?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   BOOKER: Because he be with-around Fleet and his family from Fleet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   COUNSEL: Okay. Do you know of him ever shooting back at anybody?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   BOOKER: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Tr. 670.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Eight-year-old victim E.J. testified that he was playing outside in the street and on the sidewalks with his siblings and friends on July 3, 2015, near his former residence on East 92nd Street just south of Superior Avenue. The children heard \"pops\" and \"whistles,\" and E.J.'s father yelled at them to duck and run. (Tr. 882.) E.J. was running toward his father who was in front of their house when he saw blood on his right hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Traffic proceeding on East 92nd Street is limited to one-way, northbound only. E.J. did not see a car drive down his street in the wrong direction, but he did see a car turn right at the first two-way street at the southerly end of his block. E.J. did not see the car pass him on the street. There was no cross-examination of E.J.'s testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On July 3, 2015, nurse Oina Friedman (\"Friedman\") was attending a barbeque at the home of his friend, Andre, who lived several houses south of E.J.'s residence. Andre is also E.J.'s uncle. The home was located on East 92nd Street and Shipherd Avenue, the intersection where E.J. observed a car turn right. According to Friedman's description, based on review of depictions referenced in the transcript but not placed in the record, Andre's residence was located at least ten houses from, and south of, the intersection of Superior and East 92nd Street. Andre's house was on the westside of the street. Friedman arrived at the function about 5:30 p.m. The shooting occurred at approximately 9:00 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Friedman was descending the front steps of the home just a few feet from the sidewalk when he heard shooting. Friedman described a dark sedan and a Dodge Charger proceeding easterly at Superior and East 92nd Street, at the other end of the block. East 92nd Street is a one-way street that allows traffic to proceed northerly to Superior. \"The Dodge Charger was basically taking shots from the other car, and the Dodge Charger [turned and] came up 92nd the wrong way because 92nd empties out onto Superior.\" (Tr. 939.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The Charger turned right onto East 92nd Street, driving the wrong way down the one-way street, and the \"other car that was shooting at him, they shot and they kept going.\" (Tr. 940.) \"The guy in the Dodge Charger, he appeared to just be trying to get away. He was-he wasn't having whatever it was. I don't know what it was.\" (Tr. 940.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Friedman did not see how the shooting began. \"I just saw the end result, the shooting and the guy in the Dodge trying to flee from that corner and his only way out was making a right hand turn [onto East 92nd] because it was during traffic.\" (Tr. 940.) Friedman stated that, as the Charger turned the corner at the other end of the block, he could see a single hand pointing a gun out of the back passenger window of the Charger. \"[A]nd what he ended up-the shooting that he ended up doing was nothing, you know. He was trying to basically defend himself. He shot-it was a hand held out [of the back passenger window].\" (Tr. 941.) Friedman states the Charger was at the other end of the block from where he was standing, in front of the first house on East 92nd Street, at least nine houses from where Friedman was standing, when he observed the hand in the back car window.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The Charger proceeded down East 92nd Street and passed Friedman as he began walking toward Superior to where E.J. was standing with his father. The Charger turned right at Shipherd. E.J.'s hand was bleeding. Friedman called\n   911 and helped calm E.J. and his parents until the emergency medical service (\"EMS\") arrived. Friedman was able to give partial license plate information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Friedman could not see the driver of the Charger. The windows were rolled up and darkly tinted. He assumed there had to be a second person in the Charger based on his observation of the extended hand in the rear passenger window, \"unless the driver was Stretch Armstrong.\" (Tr. 947.) He estimated that the Charger fired about six shots when it turned onto East 92nd Street, and the sedan fired 40 or more shots. \"[T]he Charger was clearly outgunned and outmanned by the guys\" in the other car. (Tr. 947.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Friedman did not see how shooting from the Charger could have impacted E.J. The sedan initiated the gun fire. (Tr. 953.) Friedman could see that the occupants of the sedan were \"hanging out the window\" shooting. (Tr. 954.) The sedan's occupants had handguns, and one had a larger gun. The hand in the Charger window held a small handgun. (Tr. 955.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 23} On July 3, 2015, Detective Joseph Edwards (\"Det. Edwards\") was working as a Third District Cleveland Police patrolman. Det. Edwards and his partner, Officer David Crane (\"Officer Crane\"), responded to the 911 call reporting the shooting that was received at approximately 9:00 p.m. They discovered a number of shell casings near the crosswalk at the intersection of East 92nd Street and Superior. A bullet also entered a home across the street from E.J.'s home, but there were no injuries. The bullet entered through the gutter and into the living room from the direction of Superior. (Tr. 968.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Det. Edwards interviewed E.J.'s father and Friedman at the father's home. He was informed that a Charger with tinted windows and chrome or silver wheels was observed. (Tr. 969.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Detective Lawayne Smith (\"Det. Smith\") of the crime scene investigative unit confirmed the caliber of the casings located at the scene. No bullets were recovered at the damaged home location; however, the bullet entered from the northerly side of the home from Superior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Detective Todd Wiles (\"Det. Wiles\") was employed as a civilian crime analyst for the Cleveland Police Department. His testimony focused, over extensive defense objections based on\n   <em>\n    State v. Dunn\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101648,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-3138\">\n    2015-Ohio-3138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204656534\">\n    2015 WL 4656534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   on cell phone calls and texts, and which tower locations were utilized by the cell phone in question, known as cell phone tower mapping. Records were secured from the cell phone provider via subpoena. After much discussion about the inferences to be drawn from the testimony and evidence, the trial court determined it would allow the information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Det. Wiles used the cell phone records for a cell phone allegedly owned by appellant that were secured by Detective Aaron Reese (\"Det. Reese\") to create\n   a map for the period July 3, 2015, through the end of July 4, 2015. Excerpts of the five pages of the records reflected cell phone calls during that time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Detective Aaron Reese (\"Det. Reese\"), a 20-year police veteran, became a detective in 2014. He responded to the July 3, 2015 shooting of E.J. Det. Reese talked with witnesses and police at the scene and visited the hospital where E.J. was being treated. He subsequently followed up with the officers that prepared the initial crime report and the listed witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 29} A \"gray or a silver or even a charcoal colored Dodge Charger\" was at the scene. (Tr. 1100.) The partial license plate information resulted in a broad base of possibilities. Det. Reese made no progress until he received information regarding other cases gleaned from the National Integrated Ballistic Identification Network (\"NIBIN\"), managed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (\"ATF\"). NIBIN maintains ballistic evidence records including shell casings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The NIBIN reports listed a number of incidents involving purported members of Broadway and Fleet. The reports included incidents where appellant was a victim, which \"jogged\" Det. Reese's memory. (Tr. 1105.) He then recalled meeting appellant previously when appellant and Neal flagged him down about a carjacking. (Tr. 1102.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Det. Reese had a \"good conversation\" with appellant and Neal. He drove them home and may have driven one of appellant's brothers home also. (Tr. 1102-1103.) Det. Reese recalled that the alleged carjacking was of the Charger that was actually owned by Neal. The vehicle had not been stolen but had been towed for an investigation by the police relating to shootings involved in the\n   <em>\n    Gang Case.\n   </em>\n   Det. Reese later learned that there were bullet holes in the vehicle, but he did not know whether they were \"fresh\" nor could the source be identified. (Tr. 1107.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Det. Reese obtained a search warrant for the cell phone that appellant had in his possession when he was arrested to see if there was any evidence in the cell phone to link appellant to E.J.'s shooting. (Tr. 1109.) He also obtained a search warrant for records from the cell phone provider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Det. Reese received the cell phone tower mapping information from Det. Wiles and began assembling a grand jury package based on the mapping information, the NIBIN hits for shell casings where appellant was allegedly present, and the witnesses' statements that the Charger was present at Superior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Det. Reese admitted that he could not tell from the shell casing information whether appellant \"was shooting, being shot at\" or was just present at the scenes where the casings were found. (Tr. 1112.) He concluded that appellant was at Superior based on cell tower mapping and also concluded appellant was in possession of the phone on the night July 3, 2015, because of photographs taken with the phone that morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 35} None of the witnesses could make a physical identification of appellant. (Tr. 1115.) The 40 casings determined to be NIBIN hits were related to various shooting incidents. However, Det. Reese was not aware that none of the casings had been linked to appellant, except as a victim, but were matched to other individuals. In fact, the eight shell casings found at Superior were all linked to a gun connected to a Broadway gang member, Deron\n   Williams (\"Williams\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Tr. 1126.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 36} In some cases, Det. Reese did not review the police reports, and in other cases, the information had been updated after the grand jury information was assembled. (Tr. 1122-1126.) Det. Reese admitted in response to questions by the trial court that if he had the updated information, he would have factored it into his decision-making regarding appellant's prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   COURT: Had you had this information that [defense counsel] suggests regarding casings that were recovered and when and where and how, you would have factored that into your decision-making?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   WITNESS: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   COURT: You acknowledge that would be important to have?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   WITNESS: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   (Tr. 1137.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Det. Reese also explained that sometimes the NIBIN data is entered into the system much later than the information is discovered. \"In fact, I've had cases where I find out about NIBIN hits postconviction, a year later but come to find out our lab had the information perhaps six months previously.\" Det. Reese assured the trial court that he did not overlook the information or choose not to follow up. (Tr. 1138.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Kristen Koeth (\"Koeth\"), a scientific examiner with the Cleveland Police Department's Department of Public Safety, was permitted to testify as a ballistics expert. (Tr. 1146.) Koeth reviewed the ballistic reports including the types of weapons involved in the shooting and, where known, who was associated with the weapon. Defense counsel ultimately engaged in an on-the-record stipulation to the ballistic evidence. Koeth confirmed that none of the evidence was tied to appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Detective Al Johnson (\"Det. Johnson\") has been a detective with the Cleveland Police Gang Impact Unit since 2013 and with the department since 2007. Det. Johnson also served as a corrections officer and became familiar with the Heartless Felons gang within the jail as well as during his tenure as a patrolman with the Community Services Unit. He was also familiar with other gangs such as the Aryan Brotherhood, Crips, Bloods, and Vice Lords.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Det. Johnson testifies at gang cases to provide information about gang operations and has testified as a gang expert in four cases. Det. Johnson explained the history of various youth gangs, including the Heartless Felons, which was formed in the juvenile corrections system in 2000 to 2002 to protect themselves against other youth groups in the juvenile system. A lot of his information is obtained from social media.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Det. Johnson talked about the spring and summer 2015 shootings involving Fleet and Broadway. The shootings ultimately ended about the time that Bradley was shot and almost killed. Blanket arrest warrants were issued for suspected Broadway and Fleet members, including \"Papa\" Houston, \"Ballzy\" Palmer, Booker, Black, Neal, and appellant. Bradley was still hospitalized. (Tr. 1223.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Det. Johnson reviewed numerous photographs extracted from social media accounts. He identified individuals depicted in the media photographs, confirming\n   the various gang memberships of multiple individuals, described the scenes, including guns and gang signs, and read some of the social media comments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 43} The information regarding appellant was distinguishable from that of the other individuals. The only social media posts of appellant were family photographs with his children and paraplegic brother, Larry. In spite of the lack of any gang affiliation evidence, Det. Johnson offered an \"opinion\" that appellant was \"affiliated\" with Fleet:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   COUNSEL: Moving on to Maurice Bradford, did you render any opinion as to whether or not he was affiliated with any gangs during this time in 2015 we've been speaking of?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   WITNESS: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   COUNSEL: And what was your-\n   <em>\n    what is your opinion\n   </em>\n   ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   WITNESS: Again, with Maurice, Maurice\n   <em>\n    was not\n   </em>\n   a Heartless Felon. He\n   <em>\n    was not\n   </em>\n   ACG [Ave Click Goon gang], but he was affiliated, and he would be under the Fleet Ave Gang.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   COUNSEL: And we don't really have any photo of him flashing the gang signs like that, or like some of the other members, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   WITNESS: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   COUNSEL: Does that-the absence of those photographs or social media, how did that affect your opinion in this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   WITNESS: My\n   <em>\n    opinion\n   </em>\n   was based on incidents and the surrounding-and the people that were with the incidents, the people that were involved in the incidents going back and forth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   COUNSEL: Okay.\n   <em>\n    So you based it on the associations and the incidents.\n   </em>\n   You're referring to shootings, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   WITNESS: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   (Emphasis added.) (Tr. 1311-1312.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Det.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   map attached as Appendix A to this opinion.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition to the approximately 12 houses, there are several vacant lots and trees. There is also a commercial building at the southwest corner of Superior. The barbeque activities were being held in the side lot on the southerly side of Andre's house, adjacent to Shipherd Avenue where the Charger ultimately turned right off of East 92nd Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   {\u00b6 75} From the front steps of Andre's house by the sidewalk at 9:00 p.m., almost 300 yards (889.63 feet) down the street, Friedman saw a car chase involving a dark sedan and a Charger at the intersection of Superior and East 92nd Street. The dark sedan was shooting at the Charger, and the Charger turned right onto East 92nd Street. \"The other car that was shooting at [the Charger], they shot and\n   <em>\n    they kept going\n   </em>\n   [on Superior]. The guy in the Dodge Charger, he appeared to just be trying to get away.\" (Emphasis added.) (Tr. 940.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   {\u00b6 76} \"I mean, listen to me. There's a tree right in front of the house, the limbs on that tree was falling off because of what they were shooting.\" Friedman also added that \"bullets were whizzing across our heads.\" Friedman told the other barbeque guests \"[e]verybody get down. * * * That's the first time in my life I ever had bullets whiz across the top of my head.\" (Tr. 952-953.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   {\u00b6 77} The Charger was \"[b]etween the corner [at Superior Avenue], and let's say that first house, from the corner,\" about 10 houses and several lots away, when Friedman saw a single \"hand held out\" of the back passenger window shooting a gun. The Charger \"was trying to basically defend himself.\" (Tr. 941.) Friedman said he saw a hand shoot \"a few times\" back at the car that was returning fire.\" (Tr. 941.) Later, Friedman \"assum[ed] half dozen maybe\" shots were fired from the Charger instead of a few. (Tr. 947.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   {\u00b6 78} Friedman estimated that the occupants in the dark sedan on Superior shot at least 40 times, though he \"couldn't see them because, you know, distance, but they took on just the, you know, image of cowboys, if you will. They were hanging out like windows [as] they were shooting.\" (Tr. 948.) The ballistics evidence was that the only shell casings found at the scene\n   were at the intersection of East 92nd Street and Superior Avenue, and all of them were sourced to the same individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   {\u00b6 79} Though the dark sedan \"shot and they kept going,\" Friedman could see that one of the sedan shooters had a \"decent size long gun.\" (Tr. 940, 954.) Also from that distance, he could see the single hand, holding a \"small handgun\" out of the Charger's back passenger window. \"It was just a bang, bang, bang, bang and let's get out of here.\" (Tr. 955.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   {\u00b6 80} Friedman then began walking north on East 92nd Street to see if anyone was injured since a number of people were outside when the shooting occurred. The Dodge Charger drove quickly past him and \"wasn't menacing or anything like that. We couldn't see him. He was trying to get away.\" (Tr. 943.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   {\u00b6 81} Friedman's 911 call was brief, reporting a shooting and injuries. He stated his belief that two people had been shot, then said that a child had been shot in the hand and identified the child's location. During the call, Friedman attributed the shooting to a Dodge Charger but did not mention the sedan at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   {\u00b6 82} Friedman could not see anyone in the Charger, but he \"assumed that [there] was a driver, [and] unless the driver was Stretch Armstrong, [there] had to be a second person in the car.\" (Tr. 947.) He could see \"[n]o shadows\" when the Charger passed. (Tr. 948.) The windows were darkly tinted, and it was getting dark outside. \"[B]y the time [the Charger] got to me, everybody in the car was laying down.\" (Tr. 955.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   {\u00b6 83} Friedman estimated the Charger's speed at 35 to 40 mph as it first made the right hand turn onto the street, then it accelerated but slowed down as it approached to make the right turn at Shipherd. Even with Friedman's distance from the actual shooting, the speed of the vehicle, number of shots being fired, the description of bullets whistling past him, distractions and ensuing darkness, Friedman testified to detailed observation about a single hand. \"I'm going to tell you from the mere sound of it, the guys who were on Superior, they had way more guns.\" (Tr. 952.) \"That's the first time in my life I ever had bullets whiz across the top of my head.\" (Tr. 953.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   {\u00b6 84} The ballistic evidence proved that the gun that shot E.J. on July 3, 2015, was listed in several NIBIN reports, including the shooting of appellant on May 17, 2015, and the drive-by shooting and firebombing of appellant's residence. The gun was recovered from Williams of the Broadway gang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   {\u00b6 85} In addition to the hand-out-of-the-back-passenger-window-from-almost-300-yards-away-past-trees-and-shrubs-with-bullets-whizzing-overhead-at-9:00 p.m. testimony, the trial court noted that the cell phone tower activity map indicated that appellant's cell phone and the Dodge Charger were at Superior at the time of the incident. Cell tower activity evidence has been permitted in Ohio to indicate that a cell phone was connected to a certain tower at a certain time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   {\u00b6 86} Typically, cell phone tower mapping by a lay person permits an inference to be drawn by the factfinder that the cell phone owner was in the area at the listed time, to corroborate other evidence of the defendant's presence at a crime scene.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v.

The more than 800 social media posts of appellant reflected no gang activity whatsoever, only family activities with his children and brother Larry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   {\u00b6 89} Booker, admittedly part of Fleet, testified that he \"hung out\" with Bradley and other members of Fleet but that appellant did not hang out in the streets with them. Appellant was \"different than the other ones.\" (Tr. 584.) Appellant was never involved in discussions about shooting or retaliating, and spent most of his time with his children and caring for Larry. Booker never knew appellant to use guns or talk about having guns. (Tr. 668-669.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   {\u00b6 90} No weapons were attributed to appellant in either case before the trial court. No bullet casings were traced to appellant. In fact, in spite of Friedman's testimony that there were guys hanging out of the sedan windows shooting at least 40 times, though they shot and kept going, the only ballistic evidence was located at the corner of Superior and East 92nd Street and traced back to Williams. The evidence supports the presence of an automobile and a cell phone, but not of specific individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   {\u00b6 91} The trial court heard three weeks of testimony by numerous witnesses in the consolidated bench trial. Much of the evidence related to charges that did not involve appellant or where appellant was actually the victim.

The evidence supports the presence of the Charger, but no evidence supports that appellant was in the Charger.

That evidence does not prove who took the photographs or whether, assuming they were taken by appellant, the cell phone was in appellant's presence that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   {\u00b6 96} Neal was the registered owner of the Charger, as she was for the SUV driven by another son that she forfeited as part of her plea. There is no evidence that appellant had sole access to the Charger. Based on the record, the family members, including Bradley and Black, had access to the vehicles owned by Neal, such as the black SUV forfeited by Neal in the\n   <em>\n    Gang Case.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   {\u00b6 97} The trial court determined in the\n   <em>\n    Gang Case\n   </em>\n   that the evidence \"did not establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Maurice Bradford was a participant in the criminal gang. The state's own witnesses suggested otherwise.\" (Tr. 1488.) As a result, the trial court concluded that \"Mr. Maurice Bradford is not guilty\" of participating in a criminal gang.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20N.E.2d%20541\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   {\u00b6 98} The trial court impressively handled a daunting task, involving three weeks of testimony from 20 witnesses, several who testified under plea agreements. The trial court deftly entertained hundreds of exhibits and adjudicated numerous evidentiary objections involving two consolidated cases with multiple defendants in one case, one of whom was also the sole defendant in the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   {\u00b6 99} We find that even when viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support the verdict in this case. Accepting that the Charger and a cell phone were present at Superior and the sole witness saw a single hand shoot a small gun from a back seat car window from a block away at 9:00 p.m. in the midst of the melee described by Friedman, the evidence is insufficient to support the presence of appellant at Superior, which subsumes the theories of complicity, aiding, and abetting. This analysis also serves to reverse the finding on the charge of having a weapon while under disability 2923.13(A)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   {\u00b6 100} In addition to sufficiency, choosing to further address the manifest weight issue, the analysis set forth herein also serves as the foundation of our finding that, sitting as a thirteenth juror and considering whether the \"greater amount of credible evidence\" supports the conviction, the verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    Thompkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"375127\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/78/380/#p386\">\n    78 Ohio St.3d at 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20N.E.2d%20541\">\n    678 N.E.2d 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   {\u00b6 101} Coupled with the evidence underlying our finding of insufficiency, the trial court acknowledged that the weight of\n   the evidence supported: (1) Broadway was the aggressor at Superior, (2) the state failed to demonstrate that appellant was involved with gang activities, (3) appellant was not known to carry a gun, hang out with gang members, or to engage in discussions of gang retaliation for shootings by Broadway, even after he was shot, all as supported by the state's own witness and evidence, and (4) that the cell mapping, which goes to the weight of the evidence, does not demonstrate that appellant was personally present at Superior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   {\u00b6 102} For the foregoing reasons, we find that the evidence was insufficient and against the manifest weight to sustain the convictions in this case, rendering the remaining assignments of error moot. App.R. 12(A). Appellant's convictions are ordered vacated, and appellant is ordered discharge from prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   {\u00b6 103} Judgment vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   LARRY A.

CELEBREZZE, JR., J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT ONLY:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   {\u00b6 104} While I concur with the majority's resolution of appellant's fifth assignment of error and determination that there was insufficient evidence to support appellant's convictions for discharging a firearm on or near prohibited premises and having a weapon while under disability, I respectfully disagree with the holding that the evidence is insufficient to support the presence of appellant at Superior Avenue at the time of the incident. In my view, the state's evidence, if believed, establishes that appellant was in the area where the shooting took place. However, I believe that the state failed to establish that appellant was inside the Charger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   {\u00b6 105} The July 3 shooting took place at approximately 9:00 p.m. at East 92nd Street and Superior Avenue. Cleveland Police Department Crime Analyst Wiles testified that appellant's cell phone connected with a cell tower at East 100th Street and Superior Avenue at 9:08 p.m. The record reflects that the cell tower with which appellant's cell phone connected is approximately 2/10 of a mile from the location that the shooting took place. Although Wiles's testimony, if believed, establishes that appellant was in the general area that the shooting took place, it does not establish that appellant was inside the Charger, much less that he had a firearm in his possession or fired any shots from inside the Charger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   {\u00b6 106} Cleveland Police Detective Reese testified about an incident that occurred a few years ago during which appellant flagged him down in the Broadway neighborhood after the Charger had been carjacked. Detective Reese explained that when appellant flagged him down, \"one of his brothers may have been there.\" (Tr. 1102-1103.) After Detective Reese spoke with appellant and his brother, he drove them home. Detective Reese's testimony, if believed, establishes at best that appellant had access to and either drove or rode in the Charger on a prior occasion. His testimony does not establish, however, that appellant was inside the Charger during the July 3 shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   {\u00b6 107} There was no eyewitness testimony or physical evidence establishing that appellant was, in fact, inside the Charger during the shootout. The Charger was registered to appellant's mother, codefendant Neal. There is no evidence that appellant was the only person that drove or had access to the Charger. In fact, the\n   record reflects that appellant's codefendant brothers, Bradley Bradford and Lawrence Black, also had access to the Charger. Accordingly, I find that the state failed to establish that appellant was inside the Charger during the shoot out, much less that appellant had a weapon and fired any shots from inside the vehicle. Therefore, I would sustain appellant's fifth assignment of error and vacate appellant's convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   {\u00b6 108} In my view, appellant's sixth assignment of error is moot and we need not address whether appellant's convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence. For all of these reasons, I respectfully concur in judgment only.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    The sentence included a concurrent six-month sentence related to\n    <em>\n     State v.

Bradley was charged in another case, and the prosecution did not want to resolve appellant's drug case until Bradley's new case was resolved.
