No. CR-[12]-561797-A, [Roberts] pled to robbery. He was originally sentenced to community control sanctions and ordered\n   to participate in a community-based treatment program. The trial court informed him that he would be sentenced to a four-year prison term if he violated his community control sanctions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [Roberts's] second case was Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-[13]-578409-A, in which he pled to breaking and entering. The trial court sentenced him to an 11-month prison term, but suspended the sentence so that he could continue to participate in the treatment program. The court continued his community control sanctions for 18 months, to run consecutive to the first case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Several months later, [Roberts] entered guilty pleas in three other separate cases. In Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-14-584010-A, he pled to escape; in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-14-586073-A, he pled to two counts of burglary; and in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-14-584791-A, he pled to burglary with a notice of prior conviction specification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   In August 2014, the trial court held a sentencing hearing. The court terminated [Roberts's] community control sanctions in Case Nos. CR-[12]-561797-A and CR-[13]-578409-A, and sentenced him to four years and 11 months, respectively, on those cases. In Case No. CR-14-584010-A, [Roberts] was sentenced to six months; in Case No. CR-14-586073-A, he was sentenced to seven years on each of the two burglary counts, to be served concurrent to each other; and in Case No. CR-14-584791-A, he was sentenced to seven years. With the exception of the six-month sentence in Case No. CR-14-584010-A and the concurrent terms on the two burglary charges in Case No. CR-14-586073-A, the trial court ordered all the other terms to be served consecutively, for an aggregate sentence of 18 years and 11 months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2-6. Thus, the 18-year, 11-month aggregate prison sentence was not the maximum aggregate term at the trial court's disposal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In his second, third, and fourth assignments of error, Roberts challenges the validity of the underlying sentences, claiming (1) the prior conviction specification was contrary to law because the trial court did not rule on or reference the qualifying conviction at the resentencing hearing; (2) the trial court erred in imposing costs in the resentencing entry although the costs were properly imposed in the original sentencing; and (3) the trial court erred in ordering restitution in the resentencing hearing without first establishing the amounts due through evidence introduced at the resentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 5} We cannot address those three assigned errors, all of which challenge aspects of the underlying sentence that were not part of the limited remand.\n   <em>\n    Jenkins,\n   </em>\n   8th Dist.

R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) authorizes the trial court to order consecutive sentences if, as is pertinent to this case, consecutive service (1) is necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish the offender; (2) is not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the public; and additionally, (3) if the offender committed the offense while awaiting trial or sentencing, under community control monitoring, or under postrelease control for a prior offense.\n   <em>\n    State v. Jones\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104152,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-8145\">\n    2016-Ohio-8145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207295653\">\n    2016 WL 7295653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5, citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Smeznik\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 103196 and 103197,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-709\">\n    2016-Ohio-709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20764060\">\n    2016 WL 764060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The trial court made all the required findings, and Roberts is not challenging that aspect of his sentences. Instead, Roberts claims that the record does not support the second finding, that consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the public because the trial court referred to his criminal history collectively as eight \"aggravated burglaries.\" Further, Roberts claims that the trial court was required to find that the harm caused by the offenses was so great or unusual that no single prison term adequately reflected the seriousness of the offender's conduct under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In this case, Roberts contends that the consecutive sentences were disproportionate to his conduct and the danger he poses to the public because the trial court could not conclude that the multiple offenses he committed while serving community control sanctions, were \"so great and unusual that no single prison term for any of the offenses committed as part of any of the course of conduct adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender's conduct\" under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(b). This conclusion, however, inappropriately combines the proportionality finding with another, independent finding, one that the trial\n   court was not required to make in this particular case because it is undisputed that Roberts committed the new crimes while serving community control sanctions, under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(a). Only one of the subdivision (a)-(c) findings is necessary to support consecutive service of prison terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Further, the off-the-cuff generalization of Roberts's history of criminal conduct is a minor distinction that does not undermine the trial court's ultimate conclusion when the totality of the sentencing hearing is considered. If the court made the required findings in order to impose consecutive sentences, we must affirm those sentences unless we \"clearly and convincingly\" find that the record does not support the court's findings.

Most of that time was spent in prison. Tr. 10:21-24. To put this in perspective, at the end of 2004, Roberts pleaded guilty to burglary and was sentenced to two years in prison. In 2006, Roberts reoffended and almost a year later was sentenced to five years in prison for two burglaries. In 2012, Roberts pleaded guilty to robbery and was sentenced to community control. In 2013, Roberts pleaded guilty to breaking and entering and was sentenced to an additional term of community control. That led to the 2014 cases, which were the result of three more burglaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 12} That the trial court, in an aside, generalized Roberts's past convictions as aggravated burglaries does not undermine the proportionality finding because the trial court was expressly looking at the past offenses as being in the \"same genre of conduct\" as the current offenses. The trial court was not focused on the aggravated nature of the crimes. The record supports the trial court's finding. More than ten of Roberts's convictions involved some form of burglary or theft offense. As the trial court explained to Roberts,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   You break into people's homes. You deprive them of their safety, deprive them of their goods, and you continue to engage in the same conduct despite the fact you've been down to prison before, despite the fact that I gave you the opportunity to address that behavior through community sanctions. I don't\n   believe it's disproportionate given the fact that you now have-I think it's eight aggravated burglaries. You've got an escape. You know, there's no changing your behavior.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In context, the trial court's generalization does not amount to the proportionality finding not being supported by the record. There must be more.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Spencer\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

Roberts's history of criminal conduct demonstrates the need to prevent Roberts from harming the public through a lengthy incarceration. When Roberts is not incarcerated, he is burglarizing people's homes. The purpose of R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) is to prevent this type of career criminal from perpetuating a cycle of criminality upon the public. Moreover, R.C. 2929.12 provides that the sentencing court \"has discretion to determine the most effective way to comply with the purposes and principles of sentencing set forth in section 2929.11 of the Revised Code [,]\" including the minimum sanction necessary to accomplish protecting the public from Roberts and others. In exercising that discretion, the trial court expressly considered the need to incapacitate Roberts as a serial burglar and the need to protect the public from being victimized by Roberts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In a similar case, a panel from this court affirmed a longer aggregate sentence for an offender who committed a similar number of burglaries while serving community control sanctions.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The defendant had an extensive criminal history and one of drug dependency, but no violent offenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7-8. The victim of the home invasion, however, was traumatized and psychologically harmed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. The trial court expressed its disappointment in first granting leniency to the offender, who then committed several crimes while serving community control.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. On these facts, it was easily concluded that not only did the defendant fail to demonstrate that the record did not support the findings with respect to his 21-year aggregate sentence, but that the trial court's consecutive sentence findings actually were \"\n   <em>\n    clearly and convincingly\n   </em>\n   supported by the record.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Similar to\n   <em>\n    Aniton\n   </em>\n   , Roberts has an extensive history of criminal conduct, Roberts traumatized his victims as a result of the home invasions, and the trial court noted its failed attempt to rehabilitate Roberts by imposing community control sanctions on the earlier offenses. More importantly, Roberts could have received a longer aggregate sentence, but the trial court imposed a shorter, aggregate term than the one affirmed in\n   <em>\n    Aniton\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, we cannot clearly and convincingly find that the aggregate sentence is disproportionate\n   to Roberts's criminal conduct in general and the danger he poses to the public by continually burglarizing homes and robbing victims.

There is no \"restriction\" on appellate courts. Saying that, however, does not mean that there is a \"restriction\" on the trial court. Of course the \"restriction\" is not on the trial court-it is the standard of review for appellate courts. \"Restrictions\" on trial courts are set forth in R.C. 2929.11, 2929.12, 2929.14(C)(4) and all of the other sentencing provisions. But the statute is not written in the \"negative\"-and even if it is (simply because it contains the word \"not\"), it certainly does not mean what\n   <em>\n    Venes\n   </em>\n   (and unfortunately, the many cases following\n   <em>\n    Venes\n   </em>\n   on this point\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) says it means. If an appellate court clearly and convincingly finds that the record does not support the trial court's findings, we may increase, reduce, modify, or otherwise reverse a sentence. That is the same as saying that the record must clearly and convincingly support the trial court's findings.

Under R.C. 2953.08, appellate courts may not modify or reverse a sentence at their whim or fancy.

The legislature has clearly indicated that appeals courts must actively review sentences, not merely defer to the determinations of trial judges. Because a primary purpose of Senate Bill 2 is to eliminate disparate sentencing for similar offenses, it seems only logical that appellate courts must take a more active role in reviewing sentences than that allowed under the\n   deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. A more active review process is the only effective way to ensure that trial judges are properly and consistently applying the guidelines. Otherwise, Senate Bill 2, which was intended to overhaul felony sentencing with appellate courts playing an active role in ensuring consistency, would be meaningless.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   But the debate is not necessarily over.

We referred to this \"change in presumption from consecutive sentences to concurrent sentences\" as a \"sea change in the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39. Despite this \"sea change in the law,\" however, R.C. 2929.41(A) only required that a trial court state that it was imposing consecutive sentences to make it so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 53} In\n   <em>\n    Lett\n   </em>\n   , we surmised that the change in presumption in 1974 occurred for several reasons: \"a backlash against prosecutorial overindictment, disparity in the manner in which consecutive sentences were imposed, frustration with the virtually unreviewable nature of consecutive sentencing, and economic considerations relating to the long-term housing of prisoners.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Unfortunately, these reasons sound all too familiar. Because despite the changes made in 1974, as well as S.B. 2 over 20 years later and most recently H.B. 86, we,\n   as a state, still grapple with these same issues today. Part of the reason that we still do is because trial courts continue to impose harsh sentences far too often for nonviolent crimes, and appellate courts continue to refuse to perform their duty to provide meaningful appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 54} After review of the sentence imposed in this case, I agree with Roberts that consecutive sentences are disproportionate to the\n   <em>\n    seriousness\n   </em>\n   of his conduct and the danger he poses to the public. This is especially so in light of the principles and purposes of felony sentencing set forth in R.C. 2929.11, which states that a sentencing court \"shall be guided by the overriding purposes of felony sentencing\"-to protect the public and punish the offender-using \"the\n   <em>\n    minimum sanctions\n   </em>\n   that the court determines accomplish those purposes without imposing an unnecessary burden on state or local government resources.\" R.C. 2929.11(A). Additionally, a sentence must be \"reasonably calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of felony sentencing\" and be \"commensurate with and not demeaning to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim[.]\" R.C. 2929.11(B). I agree with Roberts that the sentence imposed by the trial court does not meet any of these requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 55} The trial court sentenced Roberts to nearly 19 years in prison-for stealing a bottle of Pepsi and pushing a store security guard, stealing $250 of fishing equipment from someone's garage, failing to report for supervision, and breaking and entering (or attempting to enter) the homes of three victims and stealing less than $2,000 worth of property. These were not violent crimes. No one was hurt. Yet, Roberts received 18 years and 11 months in prison. Without minimizing the emotional distress the burglary offenses undoubtedly caused the victims, Roberts's offenses do not reflect such seriousness and danger to the public that almost 19 years in prison is necessary to protect the public from him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Indeed, such a lengthy sentence may demean the seriousness of other crimes and the harm to other victims. For example, an offender who murders someone could get out of prison in less time; the sentence for murder is 15 years to life. R.C. 2929.02(B)(1). Rape has a maximum sentence of 11 years in prison. R.C. 2907.02(B). Offenders who repeatedly beat their significant others or spouses do not get that much time-even when the offender has multiple domestic violence convictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Russell\n   </em>\n   , 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-03-066,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-1381\">\n    2013-Ohio-1381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201438000\">\n    2013 WL 1438000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defendant who was convicted of abduction and domestic violence for beating his girlfriend was sentenced to 36 months in prison; it was his third domestic violence conviction). Those are serious crimes of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 57} At the time of these offenses here, Roberts was approximately 50 years old. According to his presentence investigation report, he was found to be barely functioning within a borderline intellectual level. He was also addicted to heroin and a lesser form of heroin. Consecutive sentences are reserved for the worst offenses and offenders.\n   <em>\n    State v. Ladson\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

There is simply nothing in the record before us to indicate that Roberts's crimes were so great or unusual that no single prison term would adequately reflect the seriousness of his conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 58} The majority compares the facts of this case to the facts in\n   <em>\n    State v. Aniton\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102440,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-4080\">\n    2015-Ohio-4080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205781059\">\n    2015 WL 5781059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , where this court\n   upheld a 21-year sentence for multiple crimes. But in\n   <em>\n    Aniton\n   </em>\n   , one of the defendant's convictions was unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, and in another, he committed some of the burglary offenses with a firearm. Plus, unlike Roberts, the defendant's prior criminal history in\n   <em>\n    Aniton\n   </em>\n   included an offense of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 59} In summary, although the court made the findings necessary to order Roberts to serve his sentences consecutively, I would clearly and convincingly find that the record does not support the trial court's finding that consecutive sentences-totaling nearly 19 years in prison-are necessary to protect the public or punish Roberts and are not disproportionate to the seriousness of Roberts's conduct and to the danger he poses to the public. While I certainly understand the trial court's frustration with Roberts, the record does not demonstrate that an 18-year and 11-month prison sentence was \"reasonably calculated to achieve\" the purposes of felony sentencing using the minimum sanctions without imposing an unnecessary burden on the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Sentence Modification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 60} In this case, the trial court sentenced Roberts to six months for escape in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-14-584010-A. The court sentenced Roberts to seven years on each of the two burglary counts in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-14-586073-A, to be served concurrent to each other. And in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-14-584791-A, the court sentenced Roberts to seven years for burglary. With the exception of the six-month sentence for escape and the concurrent terms on the two burglary charges in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-14-586073-A, the trial court ordered that all the other prison terms, including the sentences in Cuyahoga C.P. Nos. CR-12-561797-A and CR-13-578409-A, be served consecutively, which amounted to a total sentence of 18 years and 11 months in prison. I would sustain Roberts's first assignment of error, vacate the consecutive portion of his sentence, and modify the sentence to concurrent terms, for an aggregate sentence of seven years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.
