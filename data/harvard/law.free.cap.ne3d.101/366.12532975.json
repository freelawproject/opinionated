Stated differently, to obtain partial summary judgment in a comparative negligence case, must plaintiffs establish the absence of their own comparative negligence. We hold that a plaintiff does not bear that burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Carlos Rodriguez was employed by the New York City Department of Sanitation (DOS) as a garage utility worker. He was injured while \"outfitting\" sanitation trucks with tire chains and plows to enable them to clear the streets of snow and ice. The following facts are uncontradicted: On a snowy winter day, plaintiff and his two coworkers were tasked with outfitting sanitation trucks with tire chains and plows at the Manhattan 5 facility. Typically, the driver backs the truck into one of the garage bays, and the driver and other members of the team \"dress\" the truck. One person acts as a guide, assisting the driver by providing directions through appropriate hand signals while standing on the passenger's side of the truck. Once the truck is safely parked in the garage, the driver, the guide, and the third member of the team (here, plaintiff) place chains on the truck's tires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the time of his accident, plaintiff was standing between the front of a parked Toyota Prius and a rack of tires outside of the garage bay while the driver began backing the sanitation truck into the garage. The guide, at some point, stood on the\n   <em>\n    driver's\n   </em>\n   side of the sanitation truck while directing the driver in violation of established DOS safety practices. The sanitation truck began skidding and eventually crashed into the front of the parked Toyota Prius, propelling the car into plaintiff and pinning him up against the rack of tires. Plaintiff was taken to the hospital and ultimately had to undergo spinal fusion surgery, a course of lumbar epidural steroid injections, and extensive physical\n   therapy. He is permanently disabled from working.\n   Plaintiff commenced this negligence action against the City of New York. After discovery, he moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of defendant's liability pursuant to CPLR 3212. Defendant opposed the motion and cross-moved for summary judgment in its favor. Supreme Court denied both motions. In denying plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment, Supreme Court held that there were triable issues of fact regarding foreseeability, causation, and plaintiff's comparative negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Appellate Division, among other things, affirmed the denial of plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment (\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

The dissent, relying on the language and purpose of CPLR article 14-A, would have held that plaintiff does not bear the burden of disproving the affirmative defense of comparative negligence, and thus, plaintiff should have been granted partial summary judgment on the issue of defendant's liability (\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787328\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/142/778/\">\n    142 A.D.3d at 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787328\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/142/778/\">\n    37 N.Y.S.3d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [Acosta, J., dissenting] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Appellate Division granted plaintiff leave to appeal to this Court (\n   <em>\n    lv granted\n   </em>\n   --- A.D.3d ----, 2016 N.Y.

The usual rules of statutory construction apply to the provisions of the CPLR (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chianese v.

We look \"first to the plain language of the statute[ ] as the best evidence of legislative intent\" (\n   <em>\n    Matter of Malta Town Ctr. I, Ltd. v. Town of Malta Bd. of Assessment Review,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456640\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/563/#p568\">\n    3 N.Y.3d 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 568,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456640\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/563/#p568\">\n    789 N.Y.S.2d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456640\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/563/#p568\">\n    822 N.E.2d 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2004] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   CPLR 3212, which governs summary judgment motions, provides that \"[t]he motion shall be granted if ... the cause of action ... [is] established sufficiently to warrant the court as a matter of law in directing judgment in favor of any party\" ( CPLR 3212[b] ). The motion for summary judgment must also \"show that there is no defense to the cause of action\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). Further, subsection [c] of the same section sets forth the procedure for obtaining partial summary judgment and states that \"[i]f it appears that the only triable issues of fact arising on a motion for summary judgment relate to the amount or extent of damages ... the court may, when appropriate for the expeditious disposition of the controversy, order an immediate trial of such issues of fact raised by the motion\" ( CPLR 3212[c] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Article 14-A of the CPLR contains our State's codified comparative negligence principles. CPLR 1411 provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[i]n any action to recover damages for personal injury, injury to property, or wrongful death, the\n   culpable conduct attributable to the claimant or to the decedent, including contributory negligence or assumption of risk,\n   <em>\n    shall not bar recovery,\n   </em>\n   but the amount of damages otherwise recoverable shall be diminished in the proportion which the culpable conduct attributable to the claimant or decedent bears to the culpable conduct which caused the damages.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   CPLR 1412 further states that \"[c]ulpable conduct claimed in diminution of damages, in accordance with [ CPLR 1411 ], shall be an affirmative defense to be pleaded and proved by the party asserting the defense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Placing the burden on the plaintiff to show an absence of comparative fault is inconsistent with the plain language of CPLR 1412. In 1975, New York adopted a system of pure comparative negligence, and, in so doing, directed courts to consider a plaintiff's comparative fault only when considering the amount of damages a defendant owes to plaintiff. The approach urged by defendant is therefore at odds with the plain language of CPLR 1412, because it flips the burden, requiring the plaintiff, instead of the defendant, to prove an absence of comparative fault in order to make out a prima facie case on the issue of defendant's liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant's approach also defies the plain language of CPLR 1411, and, if adopted, would permit a possible windfall to defendants. CPLR 1411 explicitly provides that \"[i]n any action to recover damages for personal injury ... the culpable conduct attributable to the [plaintiff] ... shall not bar recovery, but the amount of damages otherwise recoverable shall be diminished in the proportion ... attributable to the claimant.\" For example, assuming in a hypothetical case a defendant's negligence could be established as a matter of law because defendant's conduct was in violation of a statute (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PJI 2:26 ) and further assuming plaintiff was denied partial summary judgment on the issue of defendant's negligence because plaintiff failed to establish the absence of his or her own comparative negligence, the jury would be permitted to decide the question of whether defendant was negligent and whether defendant's negligence proximately caused plaintiff's injuries. If the jury answers in the negative on the question of defendant's negligence, the plaintiff would be barred from recovery even though defendant's negligence was established as a matter of law and in contradiction to the plain language of\n   CPLR 1411. Such a windfall to a defendant would violate section 1411's mandate that a plaintiff's comparative negligence \"shall not bar recovery\" and should only go to the diminution of damages recoverable by plaintiff. Furthermore, it is no answer to this conundrum that the trial court could set aside the verdict. The whole purpose of partial summary judgment is to streamline and focus the factfinder on the issues that need resolution, and avoid having juries make findings that are contrary to law.\n   Defendant's attempts to rely on CPLR 3212's plain language in support of its preferred approach are also unavailing. Specifically, defendant points to CPLR 3212(b), which provides; \"[a] motion for summary judgment shall ... show that there is no defense to the cause of action.\" Defendant's approach would have us consider comparative fault a defense. But, comparative negligence is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a defense to the cause of action of negligence, because it is not a defense to any element (duty, breach, causation) of plaintiff's prima facie cause of action for negligence, and as CPLR 1411 plainly states, is not a bar to plaintiff's recovery, but rather a diminishment of the amount of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The approach we adopt is also supported by the legislative history of article 14-A. (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tompkins Cty. Support Collection Unit ex rel. Chamberlin v. Chamberlin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"295036\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/99/328/#p335\">\n    99 N.Y.2d 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 335,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"295036\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/99/328/#p335\">\n    756 N.Y.S.2d 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"295036\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/99/328/#p335\">\n    786 N.E.2d 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2003] [\"[T]he legislative history of an enactment may also be relevant and is not to be ignored, even if words be clear.\"] (internal quotation marks and citations omitted] ). Article 14-A's enactment was proposed by the 1975 Judicial Conference of the State of New York (the Conference) in response to this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Dole v. Dow Chemical Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2304046\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/30/143/\">\n    30 N.Y.2d 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=331%20N.Y.S.2d%20382\">\n    331 N.Y.S.2d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=282%20N.E.2d%20288\">\n    282 N.E.2d 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1972] ), which first provided for the apportionment of negligent responsibility among joint tortfeasors. In proposing the section which later became CPLR 1411, the Conference specifically noted that neither the defense of contributory negligence or assumption of risk \"shall continue to serve as complete defenses\" in negligence actions (21st Ann Rep of N.Y. Jud Conf at 240). In proposing the section which became CPLR 1412, the Conference urged the adoption of the then-majority rule in this country, which provided that \"in all negligence actions ... the defendant claiming contributory negligence of the plaintiff has the burden of showing it\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 245). The Conference also observed that the \"burden of pleading and burden of proof are usually parallel\" and that \"[t]his article may be viewed as having created a partial defense, the effect of which is to mitigate damages, and\n   such defenses traditionally must be pleaded affirmatively\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 246).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When article 14-A was proposed in the legislature, the Introducer's Memorandum before the New York Assembly noted that the then-current system of traditional contributory negligence had \"become an obstacle to the dispensing of substantial justice\" (Assembly Introducer's Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 1975, ch 69 at 5-7). The purpose of the law was to bring \"New York law into conformity with the majority rule and represents the culmination of the gradual but persistent erosion of the rule that freedom from contributory negligence must be pleaded and proven by the plaintiff\" (\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   citing\n   <em>\n    Rossman v. La Grega,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2299037\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/28/300/#p304\">\n    28 N.Y.2d 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=321%20N.Y.S.2d%20588\">\n    321 N.Y.S.2d 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=270%20N.E.2d%20313\">\n    270 N.E.2d 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1971] ). The legislative history of article 14-A makes clear that a plaintiff's comparative negligence is no longer a complete defense and its absence need not be pleaded and proved by the plaintiff, but rather is only relevant to the mitigation of plaintiff's damages and should be pleaded and proven by the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Resolution of the issue before us necessarily turns on the interpretation and interplay of these various CPLR provisions. In\n   <em>\n    Thoma v. Ronai,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2352681,2353426,2355293\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/82/736/\">\n    82 N.Y.2d 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2352681\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/82/736/2352681/\">\n    602 N.Y.S.2d 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2352681\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/82/736/2352681/\">\n    621 N.E.2d 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1993], this Court held that the plaintiff there did not meet her burden of demonstrating the absence of any material fact; \"a factual question of her reasonable care\" existed, and thus plaintiff was properly denied summary judgment (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 737,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2352681\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/82/736/2352681/\">\n    602 N.Y.S.2d 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2352681\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/82/736/2352681/\">\n    621 N.E.2d 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). However,\n   <em>\n    Thoma\n   </em>\n   never addressed\n   the precise question we now confront. The decision itself never considered the import of article 14-A, and a review of the briefs publicly filed in that case reveal that the plaintiff proceeded on the assumption that if a question of fact existed as to her negligence, summary judgment on the issue of liability would be denied. The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Thoma,\n   </em>\n   in her limited submissions to this Court, maintained that \"[t]he crux of the case is the existence, as a matter of law, of any question of culpable conduct (contributory negligence) by the Plaintiff that would warrant the Trial Court's denial of summary judgment pursuant to C.P.L.R. \u00a7 3212 on the issue of Defendant's liability\" (\n   <em>\n    Thoma,\n   </em>\n   App's Br. at 1). Thus, to the extent that the Departments of the Appellate Division have interpreted\n   <em>\n    Thoma\n   </em>\n   as explicitly holding that a plaintiff must show an absence of comparative fault in order to obtain partial summary judgment on liability, such a reading of\n   <em>\n    Thoma\n   </em>\n   is mistaken (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Global Reinsurance Corp. v.

Defendant would have us follow the line of cases that hold that plaintiff bears the burden of disproving comparative fault as a component of establishing his prima facie entitlement to partial summary judgment on the issue of defendant's liability. Defendant points to various instances of plaintiff's conduct in this case and asserts that plaintiff was comparatively negligent.

Where plaintiff has already established defendant's liability as a matter of law, granting plaintiff partial judgment eliminates the first two questions submitted to the jury, thereby serving the beneficial purpose of focusing the jury on questions and issues that are in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Nor do we agree with defendant that what it characterizes as bifurcation of the issues of defendant's liability from plaintiff's liability runs counter to the Pattern Jury Instructions. When a defendant's liability is established as a matter of law before trial, the jury must still determine whether the plaintiff was negligent and whether such negligence was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff's injuries. If so, the comparative fault of each party is then apportioned by the jury. Therefore, the jury is still tasked with considering the plaintiff's and defendant's culpability together. As a practical matter, a trial court will instruct the jury in a modified version of Pattern Jury Instruction 1:2B that the issue of defendant's negligence, and in some cases, the related proximate cause question, have been previously determined as a matter of law. Trial courts are experienced in crafting such instructions, for example when liability has already been determined in a bifurcated trial, or when an Appellate Division upholds a liability determination and remands solely for a recalculation of damages, or a trial on damages has been ordered pursuant to CPLR 3212(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    III.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   To be entitled to partial summary judgment a plaintiff does not bear the double burden of establishing a prima facie case of\n   defendant's liability and the absence of his or her own comparative fault.

To be sure, Supreme Court addressed the issue of defendant's negligence and agreed with defendant that there are questions of fact as to foreseeability and causation. We do not read the Appellate Division's majority decision as reaching the merits of whether there is any question of fact as to defendant's negligence. Both the majority and dissenting opinions at the Appellate Division framed their resolution of this appeal as turning on whether plaintiff bore the burden of proving the absence of comparative negligence. Although the majority's five-page decision contains one sentence that makes a passing reference to defendant's negligence, it is utilized to distinguish a prior case on the issue of comparative negligence as a bar to summary judgment and is not offered as an evaluation of the merits of defendant's alternative argument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Various commentators have pointed out this inconsistency. The late Professor David Siegel, a preeminent expert in New York civil practice, has referred to the approach defendant proposes as \"peculiar,\" for it \"imposes on the plaintiff the burden of establishing ... freedom from comparative fault even though by statute that's a burden of both pleading and proof borne by the defendant under the specific terms of CPLR 1412\" (Siegel,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Prac%20%C2%A7%20280\">\n     N.Y.

Requiring the plaintiff moving for partial summary judgment on liability to affirmatively establish complete freedom from comparative fault, while allow defendant to simply contend that plaintiff has committed at least some culpable conduct, appears to tilt the scales too favorably for the defendant\" (Patrick M. Connors,\n    <em>\n     Can Comparative Fault Stop the Train Known as Summary Judgment?,\n    </em>\n    NYLJ, Jan. 16, 2013 at 2).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Finally, John R. Higgitt writes in the Practice Commentaries to CPLR 3212 that the approach favored by Siegel and Connors, which he refers to as the \"Siegel approach,\" has appeal for at least two reasons. First, he notes:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n    \"CPLR 1411's language suggests that a plaintiff seeking partial summary judgment on the issue of the defendant's liability should not have the burden of showing her freedom of comparative fault ... If a plaintiff's comparative fault 'shall not bar recovery' but merely diminishes her damages award, then it would seem that the plaintiff should not be required to prove her freedom from comparative fault as a precondition to obtaining partial summary judgment on the issue of the defendant's liability\" (John R. Higgitt, Practice Commentaries, McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, CPLR C3212:15).\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Secondly, he contends that \"the Siegel approach provides for harmony between the substantive law of torts and the rules of decision on a plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    ). Higgitt writes:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n    \"A plaintiff is entitled to recover damages in a negligence action if she demonstrates that a defendant's negligence was \"a\" proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries, i.e., that the defendant's negligence was one, not necessarily the only, substantial factor in causing the injuries. Thus, a plaintiff's right of recovery arises on her showing that the defendant was negligent and that the defendant's negligence was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries, and any comparative fault on the plaintiff's part will merely diminish the damages award. Under the present rule reflected in the decisions of the First and Second Departments, a plaintiff seeking partial summary judgment on the issue of the defendant's liability is required to prove her freedom from comparative fault. That doesn't seem to jibe with the rule of substantive law providing that a plaintiff is entitled to recover once she establishes that the defendant was negligent and that the defendant's negligence was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    [citation omitted] ).\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The dissent points to recently proposed amendments to CPLR 1412, explicitly pronouncing that the party asserting the defense of comparative negligence must interpose proof of such culpable conduct when asserting the defense on a motion for summary judgment, to contend that the Legislature is \"under the impression\" that\n    <em>\n     Thoma\n    </em>\n    is the correct and currently binding rule (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    dissenting op. at 328, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 908, 101 N.E.3d at 376, citing S.2057/2017-2018 Reg Sess [NY 2017]; S7779/2016-2017 Reg Sess [NY 2016]; 2017 A.2776 [2017] ).

In addition, the court found that even if defendant's liability was established, \"plaintiff would not be entitled to summary judgment as to liability since the question of his comparative fault must be resolved at trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Appellate Division upheld Supreme Court's finding of triable issues concerning defendant's negligence. After reviewing the facts, the Appellate Division held that \"[u]nder this factual scenario, the trier of fact could determine\n   <em>\n    that defendant was free from negligence\n   </em>\n   and that plaintiff was 100% at fault in causing his injuries\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787328\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/142/778/\">\n    142 A.D.3d 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 781,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787328\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/142/778/\">\n    37 N.Y.S.3d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1st Dept. 2016] [emphasis added] ). The majority dismisses this aspect of\n   the Appellate Division's holding as a \"passing reference,\" and, without explanation, determines that this statement \"is not offered as an evaluation of the merits of defendant's alternative argument\" (majority op. at 317 n. 2, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 900 n. 2, 101 N.E.3d at 368 n. 2). Here, where the holding of two lower courts calls into question plaintiff's demonstration of defendant's liability as a matter of law, the majority's summary dismissal of this issue is inadequate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In any event, as discussed below, the fact that the City was found to have created an issue of fact as to any liability on its part highlights the unreasonableness of the majority's approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Even assuming plaintiff demonstrated the City's liability as a matter of law, our case law requires, as the Appellate Division majority held, that plaintiff's motion for summary judgment be denied. In\n   <em>\n    Thoma v.

The majority rejects\n   <em>\n    Thoma\n   </em>\n   's holding because it does not explicitly \"address[ ] [the relevant] CPLR provisions\" and presumes that it \"never considered the import of article 14-A\" (majority op. at 321-322, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 903-04, 101 N.E.3d at 371-72). But this questionable assessment of the\n   <em>\n    Thoma\n   </em>\n   holding is undermined by later case law. In\n   <em>\n    Sammis v. Nassau/Suffolk Football League,\n   </em>\n   we reiterated the\n   <em>\n    Thoma\n   </em>\n   rule, denying partial summary judgment to plaintiff because \"[o]n this record, there exist issues of fact as to comparative fault for a factfinder to consider pursuant to CPLR 1411\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1189224\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/809/#p810\">\n    95 N.Y.2d 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 810,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1189224\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/809/#p810\">\n    710 N.Y.S.2d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1189224\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/95/809/#p810\">\n    732 N.E.2d 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2000] ).\n   More recently, we reviewed a decision of the Appellate Division that, in granting plaintiff's summary judgment motion, attempted to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Thoma\n   </em>\n   because \"plaintiffs established that the defendant driver was negligent and that the injured plaintiff was free from comparative fault\" (\n   <em>\n    Castiglione v.

The rule set out is clear, and speculation as to what the Court \"considered\"-or in other words, the suggestion that we did not mean what we said-does not mask the fact that the majority is overruling this line of cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Accordingly, the issue of whether a plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment without showing freedom from comparative fault is settled, and the Appellate Division Departments have, for the most part, been applying that precedent.

Determinations of degrees of fault should be made as a whole, and assessing one party's fault with a preconceived idea of the other party's liability is inherently unfair; or, as the Appellate Division characterized it, a defendant would \"enter[ ] the batter's box with two strikes already called\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787328\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/142/778/\">\n    142 A.D.3d at 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787328\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/142/778/\">\n    37 N.Y.S.3d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Indeed, as the Appellate Division also noted, the Pattern Jury Instructions advise that a jury consider both parties' liability together (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PJI 2:36 ). This is because the issues of defendant's liability and plaintiff's comparative fault are intertwined. A jury cannot fairly and properly assess plaintiff's comparative fault without considering defendant's actions (\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   Siegel, Practice Commentaries C 3212:24 [noting that \"(n)o purpose (is) served by the granting of summary judgment\" where \"the proof that would go into the damages question substantially overlaps that on which liability depends\"] ). The facts of this case-which two courts\n   have found created an issue of fact as to any liability on the part of defendant-highlight the unfairness of the majority's new rule (\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ugarriza v. Schmieder,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2339646\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/46/471/#p474\">\n    46 N.Y.2d 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 474-475,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=414%20N.Y.S.2d%20304\">\n    414 N.Y.S.2d 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=386%20N.E.2d%201324\">\n    386 N.E.2d 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1979] [\"Negligence cases by their very nature do not usually lend themselves to summary judgment, since often, even if all parties are in agreement as to the underlying facts, the very question of negligence is itself a question for jury determination\"] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Simultaneous consideration by the jury of both parties' level of culpability is also the more practical approach. Indeed, \"few, if any, litigation efficiencies are achieved by the entry of partial summary judgment in this context because the defendant would still be entitled, at trial, to present an all-out case on the plaintiff's culpable conduct\" (Vincent C. Alexander, Practice Commentaries, McKinney's Cons.Laws of NY, Book 7B C1412). In the event that plaintiff obtained partial summary\n   judgment without removing issues of comparative fault, a jury would still be required to assess plaintiff's degree of liability, and then make a damages determination in a subsequent proceeding. Such an inefficient approach would dispose of any benefits to be gained in granting partial summary judgment (\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E.B. Metal &amp; Rubber Indus. v. County of Washington,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3369005\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/102/599/#p602\">\n    102 A.D.2d 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 602-603,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=479%20N.Y.S.2d%20794\">\n    479 N.Y.S.2d 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [3d Dept. 1984] [\"Granting plaintiffs' motions (for partial summary judgment) would be illusory and would spare neither the court's nor the litigants' time and effort. The issue of plaintiffs' comparative negligence would still need to be resolved, which resolution would require a comparison of the parties' culpable conduct\"] ). The majority promotes its approach by pointing to the \"eliminat[ion]\" of the first two questions a jury must answer in a \"typical comparative negligence trial\" (majority op. at 324, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 905, 101 N.E.3d at 373). But these questions would not be eliminated by a grant of partial summary judgment, as an assessment of defendant's negligence would be required in order for the jury to determine comparative fault and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Nor is our approach barred by the statutory language of CPLR article 14-A. Requiring a plaintiff to show freedom from comparative fault in advance of obtaining summary judgment does not \"bar recovery\" in derogation of article 14-A. Before the enactment of Article 14-A, a plaintiff was unable to obtain recovery of any sort where he or she was in any way culpable (\n   <em>\n    Fitzpatrick v. Int'l. Ry. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1989768\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/252/127/#p133\">\n    252 N.Y. 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 133-34,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=169%20N.E.%20112\">\n    169 N.E. 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1929] [\"At common law a person has no cause of action for negligence, if he himself has contributed, in the slightest degree, to bring it about\"] ). Article 14-A enables a plaintiff to\n   <em>\n    recover\n   </em>\n   despite comparative fault (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arbegast,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20N.Y.2d%20161\">\n    65 N.Y.2d at 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=490%20N.Y.S.2d%20751\">\n    490 N.Y.S.2d 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=480%20N.E.2d%20365\">\n    480 N.E.2d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [article 14-A \"permit(s) partial recovery in cases in which the conduct of each party is culpable\"] ). It does not mandate that courts grant partial summary judgment on liability to plaintiffs who are comparatively at fault, as the majority's approach would require. The comparative fault statute simply provides that a plaintiff is entitled to recover a certain amount of damages, to be determined by a jury, even in cases where plaintiff has engaged in some degree of culpable conduct. This requires that each party's culpability be assessed and liability determined before judgment is granted (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 168,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=490%20N.Y.S.2d%20751\">\n    490 N.Y.S.2d 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=480%20N.E.2d%20365\">\n    480 N.E.2d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"(W)hat the statute requires comparison of is not negligence but conduct which, for whatever reason, the law deems blameworthy, in order to fix the relationship of each party's conduct to the injury sustained and the damages to be\n   paid by the one and received by the other as recompense for that injury\"] ).\n   The majority repeatedly speaks to the \"double burden\" our approach would place on defendant. But there is no unfair tipping of the scales. Plaintiff in his moving papers made a blanket assertion of freedom from any comparative negligence and defendant, in response, came forward with extensive evidence of plaintiff's comparative fault. Plaintiff's burden was merely that placed on any party moving for summary judgment-to demonstrate a lack of triable issues of fact. In that, plaintiff failed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Order, insofar as appealed from, reversed, with costs, case remitted to the Appellate Division, First Department, for consideration of issues raised but not determined on the appeal to that Court and certified question answered in the negative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Judges Rivera, Fahey and Wilson concur. Judge Garcia dissents in an opinion in which Chief Judge DiFiore and Judge Stein concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The majority \"do[es] not reach\" the issue of whether plaintiff demonstrated defendant's negligence as a matter of law (majority 316 n. 2, 76 N.Y.S.3d at 900 n. 2, 101 N.E.3d at 368 n. 2). In fact, this question is a preserved issue of law. The majority asserts that the Appellate Division \"fram[ed as] the sole issue for resolution\" the question \"whether a plaintiff seeking summary judgment on the issue of liability must establish, as a matter of law, that he or she is free from comparative fault\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 900 n. 2, 101 N.E.3d at 368 n.2). This is not correct. The Appellate Division certified the question \"was the order of Supreme Court, as affirmed by this Court, properly made?\" Accordingly, Supreme Court's ruling that plaintiff did not demonstrate defendant's negligence as a matter of law, and the Appellate Division's affirmance on that issue, is properly before us.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    This approach has been partially followed in the Fourth Department, with some courts granting partial summary judgment on defendant's breach of the duty of care, but leaving for the jury the question of proximate cause (\n    <em>\n     Simoneit v.
