Wright of three drug offenses, the trial court sentenced him to prison. Wright raises six assignments of error but we address only the fifth one because that review renders the remaining errors moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Wright asserts because the pills introduced into evidence were not properly tested, the trial court committed reversible error in denying his motion to exclude them as evidence. We agree. The state's expert witness, a forensic scientist, testified that he did not test a sample size large enough to determine the content of the remaining pills with a reasonable degree of scientific certainty. Thus, the remaining pills should have been excluded from evidence. We reverse the trial court's judgment and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In 2015, a Lawrence County Grand Jury indicted Wright on one count of complicity to aggravated trafficking in drugs in violation of R.C. 2923.03(A)(2) and R.C. 2925.03(A)(1)(C)(1)(d), a second degree felony; one count of trafficking in drugs in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2)(C)(1)(c), a third degree felony; and one count of possession of drugs in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)(C)(1)(b), a third degree felony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} At trial the state presented three law enforcement officers who testified about a controlled drug buy where a confidential informant used marked money to purchase oxycodone, a schedule II controlled substance, from Wright. The confidential informant and a woman who assisted Wright during the drug buy also testified about their roles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Laura Miller, a grocery store pharmacist, testified that Wright had a prescription for oxycodone and that the prescription drug bottle recovered from Wright after the controlled drug buy was one that she filled. Miller testified that the oxycodone tablets she had provided were 15 mg, green, round, and marked \"K8\". Miller testified that if the pills in the prescription bottle were marked \"A214\" instead of \"K8\", then they would not be the oxycodone pills she used to fill Wright's prescription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Stanton Wheasler, a forensic scientist with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (\"BCI\"), testified that he tested the pills and prepared a written report. Wheasler indicated that the evidence consisted of a prescription bottle of 98 pills marked \"A214\" and a plastic bag containing 95 pills with five different markings: (1) 63 pills marked \"M30\"; (2) 21 pills marked \"A215\"; (3) 1 pill marked \"224\"; (4) 7 pills marked \"K8\"; (5) 3 pills marked \"A214\". Wheasler tested six pills in total, one pill from each differently marked group. Wheasler testified that for marked pharmaceuticals, his standard protocol is to test one pill per marked group. Each of the six pills he tested contained oxycodone. Wright testified that after testing one of\n   each marked group of the 95 pills and finding it contained oxycodone, it would be reasonable to infer that the remaining pills in the group also contained oxycodone. However, Wheasler did not testify that he personally made this inference or that he made this inference with a reasonable degree of scientific certainty:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Q. And that's the total of ninety five. And is it your opinion based upon testing one of each that these ninety five pills contained oxycodone?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   A. It's my opinion that the five I tested contained oxycodone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Q. Go ahead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   A. It would be a reasonable inference that um, the remaining ones did as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Wheasler testified that when he tested one of the 98 pills marked \"A214\" that were in the prescription drug bottle, it contained oxycodone. The state asked him about the inference that could be drawn from that test:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A. That is [sic] was 98 round green tablets marked A214. Which had a reference strength of 15 milligrams of which I tested one. Weighing .10 gram plus or minus 1.04 gram. It was found to contain oxycodone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Q. And can that lead you to by inference by a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that, all ninety eight were oxycodone's [sic]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A. That would be in the inference that could be made, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Although Wheasler stated that an inference about the remaining 97 pills could be made, he clarified that he did not make that inference because he did not test a sufficient number of pills to be able to make the inference with a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In response to questioning from the trial judge, Wheasler testified that he has a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that the six pills he tested were oxycodone, and that it would be unlikely that the remaining pills were not oxycodone. Wheasler testified that he would need to sample a larger population of the pills to make an inference with a reasonable degree of scientific certainty about the remaining untested pills:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A. * * * in order for me to make an inference about a population, the rule in my laboratory is that I have to test a um, statistically back sampling plan of that population, which means I have to test, um, for example in the case of, um, sixty three tablets I'd probably be testing somewhere around twenty of them. * * * and that would be for anything. That would be for demos of heroin, that would be for bags of marijuana. That would be the number I'd have to test to be allowed to infer um, about the entire population. Um, here all I can say is that the one's I tested had oxycodone in them. And they were stored with tablets that were visually identical to me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   COURT: To a degree of scientific certainty?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A. I don't know if I am allowed to have scientific certainty about simply visual examination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   COURT: Alright, that's not something you express an opinion in that form?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On re-direct and re-cross, Wheasler explained that the accrediting body imposed requirements on inference populations. When he tests a single pill from a population of marked pills, he cannot use the reasonable degree of scientific certainty standard on the entire population of pills. In order to give an opinion within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, he would have to test a larger sample to establish a confidence interval. Wheasler testified that for the 63 pills marked\n   \"M30\", he would need to test approximately 20 pills using \"the hypergeometric function\" to establish a 95% confidence level that at least 90 percent of the pills in the sample are oxycodone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Wheasler's lab report states, \"Hypergeometric sampling may be specified in the findings above. The application of hypergeometric sampling establishes a ninety-five percent (95) confidence level that at least ninety percent (90) of the units in the sample are as reported.\" Wheasler's report was consistent with Wheasler's testimony that only six pills were tested and found to contain oxycodone, three pills with a referenced strength of 30 mg and three pills with a referenced strength of 15 mg. Thus, Wheasler's report identified a total 135 mg of oxycodone. And Wheasler's testimony was that his sample population was insufficient for him to draw inferences about the substance of the remaining pills with a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Wheasler testified that he has had experience with counterfeit marked pills and cannot tell with one-hundred-percent certainty which pills are counterfeit. Wheasler testified that by testing six pills, he did not test enough pills to find enough oxycodone in them to exceed the bulk amount of five times the maximum does of oxycodone :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A. That is correct, I have not with actual analysis positively identified oxycodone in tablets over five times the bulk amount.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Wheasler testified that it is standard lab protocol to test one of each differently marked group of pills. He visually inspects the remaining untested pills and will test additional pills if they appear to be counterfeit. Counterfeit pills often have a different appearance and may be crumbly, sloppy, different coloring, and varying thicknesses. Wheasler testified that none of the pills he tested here had counterfeit characteristics and they appeared to be legitimate pharmaceuticals. However, because he did not test an adequate sample of the remaining pills, he could not say within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that they were oxycodone:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Q. Right, is it right to say within a reasonable degree of certainty to say the six you tested were oxycodone, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. And the remainder you can't say within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. The [sic] is the way crediting body would phrase that, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Following the second day of trial Wright moved to exclude the pills from evidence based on Wheasler's inability to testify about the content of the remaining pills with a reasonable degree of scientific certainty. Wright argued that the particular charge requires the state to prove that Wright possessed or trafficked oxycodone in five but less than fifty times bulk. Wright argued that the state's evidence established that the six pills tested contained at most 180 mg (6 times 30 mg) of oxycodone-only twice the therapeutic amount of 90 mg whereas bulk is five times the therapeutic amount. Wright asked the court to exclude the evidence or to dismiss the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 15} At the close of the state's case Wright moved for a dismissal under Crim.R. 29 based on his motion to exclude the pills from evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wright argued that Crim.R. 29 provides for a dismissal of\n   the charges if the state has not met the prima facie elements of the case. Wright argued that based on Wheasler's testimony, the state provided evidence that six pills tested positive for 30 mg of oxycodone for a total of 180 mg of oxycodone. Wright argued whether the state has established a prima facie case is not a matter for the jury to evaluate. The trial court addressed Wright's motion to exclude evidence and motion for acquittal together and denied them on the ground that they were questions for the jury to determine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The jury found Wright guilty on all three counts (and a forfeiture specification). The trial court sentenced Wright to a combined ten-year prison term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Wright assigns the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   I.

LAW AND ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A. Motion to Exclude Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In his fifth assignment of error Wright argues that because the pills were\n   not properly tested, the trial court erred when it failed to exclude them from evidence. Wright points out that Wheasler testified that he could not identify the statutory threshold of oxycodone with a reasonable degree of scientific certainty. Wright was unable to make an inference about the contents of the remaining untested pills with a reasonable degree of scientific certainty because he did not test a sufficient sample size. Therefore, Wright contends that the untested pills were improperly admitted and, with only six oxycodone pills, the state could not prove that the weight of the actual pills meets the statutory threshold for the charges against him. He argues the trial court committed reversible error when it denied his motion to exclude the pill evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 19} At trial Wright filed a written motion to exclude evidence of the remaining pills on the morning after Wheasler testified. The parties agreed to argue the motion later in the day. At the close of the state's evidence Wright argued that the charges against him should be dismissed because the remaining untested pills should be excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Wright contended he did not raise an evidentiary objection sooner because he was not aware until the second day of trial that the state's forensic scientist, Stanton Wheasler, would testify that he did not test a sufficient sampling of pills to be able to identify the content of the remaining pills within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty. Wright argued that Wheasler also testified that there are counterfeit pills on the market and some are difficult to detect. Wright argued that the charges required the state to prove that the drug involved equals or exceeds five times the bulk amount but is less than fifty times the bulk amount. Bulk amount is five times the therapeutic dosage of 90 mg, or 450 mg. Wright argued that state had to prove the drug equals or exceeds five times 450 mg, which is 2250 mg, but less than fifty times the bulk amount; thus the state needed an analysis that proved within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that there was at least 2250 mg of oxycodone. Wright argued that the state only proved that six pills contained 30 mg of oxycodone, for a total of 180 mg.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The state responded that Wheasler testified that he follows protocol, works in an accredited lab and no one had complained about his work previously. It argued that this question should be a matter for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In response Wright contended that he was not disputing that Wheasler worked in an accredited laboratory nor was he disputing that Wheasler followed the lab protocol when testing the six pills-the state had proven there were at most 180 mg of oxycodone. Wright argued that Wheasler acknowledged that the accreditation process required a testing sample size of at least twenty pills when the quantity of pills was this large and that Wheasler testified that he had not tested enough pills to identify the content of the remaining pills with a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The trial court addressed both the Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal and the motion to exclude evidence together and found that, setting aside the question of Wheasler's pill sampling method, the remainder of the evidence was sufficient to withstand a Rule 29 motion. Addressing the pill sampling method, the trial court found that Wheasler submitted both a written report and testified, the trial court did not have any evidence about statistical\n   sampling, and therefore the evidence would go to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   * * * I can't consider um, you know what might be in statistical sampling's and, and what percentages to the degree of the universe are necessary. I feel like it is a, at this point, once his certification, his testimony and his opinion is in, in written form first and then orally then it's a jury question and I'll overrule both motions at this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   1.

The trial court's rationale for denying the motion was that Wheasler had already testified and submitted his report; therefore, the remaining pills would not be excluded and it was a question for the jury to decide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The trial court's terse rationale could imply that Wright's motion was untimely. If so, it misapplies the standard for the timing of such objections.

We find Wright's motion timely under Evid.R. 103. Wright sought the exclusion of the remaining pills as evidence; he did not seek to strike Wheasler's report or testimony. To the contrary, Wright relied upon Wheasler's testimony to support his motion to exclude the pills as evidence. The state's forensic scientist could not identify the substance of the remaining pills with a reasonable degree of scientific certainty and they should have been excluded because they lacked the necessary foundation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 29} We find no legal basis for the trial court's statement that it could not consider the testimony about statistical sampling and whether the expert's opinion was based upon a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.
