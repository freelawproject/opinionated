Appellee is the State of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On August 26, 2016, at approximately 1:46 a.m., appellant left a bar on Sancus Boulevard after consuming a \"couple\" beers, and made a very wide right turn into the leftmost lane of Sancus Boulevard heading southbound. Trooper Rueda noticed his behavior and executed a U-turn. She believed he may be exceeding the speed limit and, through the use of a radar gun, she was able to determine that the appellant was traveling 45 mph in a 35 mph zone. She stopped the appellant for the traffic violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} After the appellant stopped, the trooper noticed that he appeared to lose his balance as he dismounted from his motorcycle. Despite the fact that he was outdoors and had been riding a motorcycle at 45 mph, the trooper detected a strong odor of alcohol about him. This odor of alcohol remained strong throughout her contact with the appellant. She also saw that his eyes were glassy and bloodshot. In an exchange with the appellant she learned that he had just left Rude Dog, a local bar, and that he had \"a couple of beers.\" Based upon her observations and appellant's admissions, she administered field sobriety tests and, subsequent to the field sobriety tests, arrested appellant. He was charged with violation of R.C. 4511.19 (A)(1)(a),\n   4511.19 (A)(1)(d) (O.V.I. per se), and a charge of Speeding under 4511.21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellant filed a motion to suppress evidence resulting from the traffic stop pursuant to Crim.R. 12(C). Appellant contended that the state failed to establish reasonable suspicion to conduct the field sobriety tests, that scoring of the field sobriety tests was done incorrectly, that the state did not establish probable cause for his arrest and that the Breathalyzer test was not valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The trial court conducted a hearing on the motion to suppress the evidence on December 6, 2016. Prior to the hearing, the parties stipulated that the traffic stop was proper because the appellant exceeded the speed limit. The parties stipulated other issues not relevant to the assignment of error. After receiving testimony from the trooper, the trial court overruled appellant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On February 22, 2017, appellant amended his plea to no contest to the charge under R.C. 4511.19 (A)(1)(a) and the balance of the charges were dismissed. The trial court found the appellant guilty and appellant filed a timely notice of appeal with regard to the Court's finding regarding the issue of reasonable suspicion that the appellant was under the influence of alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellant submits one assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE TROOPER HAD REASONABLE SUSPICION TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF APPELLANT'S STOP TO INCLUDE FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The appellant limits his appeal to the trial court's holding that Trooper Rueda had reasonable suspicion that appellant was under the influence of alcohol. Appellant contends the facts do not support reasonable suspicion and that, therefore, the administration of field sobriety tests was an improper expansion of the detention of appellant. There are three methods of challenging on appeal a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress. First, an appellant may challenge the trial court's finding of fact. Second, an appellant may argue the trial court failed to apply the appropriate test or correct law to the findings of fact. Finally, an appellant may argue the trial court has incorrectly decided the ultimate or final issue raised in the motion to suppress. When reviewing this third type of claim, an appellate court must independently determine, without deference to the trial court's conclusion, whether the facts meet the appropriate legal standard in the given case.

The Supreme Court of the United States has re-emphasized the\n   importance of reviewing the totality of the circumstances in making a reasonable-suspicion determination:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   When discussing how reviewing courts should make reasonable-suspicion determinations, we have said repeatedly that they must look at the \"totality of the circumstances\" of each case to see whether the detaining officer has a \"particularized and objective basis\" for suspecting legal wrongdoing. This process allows officers to draw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them that \"might well elude an untrained person.\" Although an officer's reliance on a mere \"hunch\" is insufficient to justify a stop, the likelihood of criminal activity need not rise to the level required for probable cause, and it falls considerably short of satisfying a preponderance of the evidence standard.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Trooper first noticed the appellant when he made an unusual right turn, placing him in the far left lane of the road rather than the right lane as might normally be expected, and then he proceeded to exceed the speed limit by approximately 10 mph. The time of the offense, 1:46 a.m., appellant's admission of recently consuming alcohol at a local bar, and his apparent difficulty dismounting his motorcycle are additional relevant facts. The Trooper noticed that appellant had glassy, bloodshot eyes and a strong odor of alcohol even though he was driving 45 mph outdoors. All of these details, in the context of the trooper's training and experience, provide a sufficient basis for a conclusion that the trooper was warranted in having reasonable suspicion the appellant had violated the Revised Code. In fact, the evidence provided by the totality of the\n   circumstances in this case exceeds what we have found necessary to support reasonable suspicion in other cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} This Court has held that \"[I]n Ohio, it is well settled that, \"[w]here a non-investigatory stop is initiated and the odor of alcohol is combined with glassy or bloodshot eyes and further indicia of intoxication, such as an admission of having consumed alcohol, reasonable suspicion exists.\" (citations omitted)\n   <em>\n    State v.

The facts of this case fit precisely within the holding of\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   and the cases cited by the trial court in its decision. Trooper Rueda testified that appellant had glassy and bloodshot eyes, that she noticed a strong odor of alcohol and that the appellant admitted to consuming alcohol. Those facts, combined with the wide right turn, excessive speed, and the admission that appellant had just left a bar, provide abundant evidence from which reasonable suspicion can be derived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Appellant cites the Sixth District Court of Appeals holding in\n   <em>\n    Whitehouse v. Stricklin\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-10-1277,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-1877\">\n    2012-Ohio-1877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201493830\">\n    2012 WL 1493830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in support of his argument that the facts are insufficient to provide reasonable suspicion of the commission of a crime. That case is distinguishable in that the odor of alcohol about appellant in that case was described as slight, whereas the trooper in the case at bar described the odor as strong. This distinction is significant because the Sixth District Court of Appeals has held that the strong odor of alcohol and an admission of consumption of alcohol are sufficient to justify administration of field sobriety tests. \"These two factors, perceived * * * during the initial stop, created a reasonable suspicion that appellant's blood-alcohol level was over the proscribed limits and justified field sobriety tests.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
