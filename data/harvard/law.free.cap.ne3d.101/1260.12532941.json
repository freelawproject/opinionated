The complaint further alleged that at the time, Caruthers was acting within the scope of his employment with appellant Butler Transport, Inc. (Butler). The complaint asserted that appellees and the proposed class members suffered inconvenience, loss of business, and financial injury. The complaint identified the proposed class as all of those individuals and businesses that lost power on September 28, 2012, as a result of power outages caused by appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The matter was removed to federal court for some time but was eventually returned to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On January 21, 2016, appellees filed a motion for class certification. The motion stated that 1,563 AEP customers in Jefferson County lost power due to the alleged negligence of appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The trial court held a hearing on appellees' motion for class certification where it heard arguments from all parties. The court subsequently issued a judgment entry certifying the proposed class. In so doing, the court found that the class was so numerous that a joinder of all members is impracticable, that there are questions of law or fact common to the class, that the claims of the representative parties are typical of the claims of the class, and that the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interest of the class. Further, the court found that common questions of law and fact predominated over questions affecting only individual class members and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal on June 29, 2016.

We will address each one in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 13} First, appellants claim the trial court was unclear in its judgment as to which of appellees' three proposed classes it certified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In their class action complaint, appellees asked the trial court to certify the following class:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   All individuals and entities to whom American Electric Power provided electricity and/or electrical services in Jefferson County, Ohio and who were without such electrical services on September\n   28, 2012, as a result of the power outages caused by Defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 15} At the February 22, 2016 hearing, appellees proposed to modify their class definition to include at the end of the definition, \"[a]nd who suffered some type of loss.\" (Tr. 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Then in their March 2, 2016 reply to appellants' supplemental memorandum contra to class certification, appellees proposed the class as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   All individuals and entities to whom American Electrical Power provided electricity and/or power in Jefferson County, Ohio who suffered a loss as a result of the September 27, 2012 and September 28, 2012 power outage caused by Defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Appellants contend the trial court failed to indicate in its judgment entry which of the three classes it actually certified. They assert this necessitates a remand for clarification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The class certified by the trial court was clear. At the hearing, appellees' counsel stated that he was proposing to add the language \"who suffered some type of loss\" to the end of the proposed class definition. (Tr. 9). Then in their reply to defendants' supplemental memorandum contra to class certification, appellees amended their class definition to include the \"who suffered a loss\" language as well as another date of the power outage. Thus, at the time the trial court ruled on appellees' motion, this was the only proposed class definition before the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 19} To avoid any confusion on this issue, we clarify that the certified class is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   All individuals and entities to whom American Electrical Power provided electricity and/or power in Jefferson County, Ohio who suffered a loss as a result of the September 27, 2012 and September 28, 2012 power outage caused by Defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   An appellate court may modify or clarify the certified class.

They note that appellees failed to define \"loss\" in their class definition, leaving the class ambiguous. Appellants assert the trial court would be faced with determining multiple questions including which AEP customers actually suffered a loss; what constitutes a loss; for those claiming a loss from food spoilage, how will the customer prove the loss; how will the customers prove that they mitigated their losses; and can the losses be proven on a case-wide basis. Moreover, they point out that some customers only lost power for one hour, while others lost power for ten hours. Appellants cite to numerous cases from other states, which they assert show that class certification is routinely rejected for power-loss cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 22} A proposed class must be identifiable. \" '[T]he requirement that there be a class will not be deemed satisfied unless the description of it is sufficiently definite so that it is administratively feasible for the court to determine whether a particular individual is a member.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1323438\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/82/67/#p70\">\n    82 Ohio St.3d at 71-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=694%20N.E.2d%20442\">\n    694 N.E.2d 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting 7A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R.

The class only includes those \"who suffered a loss.\" Thus, if a Jefferson County AEP customer lost power for an hour and suffered no losses, he or she would not be a member of the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 25} And as to those who did suffer some type of loss, the fact that the losses may be different for different class members does not defeat class certification. \"[A] trial court should not dispose of a class certification solely on the basis of disparate damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Ojalvo v.

They assert that Stanley and Anna Cottis failed to assert any damages resulting from the power outage in their affidavits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Class representatives must be members of the class. \"The class membership prerequisite requires only that 'the representative have proper standing.

On the other hand, Stanley and Amy Cavanaugh and Route 22 Pizza both averred to monetary damages as a result of the power outage. The fact that the Cottises did not set out damages in the affidavits does not necessarily mean that they did not suffer damages. They alleged damages in their complaint including monetary damages in an amount to be determined at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 31} In order to proceed as class representatives, Stanley and Anna Cottis would eventually have to allege the specific amount of their damages. But at this point in time, there are other class representatives who did allege specific damages in their affidavits and the Cottises alleged monetary damages in their complaint. Thus, we cannot conclude the trial court abused its discretion in this respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Moreover, \"[a] representative is deemed adequate so long as his interest is not antagonistic to that of other class members.\"\n   <em>\n    Warner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1830011\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/36/91/#p96\">\n    36 Ohio St.3d at 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=521%20N.E.2d%201091\">\n    521 N.E.2d 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Marks v.

As appellees point out, common to each class member would be a determination as to whether Caruthers was negligent when he struck the AEP guy wire, whether Caruthers was acting within the scope of his employment with Butler at the time, and whether Caruthers' negligence proximately caused the class members' damages. Thus, common questions predominate the action, especially when the focus is on liability. Hence, appellants' fourth argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Fifth and finally, appellants assert there is no class capable of certification that is sufficiently definite because any such class would include individuals without legally cognizable claims. They argue that common questions do not predominate over individual determinations and class treatment is not a superior method of adjudication. Appellants claim there is no one class-wide injury for the certified class. They argue each class member would have to prove their damages separately, which would overburden the court and render the case unmanageable as a class action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 38} As discussed above, any suggested class member who did not suffer any damages would not actually be a class member. And a trial court should not deny class certification solely on the basis of disparate damages.\n   <em>\n    Ojalvo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1816275\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/12/230/#p232\">\n    12 Ohio St.3d at 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=466%20N.E.2d%20875\">\n    466 N.E.2d 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, common questions surround the issue of appellants' liability. Therefore, appellants' fifth argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Based on the above analysis of appellants' arguments, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in certifying appellees' proposed class. The trial court has expertise and familiarity with its case management and we will not second guess its inherent power to manage its own docket in this case.\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1323438\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/82/67/#p70\">\n    82 Ohio St.3d at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=694%20N.E.2d%20442\">\n    694 N.E.2d 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, appellants' sole assignment of error is without merit and is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 40} For the reasons stated above, the trial court's judgment is hereby affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Waite, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   DeGenaro, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
