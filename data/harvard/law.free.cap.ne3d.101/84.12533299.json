POWELL, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 1} This matter is before the court on a timely application for reconsideration filed by the Fayette County Department of Job &amp; Family Services (\"the Agency\") pursuant to App.R. 26(A). The Agency requests that we reconsider our October 2, 2017 judgment entry which dismissed the Agency's appeal of a decision of the Fayette County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, granting temporary custody of 15-year-old C.S. to the Agency on the ground the appeal was moot. For the reasons that follow, we grant the Agency's application for reconsideration and affirm the juvenile court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The Agency's involvement in this matter began in 2012 because of the volatile relationship between then 12-year-old C.S. and her mother (\"Mother\"). On October 23, 2013, the juvenile court adjudicated C.S. a delinquent child for violating a court order and placed C.S in the legal custody of her aunt (\"Aunt\"). Aunt lives in Tennessee; Mother lives in Ohio. In October 2016, while retaining legal custody, Aunt returned physical custody of C.S. to Mother. On November 17, 2016, Mother moved the juvenile court for legal custody of C.S. On January 10, 2017, a hearing on the motion was held. Mother and Aunt both testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On January 12, 2017, the juvenile court ordered that C.S. be placed into the temporary custody of the Agency, and scheduled a review hearing for February 16, 2017. By judgment entry filed on February 22, 2017, the juvenile court continued the Agency's temporary custody of C.S. and ordered the Agency to file a case plan and a neglect and dependency case regarding C.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The Agency appealed the juvenile court's January 12, 2017 judgment entry, arguing the juvenile court (1) violated the due process rights of the Agency, the child's parents, and Aunt, (2) failed to find that the grant of temporary custody was in the child's best interest, and (3) failed to make findings regarding reasonable efforts under R.C. 2151.419. In its amicus curiae brief, the juvenile court asserted that \"[o]n February 22, 2017, [it] issued a Judgment Entry ordering [the Agency] to immediately file a Neglect/Dependency Complaint. [The Agency] subsequently filed the Neglect/Dependency Complaint and a separate case was initiated involving C.S.\" The Agency did not file a reply brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On October 2, 2017, this court dismissed the Agency's appeal as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Because temporary custody was continued with the Agency in February 2017, the Agency has presumably complied with the juvenile court's then order to file a neglect/dependency case and case plan regarding C.S., and the Agency is not disputing the juvenile court's assertion that the Agency \"subsequently filed the Neglect/Dependency Complaint and a separate case was initiated involving C.S.,\" the issues presented are no longer \"live.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The juvenile court did not file a response to the Agency's application for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Given the Agency's foregoing assertion and the juvenile court's failure to file a response to the Agency's application for reconsideration, we find the Agency's application for reconsideration is well-taken. Accordingly, we vacate our October 2, 2017 Accelerated Calendar Judgment Entry, address the four assignments of error raised on appeal by the Agency, and hereby issue the following opinion in replacement of our October 2, 2017 judgment entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Assignment of Error No. 1:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN AWARDING CUSTODY OF A MINOR CHILD TO THE FAYETTE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF JOB &amp; FAMILY SERVICES WHERE NO NOTICE WAS GIVEN TO EITHER THE LEGAL CUSTODIAN OR THE CHILD'S PARENTS THAT CUSTODY MIGHT BE GRANTED TO THE FAYETTE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF JOB &amp; FAMILY SERVICES, AND NO OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD ON THE ISSUE OF CUSTODY TO [THE] FAYETTE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF JOB &amp; FAMILY SERVICES WAS GIVEN TO EITHER THE LEGAL CUSTODIAN OR THE CHILD'S PARENTS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The Agency argues the juvenile court's January 12, 2017 decision awarding temporary custody of C.S. to the Agency violated the due process rights of both Mother and Aunt because neither relative was given notice that the juvenile court might take such an action, nor were they given an opportunity to be heard on the issue. However, neither Mother nor Aunt have appealed the juvenile court's decision and claimed any violation of their rights. The Agency may not assert these rights on appeal. The Agency's first assignment of error is accordingly overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Assignment of Error No. 2:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN AWARDING CUSTODY OF A MINOR CHILD TO THE FAYETTE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF JOB &amp; FAMILY SERVICES WHERE NO NOTICE WAS GIVEN TO THE AGENCY OF THE PROCEEDING.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The Agency argues the juvenile court's grant of temporary custody to the Agency violated its due process rights because the Agency was neither notified of nor present at the hearing on Mother's legal custody motion, was not given notice the juvenile court was considering granting temporary custody to the Agency, and thus had no opportunity to be heard on the issue.

The juvenile court, as a division of the Fayette County Common Pleas Court, is an arm of the state of Ohio exercising the judicial power of the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 1 (\"The judicial power of the state is vested in * * * courts of common pleas and divisions thereof\"). Consequently, we find that the Agency, as an agency of a political subdivision, does not have a cognizable due process claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Additionally, Juv.R. 13(A) provides that \"[p]ending hearing on a complaint, the court may make such temporary orders concerning the custody or care of a child who is the subject of the complaint as the child's interest and welfare may require.\" Pursuant to R.C. 5153.16(A)(3), one of the duties of a public children services agency (\"PCSA\") is to \"[a]ccept custody of children committed to the public children services agency by a court exercising juvenile jurisdiction.\" There can be no denial of due process when a juvenile court acts within its jurisdiction and makes an order implicating a statutory duty of a PCSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The record does suggest that the juvenile court's order placing C.S. into the temporary custody of the Agency without prior notice violated the Agency's conception of local norms of interagency courtesy. Whether this is so, violation of such norms is not a violation of procedural due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The Agency's second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Assignment of Error No. 3:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 21} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN AWARDING CUSTODY OF A MINOR CHILD TO THE FAYETTE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF JOB &amp; FAMILY SERVICES WHERE IT DID\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   NOT MAKE AN EXPRESSED FINDING OF FACT THAT SAID GRANT OF CUSTODY WAS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CHILD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The Agency argues the juvenile court erred in awarding temporary custody of C.S. to the Agency because the juvenile court failed to find \"by clear and convincing evidence that custody to the Agency was in the best interest of the minor child.\" In support of its argument, the Agency cites R.C. 2151.414 and\n   <em>\n    In re Arnold\n   </em>\n   , 3d Dist.

The juvenile court adjudicated C.S. a delinquent child in 2013, granted legal custody to Aunt because of Mother's reported inability to handle C.S. any longer, and ordered C.S. to \"attend school each and every school day.\" In granting temporary custody to the Agency in 2017, the juvenile court found that C.S. had \"last attended school sometime before Christmas of 2016,\" \"had failed to attend any days of school thus far in 2017,\" and was not enrolled in E.C.O.T.,\" and that Mother \"ha[d] not shown any ability to handle the child as exhibited by the child's failure to attend school.\" Thus, the juvenile court properly determined that given Mother's inability or unwillingness to effectively parent C.S., the child's interest and welfare required it to grant temporary custody to the Agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 25} The Agency's third assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Assignment of Error No. 4:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 27} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN AWARDING CUSTODY OF A MINOR CHILD TO THE FAYETTE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF JOB &amp; FAMILY SERVICES WHERE THE AGENCY WAS NOT AFFORDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO PREVENT THE REMOVAL, AND THE COURT FAILED TO MAKE A FINDING OF FACT THAT REASONABLE EFFORTS WERE NOT REQUIRED OR WERE NOT POSSIBLE DUE TO EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The Agency argues the juvenile court erred in placing C.S. in the temporary custody of the Agency without making the requisite findings of fact regarding reasonable efforts under R.C. 2151.419.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 29} A juvenile court that removes a child from the child's home must determine \"whether the public children services agency * * * that * * * will be given custody of the child has made reasonable efforts\n   to prevent the removal of the child from the child's home[.]\" R.C. 2151.419(A)(1). Conversely, if one of five separate circumstances apply, the juvenile court \"shall make a determination that the agency is not required to make reasonable efforts to prevent the removal of the child from the child's home[.]\" R.C. 2151.419(A)(2). Pursuant to R.C. 2151.419(B)(1), the juvenile court is required to issue written findings of fact setting forth the reasons supporting its determination under R.C. 2151.419(A)(1) or (2).

We note that in its February 2017 judgment entry, the juvenile court made findings of fact regarding reasonable efforts under R.C. 2151.419.
