The aggravated murder and aggravated arson charges arose out of the shooting death of Walkup's wife, Ella Emmajean Walkup, and subsequent fire in their home on December\n   23, 1995. The assault charge involved Morgan County Deputy Sheriff Jerry Hallowell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The matter proceeded to trial on August 5, 1996. After hearing all the evidence and deliberations, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of aggravated murder, but guilty of murder, the lesser-included offense, and the firearm specification; not guilty of aggravated arson; and guilty of assault. By Judgment Entry dated August 14, 1996, the trial court sentenced Walkup to a total term of incarceration of fifteen years to life with three years actual incarceration for the firearm specification. Walkup filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court. This Court affirmed Walkup's convictions and sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v. Walkup,\n   </em>\n   5th Dist.
