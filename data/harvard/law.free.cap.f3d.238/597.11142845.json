Appellant seeks attorney fees of $233,131.87 and costs of $2,367.76 as an interim award for prevailing before the Supreme Court. Because we hold that Appellant is not a prevailing party and that Appellee\u2019s position was substantially justified, the Petition is DENIED. We need not and do not address the reasonableness of the amount sought in the Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">Appellant initially brought this action before the district court challenging Appel-lee\u2019s denial of disability insurance benefits. The district court rejected Appellant\u2019s contentions and affirmed the denial of benefits. On appeal, Appellant argued that the administrative law judge (1) failed to afford proper weight to a psychologist\u2019s opinion that Appellant was severely depressed; (2) improperly excluded certain of her impairments in assessing her residual function capacity; and (3) erred in failing to order a consultative examination. We rejected the first claim on the merits and held that we lacked jurisdiction under <em>Paul v. Shalala, </em>29 F.3d 208 (5th Cir.1994), over the remaining claims because Appellant failed to exhaust them before the Social Security Appeals Council. <em>See Sims v. Apfel, </em>200 F.3d 229, 230 (5th Cir.1998) (per curiam). Appellant appealed to the Supreme Court, which held that it was inappropriate to require Appellant to exhaust her claims before the Appeals Council, reversed our decision, and remanded to us for further proceedings. <em>Sims v. Apfel, </em>530 U.S. 103, 120 S.Ct. 2080, 2086, 147 L.Ed.2d 80 (2000). On remand, we reviewed and rejected Appellant\u2019s remaining claims on the merits. <em>Sims v. Apfel, </em>224 F.3d 380, 381-82 (5th Cir.2000) (per cu-riam). Nonetheless, Appellant seeks attorney fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (\u201cEAJA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A), based on the remand from the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-16\">The EAJA provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-17\">Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a court shall award to a <em>prevailing party </em>other than the United States fees and other expenses, in addition to any costs awarded pursuant to subsection (a), incurred by that party in any civil action (other than cases sounding in tort), including proceedings for judicial review of agency action, brought by or against the United States in any court having jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the position of the United States was <em>substantially justified </em>or that special circumstances make an award unjust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-18\">\u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Thus, an award of fees is mandated if (1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>claimant is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d; (2) the position of the United States was not \u201csubstantially justified\u201d; and (3) there are no special circumstances that make an award unjust. <em>See Commissioner v. Jean, </em>496 U.S. 154, 158, 110 S.Ct. 2316, 110 L.Ed.2d 134 (1990). We address only whether Appellant is a prevailing party and whether Appellee\u2019s position was substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">A plaintiff may be considered a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under the EAJA \u201cif they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.\u201d <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983); <em>see id. </em>at n. 7 (stating that the above standard is \u201cgenerally applicable in all eases in which Congress has authorized an award of fees to a \u2018prevailing party.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Squires-Allman v. Callahan, </em>117 F.3d 918, 919 (5th Cir.1997). However, appellate procedural rulings in favor of the plaintiff generally do not render her a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d <em>Hanrahan v. Hampton, </em>446 U.S. 754, 758, 100 S.Ct. 1987, 64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980). While such rulings may \u201caffect the disposition on the merits,\u201d they are not \u201cmatters on which a party could \u2018prevail\u2019 for purposes of shifting his counsel fees to the opposing party.\u201d <em>Id.; see Huey v. Sullivan, </em>971 F.2d 1362, 1367 (8th Cir.1992) (\u201cEstablishing jurisdiction is a procedural victory that does not justify fee shifting.\u201d), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Huey v. Shalala, </em>511 U.S. 1068, 114 S.Ct. 1642, 128 L.Ed.2d 363 (1994); <em>Escobar v. Bowen, </em>857 F.2d 644, 646 (9th Cir.1988) (\u201c[E]ven a significant procedural victory which implicates substantive rights is not sufficient to make a party a prevailing party under EAJA.\u201d). More importantly, \u201ca favorable judicial statement of law in the course of litigation that results in judgment against the plaintiff does not suffice to render him a \u2018prevailing party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hewitt v. Helms, </em>482 U.S. 755, 763, 107 S.Ct. 2672, 96 L.Ed.2d 654 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">In this action, Appellant makes a plausible argument that she is a prevailing party entitled to interim attorney fees for her victory before the Supreme Court. Appellant argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal and remand was a significant issue in litigation which achieved some of the benefit Appellant sought in bringing suit. <em>Cf. Texas State Teachers Ass\u2019n v. Garland Ind. Sch. Dist., </em>489 U.S. 782, 792, 109 S.Ct. 1486, 103 L.Ed.2d 866 (1989) (\u201c[A]t a minimum, to be considered a prevailing party ... the plaintiff must be able to point to a resolution of the dispute which changes the legal relationship between itself and the defendant.\u201d). Appellant further argues that because the Supreme Court has held that a party who obtains an order remanding an action pursuant to sentence four of \u00a7 205(g) of the Social Security Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), is a prevailing party under the EAJA, <em>see Sullivan v. Hudson, </em>490 U.S. 877, 892, 109 S.Ct. 2248, 104 L.Ed.2d 941 (1989), this Court should analogously hold that the Supreme Court\u2019s remand of Appellant\u2019s action renders Appellant a prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">While Appellant\u2019s victory before the Supreme Court is significant, the facts and history of this action militate against awarding fees to Appellant. There is no controlling authority that addresses whether a party that wins a jurisdictional argument before the Supreme Court is a prevailing party under fee-shifting statutes like the EAJA even if she loses the merits of her claims. But Appellant\u2019s action is similar to <em>Hewitt, </em>in which the Supreme Court held that \u201ca favorable judicial statement of law in the course of litigation that results in judgment against the plaintiff does not suffice to render him a \u2018prevailing party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hewitt, </em>482 U.S. at 763, 107 S.Ct. 2672. In <em>Hewitt, </em>the plaintiff, a prisoner, sued prison officials under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for convicting him of misconduct and sentencing him to disciplinary restrictive confinement. The district court rendered summary judgment against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>plaintiff on his constitutional claims without passing on the defendants\u2019 qualified immunity defense, but the Third Circuit reversed and held, <em>inter alia, </em>that the plaintiffs misconduct conviction violated due process and instructed the district court to enter summary judgment for the plaintiff unless the defendants established qualified immunity. The Supreme Court reversed the Third Circuit, but did not review the Third Circuit\u2019s decision on the plaintiffs misconduct conviction. When the action reached the Third Circuit again, that court reaffirmed its instruction to the district court to enter summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff based on the unconstitutionality of the misconduct conviction unless the defendants established qualified immunity. The district court on remand entered summary judgment for the defendants on all claims based on qualified immunity. Then the plaintiff sought attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court denied the plaintiffs request partially based on the fact that the defendants\u2019 qualified immunity precluded damages and thus did not render the plaintiff a prevailing party under \u00a7 1988(b). The Third Circuit reversed the district court and held, <em>inter alia, </em>that its prior ruling that the defendants violated the plaintiffs due process rights was a form of \u201cjudicial relief<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2019 that rendered the plaintiff a prevailing party under \u00a7 1988(b). On appeal the Supreme Court reversed the Third Circuit and held that because the plaintiff obtained no damages and hence no relief, he was not a prevailing party under \u00a7 1988(b). The Supreme Court added that although the Third Circuit\u2019s decision may indeed be \u201crelief,\u201d ultimately the plaintiff did not prevail because he \u201cobtained nothing from the defendants.\u201d <em>Hewitt, </em>482 U.S. at 761-62, 107 S.Ct. 2672.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Likewise, although Appellant may have obtained \u201crelief\u2019 from the Supreme Court reversing this Court\u2019s jurisdictional decision, she did not obtain anything from Appellee on the merits of her claims. The district court did not address the jurisdictional argument in rejecting the merits of Appellant\u2019s claims. We affirmed the district court\u2019s rejection of one of Appellant\u2019s claims and held that her remaining claims were jurisdictionally barred based on issue exhaustion. <em>Sims, </em>200 F.3d at 230. The Supreme Court reversed our jurisdictional finding and remanded for further proceedings. <em>Sims, </em>120 S.Ct. at 2086. On remand we reviewed the merits of Appellant\u2019s remaining claims and affirmed the district court. <em>Sims, </em>224 F.3d at 381-82. In light of these decisions, Appellant\u2019s success be-' fore the Supreme Court does not render her a prevailing party because the Supreme Court did not order any relief relating to the merits of Appellant\u2019s claims, and Appellant received nothing from Appellee. <em>See Hewitt, </em>482 U.S. at 762, 107 S.Ct. 2672. Additionally, the remand from the Supreme Court to this Court cannot be analogized to a remand under sentence four of \u00a7 405(a) because a sentence-four remand \u201cterminates the litigation with victory for the plaintiff,\u201d <em>Shalala v. Schaefer, </em>509 U.S. 292, 301, 113 S.Ct. 2625, 125 L.Ed.2d 239 (1993), whereas the Supreme Court\u2019s remand in this action neither terminated the litigation in favor of Appellant nor addressed the merits of Appellant\u2019s claims. The Supreme Court\u2019s remand is more analogous to a remand under sentence six of \u00a7 405(g), which permits a remand to the Commissioner of Social Security for further action. <em>See Squires-Allman, </em>117 F.3d at 919 n. 2 (\u201cOne does not become a prevailing party merely because the Secretary\u2019s request for a remand is granted under sentence six. Instead, the party must actually succeed in receiving some substantial benefit that was sought in the original appeal because of the remand.\u201d); <em>Escobar, </em>857 F.2d at 646. The Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Court\u2019s decision in this action is only a procedural victory on which Appellant cannot \u201cprevail\u201d for purposes of shifting his counsel fees to the opposing party. <em>See </em>Hewitt, 482 U.S. at 763, 107 S.Ct. 2672; <em>cf. Huey, </em>971 F.2d at 1367; <em>Escobar, </em>857 F.2d at 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Even assuming Appellant is a prevailing party under the EAJA, she is not entitled to attorney fees if the position of the United States was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). \u201cSubstantially justified\u201d means \u201cjustified in substance or in the main-that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.\u201d <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988). In other words, it means a \u201creasonable basis both in law in fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo be \u2018substantially justified\u2019 means ... more than merely undeserving of sanctions for frivolousness; that is assuredly not the standard for Government litigation of which a reasonable person would approve.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">The fact that one other court agreed or disagreed with the Government does not . establish whether its position was substantially justified. Conceivably, the Government could take a position that is not substantially justified, yet win; even more likely, it could take a position that is substantially justified, yet lose. Nevertheless, a string of losses can be indicative; and even more so a string of successes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 569, 108 S.Ct. at 2552. \u201cWhether or not the position of the United States was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the record (including the record with respect to the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the civil action is based) which is made in the civil action for which fees and other expenses are sought.\u201d \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B). \u201c[T]he EAJA-like other fee-shifting statutes-favors treating a case as an inclusive whole, rather than as atomized line-items.\u201d <em>Jean, </em>496 U.S. at 161-62, 110 S.Ct. 2316. The United States has the burden of establishing that its position was substantially justified. <em>Herron v. Bowen, </em>788 F.2d 1127, 1130 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Appellant raises three points on whether Appellee\u2019s position was substantially justified. First, Appellant argues that Appellee\u2019s position initially before this Court was unjustified in light of controlling precedent. Second, Appellant argues that Appellee failed to properly place the issue of exhaustion before this Court by not objecting to the magistrate judge\u2019s findings and by not cross-appealing the district court\u2019s judgment. Finally, Appellant argues that Appellee\u2019s administrative position was deceptive and misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">None of these arguments have merit. First, Appellee\u2019s position, that Appellant must seek issue exhaustion before the Appeals Council, before us was justified because it relied on our controlling decision in <em>Paul, </em>which held that a claimant\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies deprived us of jurisdiction to review her claims. 29 F.3d at 210. Moreover, the Supreme Court in Sims unanimously agreed that in most cases, issue exhaustion is a necessary predicate for federal judicial review. <em>Sims, </em>120 S.Ct. at 2084, 2086, 2087-88. The Justices narrowly split <em>5-4 </em>on whether an exception to that predicate should be created under Social Security laws. Second, because we erroneously treated issue exhaustion as a jurisdictional matter, Appellee did not have to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s findings or cross-appeal the district court\u2019s judgment. Finally, there is no evidence in the record suggesting that Appellee\u2019s administrative position was deceptive and misleading. Therefore, Appellee\u2019s position was substantially justified, and Appellant is not entitled to attorney fees under the EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">Appellant\u2019s Petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-6\">.
