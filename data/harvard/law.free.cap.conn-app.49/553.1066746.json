J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akr\">The defendant appeals from the judgment of the trial court denying his motion to dismiss the charge of violating the Home Improvement Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 20-427 (b) (5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the prosecution was not barred by the doctrine of double jeopardy. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">The history of this case discloses that the state commenced a prosecution on August 24, 1994, alleging that the defendant had contracted to perform home improvements without being registered, as required by the act. At the conclusion of all the evidence, the trial court granted a judgment of acquittal on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>that the prosecution was barred by the one year statute of limitations. General Statutes \u00a7 54-193. With the court\u2019s permission, the state appealed to this court. General Statutes \u00a7 54-96. We reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings on the ground that the trial court improperly granted the motion for judgment of acquittal because the timely issuance of the arrest warrant tolled the statute of limitations. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kruelski, </em>41 Conn. App. 476, 677 A.2d 951, cert. denied, 238 Conn. 903, 677 A.2d 1376 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Following the remand, the state commenced the present prosecution against the defendant, and the defendant moved to dismiss, arguing that further proceedings would constitute a second prosecution for the same offense following an acquittal. The trial court denied the motion, holding that \u201cthe court\u2019s prior order granting the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal was based on an unrelated legal issue and was not based on a resolution in the defendant\u2019s favor of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The defendant argues that further prosecution is barred by his constitutional right not to be placed in jeopardy twice because, in the former trial, the court ordered a judgment of acquittal based on a determination that the defendant had proven all the essential elements of a statute of limitations defense. Specifically, the defendant claims that despite being reversed by this court, the acquittal was a judgment of the trial court that represented a factual resolution of some of the elements of the charged offense, sufficient to invoke the double jeopardy bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 97, 98 S. Ct. 2187, 57 L. Ed. 2d 65 (1978), the United States Supreme Court held that \u201ca defendant is acquitted only when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>\u2018the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution [in the defendant\u2019s favor], correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the <em>offense charged.'' </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The defendant maintains that because the resolution of the statute of limitations defense involved a level of inquiry that constituted a factual determination as to whether there was unreasonable delay in the service of the arrest warrant,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the trial court was required to assess the facts surrounding the defendant\u2019s arrest. The defendant contends that those facts necessarily included facts related to his guilt or innocence and, according to double jeopardy principles, he cannot be the subject of a second prosecution for the same offense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The <em>Scott </em>court determined that when a defendant deliberately chooses to \u201cseek termination of the proceedings against him on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence of the offense of which he is accused, [he] suffers no injury cognizable under the Double Jeopardy Clause if the Government is permitted to appeal from such a ruling of the trial court in favor of the defendant. . . . Rather, [the Supreme Court] conclude [d] that the Double Jeopardy Clause, which guards against Government oppression, does not reheve a defendant from the consequences of his voluntary choice,\u201d which ends a prosecution with neither a conviction nor an acquittal. Id., 98-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">The <em>Scott </em>court further held that when a defendant is acquitted after proving ah the elements of an affirmative defense, double jeopardy operates to bar successive prosecution only when the defense is one that \u201carises from \u2018the notion that Congress could not have intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>criminal punishment for a defendant who has committed all the elements of a proscribed offense\u2019. . .where other facts established to the satisfaction of the trier of fact provide a legally adequate justification for otherwise criminal acts. Such a factual finding <em>does </em>\u2018necessarily establish the criminal defendant\u2019s lack of criminal culpability\u2019 .... By contrast, [a successful defense such as] preindictment delay represents a legal judgment that a defendant, although criminally culpable, may not be punished because of a supposed constitutional violation.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) Id., 97-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">In the present case, the defendant deliberately sought to terminate the proceeding against him by using a statute of limitations defense. A statute of limitations defense is not a defense that, when proven, negates an essential element of a charged offense or establishes a legally adequate justification for an otherwise criminal act. Instead, this type of defense \u201crepresents a legal judgment that a defendant, although criminally culpable, may not be punished because of a supposed constitutional violation.\u201d Id., 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Moreover, in ruling on the defense in question, the trial court limited its factual determination to whether the arrest warrant was delivered to the proper law enforcement authorities in a timely manner. The court\u2019s judgment of acquittal was based solely on the conclusion that such delivery was, in fact, outside the one year statute of limitations period, and the court did not resolve in the defendant\u2019s favor any of the factual elements of the offense charged. There is nothing in the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision to suggest that it considered the defendant\u2019s guilt or lack of guilt when ruling on the motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">In this case, the defendant successfully avoided a conviction by persuading the trial court to dispose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>the action on a basis that did not depend on guilt or lack of guilt. He was, thus, neither acquitted nor convicted. \u201cHe has not been \u2018deprived\u2019 of his valued right to go to the first jury; only the public has been deprived of its valued right to \u2018one complete opportunity to convict those who have violated its laws.\u2019 \u201d Id., 100. We conclude that the defendant was never \u201cacquitted,\u201d but that the case had been improperly dismissed. Accordingly, proceeding with this prosecution does not violate the defendant\u2019s privilege against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 20-427 (b) provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo person shall ... (5) offer to make or make any home improvement without having a current certificate of registration under this chapter . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b578-9\"> In his statute of limitations defense, the defendant contended that there had been an unreasonable delay in executing the arrest warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
