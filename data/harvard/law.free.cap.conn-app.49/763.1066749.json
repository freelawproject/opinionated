The respondent claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the petitioner, the department of children and families (department), proved by clear and convincing evidence the statutory grounds for termination under General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-112. Specifically, the respondent claims that the trial court improperly (1) concluded that the respondent failed to achieve a degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that she could assume a responsible position in her daughter\u2019s life pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (2), (2) concluded that the respondent\u2019s daughter was denied, by reason of the respondent\u2019s acts of commission or omission, the care necessary for her well-being pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (3), (3) concluded that the department made reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent with her daughter under \u00a7 17a-112 (d) (2) and did not prevent the respondent from maintaining a meaningful relationship with her daughter under \u00a7 17a-112 (d) (7), (4) refused to draw an adverse inference against the petitioner for failing to call a witness and (5) refused to permit the respondent to call the minor child as a witness. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">The trial court found the following facts. The respondent is the mother of Lauren, who was bom on September 9, 1985. Lauren\u2019s father never maintained a relationship with Lauren, and he consented to the termination of his parental rights on August 16,1996. In 1992, the respondent commenced a relationship with Jeff L., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>who is an alcoholic. The respondent was placed in foster care during her youth and was herself a victim of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">On October 26,1992, one of the respondent\u2019s coworkers informed Jodi Boebert, an officer of the East Hartford police department, that the respondent told her that Jeff had sexually assaulted her six year old daughter, Lauren.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The following day, Boebert and an investigator from the department interviewed Lauren at her school. At that time, Lauren had recently turned seven years old. She stated that she told her mother that her private area hurt and that her mother told her to take a bath, but Lauren did not disclose any sexual abuse. Boebert also interviewed the respondent at her home. The respondent denied having made a statement to a coworker that Jeff had assaulted Lauren and refused to reveal Jeffs name or address. On November 3, 1992, Boebert returned to the respondent\u2019s home to request that Lauren undergo a physical examination. At this time, the respondent told Boebert that she did not want Jeff to know that the police were questioning Lauren. She explained that she was pregnant with Jeffs child and that she did not want to alienate Jeff.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Subsequently, Boebert received Lauren\u2019s medical report, which failed to confirm any sexual abuse. The police department closed its investigation until March 25, 1993, when the parents of one of Lauren\u2019s friends reported to Boebert that Jeff had sexually assaulted their daughter in October, 1992. Wendy, an eleven year old friend of Lauren, told her parents that while she was at the respondent\u2019s home, Jeff had inserted his finger into her vagina and asked her to go to bed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>him. Jeff also told Wendy that the respondent knew everything and not to worry.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">On March 31,1993, Boebert and an investigator from the department again interviewed Lauren at her school. Lauren disclosed that Jeff had \u201clicked her private part and made her pee,\u201d inserted his finger into her buttocks and put his private part on her private part. This occurred in her mother\u2019s bedroom while her mother was at work and while her siblings were asleep. She stated that this contact occurred more than once over a period of one week. Lauren stated that she had told her mother and older sister what had happened, and that her mother told her not to talk to anyone about it. On April 1, 1993, Boebert informed the respondent of Lauren\u2019s statements. The respondent stated that Lauren was lying and that she did not believe her daughter\u2019s allegations or those of Wendy. The respondent again refused to reveal Jeffs name. The department removed Lauren from the respondent\u2019s home on that date. On April 5, 1993, the department obtained an order of temporary custody of Lauren and filed a petition alleging neglect. The trial court entered a finding of neglect on October 21, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">On April 16, 1993, the police arrested the respondent for risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21, and the criminal court issued a protective order prohibiting the respondent from having any unsupervised contact with Lauren. On January 30, 1996, the petitioner filed a petition for the termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 17a-l 12. After a hearing on the matter, the court entered an order terminating the respondent\u2019s parental rights on April 28, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">\u201cThe hearing on a petition to terminate parental rights consists of two phases, adjudication and disposition. See Practice Book \u00a7 1043.1 et seq. [now Practice Book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>(1998 Rev.) \u00a7 33-5]. In the adjudicatory phase, the trial court determines whether the statutory ground for termination of parental rights exists by clear and convincing evidence. If the trial court determines that a statutory ground for termination exists, it proceeds to the dispositional phase. In the dispositional phase, the trial court determines whether the termination of parental rights is in the best interests of the child. <em>In re Maximina V., </em>44 Conn. App. 80, 82-83, 686 A.2d 1005 (1997).\u201d <em>In re Drew R., </em>47 Conn. App. 124, 127, 702 A.2d 647 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">\u201cThe standard for review on appeal [from a termination of parental rights] is whether the challenged findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Luis C., </em>[210 Conn. 157, 166, 554 A.2d 722 (1989)]; <em>In re Christina V., </em>38 Conn. App. 214, 223, 660 A.2d 863 (1995).\u201d <em>In re Eden F., </em>48 Conn. App. 290, 309, 710 A.2d 771, cert. granted on other grounds, 245 Conn. 917, 717 A.2d 234 (1998). \u201cOn appeal, our function is to determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion was legally correct and factually supported. . . . We do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached .... Rather, on review by this court every reasonable presumption is made in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">We first address the respondent\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the respondent failed to achieve such a degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that she could assume a responsible position in her daughter\u2019s life. The respondent claims that this finding by the trial court was not legally correct or factually supported in light of certain evidence in the record. Specifically, the respondent relies on a report by Farah Ibrahim, a psychologist, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>the testimony of Dena Rosenbloom, a clinical psychologist. The respondent also points out that she attended eight sessions of a support group for survivors of sexual abuse in 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Ibrahim met with the respondent and Lauren during family counseling sessions in 1993 and 1994. Ibrahim\u2019s report, dated February 8, 1994, states that Lauren should eventually be reunited with the respondent, that Lauren and her mother desperately missed each other and that significant progress was made in therapy. The report states Ibrahim\u2019s belief that the respondent would benefit from individual therapy and from a course on parenting and appropriate protection of her children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The report also indicates, however, that the respondent ignored Ibrahim\u2019s recommendation for individual counseling for two years while Lauren was in foster care. In addition, at a hearing in March, 1994, concerning revocation of the April 16, 1993 protective order, Ibrahim testified that the respondent had acknowledged the possibility that Lauren was molested, but not to the extent indicated on the police report. Ibrahim did not testify at trial, although the respondent introduced a copy of her report.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The respondent also relies on the testimony of Rosenbloom, whom the respondent claims expressed optimism regarding her rehabilitation. We note, however, that the trial court found that the respondent initiated counseling with Rosenbloom four years after Lauren\u2019s placement in foster care and two weeks after the commencement of the termination proceedings in this case. Furthermore, Rosenbloom did not testify that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>respondent was rehabilitated and could not provide an opinion concerning how long it would be before the respondent could constructively act as a parent to her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Robert H. Neems, a psychologist who has worked with the respondent and Lauren since 1995, testified that the respondent had not achieved rehabilitation. He stated that until September, 1996, the respondent expressed her belief that Lauren fabricated the molestation story.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Neems also testified to other examples of behavior that indicated a lack of rehabilitation. He testified that the respondent failed to support Lauren emotionally, blamed Lauren and the department for Lauren\u2019s placement in foster care, failed to take responsibility for the course of events over the last four years and disrupted Lauren\u2019s adjustment in foster care. He stated that the respondent\u2019s continued relationship with Jeff was destructive to Lauren. According to Neems, the respondent\u2019s behavior shows that she has not acknowledged that it was her own actions at the time of the molestation that led to Lauren\u2019s placement in foster care. He also testified that he has seen no indication that the respondent is able to empathize with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>Lauren\u2019s feelings and that the respondent has no understanding of what Lauren\u2019s needs are. He concluded that the respondent was not likely to change her behavior significantly.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">In addition to Neems\u2019 testimony, the trial court heard testimony from two of the department\u2019s caseworkers. One of the caseworkers testified that the respondent revealed to her that she had been sexually abused by her foster parents, that it did not bother her and that she believed that Lauren had fabricated the molestation story. The other caseworker testified that, although the respondent entered counseling sessions for survivors of sexual abuse, the respondent told the caseworker that she attended the sessions because only her attorney instructed her to do so and that the classes were not helping her. This caseworker testified that the respondent denied any need for individual counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Section 17a-112 \u201crequires the trial court to analyze the respondent\u2019s rehabilitative status as it relates to the needs of the particular child, and further, that such rehabilitation must be foreseeable within a reasonable time.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Christina V., </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 221. \u201cA determination by the trial court . . . that the evidence is clear and convincing that the parent has not rehabilitated herself will be disturbed only if that finding is not supported by the evidence and [is], in light of the evidence in the whole record, clearly erroneous.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">The trial court\u2019s finding with respect to the respondent\u2019s rehabilitative status is supported by the evidence. The evidence at trial showed that the respondent has failed to believe Lauren\u2019s account of the molestation, continues her relationship with Lauren\u2019s molester and lacks an understanding of Lauren\u2019s needs. The trial court gave credence to Neems\u2019 testimony that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>respondent is not rehabilitated. \u201cCourts are entitled to give great weight to professionals in parental termination cases.\u201d Id. The court also found persuasive Rosenbloom\u2019s testimony that she could not estimate how long it would take the respondent to gain insight into her denial that Lauren was molested and to cope with her own feelings of anger. The trial court noted that Lauren has been in foster care for four years and determined that any farther delay in Lauren\u2019s status would be unreasonable. On the basis of the record before the trial court, we conclude that the court\u2019s finding was supported by clear and convincing evidence and was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">The respondent next claims that the trial court improperly found that she had denied Lauren, by reason of acts of commission or omission, the care, guidance or control necessary for her physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being under \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (3). The respondent contends that she protected Lauren by preventing Jeff from visiting her home between the time of the October, 1992 incident and the time that Lauren was placed in foster care, and that she believed Lauren\u2019s account of sexual contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">The trial court concluded that the respondent\u2019s failure to believe Lauren when confronted with Lauren\u2019s account of the incidents of abuse as well as with Jeffs admission of abuse, her failure to protect Lauren from further abuse, her failure to avail herself of reunification services and her failure to cooperate with the police and the department to ensure Lauren\u2019s protection constituted acts violative of \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (3). See <em>In re Felicia D., </em>35 Conn. App. 490, 502, 646 A.2d 862, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 931, 649 A.2d 253 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">The record supports the court\u2019s findings. Neems testified that the respondent\u2019s actions \u201chave been very emotionally abusive of Lauren and very, very destructive to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>Lauren\u2019s welfare for many years now. At least the four years that Lauren has been in foster care. So to say that [the respondent] feels guilty about the situation and would like to repair it is not reflected in any of the behavior that I have certainly seen since that point in time. . . . She has not shown a willingness to make the changes that would repair this relationship.\u201d Neems also testified that he had a conversation with Ibrahim in 1995, after the date of her report, in which Ibrahim stated that she terminated the therapy sessions between the respondent and Lauren because of the impact of the respondent\u2019s act of blaming Lauren and her assertions that Lauren was lying. Furthermore, Rosenbloom testified that the act of not believing a child can be more traumatic to the child than the abusive event itself. One of the department caseworkers testified that the respondent never acknowledged that Lauren was molested and that Lauren was aware that her mother did not believe her.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Section 17a-112 authorizes the termination of parental rights where specific acts of parental commission or omission have caused serious physical or emotional injury to a child. Id., 502. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination that grounds existed under \u00a7 17a-112 to terminate the respondent\u2019s parental rights was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">The respondent next claims that the trial court\u2019s conclusion under \u00a7 17a-112 (d) (2) and (7)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the department made reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>and Lauren, and that the department did not prevent reunification, was improper and violated her right to a familial relationship guaranteed by the state and federal due process clauses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The respondent contends that the department prevented reunification and that the state may not terminate parental rights where the state has created the condition under which termination is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The procedural facts relevant to the respondent\u2019s claim are as follows. On May 23, 1994, the trial court granted the respondent\u2019s motion to revoke the order of commitment and entered an order of protective supervision for one year. On June 15, 1994, however, the criminal court again entered a protective order prohibiting the respondent\u2019s contact with Lauren as a result of the respondent\u2019s arrest for multiple violations of the April 16, 1993 protective order. On June 27, 1994, on a motion by the department, the trial court modified the prior order of protective supervision and committed Lauren to the protective custody of the commissioner of the department. Thereafter, the respondent filed a motion to dissolve or modify the protective order. The trial court heard oral argument on August 12,1994, and found that the protective order was entered because the respondent had failed to protect Lauren from sexual abuse by threatening to punish her if she told anyone about it, harassed and threatened to kill the coworker who reported the abuse to the department and flagrantly violated the earlier protective order. The trial court denied the respondent\u2019s motion, and there was no contact between Lauren and the respondent from June 15, 1994, through June 19, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>\u201cThe right to the integrity of the family is among the most fundamental rights guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment.\u201d State v. Anonymous, 179 Conn. 155, 162, 425 A.2d 939 (1979). With respect to the respondent\u2019s claim that the department prevented reunification, we note that \u201ca state may not, consistent with due process of law, create the conditions that will strip an individual of an interest protected under the due process clause.\u201d <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 534, 613 A.2d 748 (1992). In this case, however, the record does not support the respondent\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The respondent claims that Lauren\u2019s foster mother and the department thwarted reunification, and precipitated the lack of ongoing contact between the respondent and Lauren. She refers to the foster mother\u2019s report to the police that the respondent was violating the protective order by repeatedly trying to contact Lauren, and to the department\u2019s report of these contacts to the prosecutor, which led to the revocation of the May 23, 1994 order. The respondent fails to recognize that the trial court issued the May 23, 1994 protective order because of the respondent\u2019s own actions in violating the earlier protective order and in threatening a witness. The respondent created the conditions under which the department sought termination in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">The trial court found that the respondent\u2019s decision to protect Jeff, to deny or disregard the effects of sexual abuse on Lauren and to refuse counseling services prevented the respondent from having a relationship with Lauren. The department offered various counseling services to assist the respondent in addressing her problems and to facilitate reunification with Lauren, but the respondent failed to avail herself of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">We conclude that the record supports the trial court\u2019s factual findings under \u00a7 17-112 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The respondent next claims that the trial court improperly refused to draw an adverse inference against the petitioner for failing to call as a witness Robert Meier, a psychologist who performed a court-ordered psychological evaluation of the respondent and Lauren for purposes of the termination hearing. The respondent requested that the trial court draw an adverse inference against the petitioner under <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 165 A.2d 598 (1960), which the trial court refused to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">\u201cThe failure of a party to produce a witness who is within his power to produce and who would naturally have been produced by him, permits the inference that the evidence of the witness would be unfavorable to the party\u2019s cause.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 675. \u201cTo take advantage of this rule permitting an adverse inference, the party claiming the benefit must show that he is entitled to it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>48 Conn. App. 41, 45, 708 A.2d 594, cert. denied, 244 Conn. 930, 711 A.2d 729 (1998). \u201cThat is, the party claiming the benefit of the ruling must show that the witness is available and that the witness is one whom the party would naturally produce.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 46; see <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>supra, 147 Conn. 675. \u201cA witness who would naturally be produced by a party is one who is known to that party and who, by reason of his relationship to that party or to the issues, or both, could reasonably be expected to have peculiar or superior information material to the case which, if favorable, the party would produce.\u201d <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>supra, 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">\u201cAppellate courts will not disturb a trial court\u2019s <em>Secondino </em>ruling absent a clear abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>221 Conn. 93, 106, 602 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>A.2d 581 (1992). In reviewing claims that the trial court abused its discretion, great weight is attached to the trial court\u2019s decision and every reasonable presumption is given in favor of its correctness. <em>State </em>v. <em>Beckenbach, </em>198 Conn. 43, 47, 501 A.2d 752 (1985).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>47 Conn. App. 590, 594, 706 A.2d 1000 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The respondent has failed to establish that she was entitled to an adverse inference because she has failed to demonstrate that Meier was a witness who, by reason of his relationship to the petitioner or to the issues in the petitioner\u2019s case-in-chief, the petitioner would naturally be expected to call. As noted by the trial court, Meier\u2019s evaluation reports were ordered by the trial court and were available to both parties. The respondent could have subpoenaed Meier to testily but did not. \u201cThe failure of a party to call as a witness a person who is available to both parties and who does not stand in such a relationship to the party in question or to the issues that that party would naturally be expected to produce him if his testimony was favorable affords no basis for an unfavorable inference.\u201d <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>supra, 147 Conn. 676. In addition, the respondent failed to establish that Meier was available to testify during the petitioner\u2019s case-in-chief or that Meier\u2019s testimony would not have been cumulative of other evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The respondent claims that the petitioner\u2019s failure to produce Meier as a witness deprived the court of an opportunity to consider the results of his examination in ruling on the petition. A review of the transcript in this case debunks the respondent\u2019s claim. In oral argument before the trial court on April 4,1997, counsel for the respondent stated that he did not want Meier\u2019s report to come into evidence, but did want an opportunity to talk to Meier before resting his case. When asked by the trial court why he wanted to talk to Meier if he did not want his report to come into evidence, counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>responded that there was new information regarding the case since the date of the report. The trial court pointed out that Meier\u2019s report was written in June, 1996, and counsel had nine months prior to the termination hearing to talk to Meier. On April 7, 1997, the trial court declined to draw an adverse inference against the petitioner for not calling Meier, noting that the petitioner had no obligation to do so if it felt it had proven its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">We conclude that the trial court was within its discretion in refusing to draw an adverse inference against the petitioner for'failing to call Meier.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">The respondent\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly refused to allow her to call Lauren as a witness, thereby violating her statutory right of confrontation under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-135 (b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>In re Noel M., </em>23 Conn. App. 410, 421, 580 A.2d 996 (1990) (respondent\u2019s rights to confrontation and cross-examination in parental termination case statutory, not constitutional in nature). The respondent claims that Lauren was a necessary witness because she was a party to all of the allegations that led to the termination proceeding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>\u201cIt is a well established principle of law that the trial court may exercise its discretion with regard to evidentiary rulings, and the trial court\u2019s rulings will not be disturbed on appellate review absent abuse of that discretion. . . . Sound discretion, by definition, means a discretion that is not exercised arbitrarily or wilfully, but with regard to what is right and equitable under the circumstances and the law .... And [it] requires a knowledge and understanding of the material circumstances surrounding the matter ....

Id., quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>204 Conn. 683, 693, 529 A.2d 1245 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1061, 108 S. Ct. 1017, 98 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>The court\u2019s decision not to question Lauren in camera is supported by our decision in <em>In re Wayne A., 25 </em>Conn. App. 536, 595 A.2d 373 (1991). In that case, the respondent father claimed that the trial court violated his rights under \u00a7 46b-135 (b) by not allowing him to call as witnesses two employees of the department. We held that \u00a7 46b-135 (b) was inapplicable because it was within the trial court\u2019s discretion to deny the request on the basis of relevance or cumulative evidence. Id., 542. In the present case, the trial court found that Lauren\u2019s testimony was not necessary based on \u201call of the evidence\u201d in the case and that requiring Lauren to testify would victimize her. The court stated: \u201cI have a distinct disinclination to have children participate in these proceedings because it sort of victimizes them again, and I don\u2019t want a child to think that they made the decision. . . . The child gets placed in the position of divided loyalty, and I don\u2019t think, based upon all of the evidence that\u2019s here, that that\u2019s a necessary bit of information.\u201d In addition, Neems testified that in his opinion, requiring Lauren to testify would be destructive to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The trial court\u2019s decision not to question Lauren in this matter was a proper exercise of its discretion and was rendered \u201c \u2018with regard to what [was] right and equitable under the circumstances and the law ....\u2019\u201d <em>New London Federal Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Tucciarone, </em>supra, 48 Conn.

Although the trial court recommended that the respondent participate in individual counseling, she attended only one counseling session, after which the therapist discontinued the sessions because the respondent was not \u201cself-motivated\u201d and because the respondent stated that she attended the session only at the insistence of the department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b792-7\"> At the trial in this case, which commenced in March, 1997, the respondent testified to the events of the night that Jeff molested Lauren and her friend Wendy. The respondent stated that she awoke from a nap and saw Jeff sitting on the living room couch with Lauren and Wendy. She walked into the kitchen to get a drink and Jeff followed her. He then told the respondent that he put his hand down the girls\u2019 pants and fondled them, but that he did not penetrate them with his finger. The respondent testified that the girls then asked Jeff to read them a Halloween story, which he did. The respondent claims to have been confused by the girls\u2019 continued interest in Jeff in light of the sexual contact that Jeff told her had just occurred. The next morning, Jeff denied having admitted to this conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Neems testified that the respondent\u2019s recent acknowledgment that Lauren was molested left unexplained her continued relationship with Jeff and her constant disruption of Lauren\u2019s placement in foster care. One of the department caseworkers testified that although the respondent ultimately acknowledged that Jeff molested Lauren, she did not believe the extent of the molestation that took place, namely digital penetration, oral sex and contact between Jeffs penis and Lauren\u2019s vagina.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b795-9\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-112 (d) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOU\">\u201cExcept in the case where termination is based on consent, in determining whether to terminate parental rights under this section, the court shall consider and shall malte written findings regarding ...

In her brief to this court, the respondent asserts that Lauren\u2019s testimony was relevant to the following issues: the events of the abuse; Jeffs presence at her home after the alleged sexual contact; her efforts to protect Lauren; Lauren\u2019s feelings of safety; Lauren\u2019s feelings toward her; what it was like for Lauren to live in her house with her brothers and sisters; what it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>like for Lauren to visit with her in the presence of therapists and social workers; and what it was like for Lauren to live with her foster family.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">In arguing the motion to the trial court, counsel stated: \u201cThe areas that we would be interested in knowing about is just the love and affection that [Lauren] holds for her mother, where she desires to live and the reasons why in the child\u2019s own words.\u201d Later in the proceedings, counsel for the respondent stated: \u201cWe still would like to have [Lauren] talk to the court in private in chambers without lawyers present, without parties present and to have a discussion regarding Lauren\u2019s intentions, her wishes, in accordance with findings that the court\u2014and the relationship she might have with her mother. ... I would request an in chambers, private discussion with the child ... to get her intentions and wishes free from any influence . . . .\u201d The trial court asked counsel: \u201cMr. Andreini, it\u2019s my understanding that you want me to talk to the child so that I can get a sense of what the child wants to do?\u201d Counsel replied: \u201cYes, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
