Provost, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53-21.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) precluded the cross-examination of a prosecution witness regarding her credibility in violation of the defendant\u2019s fundamental right to confront witnesses pursuant to both the sixth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut; and (2) permitted the prosecution to engage in misconduct during closing argument in violation of the defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following relevant facts. During 1990 through 1991, the victim, M, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>a minor female, lived with her mother, J. In the winter of 1990, shortly before M\u2019s sixth birthday, J began dating the defendant, who was known to M as Rick. J often allowed the defendant to take M with him while he did errands, played racquetball, rode his motorcycle, and, on several occasions, the defendant was alone with M at his residence. J ended her relationship with the defendant in November, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">In January, 1994, M began exhibiting suicidal tendencies and a violent temper, often running away from home. J took M to the Wheeler Clinic in Plainville for a psychiatric evaluation. During the visit, M became severely agitated, had to be restrained, and was subsequently admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital in Hartford. Upon M\u2019s discharge from the hospital three days later, J and her sister, Darline, were informed by the hospital staff that M had a yeast infection and blood in her urine.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Following her discharge from the hospital, M spent a night at Darline\u2019s home. After bathing M, Darline, concerned about M\u2019s infection, began to talk with M about \u201cgood touch and bad touch\u201d in an effort to learn whether anyone had touched M inappropriately. M told Darline that \u201cRick, mom\u2019s boyfriend,\u201d had hurt her inside, kissed her on the mouth, and \u201c[gone] to the bathroom\u201d on her. Darline immediately informed J about M\u2019s disclosures, and then reported the allegations to the department of children and families on February 6, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">After a police investigation, the defendant was arrested and subsequently found guilty of sexual assault in the first degree and risk of injury to a child. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly restricted his cross-examination of Darline, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>whom M had first revealed the sexual abuse. Specifically, the defendant contends that the trial court violated his sixth amendment right to confront his accusers by precluding the cross-examination of Darline with respect to her concern about whether any member of her family might have perpetrated the sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">We first address the defendant\u2019s contention that this claim is of constitutional magnitude. At trial, the defendant characterized the nature and purpose of his cross-examination of Darline as relating to \u201ccredibility with what [Darline] can remember as to what she testified [to] on direct.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On appeal, however, the defendant for the first time characterizes this same cross-examination as an attempt to expose Darline\u2019s motive and interest in questioning M. This new claim is solely of an evidentiary nature. \u201c \u2018Patently nonconstitutional claims that are unpreserved at trial do not warrant special consideration simply because they bear a constitutional label.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Laws, </em>36 Conn. App. 401, 411, 651 A.2d 273 (1994), cert. denied, 232 Conn. 921, 656 A.2d 671 (1995), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 240, 567 A. 2d 823 (1989). Because we do not review evidentiary claims that were not properly preserved; Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 60-5 (formerly \u00a7 4061); <em>Dept. of Public Safety </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>242 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Conn. 79, 91, 698 A.2d 803 (1997);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we will address only the issue of whether the cross-examination of Darline was improperly restricted with respect to the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right, that is, the questioning of her credibility on direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u201c \u2018The sixth amendment to the [United States] constitution guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to confront the witnesses against him. . . . The primary interest secured by confrontation is the right to cross-examination ....\u2019\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>241 Conn. 1, 15-16, 695 A.2d 1022 (1997). \u201c \u2018The confrontation clause does not, however, suspend the rules of evidence to give the defendant the right to engage in unrestricted cross-examination. . . . Only relevant evidence may be elicited through cross-examination. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>[232 Conn. 740, 746, 657 A.2d 611 (1995)]. . . . Moreover, it is well settled that questions of relevance are committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>supra, 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">The defendant maintains that his questioning of Darline regarding M\u2019s infection was necessary cross-examination because, on direct examination, Darline had raised that very issue with respect to her concern that a family member may have been involved. We disagree. At trial, Darline specifically challenged this interpretation of her testimony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our review of the record reveals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>that the trial court sustained numerous objections from the prosecution on relevancy grounds because the defendant failed both to explain how the questions were relevant to Darline\u2019s credibility and to lay the requisite evidentiary foundation that would have allowed the questioning of Darline to evolve into an issue of third party culpability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">It is well settled that \u201c[e]vidence of third party culpability must directly connect the third party to the crime. It is not enough to show that another had the motive to commit the crime . . . nor is it enough to raise a bare suspicion that some other person may have committed the crime of which the defendant is accused. . . . Unless the direct connection exists, it is within the discretion of the trial court to refuse to admit such evidence. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>227 Conn. 231, 258, 630 A.2d 577 (1993).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Guess, </em>44 Conn. App. 790, 811, 692 A.2d 849 (1997), aff'd, 244 Conn. 761, 715 A.2d 643 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Here, despite the court\u2019s request for an offer of proof, the defendant offered no evidence to connect a third party directly to M\u2019s alleged sexual abuse. Moreover, there was no evidence to suggest that M was in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>way confused or uncertain about her statement that the alleged perpetrator was the defendant. Not only did the defendant misinterpret Darline\u2019s testimony when she stated that she simply asked M who had touched her, but the attempted questioning of Darline with respect to other family members was clearly an attempt to inculpate a third party, for which no direct evidence was proffered. Accordingly, we conclude that the court properly exercised its discretion in precluding the defendant from questioning Darline about other family members on cross-examination. This proper exercise of discretion did not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly permitted the prosecution to engage in misconduct during its closing argument, depriving the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial in violation of the sixth and fourteenth amendments to both the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant contends that during closing argument the prosecutor (1) made \u201cnumerous improper, inaccurate, and highly prejudicial remarks\u201d while repeatedly asking the jury to draw inferences that he knew to be false and (2) improperly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant. The defendant concedes that this misconduct claim was unpreserved, and he now seeks review of this claim under either <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 233, or the plain error doctrine pursuant to Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 60-5 (formerly \u00a7 4061). Although the first two prongs of <em>Golding </em>are satisfied here, we find no merit to the claim pursuant to the third prong of <em>Golding.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Finally, the conduct that the defendant challenges in this case does not rise to the level of plain error.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">We have stated that \u201c[pjrosecutorial misconduct can occur in the course of closing argument. ... In order to deprive a defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial, however, the prosecutor\u2019s conduct must have so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. . . . We do not focus alone, however, on the conduct of the prosecutor. The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Garrett, </em>42 Conn. App. 507, 515, 681 A.2d 362, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 928, 929, 683 A.2d 397, 398 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Here, the defendant challenges the prosecutor\u2019s conduct solely as it related to closing argument. In determining whether this claim of prosecutorial misconduct deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial, we must first decide whether the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>tor\u2019s remarks were, in fact, improper, and, if so, whether they substantially prejudiced the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Oehman, </em>212 Conn. 325, 336, 562 A.2d 493 (1989). In so doing, \u201cwe focus on several factors: (1) the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument; (2) the severity of the conduct; (3) the frequency of the conduct; (4) the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues of the case; (5) the strength of the curative instructions adopted; and (6) the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>41 Conn. App. 180, 190, 674 A.2d 1372, cert. denied, 237 Conn. 925, 677 A.2d 950 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">We first consider the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was so misleading to the jury that it amounted to an unconstitutional denial of due process.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant contends that \u201c[i]t was unfair, as a threshold matter, to argue that the defendant\u2019s guilt was established by the absence of evidence that the prosecutor had [succeeded] in excluding on the ground that it was irrelevant.\u201d While the defendant argues that several statements that were made by the prosecutor during closing argument were improper,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> he is referring in this claim to the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the prosecutor successfully argued to prevent the admission of evidence regarding both Darline\u2019s and M\u2019s motives to lie. The problem with the defendant\u2019s claim is that excluded evidence does not exist at all, for purposes of closing arguments. It cannot be blatantly egregious, therefore, to address such an absence of evidence, notwithstanding the manner by which it was excluded. Further, it is well established that \u201cin addressing the jury [cjounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>214 Conn. 752, 760, 574 A.2d 182 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Because the challenged conduct occurred solely during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, by definition it did not evince a pattern of conduct that was repeated throughout the trial. Further, for the reasons that we have discussed, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks during closing argument did not rise to the level of blatantly egregious misconduct that would implicate the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process. Accordingly, we conclude that this unpreserved claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Finally, the defendant argues that the prosecution improperly shifted the burden of proof to him by implying, in closing argument, that the defendant had the burden of proving that the child or her aunt had deliberately fabricated the charges against him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Our review of the record reveals that the state\u2019s attorney implied no such thing, and, in fact, underscored the state\u2019s burden of proof.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury regarding the presumption of innocence, the importance of considering all of the evidence in reaching a decision, and, most important, the <em>state\u2019s </em>burden to prove each and every element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. Because \u201cwe presume, absent a fair indication to the contrary, that the jury followed the instruction of the court as to the law\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lasky, </em>43 Conn. App. 619, 629, 685 A.2d 336 (1996), cert. denied, 239 Conn. 959, 688 A.2d 328 (1997); we conclude that the burden of proof properly remained on the state to prove each and every element of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person ... (2) engages in sexual intercourse with another person and such other person is under thirteen years of age and the actor is more than two years older than such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53-21 provides: \u201cAny person who wilfully or unlawfully causes or permits any child under the age of sixteen years to be placed in such a situation that its life or limb of such child is endangered, or its health is likely to be injured, or does any act likely to impair the health or morals of any such child, shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than ten years or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b79-9\"> The defendant did not provide a separate analysis of his state constitutional claims, as is required by <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>25 Conn. App. 282, 283 n.2, 594 A.2d 985 (1991), aff'd, 222 Conn. 672, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992).

We note, however, that the defendant neither offered any evidence with respect to that fact, nor laid the requisite foundation for the admission of evidence to that effect. Accordingly, the prosecutor\u2019s mere awareness of that allegation would not preclude his reminding the jury that no evidence had been admitted to suggest that anyone other than the defendant had committed the sexual abuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b86-8\"> The defendant also argues that it amounted to misconduct for the prosecutor to argue that, if M had accused a family member, namely, Darline\u2019s son, Darline simply would not have reported the abuse.
