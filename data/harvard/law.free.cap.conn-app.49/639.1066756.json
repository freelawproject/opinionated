We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The victim, Gloria Taveras, is the defendant\u2019s former wife and the mother of their three children. The victim lived with her mother and the three children in the former marital home. By the terms of the Taveras\u2019 divorce agreement, the victim had physical custody of the children, and the defendant had unsupervised visitation every other week from 9 a.m. on Saturday to 6 p.m. on Sunday. By mutual agreement, however, the defendant often began his visitation with the children on Friday evenings.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">On Friday, September 15, 1995, the defendant and the victim spoke by telephone and argued over the defendant\u2019s visit with the children that weekend. The defendant did not come to pick up his children on Friday, September 15, or on Saturday, September 16. On Sunday, September 17, shortly after the victim arrived home from work, the defendant arrived at her house. After the defendant spoke with one of his children, the victim came to the door and asked the defendant why he was there. An argument ensued between the defendant and the victim. When the victim would not allow the defendant to enter her home, he grabbed her by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>hair and attempted to pull her outside. The defendant grabbed her by the arm, leaving scratches and bruises on her upper left arm. At one point during the altercation, the victim tore the defendant\u2019s jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">At the time of the altercation, the victim\u2019s mother was at home in her basement apartment. The victim\u2019s sister, Mildred Bauza, was visiting her mother, and Milton Quiles, an acquaintance of the family, was also in the basement apartment repairing the plumbing. Upon hearing the commotion at the front door, Bauza and Quiles came upstairs. Both Bauza and Quiles testified that when they arrived upstairs the defendant was trying to pull the victim out of the house while the victim resisted. Quiles intervened and was able to separate the victim and the defendant. The defendant then went to his car and telephoned the police to report that he had been attacked by the victim. Bauza also called the police to report the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Officer Richard Golas of the Bridgeport police department arrived within ten to fifteen minutes. Golas testified that when he arrived at the victim\u2019s house he first spoke with the defendant who was outside of the house. Golas further testified that the defendant told him that he and his former wife had argued over his custody rights, and that she had punched him and ripped his jacket. Golas observed that the defendant\u2019s jacket was ripped, but could not testify as to the extent of the damage. Golas also testified that he could not observe any injuries on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Golas next went into the house to speak to the victim and the two witnesses. Golas observed ambulance personnel tending to the victim, who was six months pregnant and experiencing labor pains. Golas also observed that the victim looked upset, had scratches and bruises, and her hair was disheveled. Golas then interviewed Bauza and Quiles, the two witnesses to the incident, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>and interviewed the defendant again regarding what had transpired. After speaking with all of the parties present and observing the physical conditions of both the defendant and the victim, Golas surmised that the defendant became angry with the victim and \u201ctried to take her out, pulling her physically out of her house,\u201d and concluded that there was probable cause to arrest the defendant for third degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The defendant first claims that his constitutional right to due process, as guaranteed by the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, was violated by the prejudicial testimony of the investigating officer, Golas. The defendant argues that Golas was permitted to give his expert legal opinion on the ultimate issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt and that Golas\u2019 testimony was improperly emphasized by the prosecution. He further claims that the trial court should have given a curative instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">For the first time on appeal, the defendant objects to a portion of Golas\u2019 testimony in which the officer purportedly gave his opinion on the ultimate issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. The portion of Golas\u2019 testimony to which the defendant now objects is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-10\">\u201cQ. Okay, Now this is your normal course of your investigation when you arrive at a domestic call? Do you interview the parties?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-11\">\u201cA. Sure, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-12\">\u201cQ. And then what do you do after you interview the parties? What do you do with the information you\u2019ve received?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>\u201cA. Well, you weigh the information. I saw the injury on the victim . . . and I didn\u2019t see any injury on the defendant, so being a domestic violence call in the state of Connecticut, if there\u2019s any kind of an injury or an assault, you have to determine if there\u2019s going to be an arrest made.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">\u201cQ. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">\u201cA. Weighing my options, I did decide to arrest the defendant for assault third, domestic violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">\u201cQ. Now, aside from this particular case, is it your procedure when you go to a call like this, that sometimes you may arrest more than one party?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-9\">\u201cA. Yes, depending on the circumstances, you might arrest both parties, you might arrest whoever\u2019s at fault, whoever\u2019s in the wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-10\">\u201cQ. Okay. And you made a determination that day\u2014\u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-11\">\u201cA. Correct, that the defendant was at fault, from weighing my information I was given, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">Because the defendant failed to object to Golas\u2019 testimony at trial, we must determine whether review of this issue is warranted under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). In <em>Golding, </em>our Supreme Court held that \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>damental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., 239-40. \u201c \u2018The first two questions relate to whether a defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable, and the last two relate to the substance of the actual review.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>8 Conn. App. 528, 531, 513 A.2d 1261 (1986).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Shinn, </em>47 Conn. App. 401, 409, 704 A.2d 816 (1997), cert. denied, 244 Conn. 913, 914, 713 A.2d 832, 833 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">\u201cThe improper admission of opinion testimony that answers a question that a jury should have resolved for itself is not of constitutional significance and is a type of evidentiary error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vilalastra, </em>[207 Conn. 35, 46, 540 A.2d 42 (1988)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>47 Conn. App. 559, 563, 707 A.2d 295 (1997), cert. denied, 244 Conn. 917, 714 A.2d 8 (1998). Because the defendant\u2019s claim regarding Golas\u2019 testimony is not of constitutional magnitude, we cannot afford it <em>Golding </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">We next consider whether this issue is entitled to plain error review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cGenerally, where a claimed error of a nonconstitutional nature is not brought to the attention of the trial court, appellate review of that claim is available only if it constitutes plain error. ... To prevail under the plain error doctrine, the defendant must demonstrate that the claimed error is both so clear and so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice. . . . This doctrine is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>implicated and review of the claimed error is not undertaken unless the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. . . . Furthermore, even if the error is so apparent and review is afforded, the defendant cannot prevail on the basis of an error that lacks constitutional dimension unless he demonstrates that it likely affected the result of the trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>46 Conn. App. 486, 511, 700 A.2d 694 (1997), cert. denied, 244 Conn. 907, 908, 713 A.2d 829 (1998); see also <em>Kolich </em>v. <em>Shugrue, </em>198 Conn. 322, 326, 502 A.2d 918 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Plain error review is not warranted here. In this case, Golas testified not as an expert witness, but instead as a fact witness with firsthand knowledge of the incident in question. Furthermore, Golas did not in fact testify as to the ultimate issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. Instead, he testified as to his personal observations at the scene, his method of investigation, his statutory obligations in domestic cases and the fact that it was his ultimate conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to determine that the defendant was \u201cat fault\u201d in the incident and was the proper party to be <em>arrested. </em>Golas did not testify that in his opinion, the defendant was guilfy of third degree assault. We conclude that it was not improper for the trial court to admit Golas\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">The defendant next claims that the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments, permitted over the defendant\u2019s objection, improperly emphasized Golas\u2019 testimony. The defendant claims that he was prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s impropriety in the following respects: (1) the state asked the jury to consider matters that it should not have considered; (2) the prosecutor improperly bolstered Golas\u2019 testimony; (3) the prosecutor expressed her personal opinion of Golas\u2019 credibility; and (4) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>prosecutor improperly implied that the jury should reach the same conclusions as Golas.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The trial court has wide discretion in ruling on evidentiary matters, and its rulings will be reversed only if there has been a clear abuse of discretion or an injustice has been done. <em>State </em>v. <em>Zollo, </em>36 Conn. App. 718, 723, 654 A.2d 359, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 906, 660 A.2d 859 (1995). \u201c[Cjounsel may comment upon facts properly in evidence and upon reasonable inferences drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinsey, </em>173 Conn. 344, 348, 377 A.2d 1095 (1977). Since we have determined that Golas\u2019 testimony was properly admitted by the trial court, the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments will not be deemed improper unless they distorted or misstated Golas\u2019 testimony in some way.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>The prosecutor in this case merely argued to the jury facts that were properly admitted into evidence. She restated Golas\u2019 testimony with respect to his investigation and the facts that he concluded supported the defendant\u2019s arrest. The prosecutor did not argue that Golas had determined that the defendant was guilty, nor did she indicate that Golas\u2019 testimony should be believed by the jury. Instead, the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments accurately reflected Golas\u2019 testimony, which testimony was properly admitted into evidence by the trial court and, therefore, the trial court properly overruled the defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"AQt\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Finally, since we conclude that Golas\u2019 testimony was properly admitted by the trial court and that the prosecutor properly commented on admissible evidence, the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly refused to deliver a curative instruction is to no avail. The trial court has great discretion in deciding whether to give a curative instruction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pouncey, </em>241 Conn. 802, 814-15,699 A.2d 901 (1997). The burden is on the defendant to prove that the trial court\u2019s refusal to deliver a curative instruction so far exceeded the boundaries of the court\u2019s discretion that he was denied a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>214 Conn. 752, 759-60, 574 A.2d 182 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">In this case, it is evident that the trial court evaluated the circumstances of the case, determined that the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks were appropriate comment on the evidence and were not prejudicial and, accordingly, determined that a curative instruction was not warranted. We agree with that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly excluded from evidence the jacket that he wore at the time of the incident. Additional facts are necessary to the resolution of this claim. The defendant testified that on the day of the incident in question, he was wearing a jacket and that during a heated argument the victim tore the jacket so that \u201cthe whole inside of the jacket, which has a lining, and the cloth itself, was ripped and torn completely.\u201d Golas and Bauza also testified that the defendant\u2019s jacket was tom during the argument, although neither testified as to the extent of the tear. The victim denied that she ripped the defendant\u2019s jacket. The defendant then testified that the lining of the jacket had been repaired by a tailor since the incident, but that the mending on the jacket would show where the damage had been. The defendant moved to admit the jacket into evidence to show the extent of the damage made by the victim and to refute the victim\u2019s testimony that she did not tear- the jacket. The prosecution objected to the admission of the jacket, arguing that the repaired jacket was no longer a fair and accurate representation of the garment at the time of the incident and, further, that there was a problem with the chain of custody because the j acket had been out of the defendant\u2019s possession while it was being repaired. The court mled that the jacket was inadmissible because it had undergone material alterations, was substantially changed, and was no longer a fair and accurate representation of the condition of the jacket at the time of the incident. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">\u201cWhen proffered evidence is challenged on the ground of material alteration, the trial court must satisfy itself in reasonable probability that the substance has not been changed in important respects. The trial court, in making its determination, must consider the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>of the article, the circumstances surrounding its preservation and custody and the likelihood of intermeddlers tampering with it. In the absence of a clear abuse of discretion the ruling of the trial court [considering] the evidence must stand.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 722, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Given that the jacket in this case was being offered to show the extent of the tears made in the material, the trial court properly concluded that the repair of the jacket constituted a substantial material alteration and that the jacket, therefore, no longer accurately represented what it purported to show. Further, the exclusion of the jacket did not prejudice the defendant because he was able to present evidence that the jacket had been ripped in the incident through the testimony of Golas and Bauza. In light of this evidence and the other factors involved, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit the repaired jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">The defendant finally claims that the trial court improperly denied his request for a mistrial based on the statements made by the state\u2019s witness regarding prior misconduct of the defendant in violation of the court\u2019s order precluding such comments. Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine requesting that the court enter an order prohibiting police officers who testify for the state from mentioning that the defendant was known to them from his prior arrests or convictions. The court ordered \u201cthat no questions about prior arrests are to be asked by the state, and the witnesses and the officers are to be instructed not to volunteer such information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">The defendant specifically cites four examples where he claims that the court\u2019s pretrial order was violated by the victim, who testified for the state. In the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>instance, after the victim testified on direct examination, without objection, that her marriage to the defendant was \u201cnot that great,\u201d the state asked her, \u201cHow would you describe it?\u201d The defendant objected to this inquiry and the question was withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The next two instances that the defendant cites as violative of the court\u2019s order involved responses by the victim to the defendant\u2019s own cross-examination of her. During cross-examination, the defendant asked the victim whether, on the day of the incident, there was a protective order in place. In her response, which was subsequently stricken, the victim stated that protective orders had been entered on prior unrelated occasions. Later during cross-examination, in response to the question of whether her children engaged in visitation with any third party, the victim stated that \u201chis family tries, the only time they really come up is when he ends up arrested for any other thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The fourth instance cited by the defendant occurred on the state\u2019s redirect examination of the victim. On redirect, the state asked the victim, \u201cBefore when you were testifying, describing the incident that day, the pushing and shoving that was going on and [the defense attorney] asked you, isn\u2019t it true that he had done that before, that the defendant had done that before, what did you mean when you said yes, he had done that before?\u201d In response, the victim stated, \u201cHe had come into the house before, broken into the back door and came into the house, he destroyed my car, he destroyed everything inside the house, wanting to beat me up, threatened me with a gun, things like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">The defendant objected to the victim\u2019s response on the ground of relevancy and, after removing the jury and hearing argument from counsel, the trial court sustained the objection and ordered that the victim\u2019s response be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>After this ruling, the defendant moved for a mistrial arguing that the jury was prejudiced beyond any curative instruction. When the jury returned to the courtroom, the trial court issued the following instruction: \u201cThank you. You may be seated. Ladies and gentlemen, I am sustaining the objection to the last question and, therefore, any answer that was given to the question \u2018had he done that before\u2019 and the responses to that question, are to be\u2014are stricken. They\u2019re stricken from the record, and they\u2019re not to be considered by you in your deliberations as far as the evidence in this case. That is not evidence and it is not part of your consideration. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">\u201c \u2018While the remedy of mistrial is permitted under the rules of practice it is not favored. [It] should be granted only as a result of some occurrence upon the trial of such a character that it is apparent to the court that because of it a party cannot have a fair trial . . . and the whole proceedings are vitiated. ... If curative action can obviate the prejudice, the drastic remedy of mistrial should be avoided. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Wooten, </em>[227 Conn. 677, 693-94, 631 A.2d 271 (1993]). On appeal, we hesitate to disturb a decision not to declare a mistrial. The trial judge is the arbiter of the many circumstances which may arise during the trial in which his function is to assure a fair and just outcome. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>210 Conn. 315, 333, 554 A.2d 1080 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bausman, </em>162 Conn. 308, 312, 294 A.2d 312 (1972).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>46 Conn. App. 131, 136-37, 698 A.2d 908 (1997).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>47 Conn. App. 542, 557, 706 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 244 Conn. 908, 713 A.2d 829 (1998). \u201cOn appeal, the defendant bears the burden of establishing that there was irreparable prejudice to the defendant\u2019s case such that it denied him a fair trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>225 Conn. 55, 87, 621 A.2d 728 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>\u201cDue process seeks to assure a defendant a fair trial, not a perfect one.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 565, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982). Here, while the testimony of the victim may have violated the court\u2019s pretrial order, the defendant has failed to establish that given the court\u2019s cautionary instruction to the jury, and when taken in the context of the entire trial, he was prejudiced by the violation of the court order. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-16\"> General Statute \u00a7 53a-61 provides in relevant part: \u201cAssault in the third degree: Class A misdemeanor, (a) A person is guilty of assault in the third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>degree when: (1) With intent to cause physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b666-13\"> Golas was apparently referring to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-38b (a), which provides in relevantpart: \u201cWhenever apeace officer determines upon speedy information that a family violence crime . . . has been committed ... he shall arrest the person or persons suspected of its commission and charge such person or persons with the appropriate crime. The decision to arrest and charge shall not (1) be dependent on the specific consent of the victim, (2) consider the relationship of the parties or (3) be based solely on a request by the victim.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\"> Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 60-5, formerly \u00a7 4061, provides in relevant part: \u201cThe court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. The court may in the interests of justice notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial court. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">The state addressed the issue of plain error review in its brief, and the issue was raised during oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b669-7\"> The prosecutor\u2019s full closing argument regarding Golas\u2019 testimony is as follows: \u201cI\u2019d also like to touch a little bit on the testimony by Officer Golas. He was the officer that got the call. He indicated it came over the dispatch as a domestic call with iiyuries. He arrived on the scene. He immediately\u2014 the defendant was there, and as testimony indicates from, I believe Mildred Bauza and the defendant, the defendant had called the police. And, the police officer testified when he arrived at the scene, he immediately\u2014he went over to the defendant . . . and spoke to him. After speaking to the defendant, Officer Golas then spoke to the other parties. He spoke to the victim, Gloria Taveras. He spoke about what he observed. He spoke that she was very upset, her hair was messed up, he found a hair clip outside the doorway outside of the house, not inside, that she seemed very upset and that he also observed scrapes on her arm. Officer Golas, after talking to the victim, also talked to Mildred Bauza, he also talked to Milton Quiles. And, then in an effort to thoroughly investigate, he went back to the defendant. He talked to the defendant a second time. I think that\u2019s very significant, and I think you will find it\u2019s very significant because, as the officer testified, many times in domestic violence cases [objection asserted by defense counsel and overruled by the court] he testified, when he goes out on domestic violence calls, he has to make a determination, he interviews the parties. Here he certainly interviewed both sides to the argument. He interviewed the two independent witnesses. He\u2014I believe that what you will recall that what Officer Golas said, he did not see the defendant as the victim. He looked\u2014he saw that the defendant had a torn jacket, but he observed the scrapes on the victim, he knew that she was pregnant, six months pregnant. He testified he observed some rips on the defendant\u2019s jacket. He did not observe any iiyuries to the defendant\u2019s wrists. He did not observe any blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>on the defendant\u2019s wrists, as the defendant testified to. Officer Golas testified that in assessing this and making a determination, he talked to all of the parties. He did his investigation, and based upon his investigation he made a determination, and that determination was that the defendant was the party to be <em>arrested </em>for assault in the third degree.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
