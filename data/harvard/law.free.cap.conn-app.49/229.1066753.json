After a review of the record and briefs, and after hearing from the parties at oral argument, we conclude that the trial court properly dismissed the petition to terminate the rights of Jessica\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. Jessica was bom on October 29, 1990. One month later, Jessica\u2019s pediatrician notified the department that Jessica had suffered injuries to her head and that her parents\u2019 explanation was not consistent with the injury, a fractured skull with a small amount of brain swelling. Jessica\u2019s mother later admitted having hit the child with her hand. Jessica\u2019s father knew of the incident. In December, 1990, the department obtained temporary custody of Jessica and filed coterminous petitions of neglect and termination of parental rights as to Jessica\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">On March 15, 1991, the department withdrew the termination petition, and Jessica was adjudicated neglected and committed into department custody and placed in foster care. Jessica was returned to her parents in October, 1991. From that time until the summer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>of 1992, the department provided protective services for Jessica in her family home. On June 5, 1992, the department petitioned to revoke Jessica\u2019s commitment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The department closed its file on Jessica because its expectations concerning her parents were successfully met.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Three and one-half years later, Jessica came to the attention of the department again. In March, 1995, the mother took Jessica and left the marital home. The mother sought help atabattered women\u2019s shelter, where she reported spousal abuse and that she had hit Jessica in the head again. She also reported that the father had beaten Jessica with a belt. The coordinator of the shelter reported suspected child abuse to the department. Upon investigation, a department employee noted bruises on Jessica\u2019s back, buttocks and legs. The department again obtained custody of Jessica, placed her in foster care, and once more filed coterminous petitions of neglect and termination of parental rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>At the time of trial, Jessica was living with a foster family, and her parents were separated. Trial was held on several days between September 29, 1995, and April 22, 1996. The trial court heard testimony from Jessica\u2019s foster mothers, from the respondents and from other relatives, department caseworkers and two psychologists, whose reports were also admitted as evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court also took judicial notice of the court files of both the 1990 and 1995 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The trial court first considered the neglect petition and then considered whether either of the two statutory grounds alleged in the termination petition were proved by clear and convincing evidence. The trial court found by a fair preponderance of the evidence that Jessica was neglected for injuries the parents inflicted on her in March, 1995. The court ordered Jessica committed to the department for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">With respect to the termination petition, the court took judicial notice of the 1990 file and found that, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>part of that proceeding, Jessica had been adjudicated neglected. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (2). The trial court also found with respect to the 1995 proceeding that the department had not made reasonable efforts to reunite the family for a period of not less than one year. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-112 (b), (c) and (d) (2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court stated that because the parents had successfully achieved rehabilitation in the past, they would again benefit from the intensive services of the department. The court dismissed the termination petition on both grounds alleged, i.e., failure to achieve rehabilitation and parental acts of omission and commission. The trial court also ordered the department to provide the parents with intensive rehabilitation services and additional supervised visitation. See Practice Book \u00a7 1046.1, now Practice Book (Rev. 1998) \u00a7 33-12.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The department raises four issues on appeal: the trial court improperly (1) relied on dispositional evidence for adjudication, (2) concluded that the parents would benefit from rehabilitative services, (3) found that the allegations were not proven by clear and convincing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>evidence, and (4) concluded that termination of parental rights was not in the best interest of the child.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\u201c \u2018Termination of parental rights\u2019 means the complete severance by court order of the legal relationship, with all its rights and responsibilities, between the child and the child\u2019s parent or parents . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 45a-707 (8). \u201cTermination of parental rights is \u2018a most serious and sensitive judicial action.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Barbara J., </em>215 Conn 31, 44, 574 A.2d 203 (1990). \u201cSince termination of parental rights is the ultimate interference by the state with the natural rights of parents in their children, resulting in an everlasting severance of the legal relationship, and usually the permanent separation of parent and child as well, courts must require strict adherence to the statutory standards.\u201d <em>In re Migdalia M., </em>6 Conn. App. 194, 203, 504 A.2d 533, cert. denied, 199 Conn. 809, 508 A.2d 770 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">On appeal, \u201c[w]e will overturn such a finding of fact only if it is clearly erroneous in light of the evidence in the whole record.\u201d <em>In re Romance </em>M., 229 Conn. 345, 353, 641 A.2d 378 (1994). \u201c[G]reat weight is given to the judgment of the trial court because of its opportunity to observe the parties and the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rummel </em>v. <em>Rummel, </em>33 Conn. App. 214, 221, 635 A.2d 295 (1993). \u201c \u2018We do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. Rather, we focus on the conclusion of the trial court, as well as the method by which it arrived at that conclusion, to determine whether it is legally correct and factually supported.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re David E., </em>4 Conn. App. 653, 656, 496 A.2d 229 (1985). \u201c[0]n review by this court every reasonable presumption is made in favor of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Felicia D., </em>35 Conn. App. 490, 499, 646 A.2d 862, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 931, 649 A.2d 253 (1994). Our review of the complete record reveals the trial court\u2019s decision was factually supported and legally correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The department first claims that the trial court improperly considered dispositional evidence during the adjudicatory phase of the termination proceedings. This claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">A hearing on a petition to terminate parental rights consists of two phases, adjudication and disposition. <em>In re Tabitha P., </em>39 Conn. App. 353, 360, 664 A.2d 1168 (1995). \u201cIn the adjudicatory phase, the trial court determines whether one of the statutory grounds for termination of parental rights exists by clear and convincing evidence. If the trial court determines that a statutory ground for termination exists, it proceeds to the dispositional phase. In the dispositional phase, the trial court determines whether termination is in the best interest of the child.\u201d Id. \u201cIn the discretion of the court, evidence on adjudication and disposition may be heard in a nonbifurcated hearing, provided disposition may not be considered until the adjudicatory phase has concluded.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 1042.1 (4), now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 33-3 (b); see also <em>In re Jose C., </em>11 Conn. App. 507, 508-509, 527 A.2d 1239 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">In this case, the trial court properly conducted a nonbifurcated trial and rendered a decision on the adjudicatory phase of the termination proceeding. The trial court wrote two memoranda of decision, one dismissing the petition and one in response to the department\u2019s motion for articulation, which indicate that the court\u2019s adjudicatory decisions were based on events that took place prior to the department\u2019s March, 1995 petition to terminate the rights of Jessica\u2019s parents. Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>the trial court found that the department did not prove nor did it request the trial court to waive the requirement that it made reasonable efforts to reunite the family for a period of not less than one year. The department\u2019s ability to rehabilitate the parents following Jessica\u2019s commitment in 1991 also militated against termination of their parental rights in 1996. The trial court stated in response to the motion for articulation: \u201cIf their past behavior is the best predictor of the parents\u2019 future behavior, these parents would find intensive rehabilitative services as [the department] provided them in 1991 beneficial to rehabilitation now.\u201d The parents\u2019 prior successful rehabilitation and the mutual love and bonds between Jessica and her parents are the basis on which the trial court dismissed the termination petition. Those facts occurred and were documented prior to March 29, 1995, and were properly considered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The department cites two sets of facts as the basis of its claim on appeal. The first concerns the department\u2019s having provided the mother with individual therapy and supervised visitation, which occurred after the 1995 termination petition was filed. The court found the mother to be in compliance with the therapy and visitation requirements. The trial court is required \u201cto analyze the respondent\u2019s rehabilitative status as it relates to the needs of the particular child, and further, that such rehabilitation must be foreseeable within a reasonable time. There may be instances in which the evidence does not establish that parental rights should be terminated under this section, despite the fact that continuing supportprograms for the parent may be suitable or even necessary. . . . Moreover, the court must also consider the six factors listed in General Statutes [Rev. to 1995 \u00a7 17a-112 (d)] when determining whether a parent has failed to rehabilitate himself or herself.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Sarah </em>M., 19 Conn. App. 371, 376-77, 562 A.2d 566 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-112 (d) provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept in the case where termination is based on consent, in determining whether to terminate parental rights under this section, the court shall consider and shall make written findings regarding: (1) The timeliness, nature and extent of services offered or provided to the parent and the child by an agency to facilitate the reunion of the child with the parent; (2) whether the department of children and families has made reasonable efforts to reunite the family pursuant to the federal Child Welfare Act of 1980, as amended ... (6) the efforts the parent has made to adjust his circumstances, conduct, or conditions to make it in the best interest of the child to return him to his home in the foreseeable future . . . .\u201d The mother\u2019s compliance with the therapy and visitation requirements <em>initiated, by the department</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is in keeping with the mandate of the statute and supports the trial court\u2019s order that the department provide the parents with intensive rehabilitative services and supervised visitation for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The second set of facts at issue concern the father. At trial, the father testified as to his employment and living arrangements. In its memoranda, the trial court wrote that \u201che is presently separated from his wife and living with his mother.\u201d The department takes exception to the phrase \u201cis presently.\u201d Our review of the father\u2019s testimony discloses that the status of his employment, marriage and residence preexisted the department\u2019s filing of the termination petition and continued until the time of trial. The trial court\u2019s memoranda of decision merely state the status quo. These facts, too, were found pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (d) and further support the trial court\u2019s order for continued intensive rehabilitative services. Thus, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>did not improperly consider dispositional evidence during the termination proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The department\u2019s second claim is that the trial court improperly concluded that Jessica\u2019s parents would benefit from rehabilitative services. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The department\u2019s petition to terminate was partially based on \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (2), which provides in relevant part that \u201cthe parent . . . has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that <em>within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, </em>such parent could <em>assume a responsible position in the life of the child </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) We cannot say that the facts found are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence in the whole record.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">This court previously addressed the standard of \u201cpersonal rehabilitation\u201d in the case of <em>In re Migdalia M., </em>supra, 6 Conn. App. 194, which is instructive here. Migdalia was a child with severe medical problems. Her parents could not provide the child with the care needed to treat her medical problems. Migdalia was found to be neglected, and was committed to the department and placed in foster care. Migdalia\u2019s parents loved her and visited with her regularly. This court examined the statutory requirements of \u201cpersonal rehabilitation\u201d and reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment terminating parental rights for failure to achieve rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">\u201c \u2018Personal rehabilitation\u2019 as used in the statute refers to the restoration of a parent to his or her former constructive and useful role as a parent.\u201d Id., 203. The statute does not \u201cdefine the degree of personal rehabilitation required or the meaning of a \u2018responsible position in the life of the child.\u2019 \u201d Id., 206. The statute also does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>not require parents to \u201cbe able to assume full responsibility for [a] child, unaided by available support systems.\u201d <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-3), </em>1 Conn. App. 463, 477, 473 A.2d 795, cert. denied, 193 Conn. 802, 474 A.2d 1259 (1984). The fact that both parents still need counseling does not mean they have not sufficiently achieved rehabilitation. See <em>In re Luis C., </em>210 Conn. 157, 167, 554 A.2d 722 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">As did Migdalia\u2019s parents, Jessica\u2019s parents have intellectual and psychological hmitations that prohibit them from successfully parenting her without support. The trial court found that Jessica was bonded to her parents and that they love her. Therefore, to the extent the parents can demonstrate to Jessica that they care about and love her, they have a responsible position in her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The trial court\u2019s factual findings and legal conclusions are supported by the record. Because the parents had achieved rehabilitation in the past,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the trial court found that they deserved a second chance and ordered the department to provide rehabilitative services for one year, which is a reasonable time. The department failed to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that parental rights should be terminated for failure to achieve rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">The department also claims that the trial court improperly dismissed its petition to terminate the parental rights of Jessica\u2019s parents on the ground of acts of commission and omission pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>(b) (3), finding that the department failed to meet its burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence. This claim also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (3) provides, \u201cthe child has been denied, by reason of an act or acts of parental commission or omission, the care, guidance or control necessary for his physical, educational, moral or emotional well-being. Nonaccidental or inadequately explained serious physical injury to a child shall constitute prima facie evidence of acts of parental commission or omission sufficient for the termination of parental rights . . . .\u201d Under this subdivision, parental rights can be terminated for one or numerous acts or omissions that affect a child\u2019s well-being. The department\u2019s petition focuses on the physical injuries Jessica suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">As we construe the statute, where the termination is based on a claim of serious physical injury, two criteria must be met to establish prima facie evidence for termination of parental rights: the physical injury must be serious <em>and </em>it must be nonaccidental or inadequately explained. The trial court found that in March, 1995, Jessica had bruises on her back, legs and buttocks most probably caused by her father\u2019s beating her with a belt. Jessica\u2019s mother struck the child\u2019s head. The injuries were nonaccidental because her parents intended to strike her. Because X rays and a computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan taken at the time did not reveal any broken bones, the trial court did not find Jessica\u2019s injuries to be serious enough to warrant termination of parental rights for acts of parental commission or omission. The trial court also noted that Jessica suffered developmental delays and psychological trauma as a result of her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Although certain terms and words are defined in the child welfare act,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cserious physical injury\u201d is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>defined. \u201cUnder our rules of statutory construction, we are guided by the words of the statute itself, the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, the legislative policy the statute was designed to implement, and its relationship to existing legislation and common-law principles governing the same subject matter. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>240 Conn. 317, 327-28, 692 A.2d 713 (1997).\u201d <em>Thompson &amp; Peck, Inc. </em>v. <em>Division Drywall, Inc., </em>241 Conn. 370, 375, 696 A.2d 326 (1997). \u201c[Tjhere is a presumption that the legislature, in enacting a law, did so in view of existing relevant statutes and intended it to be read with them so as to make one consistent body of law. <em>Citrano </em>v. <em>Berkshire Mutual Ins. Co., </em>171 Conn. 248, 255, 368 A.2d 54 (1976).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cagiva North America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Schenk, </em>239 Conn. 1, 8, 680 A.2d 964 (1996). Therefore, we look to existing legislation on the same subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u201cThe public policy of this state is: To protect children whose health and welfare may be adversely affected through injury and neglect . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-101 (a); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD), </em>189 Conn. 276, 283, 455 A.2d 1313 (1983). A child is \u201c \u2018neglected\u2019 who . . . (B) is being denied proper care and attention, physically ... or (C) is being permitted to live under conditions, circumstances or associations injurious to his well-being or (D) has been abused . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 (8). \u201c \u2018[A]bused\u2019 means that a child or youth (A) has had physical injury or injuries inflicted upon him other than by accidental means, or (B) has injuries which are at variance with the history given of them, or (C) is in a condition which is the result of maltreatment such as, but not limited to . . . cruel punishment . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">We note that the statutes defining neglect and abuse use only the words <em>physical injury </em>or <em>injuries </em>not <em>serious </em>physical injury. This does not present a problem. \u201cWhile that standard itself does not have a precise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>meaning, it does not lack metes and bounds. Our case law has defined and circumscribed that standard over the years ... in child neglect cases.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>179 Conn. 155, 165, 425 A.2d 939 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The trial court concluded that Jessica\u2019s injuries were not so serious as to warrant termination of her parents\u2019 parental rights. The trial court\u2019s decision is consistent with decisions of our Supreme Court and this court in interpreting \u00a7 17a-112 (b) and the comparable General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 45a-717,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> titled \u201cTermination of parental lights.

I concur in the result reached by the majority but write separately to address concerns I have about the interpretation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-112 as set forth in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Initially, it is important to note that there are two ways in which the department of children and families (department) may petition for the termination of parental rights in accordance with \u00a7 17a-112: (1) by filing coterminous petitions or (2) by filing a petition for termination of the parental rights in a child presently committed to the department. These methods are set forth in the statutes and rules of practice as well as on the form that the department files when it initiates a coterminous proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In this appeal, the petitions praying for the termination of parental rights were filed as coterminous petitions as authorized by General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-112 (e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The filing of coterminous petitions requires that one petition allege that the child is neglected, and that the accompanying petition request, if neglect is found, that the parental rights in the child be terminated. In order to be a coterminous proceeding, these petitions must be filed simultaneously or in close proximity in time. The other manner of petitioning for the termination of parental rights under \u00a7 17a-112 (b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>is to request the termination of parental rights in a child who is currently committed to the department as a result of a previous adjudication of neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The following facts must be emphasized. On March 10, 1995, an order of temporary custody was granted by the trial court, <em>Keller, J. </em>The accompanying neglect petition alleged that Jessica M. was neglected because \u201con 3/9/95, the Department of Children and Families received a referral from a battered Women\u2019s Shelter. Referral stated that mother came to the shelter the day before because of spousal abuse. Child Jessica, age four years, had bruises on back, buttocks, hip and back of legs. Mother told caller she had fractured the child\u2019s skull previously and she was placed in the department\u2019s care. Caller further reported that mother disclosed hitting the child on the head on Monday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">On March 29, 1995, the department alleged that the respondents\u2019 parental rights should be terminated because (1) Jessica had been found in a prior proceeding to be neglected and her parents had failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation or, in the alternative, (2) Jessicahad been denied by an act of commission or omission the care, guidance or control necessary for her physical and emotional well-being.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">In the present case, the child was not committed to the department as a neglected child when the petitions were filed. Jessica was in the care of the department by way of an order for temporary custody, the request for which was filed simultaneously with the petition alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>neglect. The neglect petition alleged that the child was neglected because she was permitted to live under conditions, circumstances or associations injurious to her well-being and, as a result, was being denied proper care and attention, both physically and emotionally. The trial court found the child neglected, by a fair preponderance of evidence, as a result of injuries inflicted on her on March 9, 1995, by her parents. Thereafter, in its written decision, the trial court proceeded to commit the child to the department for a period of one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Under the statutory scheme, the commitment of Jessica for one year would deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to render any further disposition regarding the termination of parental rights. Section \u00a7 17a-112 (e) authorizes the Superior Court <em>in lieu of </em>granting the neglect petition and committing the child to the custody of the department, to grant the petition for termination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Despite this, the trial court considered the petition to terminate parental rights. We must assume that the commitment of Jessica by the court was in anticipation and a rejection of the request for termination of parental rights and, therefore, that the trial court properly considered both grounds alleged by the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The first ground for termination considered by the court was failure to achieve rehabilitation. For a court to order termination on that ground pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (2), the child must have been found to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>neglected in a prior proceeding and the parents must have failed to achieve such a degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, they could assume a responsible position in the life of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The majority assumes that the requirement that the child must have been found neglected in a prior proceeding means that the child was found neglected any time in the past. Common sense and case law suggest that the phrase \u201cin a prior proceeding\u201d means the proceeding that immediately precedes and results in the filing of the petition to terminate parental rights. See footnote 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Failure to achieve rehabilitation should not be considered as a ground for termination in a coterminous proceeding because there is no \u201cprior proceeding\u201d to mark the beginning of the period in which the parent must achieve rehabilitation. General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-112 (b) provides that the parental rights of a non-consenting parent may be terminated if after <em>\u201can extended period of time </em>... (2) the parent of a child who has been found by the superior court to have been neglected or uncared for <em>in a prior proceeding </em>has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Failure to rehabilitate is defined as the failure of a parent to achieve expectations following the adjudication and disposition of the prior neglect petition. See <em>In re Michael M., </em>29 Conn. App. 112, 125-26, 614 A.2d 832 (1992); <em>In re Migdalia M., 6 </em>Conn. App. 194, 206, 504 A.2d 533, cert. denied, 199 Conn. 809, 508 A.2d 770 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">The grounds for termination set forth in subsection (b) must be alleged after an \u201cextended period of time\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>unless subsection (c)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> has been satisfied. A plain reading of the statute reveals that the phrase \u201cprior proceeding\u201d refers to the determination of neglect that immediately precedes the filing of the termination petition. \u201cIn practice, a parent\u2019s rehabilitation is often measured against the expectations established by the court following adjudication and disposition of the prior neglect petition.\u201d P. Chill, The Law of Child Abuse and Neglect in Connecticut (1997), p. 147. In a coterminous proceeding, there is no period of time to observe the parents and determine if they have or have not achieved expectations following the adjudication of the neglect petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u201cIt is well settled that a statute must be applied as its words direct. . . . <em>All Brand Importers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>213 Conn. 184, 194, 567 A.2d 1156 (1989).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pascarelli </em>v. <em>Moliterno Stone Sales, Inc., </em>44 Conn. App. 397, 400, 689 A.2d 1132, cert. denied, 240 Conn. 926, 692 A.2d 1282 (1997). Statutes should be given their plain meaning. In a coterminous proceeding an insufficient amount of time passes in which to evaluate the parents\u2019 attempt to achieve rehabilitation and, therefore, I conclude that the ground of failure to achieve rehabilitation is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">A search of the case law of our state did not uncover any termination of parental rights judgment in which coterminous petitions were granted on the ground of failure to achieve rehabilitation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Failure to achieve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>rehabilitation, by its very terms, suggests that there are problems affecting the child that have been identified and that over a period of time have not been corrected so as to restore the parent to his or her <em>prior </em>constructive and useful role as a parent. Stating it simply, the statutory scheme requires that the occurrence of events or pattern of behavior that bring about state intervention be followed by a period of corrective action. If the parent fails in this endeavor, the failure is ground for the permanent removal of the child from the parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">In the present case, if the department was successful in its goal to terminate parental rights on the basis of failure to achieve rehabilitation, the respondents would have been denied the opportunity to achieve rehabilitation provided by statute. When coterminous petitions are filed, the department is requesting that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>waive any time constraints so that the parental rights can be terminated without taking action to reunite parent and child. To allow failure to achieve rehabilitation to be relied on in a coterminous situation would not allow sufficient time to pass between the finding of neglect and the termination of parental rights so that the court could make a reasonable determination of the parent\u2019s success or failure at attempted rehabilitation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">The prior proceeding on which the department relied to invoke the jurisdiction of the trial court was the finding of neglect four years earlier, that proceeding having resulted in a six month commitment to the department. It is undisputed that during the three and one-half years since that commitment ended, there has been no state involvement with this family and no complaints made to the department. If the requirement of being found neglected in a prior proceeding is not tied to the petition to terminate parental rights when considering failure to achieve rehabilitation, the parents will be denied the statutory opportunity to achieve rehabilitation. Further, after neglect has been found upon the occurrence of an event requiring state intervention, the state\u2019s filing of coterminous petitions and the event that brought about the finding of neglect years before can be used as evidence of failure to achieve rehabilitation. This does not make sense nor does it comport with the statutoiy scheme in that it ignores the meaning of rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>For these reasons, I would exclude the ground of failure to achieve rehabilitation from \u00a7 17a-112 (b) (2) as far as it applies to the filing of coterminous petitions. I agree with the majority in upholding the judgment of the trial court that the petitioner failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Jessica had been denied by an act of omission or commission the care, guidance or control necessary for her physical and emotional well-being.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\"> The form for the termination of parental rights is created pursuant to the authority under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-112, 45a-715 and 45a-717.
