(Norse), appeals from the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment on all counts of its complaint in favor of the defendant, Tingley Systems, Inc. (Tingley). On appeal, Norse claims that the trial court improperly (1) failed to recuse itself from hearing Tingley\u2019s motion for summary judgment and (2) granted Tingley\u2019s motion for summary judgment because (a) there are genuine issues of material fact and (b) the law was misapplied with respect to (i) Tingley\u2019s special defense relating to advice of counsel and (ii) Norse\u2019s abuse of process and Connecticut Unfair Trade Practice Act (CUTPA)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claims. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The following facts are relevant to the case before this court. Norse, a Connecticut corporation, and Tingley, a Florida corporation, do business in the computer industry. Norse develops software programs and systems for health maintenance organizations. Sometime prior to 1988, Tingley had licensed the use of its health maintenance organization software program (software program) under certain conditions to Aetna Health Care Systems, Inc. (Aetna). In or about 1987, Tingley knew that Aetna intended to upgrade its computer hardware. Aetna hired Norse as a consultant to assist in its upgrading efforts. Sequoia Systems, Inc. (Sequoia), was a computer hardware vendor offering to sell Aetna a new computer. In early 1988, Tingley learned certain information that caused its principals to believe that the software program had been used in a manner that violated the license. Tingley received information that Norse had assisted Aetna and Sequoia in benchmarking<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>the software program on Sequoia\u2019s equipment in Massachusetts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Benchmarking necessarily involved the copying and modification of the software program. Norse stood to gain a sizable commission from Sequoia if Aetna purchased Sequoia\u2019s equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">On May 16, 1988, Tingley commenced suit against Norse in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, alleging copyright infringement, unauthorized access to and misuse of a computer system in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-251 and 52-570b, tortious interference with a business relationship, misappropriation of trade secrets, common-law unfair competition and CUTPA violations. On July 28, 1988, the District Court, Nevas, J., dissolved the temporary restraining order obtained by Tingley, finding that there was no actual or imminent harm to Tingley. Norse moved for sanctions against Tingley.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">On August 3, 1998, Tingley voluntarily dismissed the suit without prejudice pursuant to Rule 41 (a) (1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Norse opposed the dismissal and moved to have Aetna made a party defendant to the action. The District Court, Nevas, J., granted Norse\u2019s motion to vacate the dismissal and ordered Tingley to join Aetna as a party defendant. Tingley amended its complaint to cite in Aetna. Norse answered the amended complaint and alleged ten counterclaims against Tingley, including federal antitrust violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Following discovery and the filing of numerous motions, only two counts of Tingley\u2019s amended complaint went to the jury, copyright infringement and tortious interference with business relations. Norse ultimately limited its counterclaims to five, alleging tortious interference with contractual relations, libel, slander, CUTPA violations and common-law unfair competition. Following trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Norse on both the amended complaint and its own counterclaims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The jury awarded Norse $1,610,500. Tingley filed postverdict motions, and the District Court reduced the verdict to $515,000.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Norse again moved for sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In denying the motion for sanctions, the District Court, Restani, J., found that Tingley had probable cause to bring its claim for copyright violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Judgment entered in the federal litigation on September 15,1993. On September 20,1993, Norse commenced the present action against Tingley alleging vexatious litigation with malice pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-568 (2), vexatious litigation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-568 (1), abuse of process and CUTPA violations. In 1995,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Norse filed an application for a prejudgment remedy of more than $1,900,000, which was denied by the trial court following a two day hearing in October, 1996. Tingley then filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. Norse appealed. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Norse\u2019s first claim is that the trial court improperly failed to recuse itself from hearing Norse\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Norse\u2019s claim of judicial bias has two bases: first, that the trial court was privy to settlement discussions and, second, that the trial court acted with bias toward Norse as a result of the prejudgment remedy hearing. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for our review of this claim. Norse\u2019s application for a prejudgment remedy was heard on October 9 and 10, 1996. Prior to the hearing, the trial court met with counsel in chambers during which time the prospects of settlement were discussed. Although there is no transcript of the discussion, the trial court made brief mention of the settlement discussion on the record prior to the prejudgment remedy hearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Immediately following the trial court\u2019s comment about the settlement discussion, <em>counsel for Norse </em>asked that the parties waive any objection to the prejudgment remedy application\u2019s being heard by a judge trial referee.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Lief Petterson, president of Norse, was called as a witness to testify, in part, as to the damages Norse incurred as a result of the federal litigation. During cross-examination, Tingley\u2019s counsel elicited a response from Petterson that revealed that he had not accurately represented the amount of attorney\u2019s fees Norse had incurred at the time of his testimony in the federal case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A portion of the transcript of the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>trial was placed in evidence. It revealed that during his closing argument to the federal jury, Norse\u2019s counsel, who knew the actual fee arrangements between Norse and its attorneys, adopted Petterson\u2019s testimony as to attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial court voiced concern about the discrepancy between Petterson\u2019s federal and state court testimony, and the argument of Petterson\u2019s counsel before the federal jury. The trial court instructed Norse\u2019s trial counsel<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to prepare an affidavit for the trial court to review and consider the next steps, if any.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The trial court denied Norse\u2019s application for a prejudgment remedy at the conclusion of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">On October 29,1996, Norse filed a motion for recusal. The motion for recusal was based on the trial court\u2019s comments about Petterson\u2019s testimony and the final argument of Norse\u2019s counsel in the federal trial. The motion did not include an affidavit or a certification by counsel that the motion was made in good faith. The motion was denied by the trial court on December 5, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>On December 16, 1996, Tingley filed a motion for summary judgment, which Norse opposed. The trial court heard argument on the motion for summary judgment on February 3, 1997. After Tingley\u2019s counsel had argued, Norse\u2019s counsel moved orally for the trial court to recuse itself. For the first time, Norse\u2019s counsel cited the trial court\u2019s participation in the settlement discussion as a basis for the motion and claimed the trial court had not given Norse a fair hearing with respect to the prejudgment remedy application. The trial court denied the motion for recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">\u201cA motion to disqualify a judicial authority shall be in writing and shall be accompanied by an affidavit setting forth the facts relied upon to show the grounds for disqualification and a certificate of the counsel of record that the motion is made in good faith. The motion shall be filed no less than ten days before the time the case is called for trial or hearing, unless good cause is shown for failure to file within such time.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 997, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 1-23. \u201cThis provision creates a mandatory procedure to be followed by any party seeking to recuse a judge. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>183 Conn. 520, 521-23, 441 A.2d 41 (1981).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>6 Conn. App. 407, 412, 505 A.2d 1266, cert. denied, 199 Conn. 810, 508 A.2d 771 (1986). \u201c \u2018It is axiomatic that the burden of establishing a record that a judicial impropriety has occurred which demonstrates or gives the appearance of bias or partiality so as to require recusal rests with the party who claims the occurrence of such an impropriety.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>205 Conn. 578, 584, 534 A.2d 1175 (1987).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Teel, </em>42 Conn. App. 500, 506, 681 A.2d 974, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 921, 682 A.2d 1012 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In this case, Norse did not comply with the rules of practice in either instance in which it attempted to have the trial court recuse itself. Norse\u2019s written motion contained no affidavit setting forth the facts relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>to show the grounds for disqualification; it also contained no good faith certificate of the counsel of record. Norse never requested or demanded a hearing to present evidence to support its claim of judicial disqualification. \u201cRepresentations made by counsel are not evidence in the record upon which we can rely in our review of the judge\u2019s conduct. . . . [T]he dictates of Practice Book \u00a7 997 [now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 1-23], which requirements we hold to be mandatory are a condition precedent to a hearing on a judge\u2019s disqualification. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>supra [183 Conn. 521-23].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>supra, 6 Conn. App. 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The motion made during the summary judgment hearing was not only oral, it was untimely, not having been filed ten days before the hearing. Norse also failed to show good cause why its second motion<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> for recusal was not made within ten days of the hearing, particularly in view of the fact that the trial court denied the prejudgment remedy approximately four months before the hearing on the summary judgment motion. Because Norse failed to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 997, the trial court properly denied the motions for recusal. See <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Coburn, </em>46 Conn. App. 620, 628, 700 A.2d 81, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 938, 702 A.2d 644 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Norse\u2019s second claim is that the trial court improperly granted Tingley\u2019s summary judgment motion. It bases that claim on its assertions that there are genuine issues of material fact and that the court misapplied the law with respect to Tingley\u2019s advice of counsel special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>defense, and Norse\u2019s abuse of process and CUTPA claims. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The following facts are relevant to this claim. Norse\u2019s suit against Tingley alleges the following claims: vexatious litigation with malice pursuant to \u00a7 52-568 (2)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (count one), vexatious litigation pursuant to \u00a7 52-568 (l)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (count two), abuse of process (count three) and CUTPA (count four). In its answer, Tingley asserted eleven special defenses, three of which are relevant to this appeal: Norse\u2019s claims are barred by the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel and, with respect to the vexatious litigation claim, Tingley\u2019s actions were in reliance on the advice of counsel. Additional facts will be included as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">\u201cOur standard of review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment is well established.\u201d <em>Zichichi </em>v. <em>Middlesex Memorial Hospital, </em>204 Conn. 399, 402, 528 A.2d 805 (1987). \u201cThe judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 384, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 17-49. A \u201cmaterial fact\u201d is a fact that will make a difference in the result of the case. See <em>Hammer </em>v. <em>Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co., </em>214 Conn. 573, 578, 573 A.2d 699 (1990). The facts at issue are those alleged in the pleadings. See <em>Plouffe </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H.R. Co., </em>160 Conn. 482, 489, 280 A.2d 359 (1971). The party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>seeking summary judgment \u201chas the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue as to all material facts, which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>D.H.R. Construction Co. </em>v. Donnelly, 180 Conn. 430, 434, 429 A.2d 908 (1980). Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 380 and 381, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7\u00a7 17-45 and 17-46, the party adverse to such a motion must provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. \u201cIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The test is whether a party would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connell </em>v. <em>Colwell, </em>214 Conn. 242, 246-47, 571 A.2d 116 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">\u201cWhile the court must view the inferences to be drawn from the facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. </em>v. <em>Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986), a party may not \u2018rely on mere speculation or conjecture as to the true nature of the facts to overcome a motion for summary judgment.\u2019 <em>Knight </em>v. <em>U.S. Fire Ins. Co., </em>804 F.2d 9, 12 (2d Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 932, 107 S. Ct. 1570, 94 L. Ed. 2d 762 (1987).\u201d <em>Gallien </em>v. <em>Connecticut General Life Ins. Co., </em>49 F.3d 878, 882 (2d Cir. 1995). \u201cOn appeal, however, the burden is on the opposing party to demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the movant\u2019s summary judgment motion was clearly erroneous. <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 222, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).\u201d <em>2830 Whitney Avenue Corp. </em>v. <em>Heritage Canal Development Associates, Inc., </em>33 Conn. App. 563, 567, 636 A.2d 1377 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">A defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment \u201cis properly granted if it raises at least one legally sufficient defense that would bar the plaintiffs claim and involves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>no triable issue of fact.\u201d <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 529, 543, 494 A.2d 555 (1985). Because issues in this appeal concern questions of law, this court reviews such claims de novo. See <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Bulaong, </em>218 Conn. 51, 58, 588 A.2d 138 (1991); <em>Schratwieser v. Hartford Casualty Ins. Co., </em>44 Conn. App. 754, 757, 692 A.2d 1283, cert. denied, 241 Conn. 915, 696 A.2d 340 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Norse\u2019s first claim is that Tingley\u2019s motion for summary judgment should have been denied because there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Tingley had probable cause to initiate the federal court litigation. The following additional facts are necessary for our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Tingley\u2019s motion for summary judgment was based on its having probable cause to commence a copyright infringement claim against Norse in federal court. The motion was supported by affidavits of Tingley\u2019s counsel, and the testimony of various Tingley and Norse employees, among other things. Norse opposed summary judgment, claiming that because the federal jury found Tingley had malice in bringing its claim of copyright infringement against Norse, Tingley lacked probable cause and the real purpose in commencing the litigation was to put Norse out of business. Norse also heavily relies on its interpretation of Tingley\u2019s prelitigation investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">In granting Tingley\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court found the following facts. \u201cThe dispute had its origin in a licensing agreement between Tingley, a computer software company, and Aetna. Aetna was licensed to use Tingley software, but was to maintain it in a confidential manner. In 1988, Tingley learned its copyrighted software had been permitted by Aetna to be taken to another site, where a computer seller tested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>it with an eye to determining whether the software could be utilized with that company\u2019s equipment. Norse was the \u2018middle man\u2019 for this operation, and if the tests indicated compatibility between the Tingley software and the seller\u2019s equipment, Norse would be entitled to a commission ....</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">\u201cTingley\u2019s investigation confirmed these facts, and there does not appear to be any question but that these events occurred. In fact, one George Curley, an Aetna employee, admitted in the federal litigation that this had occurred and that the Tingley-Aetna licensing agreement had been breached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">In addition to those facts, which the trial court described as \u201cundisputed,\u201d the trial court took note of the evidence that Tingley presented in support of its summaiy judgment motion: affidavits from two of its attorneys, experts in computer law who were involved in the federal litigation, attesting that it was their belief that \u201ca sufficient factual basis existed to allege each of the claims asserted,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and a transcript of the District Court on Norse\u2019s postverdict motion for Rule 11 sanctions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Although it is pleaded in several alternatives, Norse\u2019s claim against Tingley is really one of vexatious litigation. \u201cA vexatious suit is a type of malicious prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>action, differing principally in that it is based upon a prior civil action, whereas a malicious prosecution suit ordinarily implies a prior criminal complaint. To establish either cause of action, it is necessary to prove want of probable cause, malice and a termination of suit in the plaintiff\u2019s favor .... Probable cause is the knowledge of facts sufficient to justify a reasonable person in the belief that there are reasonable grounds for prosecuting an action .... Malice may be inferred from lack of probable cause .... The want of probable cause, however, cannot be inferred from the fact that malice was proven .... The existence of probable cause is an absolute protection . . . and what facts, and whether particular facts, constitute probable cause is always a question of law.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vandersluis </em>v. <em>Weil, </em>176 Conn. 353, 356, 407 A.2d 982 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">\u201cFor purposes of a vexatious suit action, \u2018[t]he legal idea of probable cause is a bona fide belief in the existence of the facts essential under the law for the action and such as would warrant a man of ordinary caution, prudence and judgment, under the circumstances, in entertaining it.\u2019 <em>Wall </em>v. <em>Toomey, 52 </em>Conn. 35, 36 (1884); accord <em>Ledgebrook Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Lusk Corp., </em>172 Conn. 577, 584, 376 A.2d 60 (1977). \u2018Probable cause is the knowledge of facts, actual or apparent, strong enough to justify a reasonable man in the belief that he has lawful grounds for prosecuting the defendant in the manner complained of.\u2019 <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>93 Conn. 475, 477, 106 A. 761 (1919). Thus, in the context of a vexatious suit action, the defendant lacks probable cause if he lacks a reasonable, good faith belief in the facts alleged and the validity of the claim asserted.\u201d <em>DeLaurentis </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>220 Conn. 225, 256, 597 A.2d 807 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Neither of the parties disputes that the software program was copied and taken from Aetna\u2019s offices in Middletown and transported to Sequoia\u2019s facilities in Massachusetts for the benchmarking. Also, no one disputes that Norse was a party to the benchmarking. Therefore, the trial court ruled Norse had not \u201csuccessfully responded to [Tingley\u2019s] arguments as to the facts and law\u201d and granted summary judgment. What facts constitute probable cause is a question of law. See <em>Vandersluis </em>v. <em>Weil, </em>supra, 176 Conn. 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The essence of Norse\u2019s appeal is that it does not agree with the trial court\u2019s finding of facts and would have this court reinterpret the facts. Norse bases its argument on the federal jury\u2019s finding that Tingley commenced the federal suit with malice. Because there was a finding of malice, Norse believes Tingley brought the federal court action to put Norse out of business. What Norse believes is not relevant to the issue of Tingley\u2019s reasonable belief in grounds to commence the lawsuit. Although malice is probably a motivating factor in much litigation, malice alone is not sufficient to prove vexatious litigation. Want of probable cause may prove malice, but malice does not prove a lack of probable cause. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Norse\u2019s claim that the District Court\u2019s ruling on the Rule 11 sanctions motion is not res judicata as to the question of probable cause is not availing. The trial court did not rule that the issue of probable cause was previously adjudicated in the District Court. The trial court merely identified the District Court\u2019s ruling as evidence of Tingley\u2019s reasonable belief that it had reasonable grounds for prosecuting a copyright infringement claim against Norse. The trial court properly granted Tingley\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the claim of vexatious litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Norse\u2019s next claim is that the trial court improperly applied the law with respect to Tingley\u2019s special defense to the vexatious litigation claim that it relied on the advice of counsel. We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Tingley presented uncontested evidence from two lawyers, experts in the field of computer law, who testified that based on Tingley\u2019s investigation there were reasonable grounds for Tingley to allege the claims it asserted. \u201cAdvice of counsel is a complete defense to an action of . . . vexatious suit when it is shown that the defendant . . . instituted his civil action relying in good faith on such advice, given after a full and fair statement of all facts within his knowledge, or which he was charged with knowing.\u201d Id., 361. Norse contends that the testimony of one of the lawyers with respect to the law of copyrighted materials was legally incorrect. We need not decide that question. \u201cThe fact that the attorney\u2019s advice was unsound or erroneous will not affect the result.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Norse attempts to distinguish <em>Vandersluis </em>from the facts of the case before us. Norse claims that the \u201cadvice of counsel\u201d defense is available only to common-law claims of vexatious litigation and not the \u00a7 52-568 statutory causes of action it alleged. Norse cites no law in support of its argument. The elements of a common-law or statutory cause of action for vexatious litigation are identical. Therefore, the special defense of advice of counsel can be pleaded in response to both causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Norse\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly applied the doctrine of res judicata to count three, abuse of process, and count four, CUTPA, in granting Tingley\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Because public policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>prohibits a party from relitigating a matter that has been previously determined, we agree with the trial court that Norse\u2019s CUTPA and abuse of process claims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">\u201c[CJlaim preclusion, sometimes referred to as res judicata, and issue preclusion, sometimes referred to as collateral estoppel, are first cousins. Both legal doctrines promote judicial economy by preventing relitigation of issues or claims previously resolved. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">\u201c[T]he doctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion, [provides that] a former judgment on a claim, if rendered on the merits, is an absolute bar to a subsequent action on the same claim. A judgment is final not only as to every matter which was offered to sustain the claim, but also as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose .... The rule of claim preclusion prevents reassertion of the same claim regardless of what additional or different evidence or legal theories might be advanced in support of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">\u201cWe have adopted a transactional test as a guide to determining whether an action involves the same claim as an earlier action so as to trigger operation of the doctrine of res judicata. [T]he claim [that is] extinguished [by the judgment in the first action] includes all rights of the plaintiff to remedies against the defendant with respect to all or any part of the transaction, or series of connected transactions, out of which the action arose. What factual grouping constitutes a \u2018transaction,\u2019 and what groupings constitute a \u2018series,\u2019 are to be determined pragmatically, giving weight to such considerations as whether the facts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit, and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties\u2019 expectations or business understanding or usage. ... In applying the transactional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>test, we compare the complaint in the second action with the pleadings and the judgment in the earlier action. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">\u201cWe recognize that the mere explication of the doctrine of claim preclusion does not resolve all difficulties which may appear at the point of application. As was stated long ago, the law of estoppel by judgment is well settled, the only difficulty being in its application to the facts. . . . The difficulty has always been in determining what matters are precluded by the former adjudication. ... In applying the rule of claim preclusion, the critical question is how broad a definition to give to the term same claim or cause of action. The broader the definition, the broader the scope of preclusion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Delahunty </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>236 Conn. 582, 589-91, 674 A.2d 1290 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">In the federal court litigation, Norse asserted a tortious interference with contractual relations counterclaim against Tingley, alleging in part that Tingley, \u201cknowing of the contractual relationship by and between Norse and Sequoia, intentionally sought to interfere with said contractual relationship by making certain defamatory statements and allegations to Sequoia about Norse with the intent of stopping any payment to Norse pursuant to its agreement with Sequoia.\u201d The federal jury found in favor of Norse on this counterclaim, and judgment entered against Tingley.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">In the amended complaint before the trial court, Norse asserted a CUTPA claim, alleging, in part: \u201cTingley engaged in unfair methods of competition and/or unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of such trade or commerce in violation of General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>\u00a7 42-110b, including but not limited to the following: (A) Tingley commenced the previous underlying frivolous and vexatious litigation against Norse for the primary improper ulterior motive of financially destroying its business competitor, [Norse]; (B) Tingley commenced the underlying previous frivolous and vexatious litigation with knowledge and with the intent that it would substantially interfere with and terminate any existing advantageous business or contractual relationship between Norse and Aetna and/or Norse or Sequoia . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The CUTPA claim before the trial court is an attempt to assert a hybrid claim of both tortious interference with a business or contractual relationship and vexatious litigation. This is a tortious interference with a business or contractual relationship claim recast as a CUTPA claim. Any claim for tortious interference with Norse\u2019s business or contractual relationships was resolved in the federal litigation. Norse cannot now have a second bite of the apple for damages resulting from an injury to its business interests. Therefore, Norse\u2019s CUTPA claim is barred by the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Norse next claims that the trial court improperly held that Norse\u2019s abuse of process claim was barred by the doctrine of res judicata because it could have been asserted in the federal litigation. Norse maintains that because the claim was not ripe for adjudication, it could not have been asserted in the federal litigation. Although we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment that Norse\u2019s abuse of process claim is barred by the doctrine of res judicata, we reach this conclusion on the basis of grounds different from those relied on by the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>court.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We find that the claim is barred because it is essentially a claim of tortious interference with a business or contractual relationship that was decided by the federal court. We also hold that as a matter of law, the facts of this case do not constitute an abuse of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Norse alleged no abuse of process claim in its counterclaims in the federal litigation. In count three of its amended complaint before the trial court, Norse alleged that Tingley had commenced a civil action against it in the District Court, that Tingley had prosecuted the prior action \u201cwith the primary ulterior and improper motive to harm and/or destroy its business competitor, Norse. . . . There was no probable cause justifying commencement and prosecution of the [federal litigation] . . . [and] Norse suffered financial damages as a result of Tingley\u2019s abuse of process . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Once again, Norse attempts to assert a tortious interference with business or contractual relationships as another cause of action, specifically, abuse of process. A tortious interference with business or contractual relationship claim cannot be converted into an abuse of process claim simply by labeling it as such. Furthermore, the facts of this case, as a matter of law, do not constitute abuse of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">\u201cThe action of malicious prosecution lies where a civil or criminal action has been instituted with malice and without probable cause, and has terminated unsuccessfully. The plaintiff must allege and prove that the original action, whether civil or criminal, was instituted without probable cause, with malice, and that it terminated in his favor. Abuse of process is the misuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>process regularly issued to accomplish an unlawful ulterior purpose. . . . The distinction between malicious prosecution or vexatious suit and abuse of process as tort actions is that in the former the wrongful act is the commencement of an action without legal justification, and in the latter it is in the subsequent proceeding, not in the issue of process but in its abuse.\u201d <em>Schaefer </em>v. O. <em>K. Tool Co., </em>110 Conn. 528, 532, 148 A. 330 (1930). \u201cAn action for abuse of process lies against any person using \u2018a legal process against another in an improper manner or to accomplish a purpose for which it was not designed.\u2019 <em>Varga </em>v. <em>Pareles, </em>[137 Conn. 663, 667, 81 A.2d 112 (1951)]; <em>Schaefer </em>v. O. <em>K. Tool Co., </em>[supra, 532-33]. Because the tort arises out of the accomplishment of a result that could not be achieved by the proper and successful use of process, the Restatement Second (1977) of Torts, \u00a7 682, emphasizes that the gravamen of the action for abuse of process is the use of \u2018a legal process . . . against another <em>primarily </em>to accomplish a purpose for which it is not designed . . . .\u2019 ... Comment b to \u00a7 682 explains that the addition of \u2018primarily\u2019 is meant to exclude liability \u2018when the process is used for the purpose for which it is intended, but there is an incidental motive of spite or an ulterior purpose of benefit to the defendant.\u2019 See also 1 F.

Tingley pursued federal litigation for its intended purpose, i.e., to obtain damages for copyright violations by means of a successful lawsuit.
