Prete and Son Construction Company, Inc. (Prete), Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (Aetna) and M.P.H. Company, Inc. (M.P.H.), on the plaintiffs claim for payment on a bond. The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly excluded three letters constituting notice (notices) that the plaintiff had sent to the defendants pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 49-42 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. Prete was the general contractor for a project at East Haddam High School in East Haddam. Prete entered into a subcontract with M.P.H., which, in turn, entered into a subcontract with the plaintiff to perform certain labor services for the school. Prete, in accordance with General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 49-41 (a), as amended by Public Acts 1993, No. 93-104,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>furnished a bond that was issued by Aetna. The plaintiff instituted this action, alleging that it had not been paid for material, work and labor in the amount of $41,321.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">At trial, the plaintiff attempted to introduce three letters that it allegedly had sent to the three defendants demanding payment. The defendants objected to the admission of the notices because the plaintiff did not establish a nexus between \u201cM.P.H. Company, Inc.,\u201d the proper name of the defendant \u201cfor whom the labor was performed,\u201d and \u201cMechanical Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc.,\u201d the name, as alleged by the plaintiff in its complaint, by which \u201cM.P.H. Company, Inc.,\u201d is now known. As a result, the defendants argued that they did not receive sufficient notice pursuant to \u00a7 49-42 (a), which requires that the notice state the company \u201cfor whom the labor was performed.\u201d See footnote 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The plaintiff responded by arguing that although the complaint alleged that \u201cM.P.H. Company, Inc.,\u201d is now known as \u201cMechanical Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc.,\u201d the names included in the notices were stated with \u201csubstantial accuracy\u201d as required by \u00a7 49-42 (a). It is important to note that although the plaintiff alleged in its complaint that \u201cM.P.H. Company, Inc.,\u201d is now known as \u201cMechanical Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc.,\u201d the notices to the defendants referenced, as the party \u201cfor whom the labor was performed,\u201d \u201cMPH Plumbing of North Haven, Connecticut\u201d in the letter to Prete, \u201cMPH Plumbing and Heating\u201d in the letter to M.P.H. and \u201cMPH Plumbing and Heating, North Haven, Connecticut\u201d in the letter to Aetna.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>The trial court sustained the defendants\u2019 objections because the plaintiff had not established a nexus between \u201cM.P.H. Company, Inc.,\u201d and \u201cMechanical Plumbing and Heating, Inc.\u201d The trial court noted, however, that it would reconsider admitting the letters if the plaintiff provided further evidence connecting \u201cM.P.H. Company, Inc.,\u201d and \u201cMechanical Plumbing and Heating, Inc.\u201d The trial court recessed the trial to allow the plaintiff to drive from Middletown to New Haven so that the plaintiffs attorney could retrieve a document. Upon his return, the plaintiff offered a certified notice from the secretary of the state, indicating that M.P.H. Company, Inc., was dissolved at the time the plaintiff allegedly sent the notice. The defendants objected to the plaintiffs offer of the notice of dissolution; however, the trial court overruled the defendants\u2019 objections. Despite the fact that the trial court allowed the notice of dissolution to be admitted as a full exhibit, it held that notice was insufficient under \u00a7 49-42 (a) and affirmed its prior ruling sustaining the defendants\u2019 objections. The trial court reasoned that although \u201cM.P.H. Company, Inc.,\u201d may be the same entity as \u201cMechanical Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc.,\u201d the court is \u201cnot permitted rightfully to so engage in that speculation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Because the trial court sustained the defendants\u2019 objections on the basis that the plaintiff did not establish a nexus between \u201cM.P.H. Company, Inc.,\u201d and \u201cMechanical Plumbing <em>&amp; </em>Heating, Inc.,\u201d the first issue we must resolve is whether the plaintiff was obligated to establish a nexus. \u201c \u2018Pleadings have their place in our system of jurisprudence. While they are not held to the strict and artificial standard that once prevailed, we still cling to the belief, even in these iconoclastic days, that no orderly administration of justice is possible without them.\u2019 <em>Malone </em>v. Steinberg, 138 Conn. 718, 721, 89 A.2d 213 (1952).\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Sergi, </em>38 Conn. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>829, 841, 664 A.2d 795 (1995). \u201cThe purpose of the complaint is to put the defendants on notice of the claims made, to limit the issues to be decided, and to prevent surprise. <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, </em>203 Conn. 554, 557, 525 A.2d 954 (1987). \u2018Justice is not served by accepting a claim of variance [between allegations and proof] from a party who at all times has been in a position of knowing the true state of facts.\u2019 <em>Schaller </em>v. <em>Roadside Inn, Inc., </em>154 Conn. 61, 67, 221 A.2d 263 (1966). Our Supreme Court has indicated that a minor pleading deficiency, in the absence of surprise or other prejudice, should not be relied on to defeat a cause of action. <em>Giulietti </em>v. <em>Connecticut Ins. Placement Facility, </em>205 Conn. 424, 434, 534 A.2d 213 (1987).\u201d <em>Papagorgiou </em>v. <em>Anastopoulous, </em>23 Conn. App. 522, 527-28, 582 A.2d 1181 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In the present case, the defendants were aware that the plaintiff alleged in its complaint that it \u201cserved notice of claim in accordance with Connecticut Statute Section 49-42.\u201d Although the plaintiff also alleged that \u201cM.P.H. Company, Inc.,\u201d is now known as \u201cMechanical Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc.,\u201d the defendants were put on notice of the plaintiffs claim that it served notice in accordance with \u00a7 49-42 (a). Because \u00a7 49-42 (a) requires only \u201csubstantial accuracy,\u201d the defendants should have been aware that the plaintiff would not necessarily be required to prove that \u201cM.P.H. Company, Inc.,\u201d is now known as \u201cMechanical Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc.\u201d The plaintiffs cause of action should not be defeated simply because it also alleged in its complaint that \u201cM.P.H. Company, Inc.,\u201d is now known as \u201cMechanical Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc.\u201d The issues were properly limited, the defendants were on notice as to the relevant issues and they were not surprised by the plaintiffs argument that the notices were substantially accurate. We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff was not obligated to prove that \u201cM.P.H. Company, Inc.,\u201d is now known as \u201cMechanical Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>The second issue we must resolve is whether the trial court improperly refused to admit the three notices that were offered by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff claims that the notices, which referenced \u201cMPH Plumbing of North Haven, Connecticut,\u201d in the letter to Prete and \u201cMPH Plumbing and Heating, North Haven, Connecticut,\u201d in the letter to Aetna, constituted sufficient notice pursuant to \u00a7 49-42 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Section 49-42 (a) requires a subcontractor to serve \u201ca notice of claim ... on the surety that issued the bond and a copy of the notice on the contractor named as principal in the bond. The notice of claim shall state with substantial accuracy . . . the name of the party for whom the labor was performed . . . .\u201d This section and \u00a7 49-41, which requires a bond to be issued for public works projects, were \u201c \u2018enacted to protect workers and materials suppliers on public works projects who cannot avail themselves of otherwise available remedies such as mechanic\u2019s liens.\u2019 <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners, P.C. </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>236 Conn. 750, 757, 674 A.2d 1313 (1996); see <em>National Fireproofing Co. </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>81 Conn. 632, 633, 71 A. 911 (1909) (mechanic\u2019s lien cannot lie against the state or any of its subdivisions).\u201d <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. </em>v. <em>EI Constructors, Inc., </em>239 Conn. 708, 714-15, 687 A.2d 506 (1997). Section 49-42 is \u201chighly remedial in nature . . . [and] entitled to a liberal construction and application in order properly to effectuate the [legislative] intent to protect those whose labor and material go into public projects.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\u201cWhat is in issue is determined by the pleadings and, once they have been filed, the evidence proffered must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>be relevant to the issues raised in the pleadings. <em>Telesco </em>v. <em>Telesco, </em>187 Conn. 715, 720, 447 A.2d 752 (1982); <em>Arey </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>187 Conn. 324, 332, 445 A.2d 916 (1982); <em>Tehrani </em>v. <em>Century Medical Center, P.C., </em>7 Conn. App. 301, 308, 508 A.2d 814 (1986).\u201d <em>Borkowski </em>v. <em>Sacheti, </em>43 Conn. App. 294, 320-21, 682 A.2d 1095, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 945, 686 A.2d 120 (1996). \u201cRelevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue. . . . One fact is relevant to another if in the common course of events the existence of one, alone or with other facts, renders the existence of the other either more certain or more probable. ... A party is not required to offer such proof of a fact that it excludes all other hypotheses; it is sufficient if the evidence tends to make the existence or nonexistence of any other fact more probable or less probable than it would be without such evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosby, </em>44 Conn. App. 26, 31-32, 687 A.2d 895 (1996), cert. denied, 240 Conn. 910, 689 A.2d 474 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The pleadings in the present case put the accuracy of the notices in issue. The three notices, referencing inaccurate names as the party for which the labor was performed, were relevant to this issue because they had a logical tendency to aid the trial court in determining whether the names were substantially accurate. As a result, the trial court was obligated to decide whether the inaccurate names that were referenced in the plaintiffs letters to the surety that issued the bond (Aetna) and the contractor who was named as the principal in the bond (Prete)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were, nevertheless, substantially accurate. The trial court never reached this necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>determination. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to admit the notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 49-42 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cEvery person who has furnished labor or material in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract in respect of which a payment bond is furnished under the provisions of section 49-41 and who has not been paid in full therefor . . . may enforce his right to payment under the bond by serving a notice of claim ... on the surety that issued the bond and a copy of the notice on the contractor named as principal in the bond. The notice of claim shall state with substantial accuracy the amount claimed, <em>the name of the party for whom the labor was performed . . . </em>and shall provide a detailed description of the bonded public project for which the labor or material were provided. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Our Supreme Court has asserted that, in a case such as this, \u201cit is the statute in force at the time of the execution of the contract which controls.\u201d <em>American Masons' Supply Co. </em>v. <em>F. W. Brown Co., </em>174 Conn. 219, 225, 384 A.2d 378 (1978). The date on which the contract was executed is unclear. The plaintiff alleged in its complaint that the contract between Prete and M.P.H. was executed \u201c[on] or about 1993.\u201d Prete alleged that the contract was executed in 1992, while M.P.H. admitted in its answer that the contract was executed on or about 1993. We use the statute as it appeared in 1993; however, we note that the statute was identical in 1992.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-9\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 49-41 (a), as amended by Public Acts 1993, No. 93-104, provides in relevant part: \u201cEach contract exceeding twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>five thousand dollars in amount for the construction, alteration or repair of any public building or public work of the state or of any subdivision thereof shall include a provision that the person to perform the contract shall furnish to the state or the subdivision on or before the award date, a bond in the amount of the contract which shall be binding upon the award of the contract to that person, with a surety or sureties satisfactory to the officer awarding the contract, for the protection of persons supplying labor or materials in the prosecution of the work provided for in the contract . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\"> Because General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 49-42 (a) requires the subcontractor to serve a notice of claim only on the surety that issued 1he bond and the principal named in 1he bond; see footnote 1; we will address only the letters to Aetna, the surety, and Prete, the principal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\"> We note that \u00a7 49-42 (a) requires the plaintiff to serve a \u201ccopy\u201d of the notice of claim on the principal on the bond (Prete). Although the plaintiff sent a separate notice to Prete, rather than a copy, it is possible for a separate notice to satisfy the requirements of the statute.
