Altham, Jr., from execution. Ultimately, two bank executions were issued, one which was untimely and one timely served. The trial court held that the moneys were exempt from execution because, for a period of time, the moneys were improperly held as a result of the untimely execution. On appeal, the commissioner claims that the trial court improperly created an exemption not otherwise provided for by statute. We agree and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. On January 31, 1992, the trial court, <em>Hon. Norris L. O\u2019Neill, </em>judge trial referee, found that Altham had violated Connecticut hazardous waste laws and regulations in connection with his company. Judgment issued against Altham in the form of injunctive relief and $18,000 in civil penalties. Altham failed to pay the civil penalties, and the commissioner applied for a bank execution to levy Altham\u2019s funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>On February 3, 1997, the trial court issued a bank execution in the amount of $18,000, which was not served on Altham\u2019s bank until April 29, 1997. On May 21,1997, Altham sent a facsimile of his exemption claim form to the bank, which the bank properly forwarded to the Superior Court. A hearing on these issues was held before the trial court, <em>Berger, J., </em>on August 25, 1997. At this time, the trial court questioned the timeliness of the service of the execution on the funds. On August 29, 1997, the trial court determined that the service of the first bank execution by the sheriff was untimely and, therefore, void.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">On August 26,1997, prior to his knowledge of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the first execution, the commissioner applied for and received a second bank execution to levy Altham\u2019s funds. Altham was notified on August 29, 1997, of the second execution, and on September 11, 1997, Altham properly filed an exemption claim form asserting that the funds were exempt from execution because the moneys had been improperly held by the first execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">On October 20, 1997, a hearing on the second execution was held before Judge Berger. The trial court ruled that the funds should be exempt from the second execution because but for the fact that the funds had been held improperly under a stale execution, the funds would have been available to Altham to spend. The trial court reasoned that if the funds had been available, they would not have existed at the time the second execution was served. Therefore, the moneys should not now be subject to a properly served execution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>The trial court signed the hearing transcript in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 4059, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 64-1 (a) (6), in lieu of filing a memorandum of decision. The commissioner appeals from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">On February 25, 1998, the parties were ordered to appear before this court to explain why Altham had not filed a brief in response to the commissioner\u2019s appellate brief. Altham failed to appear, and the commissioner requested, as a sanction, that this court vacate the trial court judgment pursuant to Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 85-1, formerly \u00a7 4184A, and Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 85-2, formerly \u00a7 4184B.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This court declined the commissioner\u2019s request; however, we ordered that the appeal be considered on the basis of the commissioner\u2019s brief and the record only, thereby precluding Altham, the appellee, from presenting oral argument. The order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>from this court stated: \u201cIt appearing that this appeal has not been defended with proper diligence, it is hereby ordered, sua sponte, that the appeal will be considered on the basis of the appellant\u2019s brief and the record only. The appellee will not be allowed to present oral argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\u201c[General Statutes \u00a7] 52-367b governs the execution against debts due from banks. Once a judgment debtor claims an exemption from execution pursuant to \u00a7 52-367b (e),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court must schedule a short calendar hearing on the exemption claim. The exemption claim filed by the debtor is considered prima facie evidence that the claimed exemption exists. General Statutes \u00a7 52-367b (f). The court, after conducting this hearing, must decide whether the exemption claim is meritorious; General Statutes \u00a7 52-367b (i); and, if so, whether all or only part of the money deposited in the subject account is exempt. General Statutes \u00a7 52-367b <em>Q).\u201d People\u2019s Bank </em>v. Perkins, 22 Conn. App. 260, 262-63, 576 A.2d 1313, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 813, 580 A.2d 58 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Section 52-367b sets forth the circumstances under which execution against debts due to a creditor, which are held by a banking institution, may be levied. Section 52-367b (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[ejxecution may be granted pursuant to this section against any debts due from any banking institution to a judgment debtor who is a natural person, except to the extent such debts are protected from execution by [statute] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>. . . .\u201d Here, the trial court improperly created an exemption not otherwise provided by statute. <em>People\u2019s Bank </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>supra, 22 Conn. App. 260. Specifically, the trial court found that the entire account was exempt from execution because of the proceedings related to the service of the first execution, which was untimely and therefore improper. This exemption is not provided for in the General Statutes. To the contrary, General Statutes \u00a7 52-352b sets forth the list of statutory exemptions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court\u2019s exemption is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>not provided for by statute and, accordingly, the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further consideration of the exemption claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In this opinion LAVERY, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\"> The trial court\u2019s ruling was as follows: \u201cThis is a statutory proceeding. I understand that, but it\u2019s clear to me from the fact situation that what we have here, those moneys should have been returned to Mr. Altham; they were not. . . . That based upon the argument heard in front of me that there were certain discussions made between you and the sheriff, the [first execution] was then returned. I can understand what you did . . . but that money was frozen\u2014which I term to be illegal. I am frankly, convinced I do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>have those powers. . . . Mr. Altham, those moneys are exempt and shall be returned to you. Mir. [David] Wrinn, [assistant attorney general], to [attach] those moneys while they were pending in front of me on a different issue and to turn around and issue an alternative process, which was the subject of the matter before me, I believe is improper. I understand that you perhaps believed as I concluded after that hearing that the levy would fail because it was untimely, so you chose an alternative means, but the only reason those moneys were there was because they were being held improperly. Mr. Altham would have had use of them, and he is going to get use of them. Those moneys are deemed exempt.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\"> Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 85-1, formerly \u00a7 4184A, provides in relevant part: \u201cIf a party shall fail to defend against an appeal with proper diligence, the court may set aside in whole or in part the judgment under attack, with costs, and direct the entry of an appropriate final judgment by the trial court against the party guilty of the failure.
