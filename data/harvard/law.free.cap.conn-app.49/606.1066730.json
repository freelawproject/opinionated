On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) instructed one panel of venirepersons in its preliminary remarks concerning the presumption of innocence and (2) instructed the jury concerning the finding of an affirmative fact from its denial by a witness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On April 21, 1995, Colleen Bachard, the victim, visited the defendant at his house on Stillman Street in Bridgeport. Bachard and the defendant began to argue when she noticed \u201chickeys\u201d on the defendant\u2019s neck. Bachard left the defendant\u2019s house and subsequently joined the defendant\u2019s sister, Maria Perez, and Perez\u2019 friend, Christina Santiago. Bachard then walked to the comer of Berkshire and East Main Streets accompanied by the two women. Bachard testified that she was going to the comer to meet a woman named Melissa, whom she suspected was responsible for the hickeys on the defendant\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">While the women were waiting on the street comer, the defendant rode up on a bicycle. The defendant and Bachard began arguing again. The argument escalated and Bachard and the defendant began to exchange blows. While Bachard and the defendant were fighting, a friend of Bachard\u2019s, Carlos Diaz, and his passenger, Brian Puffen, drove by in Diaz\u2019 car. Seeing the altercation, Diaz turned his car around and came back. As Bachard began to walk into the street, signaling to Diaz, the defendant shouted that if she kept on walking he was going to shoot her. Immediately thereafter, four shots were fired. Bachard fell to the ground, bleeding from a bullet wound to her neck. Several police officers responded to the scene almost immediately. By the time the police arrived, however, the defendant had fled on his bicycle. Bachard was taken to a hospital, where she was treated and released nine days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The state charged the defendant with attempted murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 \u00a7 53a-54a and 53a-49,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>(a) (l),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> commission of a class A, B or C felony with a firearm in violation of \u00a7 53-202k<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of \u00a7 29-35 (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6At trial, the defendant alleged that he had been shooting at Diaz in self-defense and struck Bachaxd by mistake. To support his self-defense claim, the defendant presented testimony of his sister, Perez, that after Diaz parked the car he got out and shot at least two times over the hood of the car at the defendant before the defendant returned fire. In addition, the defendant presented expert testimony showing that gunshot residue was found in various locations on the interior of Diaz\u2019 car.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">On March 13, 1996, the jury found the defendant not guilty of the crime of attempted murder, but guilty of the crime of assault in the first degree. The jury also found the defendant guilty of carrying a pistol without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>a permit and commission of a class A, B or C felony with a firearm. The trial court sentenced the defendant to twenty years imprisonment, suspended after fifteen years, and five years probation on the charge of assault in the first degree, five years imprisonment to run consecutively on the charge of commission of a felony with a firearm and five years imprisonment to run concurrently on the charge of carrying a pistol without a permit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly instructed a panel of potential jurors concerning the presumption of innocence. Specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court, by one statement in its preliminary remarks to a panel of potential jurors, undermined the presumption of innocence and violated his constitutional rights to due process of law, to an impartial jury, to present a defense and to confront adverse witnesses.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">In its preliminary remarks, the trial court gave a brief overview of the component parts of the trial, instructed the potential jurors to keep an open mind throughout the trial and attempted to quell any fears they might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>have about being adequate for the task. The trial court also offered a preliminary explanation of the concept of the presumption of innocence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Two members of this panel of venirepersons became jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The defendant failed to raise this claim at trial and now seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or, alternatively, under the plain error doctrine. \u201cA defendant may prevail under the third prong of <em>Golding </em>on a claim of instructional error only if, considering the substance of the charge rather than the form of what was said, it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled. . . . Moreover, this court will reverse a judgment for plain error only in the truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 457, 680 A.2d 147 (1996). We conclude that the defendant cannot prevail under either of these standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">\u201cPreliminary instructions to prospective jurors in a criminal case are not mandatory. . . . When preliminary instructions are given, they do not supersede those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>given after evidence and arguments under our practice.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Figueroa, </em>235 Conn. 145, 184, 665 A.2d 63 (1995). Analogous to those situations where a court attempts to clarify the phrase reasonable doubt, judicial attempts to clarify the meaning of the phrase presumption of innocence by explanation, elaboration or illustration may tend to confuse or mislead; however, such explanations do not necessarily constitute reversible error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 457; <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>supra, 184; cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>DelVecchio, </em>191 Conn. 412, 420, 464 A.2d 813 (1983). The question on appeal is whether the court\u2019s statements correctly conveyed the concept of presumption of innocence to the jury. \u201c \u2018In determining whether preliminary jury instructions require reversal, we must ask whether the jury was fully and properly instructed at the critical time, after all the evidence and after the arguments of counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In its final instructions, the trial court informed the jury that \u201c[i]n this case, as in all criminal cases, the accused is presumed to be innocent until he is proven guilty. That means that at the moment when he was presented here before you for trial, he is free from any bias, prejudice or burden arising from his position as the accused. He was then innocent and he remains innocent until such time as the evidence presented in the ordinary course of this trial, here in this courtroom, satisfies you that he is guilty. \u201d The trial court specifically told the jury, \u201cYou must not consider the information as evidence of guilt or draw any inference of guilt from the fact that the accused was\u2014has been arrested and charged. The arrest is as consistent with innocence as it is with any other concept.\u201d The trial court also instructed the jury that the state has the burden of proving the guilt of the accused and that the accused does not have to prove his innocence. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>explained that \u201c[t]he law presumes a defendant to be innocent of the crime, thus, a defendant\u2014although the accused begins the trial with a clean slate, with no evidence against him, and the law permits nothing but legal evidence presented before the jury to be considered in support of any charge against the accused.\u201d The trial court further instructed that \u201cthe presumption alone\u2014of innocence\u2014alone is sufficient to acquit a defendant unless the jurors are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of his guilt after a careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence in the case.\u201d The trial court then went on to explain the concept of reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Our review of the entire record in this case persuades us that the defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s preliminary instruction that it \u201chas been determined by a magistrate of this court that the crime charged probably was committed and that the accused probably had something to do with it.\u201d The jury was fully and correctly instructed as to the principles of the defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence and the state\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt at final instructions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, the defendant was not deprived of his constitutional right to a fair trial and may not prevail under <em>State v. Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, because he has not demonstrated that an error of constitutional magnitude clearly exists. <em>State v. Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 458; <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 184-85. Similarly, the trial court\u2019s preliminary instructions did not affect the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings and, therefore, did not constitute plain error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>supra, <em>458; State </em>v.Figueroa, supra, 185; <em>State v. Wright, </em>207 Conn. 276, 288-89, 542 A.2d 299 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury concerning the finding of an affirmative fact from its denial by a witness.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant did not object to the instruction at trial, but now seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40; see footnote 9; or, alternatively, under the plain error doctrine. The defendant acknowledges the well-settled rule that a jury is not permitted to infer, from its disbelief of a witness\u2019 testimony, that the opposite is true; <em>State </em>v. <em>Alfonso, </em>195 Conn. 624, 634, 490 A.2d 75 (1985); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>191 Conn. 46, 56, 463 A.2d 578 (1983); <em>Novak </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>178 Conn. 506, 508, 423 A.2d 147 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayell, </em>163 Conn. 419, 426-27, 311 A.2d 60 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>14 Conn. App. 657, 671-72, 544 A.2d 194, cert. denied, 208 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>815, 546 A.2d 283 (1988); yet argues that the rule is too broad and should apply only against the party bearing the burden of proof. Specifically, the defendant argues that the instruction violated his rights to due process of law, to present a defense and to confront adverse witnesses.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The record before us is adequate to review the defendant\u2019s claim. The defendant, however, has failed to meet the second prong of the <em>Golding </em>test because his claim of instructional impropriety is not one of constitutional magnitude. \u201c \u2018Just as every claim of evidentiary error by the trial court is not truly constitutional in nature; see, e.g., <em>[State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 241]; every claim of instructional error is not truly constitutional in nature. . . . Indeed, it would trivialize the constitution to transmute a nonconstitutional claim into a constitutional claim simply because of the label placed on it by a party or because of a strained connection between it and a fundamental constitutional right.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dash, </em>242 Conn. 143, 151-52, 698 A.2d 297 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">It is axiomatic under Connecticut law that while a jury may reject a witness\u2019 testimony, a jury in rejecting such testimony is not entitled to conclude that the opposite is true. <em>State </em>v. <em>Alfonso, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 634; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 56. Because this rule is firmly rooted in Connecticut jurisprudence, we do not find fault with the trial court\u2019s instruction. In the absence of a showing that the instruction was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>likely to be misunderstood by the jurors or that the jury was advised how to decide the case, it strains the meaning of constitutional claims to say that this claimed instructional error is constitutional in nature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>227 Conn. 32, 65, 630 A.2d 990 (1993). Therefore, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s claim because the defendant has failed to allege a claim of constitutional magnitude as required by the second prong of <em>Golding. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 817-18, 709 A.2d 522 (1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>supra, 63-65; <em>State </em>v. <em>Garrett, </em>42 Conn App. 507, 518-19, 681 A.2d 362, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 928, 929, 683 A.2d 398 (1996). Similarly, the trial court\u2019s instruction did not affect the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings and, therefore, did not constitute plain error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b629-9\"> The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly convicted him of commission of a class A, B or C felony with a firearm under General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k. The defendant argues that \u00a7 53-202k constitutes a sentence enhancement provision rather than a separate offense and that he should not have been convicted under this provision. The state conceded that this claim is correct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dash, </em>242 Conn. 143, 146, 698 A.2d 297 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>48 Conn. App. 361, 373, 709 A.2d 43, cert. denied, 245 Conn. 907, 718 A.2d 16 (1998). At oral argument, both parties agreed that the defendant has already been resentenced by the trial court. This issue is moot, and we need not address it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person or causes a suicide by force, duress or deception . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime, he: (1) Intentionally engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be; or (2) intentionally does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b631-9\"><em> </em>General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k provides: \u201cAny person who commits any class A, B or C felony and in the commission of such felony uses, or is armed with and threatens the use of, or displays, or represents by his words or conduct that he possesses any firearm, as defined in section 53a-3, except an assault weapon, as defined in section 53-202a, shall be imprisoned for a term of five years, which shall not be suspended or reduced and shall be in addition and consecutive to any term of imprisonment imposed for conviction of such felony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b631-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall carry any pistol or revolver upon his person, except when such person is within his dwelling house or place of business, without a permit to carry the same issued as provided in section 29-28. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b632-8\"> The trial court subsequently resentenced the defendant; see footnote 1; to twenty years imprisonment suspended after fifteen years and five years probation on the charge of assault in the first degree; this sentence was enhanced by five years imprisonment on the charge of commission of a felony with a firearm, and five years imprisonment to run concurrently on the charge of carrying a pistol without a permit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b632-9\"> The defendant claims a violation of article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, of the constitution of Connecticut with respect to the presumption of innocence.

App. 839, 843 n.5, 647 A.2d 43 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b633-6\"> In explaining the concept of the presumption of innocence, the trial court instructed the panel of potential jurors in relevant part: \u201cNow, the other concepts have to do with your view toward being here this morning. And you heard about the presumption of innocence, correct? You heard that mentioned by Judge Ronan, I presume. And it wasn\u2019t new to you. You\u2019ve heard it before in your life. But now that you\u2019re in this room, you look around the room, you figure out who\u2019s who. I\u2019ve already told you that he\u2019s the state\u2019s attorney. You figured out [that] I\u2019m the judge. Mr. Abbamonte is representing the accused; he\u2019s seated to Mr. Abbamonte\u2019s left. His name is Harry W. Rodriguez. So let\u2019s focus on him, on the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">\u201cThat is a presumption that everybody should maintain in their own mind. It is a requirement under the constitution. This accused and every other person in this country is entitled to it. And it means that the accused is presumed to be innocent and that presumption remains with him throughout the course of the trial. Until such time as the evidence produced in this courtroom, in the orderly process of this trial, satisfies you that he is guilty and no longer entitled to that presumption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">\u201cSo what does it mean to you now? It means the same thing to me. It means that this is a person merely charged with a crime on the say-so of somebody else. [He has] been arrested based on probable cause, the lowest level of proof, and only determined to know that <em>he has been determined by a magistrate of this court that the crime chargedprobably was committed and that the accused probably had something to do with it. </em>But that\u2019s on the say-so of others, you see. And these trials\u2014the trial here in this courtroom is based on the burden of proof beyond all reasonable doubt, a much, much heavier burden. A much stronger picture has to be developed. By who? By others who gave information before who will be brought in here under oath and examined and cross-examined. Much different. Sometimes stories change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">\u201cSo focusing on the accused, is there something bothering you about the presumption? Does he look guilty? Is this something you can deal with? It\u2019s certainly not fair, is it? Must he have done something or he wouldn\u2019t be here? That oftentimes comes across the juror\u2019s mind. But that\u2019s suspicion, isn\u2019t it? Would you want to be treated that way? Convicted by suspicion alone. He\u2019s been accused, an accusation. Is that enough for you? Is that enough for our society? Of course not. What\u2019s wrong with affording him the presumption and waiting to see what the facts are? Because you know nothing about the case. Some of you would say, \u2018Well, judge, you\u2019re being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>awfully presumptuous. You think that I\u2019ve already made up my mind.\u2019 And of course you recognize that would be stupid, because you don\u2019t know anything about the case. Unless you have some private knowledge. And we\u2019ll ferret that out shortly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">\u201cSo those are the things that have to be\u2014you have to be concerned with. That you remove from your mind any kind of suspicion, any basis of accusation; that you take care of any bias you might have, any prejudice you might have. If you can\u2019t do that, then you\u2019re obligated to tell us that. And if you have the ability to tell us that, be sure you have the ability to explain it.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\"> \u201cUnder <em>Golding, </em>a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.

Is it reasonable and logical to draw such an inference? Is it reasonable and logical to draw any inference from which you can determine whether bullets were fired at the car or bullets were fired from within the car.
