The defendant claims that the trial court improperly found that no genuine issues of material fact existed. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">The plaintiff instituted the underlying action to foreclose a lien, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47-258,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>common charges and assessments levied against the defendant. The defendant filed an answer, alleging a special defense of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment alleging that there were no genuine issues of material fact, and supplying the court with a supporting affidavit and memorandum of law. The defendant filed an objection, without supporting affidavits, claiming that the amount due was in dispute. He claimed that the amount due to the plaintiff for assessments and common charges had been tendered to it but not accepted and that, therefore, the only remaining sums allegedly due were for attorney\u2019s fees. The defendant claimed that such fees are not recoverable until a judgment has entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment as to liability on both substantive and procedural grounds. Subsequent to its granting of the motion for summary judgment as to liability, the court granted the plaintiffs motion for judgment of foreclosure by sale finding a debt of $3980.28, \u201cwhich sum includes an attorney\u2019s fee of $3300.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 17-49, formerly \u00a7 384, provides that \u201c[t]he judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Further, Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 17-45, formerly \u00a7 380, provides in relevant part that the party in opposition to the motion for summary judgment \u201cprior to the day the case is set down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>for short calendar shall file opposing affidavits and other . . . documentary evidence. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Once the moving party has presented evidence in support of the motion for summary judgment, the opposing party must present evidence that demonstrates the existence of some disputed factual issue. <em>Scinto </em>v. Stamm, 224 Conn. 524, 533, 620 A.2d 99, cert. denied, 510 U.S. 861, 114 S. Ct. 176, 126 L. Ed. 2d 136 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Goggin, </em>208 Conn. 606, 616, 546 A.2d 250 (1988); <em>Bartha </em>v. <em>Waterbury House Wrecking Co., </em>190 Conn. 8, 11-12, 459 A.2d 115 (1983). \u201cIt is not enough, however, for the opposing party merely to assert the existence of such a disputed issue. Mere assertions of fact . . . are insufficient to establish the existence of a material fact and, therefore, cannot refute evidence properly presented to the court under Practice Book \u00a7 [17-45].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Hartford Hospital, </em>192 Conn. 451, 455, 472 A.2d 1257 (1984). To oppose a motion for summary judgment successfully, the nonmovant must recite specific facts in accordance with Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7\u00a7 17-45 and 17-46, formerly \u00a7\u00a7 380 and 381, which contradict those stated in the movant\u2019s affidavits and documents and show that there is a genuine issue for trial. If he does not so respond, summary judgment shall be entered against him. <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>182 Conn. 34, 38, 438 A.2d 415 (1980); <em>Rusco Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Housing Authority, </em>168 Conn. 1, 5, 357 A.2d 484 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Here, the defendant filed no affidavits but relied on assertions of fact in his brief in opposition to the plaintiffs motion. A trial court may appropriately render summary judgment when the documents submitted demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact remaining between the parties and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 17-49; <em>Yanow </em>v. <em>Teal Industries, Inc., </em>178 Conn. 262, 268, 422 A.2d 311 (1979). Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>the defendant failed to file opposing affidavits, the trial court\u2019s decision could be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">In a memorandum of decision, however, the court addressed the substantive issue raised by the defendant. The defendant claimed that attorney\u2019s fees and costs of litigation are not recoverable as a priority debt. The plaintiff claims that \u00a7 47-258 authorizes as part of its condominium priority lien, the litigation expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, incident to its foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Section 47-258 (g) provides: \u201cA judgment or decree in any action brought under this section shall include costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for the prevailing party.\u201d The defendant does not dispute that this section authorizes the inclusion of these costs and fees as part of plaintiffs judgment but maintains that because \u00a7 47-258 (b) does not specifically include the words \u201ccosts and attorney\u2019s fees\u201d as part of the priority lien, those fees and costs could not be imposed until a judgment was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">This issue was reached and decided in <em>Hudson House Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>223 Conn. 610, 616-17, 611 A.2d 862 (1992), in which our Supreme Court held that \u00a7 47-258 (g) authorizes the inclusion of costs of collection as part of the lien, and that \u00a7 47-258 authorizes the inclusion of attorney\u2019s fees and costs in the sums entitled to priority. A 1991 legislative enactment, Public Acts 1991, No. 91-359, amended \u00a7 47-258 (b) specifically to include the costs of collection and attorney\u2019s fees within the priority. See General Statutes \u00a7 47-258 (b) (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47-258 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) The association has a statutory lien on a unit for any assessment levied against that unit or fines imposed against its unit owner. Unless the declaration otherwise provides, fees, charges, late charges, fines and interest charged pursuant to subdivisions (10), (11) and (12) of subsection (a) of section 47-244 are enforceable as assessments under this section. If an assessment is payable in instalments, the full amount of the assessment is a lien from the time the first instalment thereof becomes due.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-12\">\u201c(b) A lien under this section is prior to all other liens and encumbrances on a unit except (1) liens and encumbrances recorded before the recordation of the declaration and, in a cooperative, liens and encumbrances which the association creates, assumes or takes subject to, (2) a first or second security interest on the unit recorded before the date on which the assessment sought to be enforced became delinquent, or, in a cooperative, a first or second security interest encumbering only the unit owner\u2019s interest and perfected before the date on which the assessment sought to be enforced became delinquent, and (3) liens for real property taxes and other governmental assessments or charges against the unit or cooperative. The lien is also prior to all security interests described in subdivision (2) of this subsection to the extent of (A) an amount equal to the common expense assessments based on the periodic budget adopted by the association pursuant to subsection (a) of section 47-257 which would have become due in the absence of acceleration during the six months immediately preceding institution of an action to enforce either the association\u2019s lien or a security interest described in subdivision (2) of this subsection and (B) the association\u2019s costs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees in enforcing its lien. A lien for any assessment or fine specified in subsection (a) of this section shall have the priority provided for in this subsection in an amount not to exceed the amount specified in subparagraph (A) of this subsection. This subsection does not affect the priority of mechanics\u2019 or materialmen\u2019s liens or the priority of liens for other assessments made by the association.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
