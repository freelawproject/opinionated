He was tried and convicted of both crimes. After an odyssey through the state and federal courts we describe hereafter, he was retried in 1996. He was then convicted of the robbery, but the jury was unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>agree on the murder charge and a mistrial on that count was declared. Defendant was again tried for the murder in 1998 and the jury was again unable to agree resulting in a second mistrial. The judge denied defendant\u2019s ensuing motion for dismissal of the murder indictment. Defendant now appeals from the 1996 robbery conviction and from the 1998 order denying his motion to dismiss the murder indictment. We affirm the judgment of conviction of the robbery, but reverse the order denying the motion to dismiss the murder indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">To say that the procedural history before us is tortuous hardly begins to describe it. In its most briefly stated outline, two indictments were returned in 1977 against defendant Lawrence Simmons and his co-defendants Donald Phillips and David Wilson. The first charged all three of them with the armed murder of Dr. David Doktor, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:113-1 and 2A:151-5, by bludgeoning him to death with a metal pipe. The second charged defendant and Phillips with the robbery of George Marshall, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:141-1. Although the two crimes were committed during the same early morning hours and allegedly within minutes of each other, they nevertheless resulted from two quite separate and distinct episodes. The indictments were, however, jointly tried by a jury in October and November 1977. The State\u2019s main witness was co-defendant David Wilson, who testified under a grant of immunity. Defendant was convicted of all charges against him. He was sentenced on December 21, 1977, to a life term for the murder and to a consecutive term of nine to ten years for the robbery. He has been incarcerated since.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Thirteen years passed before defendant\u2019s direct appeal was heard. The events during the first eleven years of that period are described in all their excruciating detail in the opinion of the Federal District Court granting defendant a conditional writ of habeas corpus. <em>Simmons v. Beyer, </em>689 <em>F.Supp. </em>432 (D.N.J.1988). As best as we can understand what happened, defendant\u2019s trial counsel failed to file a notice of appeal despite defendant\u2019s request that he do so. The Public Defender also failed to file a notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>appeal. Clearly that should not have affected defendant\u2019s right to file the notice of appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>when, three years later, he discovered that the notice had not been filed. <em>See </em>Notice to the Bar, 100 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>Index Page 1208 (1977), relaxing <em>R. </em>2:4-4(a) to permit a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>filing of the notice of appeal if defendant demonstrates that he timely advised either trial counsel or the Public Defender of his desire to appeal. <em>See also State v. Altman, </em>181 <em>N.J.Super. </em>539, 438 A.2d 576 (App.Div.1981), so holding. Since this court routinely follows <em>Altman </em>and relaxes the rule in such circumstances, we are unable to explain what actually happened here. In any event, it appears that when defendant discovered in 1980 that his appeal had not been filed, he sought the aid of the federal court, which denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus since he had not exhausted his state remedies, namely, moving this court for leave to file his notice of appeal <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>The Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the denial and the United States Supreme Court denied defendant\u2019s petition for <em>certiorari. </em>That brings us to June 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Defendant\u2019s next step was the seeking of post-conviction relief in the trial court. Following a hearing, a trial judge, in July 1983, found that defendant had, in fact, made timely request for an appeal but ruled that the trial court was without authority to grant the relief of permitting the filing of a notice of appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>since only this court could grant that relief. Accordingly, in August 1983, defendant made that motion to this court. The prosecutor took no position. Inexplicably and without explanation, this court denied that motion as well as defendant\u2019s ensuing motion for reconsideration. Defendant then filed a petition for certification to the Supreme Court, which, this time, the prosecutor actively opposed. The petition was denied in November 1984. <em>State v. Simmons, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>187, 491 A.2d 690 (1984). In 1986 defendant filed a pro se motion with this court seeking indigency status and, once again, leave to file his notice of appeal <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>The prosecutor filed opposition papers, and we denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Defendant then once more sought the aid of the federal court, leading to the 1988 opinion in <em>Beyer, supra, </em>689 <em>F.Supp. </em>432. Judge Debevoise concluded, based on these events, that defendant had been deprived of his right to effective assistance of counsel as well as his right to appeal and that he was consequently then entitled to the substantive review, by way of direct appeal, of the 1977 judgment of conviction. The problem that emerged, however, was the loss of the transcriber\u2019s notes of the trial in the intervening eleven years. Recognizing that it might be possible, nevertheless, to reconstruct the record for appellate purposes, the court gave the State the option of ensuring defendant\u2019s effective appeal or providing a new trial and, further, directing that if neither was done, the writ would issue unconditionally. That ruling, as we have noted, was in 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Following the federal court ruling, the prosecutor, in compliance therewith, moved this court for leave for defendant to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>and for a remand to the trial court for reconstruction of the record. Those motions were granted. The reconstruction was completed by the trial court and filed with this court in November 1988, and both this court and the Federal District Court denied defendant\u2019s motions challenging the reconstruction. In January 1989 and while the appeal was pending, defendant moved for a limited remand to the trial court in order to seek a new trial based on Wilson\u2019s then recantation of his 1977 trial testimony. We granted the motion and an evidentiary hearing ensued before the trial court, which entered an order denying the new trial motion in April 1989. Defendant then amended his notice of appeal to include a challenge to that order as well. We finally heard the appeal in April 1990, and by our 73-page opinion filed under Docket Number A-6277-87T1 on July 13, 1990, we affirmed the 1977 judgments of conviction. The Supreme Court denied defendant\u2019s petition for certification in October 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">After defendant had thus exhausted his state remedies, he moved once again in the federal court for the reopening of his petition for <em>habeas corpus. </em>The motion was granted, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>was heard, and the writ dismissed. <em>Simmons v. Arvonio, </em>796 <em>F.Supp. 777 </em>(D.N.J.1992). The Third Circuit, however, reversed <em>sub nom. Simmons v. Beyer, </em>44 F.3d 1160 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 <em>U.S. </em>905, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>271, 133 L.Ed.2d 192 (1995). Noting that defendant had asserted a colorable claim that the prosecutor had used race-based peremptory challenges of prospective jurors in the 1977 trial and according defendant the retroactive benefit of <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>79, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), and <em>State v. Gilmore, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>508, 511 A.2d 1150 (1986), the Circuit Court held that the failure of the reconstructed record of the trial to include the <em>voir dire </em>facts and the non-retrievability of that information coupled with the inordinate delays attending final disposition of these charges required the grant of a new trial. Thus, eighteen years after the entry of the judgments of conviction, defendant was finally accorded a right to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">It took another year, however, before that new trial actually took place. First, the State sought a writ of <em>certiorari </em>from the United States Supreme Court, which was denied, and then, pursuant to the Third Circuit reversal, the Federal District Court issued an order vacating its denial of the petition for the writ and ordered defendant either tried or released. Finally, the trial commenced in mid-1996, and defendant was again convicted of the robbery charge and sentenced to a fifteen-year prison term, which he had by then served in full. Although Wilson gave his recanting testimony, the jury was unable to agree on the murder charge, and a mistrial thereof was declared and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">It is now nearly four years later. Insofar as we are able to determine, defendant filed a timely notice of appeal from the robbery conviction. While the appeal was pending, a third trial of the murder charge was scheduled following denial of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment. Commencement of trial was, however, delayed until October 1998 because of substitutions of counsel for defendant and intervening federal proceedings by which defendant sought unsuccessfully to have the murder indictment dismissed. In any event, at this third trial of the murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>indictment, now twenty-one years after the crime, Wilson recanted his recantation. Nevertheless, the jury was still unable to agree, and a second mistrial was declared. Defendant then moved the trial court for dismissal of the murder indictment. That motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">At this point considerable confusion developed resulting, at least in part, from defendant\u2019s efforts to obtain recourse simultaneously from the state court and the federal court. To begin with, he moved in this court for an order dismissing the murder indictment entered after the 1998 mistrial. Although we denied the motion, we entered an order permitting the notice of appeal from the 1996 robbery conviction to be amended to include a challenge to the 1998 order denying the motion to dismiss the indictment. At the same time, defendant sought relief in the federal court from the same 1998 order, and we have been advised that defendant\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus is now pending in the Third Circuit. Unfortunately, however, and apparently as the result of some miscommunication between defendant\u2019s counsel and the Clerk\u2019s office, defendant did not file a supplementary brief with this court addressing the 1998 order. At the time of oral argument, therefore, we were unaware that a second mistrial had taken place and the briefs did not address the import of the 1998 mistrial. We cannot, however, ignore the fact of the 1998 mistrial because of the obvious effect it has on defendant\u2019s right to a dismissal of the murder indictment. A conviction followed by two hung juries is a very different proposition from a conviction followed by only one. The parties were thus given the opportunity to file supplementary briefs addressing the State\u2019s right to try defendant on the murder charge for a fourth time under all the circumstances we have here recited.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">As the matter now stands then, what is presently before us is, first, the question of whether the State may be permitted to retry defendant a fourth time for the murder, and second, whether the robbery conviction resulting from the 1996 trial is sustainable. We conclude that while the robbery conviction was not infected by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>any reversible error, the murder indictment must now be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">We address first the murder indictment. The standards and considerations informing the granting of a motion to dismiss an indictment following multiple hung juries are articulated by <em>State v. Abbati, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>418, 435, 493 A.2d 513 (1985), in which the Court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">We hold that a trial court may dismiss an indictment with prejudice after successive juries have failed to agree on a verdict when it determines that the chance of the State\u2019s obtaining a conviction upon further retrial is highly unlikely. The trial court must carefully and expressly consider the following factors, which shall govern its ultimate decision whether to dismiss the indictment: (1) the number of prior mistrials and the outcome of the juries\u2019 deliberations, so far as is known; (2) the character of prior trials in terms of length, complexity, and similarity of evidence presented; (3) the likelihood of any substantial difference in a subsequent trial, if allowed; (4) the trial court\u2019s own evaluation of the relative strength of each party\u2019s case; and (5) the professional conduct and diligence of respective counsel, particularly of the prosecuting attorney. The court must also give due weight to the prosecutor\u2019s decision to reprosecute, assessing the reasons for that decision, such as the gravity of the criminal charges and the public\u2019s concern in the effective and definitive conclusion of criminal prosecutions. Conversely, the court should accord careful consideration to the status of the individual defendant and the impact of a retrial upon the defendant in terms of untoward hardship and unfairness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Unfortunately, when the motion to dismiss the indictment after the second mistrial was argued, neither counsel referred explicitly to <em>Abbati </em>and neither did the trial judge although he referred at least tangentially to some of the <em>Abbati </em>factors. This is what he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">[There] has been some difference in terms of the trial in 1996, and the instant matter [the 1998 trial]. Certainly there was additional material in evidence that was adduced during the trial of 1977. In that matter many individuals who testified are now unavailable as a result of death or other incapacity, but the fact is that the State apparently is representing that it has chosen to retry this defendant and I believe under the law should have that opportunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\">I think the State is correct, there should be some finality, some closure as far as defendant is concerned, the State is concerned and by that I mean the victim or victims in this particular case. I\u2019m of the opinion that the defendant has presented nothing on the record which would warrant this Court [to] grant him the relief which he\u2019s seeking, namely, a dismissal of the indictment and for that motion, the motion for a dismissal is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number> We agree with the State that ordinarily the failure of the trial judge to consider and weigh the <em>Abbati </em>factors would require a remand to the trial judge for that purpose. Indeed, <em>Abbati </em>itself so held. <em>Abbati supra, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>at 436-437, 493 A.2d 513. We do not regard this case, however, as ordinary. We are persuaded that the inordinate length of time that has passed since the first trial, defendant\u2019s incarceration for the last twenty-three years, his eligibility for parole long since had the original conviction been affirmed,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, most significantly, the clarity with which the issue presents itself, impel us to exercise our original jurisdiction pursuant to <em>R. </em>2:10-5 in the interests of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The conceptual basis of <em>Abbati </em>is fundamental fairness and substantial justice. <em>Id. </em>at 427, 430, 493 A.2d 513. The core of the <em>Abbati </em>rationale in our view is that when the prosecution, resorting substantially to the same evidence, fails repeatedly to persuade all members of the jury of defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, it cannot keep trying the same case again and again. As Justice Handler summarized it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">The anxiety, vexation, embarrassment, and expense to the defendant of continual reprosecution where no new evidence exists is a proper subject for the application of traditional notions of fundamental fairness and substantial justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">[Id. at 430, 493 A.2d 513.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Thus the basic prosecutorial abuse the Court was addressing in <em>Abbati </em>was the repeated effort to obtain a conviction after multiple juries, presented with the same proofs, are unable to reach a verdict. In short, <em>Abbati </em>permits the trial court to tell the prosecutor that those proofs, after repeated testing in the crucible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>of jury deliberations, are not likely ever to result in a conviction, and he must, accordingly, stop trying to obtain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">We think it plain that since the prosecutor has twice, once nineteen years after the crime and once twenty years after the crime, failed to obtain a conviction, there is little likelihood that he will on a third attempt. We note first, as we have pointed out, that in 1977 the State\u2019s case relied primarily on co-defendant Wilson\u2019s testimony. In 1996 the jury was not persuaded of defendant\u2019s guilt after considering Wilson\u2019s recantation testimony, and in 1998, a second jury was not persuaded after considering Wilson\u2019s recantation of his recantation. Moreover, critical witnesses who testified at the 1977 trial were unavailable in 1996 and 1998, and will continue to be unavailable. One of the detectives who had originally taken Wilson\u2019s statement has died. Another police officer involved in the original investigation is unavailable because of a heart condition. A State\u2019s forensic witness, Dr. Counbis is deceased. The allegedly blood-free clothes defendant was wearing on the night of the murder are missing. There are no transcripts of the 1977 trial for use either as substantive evidence or impeachment. And although we asked the State to submit a supplementary brief on the <em>Abbati </em>issue, it has not suggested to us any way in which the proofs at yet a third retrial would be materially different. In sum, we are satisfied that the likelihood of a conviction following a fair retrial is altogether too remote to warrant yet another prosecution almost a quarter of a century after the crime was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">We consider <em>seriatim </em>the remaining <em>Abbati </em>factors. With respect to the first factor, there have already been two hung juries. The State represents to us that the jury vote in both was the same, namely, eight to convict and four to acquit. Clearly, then, the State did no better in juror persuasion the second time. With respect to the second factor, the quality and character of the trials, all three were lengthy and complex, except the proofs, because of the problems due to the delay of nineteen years between the first and second trials, were substantially abbreviat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>ed, the loss of proofs apparently prejudicing both sides. We have already discussed the third factor, namely, the likelihood of prosecutorial success in another trial. As to the fourth factor, the trial court made no evaluation of the relative strength of each party\u2019s case, but we think it plain from what we have already said, that the State\u2019s case gets no better. The fifth factor is professional conduct and diligence. We need only say that from the date of the 1977 conviction, the pursuit of the right to appeal, the appeal process, and the scheduling of the two retrials, were all inordinately delayed, and very little of that delay can be laid at defendant\u2019s door even though much of it was apparently contributed to by the public defender as well as the prosecutor and indeed the judicial process itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">We turn then to Abbati\u2019s unenumerated factors. We appreciate the gravity of the offense. This was a brutal fatal beating of an elderly doctor on his way to render emergency assistance at the hospital. The crime was heinous and unforgivable, and the ensuing community outrage as well as the prosecutor\u2019s desire to bring the murderer to justice were entirely justified. But the prosecutor has not been able to do so despite the original overturned conviction, and the fact remains that defendant has already been incarcerated for twenty-three years, a period of time approximating the time he would have served if his guilt had been proven. If he is innocent, this protracted incarceration would be tragic and unjust in the extreme. If he is guilty, he can be regarded as having served his time. Another trial in all these circumstances is not likely to serve the interests of justice. It would be much more likely to result in an unjustifiable impact upon defendant, more pain to all those who were then involved, and considerable expense and burden to the State. The prosecutor does not want defendant to go free while the question of his guilt or innocence remains unresolved. We appreciate and sympathize with that motive. It is simply not enough, however, to justify another trial under <em>Abbati </em>principles in the undisputed circumstances here.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Although we need not consider defendant\u2019s other objections to the denial of his motion to dismiss the murder indictment, he has raised a number of challenges to the 1996 robbery conviction. They are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">I. THE CONVICTION UNDER INDICTMENT 970-77 MUST BE REVERSED AND BOTH INDICTMENTS 970-77 and 737-778 MUST BE DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE AND THE STATE BARRED FROM RETRYING DEFENDANT AS THE STATE\u2019S CONDUCT THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF THIS CASE SHOCKS ALL PRINCIPLES OF FAIRNESS, DUE PROCESS AND JUSTICE; DEFENDANT\u2019S FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS RIGHTS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED AND WILL BE VIOLATED FURTHER IF HE IS TRIED AGAIN.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">II.

NUMEROUS LEGAL ERRORS OCCURRED WHICH DEPRIVED DEFENDANT OF HIS FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT DUE PROCESS RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL, MANDATING A REVERSAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">We have considered each of these issues insofar as they relate to the 1996 robbery conviction in the light of the record, the applicable law, and the arguments of counsel, and we are satisfied that they are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">The judgment of conviction for robbery is affirmed. We remand to the trial court for entry of an order dismissing the indictment for murder.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-9\"> As we have noted this was a Title 2A murder conviction on which a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed. With commutation time, defendant could have been parole eligible in fourteen years. <em>See State v. Maxey, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>62, 66, 198 A.2d 768 (1964), so construing repealed <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.11. Thus, even with the nine to ten-year consecutive robbery sentence, defendant could have been parole eligible long before now since repealed <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.10 provided for parole eligibility on a fixed term after service of one-third of the sentence less commutation time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
