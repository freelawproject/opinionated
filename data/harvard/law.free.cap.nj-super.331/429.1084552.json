On appeal to this court, his conviction and sentence were affirmed in a written opinion dated August 28,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-15\">Thereafter, defendant filed a motion seeking post-conviction relief based primarily on a claim of inadequate representation by counsel. The motion was denied, and defendant now appeals that denial to this court, making the following claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-16\">POINT i</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-17\">BECAUSE DEFENDANT WAS DENIED THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OP TRIAL COUNSEL, HIS PETITION FOR POST-CONVICTION RELIEF SHOULD HAVE BEEN GRANTED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>A) FAILURE OF TRIAL COUNSEL TO PRESENT AN INTOXICATION DEFENSE DEPRIVED DEFENDANT OF THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF TRIAL COUNSEL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">B) TRIAL COUNSEL RENDERED INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE WHEN HE FAILED TO MOVE TO SEVER THE TRIAL OF COUNT FOUR, CRIMINAL CONTEMPT, FROM THE OTHER COUNTS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">C) TRIAL COUNSEL WAS INEFFECTIVE WHEN HE FAILED TO PRESENT ANY DEFENSE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">D) TRIAL COUNSEL WAS INEFFECTIVE WHEN HE FAILED TO INVESTIGATE EXCULPATORY INFORMATION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-8\">E) TRIAL COUNSEL AND APPELLATE COUNSEL RENDERED INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE BY FAILING RESPECTIVELY TO OBJECT TO THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S INADEQUATE CHARGE ON \u201cANYTHING OF VALUE\u201d AND RAISE THE ISSUE ON APPEAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">After hearing defendant\u2019s motion, Judge McNeill delivered a formal written opinion denying the requested relief. We agree with the analysis, findings and conclusions set out in that well reasoned opinion, and thus we affirm, substantially for the reasons set out in Judge McNeill\u2019s written opinion dated December 18, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
