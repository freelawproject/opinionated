The named defendants were Margaret Murray, the Director of the Division, and Michele K. Guhl, the Commissioner of the Department of Human Services. Appellants alleged that they had filed administrative appeals with the Division challenging the Medicaid reimbursement rates established in January 1996, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>October 1996, January 1997 and January 1998, but that the Division had \u201ccontinually and consistently failed to make any determination or issue any decision with respect to any of the ... rate appeals.\u201d Appellants sought an order directing the Division to decide all their pending rate appeals within thirty days. Appellants also sought an order directing the Division to decide any future rate appeals within 120 days. In addition, appellants sought an order requiring \u201cdefendants to pay ... all costs and fees, including attorneys fees, incurred in prosecuting this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Appellants\u2019 claims were based on principles of state administrative law as well as Title XIX of the Federal Social Security Act, commonly known as the Medicaid Act, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1396-1396v, and the regulations adopted thereunder. In addition, appellants contended that the Division\u2019s failure to promptly decide their Medicaid rate appeals violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Appellants asserted that their federal claims were maintainable under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Respondents filed a motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s complaint or, in the alternative, to transfer the case to this court. On May 13, 1999, the Law Division transferred the case, concluding that this court has exclusive jurisdiction because appellants seek review of the inaction of a state administrative agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">On June 29, 1999, appellants filed a motion for the summary entry of an order compelling the Division to immediately decide their pending Medicaid rate appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">On July 9, 1999, while appellants\u2019 motion was pending, the Division issued final decisions in all of appellants\u2019 pending Medicaid rate appeals except for four filed by Deborah Heart and Lung Center.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Twenty-nine of these decisions consisted of identical form letters that denied the hospitals\u2019 Medicaid rate appeals on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the ground that the \u201chospital did not sustain a marginal loss in providing inpatient services to Medicaid beneficiaries at the rates under appeal.\u201d The other two were form letters that dismissed the hospitals\u2019 rate appeals on the ground that they had been filed beyond the twenty-day period allowed under <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-9.1(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Following these decisions, respondents filed a motion to dismiss this appeal on the ground that appellants\u2019 claim that the Division had failed to decide their rate appeals within a reasonable period of time was moot because the Division had issued decisions. Appellants opposed the motion on the ground that their claims were not limited to a demand for issuance of decisions in the pending rate appeals. We denied respondents\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Appellants now ask this court to grant declaratory and injunctive relief that would require the Division to decide future Medicaid rate appeals in a timely manner. Specifically, appellants seek an order that would require the Division \u201cto issue written determinations of hospitals\u2019 rate appeals within 120 days.\u201d Appellants also seek a determination that the decisions issued by the Division on July 9, 1999 were \u201cincomplete\u201d and an order directing the Division to issue \u201ccomplete\u201d decisions in their rate appeals. In addition, appellants seek an award of attorney\u2019s fees under 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">We conclude that the Division has an obligation to decide Medicaid rate appeals within a reasonable period of time, and that the Division failed to satisfy that obligation in processing the appeals that precipitated this action. However, neither federal nor state law obligates the Division to decide Medicaid rate appeals within 120 days or any other fixed time period, and we do not believe it would be appropriate for this court to impose such an obligation. Therefore, we deny appellants\u2019 request for injunctive relief compelling the Division to decide future Medicaid rate appeals within a specified time period. We also reject appellants\u2019 demand for a declaration that the decisions in the rate appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>issued on July 9, 1999, are \u201cincomplete.\u201d We reject appellants\u2019 claim for attorney\u2019s fees under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Preliminarily, we note that the Law Division properly transferred the case to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\"><em>Rules </em>2:2-3(a)(2) and 2:2-4 \u201ccontemplate[ ] that \u2018every proceeding to review the action or inaction of a <em>state </em>administrative agency [shall] be by appeal to the Appellate Division.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pascucci v. Vagott, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>40, 52, 362 A.2d 566 (1976) (quoting <em>Central R.R. v. Neeld, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>172, 185, 139 A.2d 110, <em>cert. denied, </em>357 <em>U.S. </em>928, 78 <em>S.Ct. </em>1373, 2 L.Ed.2d 1371 (1958)). \u201cThe term \u2018action,\u2019 found in <em>[Rules </em>2:2-3(a) and 2:2-4], includes inaction.\u201d <em>Mathews v. Finley, </em>46 <em>N.J.Super. </em>175, 177, 134 A.2d 441 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>283, 135 A.2d 590 (1957). Therefore, the Appellate Division has exclusive jurisdiction to consider a claim of state administrative agency inaction. <em>Pascucci v. Vagott, supra, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>at 52, 362 A.2d 566; <em>Johnson v. New Jersey State Parole Bd., </em>131 <em>N.J.Super. </em>513, 517-21, 330 A.2d 616 (App.Div.1974), <em>certif. denied, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>94, 335 A.2d 47 (1975); <em>see also Toll Bros., Inc. v. State of New Jersey, Dept. of Envtl. Protection, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>519, 525-26 n. 3, 577 A.2d 845 (App.Div.1990); <em>Equitable Life Mortgage &amp; Realty Investors v. New Jersey Div. of Taxation, </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>232, 237-38, 376 A.2d 966 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>535, 384 A.2d 514 (1977); <em>but cf. Township of Montclair v. Hughey, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>441, 446-48, 537 A.2d 692 (App.Div.1987).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If our determination of such a claim requires the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>development of a factual record, \u201cwe can remand to the agency for a statement of reasons, for further action by the agency, or can permit the Law Division to create a record and make fact-finding.\u201d <em>Trantino v. New Jersey State Parole Bd. </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437, 460, 687 A.2d 274 (App.Div.1997), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>19, 711 A.2d 260 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Accordingly, under our appellate rules, the appropriate procedural route for a party claiming to be adversely affected by the inaction of a state administrative agency is to file a notice of appeal and motion for summary disposition accompanied by a supporting brief, certification and other relevant factual materials. The agency\u2019s response to such a motion affords this court an opportunity to determine whether there is any dispute concerning the factual allegations upon which an inaction claim is grounded. If there is no dispute, this court can proceed to a prompt disposition of the claim. If there is a dispute, the matter can be remanded to the agency, an Administrative Law Judge or the Law Division to develop a record and make appropriate factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">In. this case, appellants\u2019 motion for the summary entry of an order compelling the Division to immediately decide their pending Medicaid rate appeals was mooted when the Division decided those appeals while the motion was still pending. Insofar as the certifications submitted in connection with that motion relate to appellants\u2019 other claims, the parties consented to supplementation of the record to include their respective certifications. Moreover, we are satisfied from our review of the certifications that there is no dispute concerning any factual allegations material to a disposition of appellants\u2019 remaining claims. Therefore, this appeal is ripe for a final decision without the need for a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Respondents renew their argument that this appeal should be dismissed as moot because the Division has now rendered decisions in the rate appeals that appellants sought to compel the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Division to decide. Appellants respond that we have already rejected this argument by denying respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Because our order denying respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss was interlocutory, it is subject to reconsideration. <em>See State v. Reldan, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>187, 205, 495 A.2d 76 (1985); <em>Johnson v. Cyklop Strapping Corp., </em>220 <em>N.J.Super. </em>250, 257-64, 531 A.2d 1078 (App.Div.1987), <em>certif. denied, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>196, 540 A.2d 189 (1988). However, we remain satisfied that this appeal is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Although the Division\u2019s failure to issue timely decisions 'in appellants\u2019 then pending Medicaid rate appeals precipitated this action, appellants sought not only an order compelling the Division to decide the pending appeals within thirty days, but also a directive that the Division decide any future Medicaid rate appeal within 120 days. In addition, after the Division decided the pending rate appeals, appellants asserted a claim that those decisions were \u201cincomplete\u201d and sought an order directing the Division to issue \u201ccomplete\u201d decisions. Appellants also seek an award of attorney\u2019s fees. These claims were not mooted by the issuance of decisions in the rate appeals that were pending when the action was initiated, <em>cf. Galloway Township Bd. of Educ. v. Galloway Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>25, 37-47, 393 A.2d 218 (1978), and must now be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Appellants argue that the Division\u2019s failure to issue timely decisions in their Medicaid rate appeals violated the statutes and regulatory provisions governing the Medicaid program, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the State law requirement of fundamental fairness in the administrative process. To prevent such delay in future Medicaid rate appeals, appellants seek an order directing the Division to decide future Medicaid rate appeals within 120 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Preliminarily, it is appropriate to describe briefly the regulatory framework under which Medicaid rate appeals are brought before the Division. The Medicaid program is a joint federal-state program established by Title XIX of the Social Security Act to provide medical care for indigent, disabled and elderly persons. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396. Although states are not required to participate, a state that chooses to participate must operate its program in compliance with the federal statute and regulations. <em>Harris v. McRae, </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>297, 301, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2671, 2680, 65 L.Ed.2d 784, 794 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The Division is the state agency responsible for administering the New Jersey Medicaid program. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-4, 5. Under the present regulatory system, the Division issues an individual rate schedule at least once a year to each hospital participating in the Medicaid program. <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:52-5.1 to 5.17. If a hospital disputes its rate schedule, it may file an appeal with the Division. <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:52-9.1. Such an appeal may involve a claim either that the Division has made calculation errors or that the rates do not provide adequate compensation for the hospital\u2019s costs in caring for Medicaid recipients. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-9.1(a),(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Appellants\u2019 rate appeals all involved claims that the Medicaid reimbursement rates established by the Division did not provide the hospitals with adequate compensation for the care of Medicaid recipients. Such an appeal must be filed within twenty days after publication of the rates, and the documentation supporting the appeal must be filed within an additional sixty-day period. <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:52-9.1(b)(l). After the Division reviews the hospital\u2019s submission, it must issue a written decision regarding the hospital\u2019s rate appeal. If a hospital disagrees with the Division\u2019s decision, it may request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, whose initial decision is then adopted, modified or rejected by the Director of the Division. <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:52-9.1(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">In January 1996, October 1996, January 1997 and January 1998, the Division issued rate schedules to all New Jersey hospitals then participating in the Medicaid program. On each occasion, appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>lants filed administrative appeals alleging that their reimbursement rates were inadequate. When appellants filed this action in February 1999, the Division had not decided any of appellants\u2019 rate appeals, even though some of them had been pending for a full three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">It is firmly established in this State that administrative agencies\u2019 procedures are subject to judicial review and supervision to assure fairness in the administrative process. <em>See, e.g., In re Arndt, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>432, 436, 341 A.2d 596 (1975); <em>In re Senior Appeals Examiners, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>356, 363, 290 A.2d 129 (1972). As Justice Jacobs observed in <em>Monks v. New Jersey State Parole Bd., </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>238, 248-49, 277 A.2d 193 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">Our Judicial system has historically been vested with the comprehensive prerogative writ jurisdiction which it inherited from the King\u2019s Bench; that jurisdiction has been frequently exercised in the supervision of inferior governmental tribunals ineluding administrative agencies.... When our 1947 Constitution was prepared, pains were taken to insure not only that the court\u2019s prerogative writ jurisdiction would remain intact, but also that the manner of its exercise would be greatly simplified ([N.J. Const.] art. VI, sec. 5, II4). The implementing court rules now provide an easy mode of review designed to insure procedural fairness in the administrative process and to curb administrative abuses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Furthermore, our courts have held that undue delay in the administrative process may result in a denial of \u201cfundamental procedural fairness.\u201d <em>Arndt, supra, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>at 436, 341 A.2d 596; <em>see also Johnson v. New Jersey State Parole Bd., supra, </em>131 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 517-21, 330 A.2d 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">In <em>Arndt, </em>the Court observed that a delay of nearly three years between a motorist\u2019s arrest on suspicion of driving while under the influence of alcohol and the Division of Motor Vehicle\u2019s final decision suspending his license for refusing to submit to a breathalyzer test \u201cevincefd] an entire lack of that acute appreciation of justice which should characterize a tribunal charged with [such a] delicate and important duty.\u201d 67 <em>N.J. </em>at 437, 341 A.2d 596 (quoting <em>Smith v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., </em>270 <em>U.S. </em>587, 591, 46 <em>S.Ct. </em>408, 409, 70 <em>L.Ed </em>747, 749 (1926)). The Court concluded that because the suspension proceedings had not been conducted \u201cwithin a reasonable time and ... the proceedings as a whole were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>conducted with seriously unfair disregard of [the motorist\u2019s] rights, ... the order of suspension should be vacated.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The Division\u2019s delay in issuing decisions regarding appellant\u2019s Medicaid rate appeals was as clearly unjustifiable as the administrative delay that the Court found to violate \u201cfundamental procedural fairness\u201d in <em>Arndt. Id. </em>at 436, 341 A.2d 596. Appellant hospitals are quasi-public entities that are entitled to a timely determination of any claim that they are not being adequately compensated for the care of Medicaid recipients.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The Division\u2019s only explanation for its long delay in deciding appellants\u2019 rate appeals was presented through the certification of its \u201cAdministrator of Provider Rate Setting,\u201d which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">14. The typical packet received from a hospital requesting a rate appeal contains documentation between 3 inches and 12 inches thick____ Each of these packets must be individually reviewed and considered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-10\">15. The first step in the review process is to determine whether the hospital has submitted documentation in support of each of the three categories. If the hospital has not submitted the required information, the rate appeal is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-11\">16. If the hospital has submitted documentation in support of each category, the documents are examined closely and the proposed calculations are considered. In addition, based upon the documentation submitted, in some instances [the Division] creates its own new calculations and/or requests additional information from the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-12\">17. There are only 2 people, including myself, within my department capable of performing this intensive review and this is not our only job function.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-13\">22. A strict 120 day deadline is not feasible given the amount of documentation submitted, that all hospitals submit their documentation on approximately the same day, the intensive examination of those documents and the complex 'calculations involved in determining rate appeals, and the need, in some cases, for obtaining further documentation from the hospital.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-14\">If the Division had received an unexpectedly large number of rate appeals in a particular year, which created a backlog that prevented every appeal from being decided in a timely manner, the Division\u2019s explanation might provide a reasonable excuse for some delay in the administrative process. However, the record indicates that the Division has received approximately the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>number of appeals each time it has established new rates,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that it did not decide any hospital rate appeals between February 16,1996 and July 9,1999. Furthermore, when the Division finally did take action, apparently under the pressure of this litigation, it issued decisions on the same day in all seventy-four of the pending rate appeals that had been filed by hospitals between January 26, 1996 and January 26,1998. The simultaneous issuance of so many decisions indicates that the Division has the capacity to decide a substantial number of rate appeals within a short period of time. Moreover, two of the Division\u2019s decisions simply dismissed appeals that hospitals had filed three years earlier on the ground that the appeals were untimely, even though such a determination could have been made in just a few minutes, without undertaking the \u201cintensive examination of documents\u201d or \u201ccomplex calculations\u201d that the Division claims are required to decide a Medicaid rate appeal. Therefore, the Division\u2019s failure to decide even those rate appeals that it eventually concluded had been filed out-of-time provides added support for our conclusion that the agency violated its statutory responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Nevertheless, we find no basis for requiring the Divisi\u00f3n to decide Medicaid rate appeals within 120 days or any other fixed time period. When the Legislature has concluded that an agency should be required to take action within a fixed time period, it has incorporated a specific provision in the applicable legislation establishing a deadline for agency action. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(e) (Administrative Procedure Act); <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:55D-73 (Municipal Land Use Law). The Medicaid Act does not contain a comparable provision. Although the federal regulations that govern the Medicaid program require \u201cprompt administrative review\u201d of a rate appeal, 42 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 447.253(e), neither the federal Medicaid statute nor the implementing regulations require a state Medicaid agency to issue a decision within a fixed period of time. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>In the absence of any federal mandate or state legislative directive that the Division issue its decision in a rate appeal within a specific time, we do not believe it would be appropriate to impose such a requirement by judicial fiat. Instead, we limit the relief in this case to a declaration that the Division has an obligation to decide Medicaid rate appeals within a reasonable period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The Division suggested at oral argument that, except in extraordinary circumstances, it should be able to decide a Medicaid rate appeal within six months after a hospital submits the documentation supporting its appeal. We assume the Division will undertake to decide future Medicaid rate appeals within this time period, and that if any individual appeal cannot be decided within six months, the Division will notify the hospital of the reason for the delay and the additional time it anticipates will be required to complete its review and issue a decision. If the Division fails to issue a decision within a reasonable period of time, a hospital may seek appropriate relief from this court under the procedures described in section I of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Appellants also seek a declaration that the Division\u2019s decisions in the rate appeals issued on July 9, 1999 are \u201cincomplete\u201d and a direction to the agency to issue \u201ccomplete\u201d decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayx\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-9.1(b)(2) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">The Division will not approve an increase in a hospital\u2019s rates unless the hospital demonstrates that it would sustain a marginal loss in providing inpatient services to Medicaid recipients at the rates under appeal even if it were an economically and efficiently operated hospital____ Any hospital seeking a rate increase must demonstrate the cost it must incur in providing services to Medicaid beneficiaries and the extent to which it has taken all reasonable steps to contain or reduce the costs of providing inpatient hospital services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">In denying appellants\u2019 rate appeals, except for the two that were dismissed as untimely, the Division stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-11\">Because [the Division] determined that your hospital did not sustain a marginal loss for the rate period under appeal, it did not address the issues of whether the hospital was efficiently or economically operated or whether it had taken reasonable steps to reduce or contain its costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Appellants contend that by the terms of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-9.1(b)(2), the Division must make four separate determinations in deciding a rate appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">(1) the Division must first determine whether the hospital is efficiently operated; if not,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">(2) the Division must actjust for efficiency in determining whether the hospital would suffer a marginal loss;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">(3) the Division must determine if the hospital has demonstrated the cost it must incur in providing services to Medicaid beneficiaries; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">(4) the Division must determine if the hospital has taken all reasonable <em>steps </em>to contain or reduce that cost of providing inpatient services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Appellants contend that because the Division only decided that they did not suffer marginal losses for the rate periods in question, the Division created the potential for \u201cpiecemeal decision-making,\u201d which could result in additional delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">However, there is no statute or administrative regulation that requires the Division to consider every issue that may be pertinent to a rate appeal even if it concludes that a hospital\u2019s failure to satisfy one requirement of the regulation is dispositive of the appeal. Moreover, it is not uncommon for an administrative agency or a court to pass upon only those issues that need to be addressed in order to reach a final decision in a matter. For example, a court may grant summary judgment dismissing a complaint based upon a single affirmative defense, without considering other possible grounds for dismissal. Although this form of disposition may result in additional litigation if an appellate court concludes that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on that ground, this does not mean that a trial court is required to consider not only the defense that it finds to be dispositive of the case, but also all other possible defenses simply to avoid the possibility of a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">The same principle applies to administrative agency adjudication. Although an agency may decide in its discretion to consider all issues presented in an administrative proceeding, in order to assure that a hearing will produce a final decision, it is not required to do so. Consequently, the Division\u2019s decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>consider only a single issue, which the Division found to be dispositive of appellants\u2019 rate appeals, did not violate any of the statutory or regulatory provisions governing the Medicaid program or constitute an abuse of discretion. Any alleged error in those decisions is not properly before us in this appeal, but should instead be raised within the framework of appellants\u2019 pending administrative appeals from those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Finally, we consider appellants\u2019 attorney\u2019s fee claim. This claim is based on 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1988, which provides that \u201c[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of section[ ] ... 1983 ..., the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.\u201d Section 1983 (42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1983) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">Every person who, under color of any statute, ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any ... person ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Although our decision rests solely on state grounds, this does not foreclose appellants from seeking an award of attorney\u2019s fees under 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1988, because a party who prevails solely on state grounds, without the court reaching its federal claims, may be entitled to such fees. <em>See Maher v. Gagne, </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>122, 132-33, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2570, 2576-77, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>653, 663 (1980); <em>Williams v. Hanover Housing Auth., </em>113 F.3d 1294, 1297-99 (1st Cir.1997); <em>see also Urban League of Greater New Brunswick v. Mayor &amp; Council of Carteret, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>536, 542-46, 559 A.2d 1369 (1989). Attorney\u2019s fees are recoverable in a \u00a7 1983 action if the plaintiffs prevail on a state law issue arising from the same nucleus of common facts as the federal claims, provided the federal claims are substantial enough to support federal jurisdiction. <em>Maher v. Gagne, supra, </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>at 133 n. 15, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2576, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 663; <em>see Williams v. Hanover Housing Auth., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number><em>supra, </em>113 F.3d at 1298. A federal claim is considered insubstantial only if it is obviously without merit or its unsoundness \u201cso clearly results from the previous decisions of this court as to foreclose the subject and leave no room <em>for </em>the inference that the question sought to be raised can be the subject of controversy.\u201d <em>Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 <em>U.S. </em>528, 537-38, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>1372, 1379, 39 L.Ed.2d 577, 587-88 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Appellants asserted two federal claims. First, appellants claimed that the Division\u2019s delays in deciding their rate appeals violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In support of this claim, appellants relied solely upon four cases that involved administrative delays in processing claims for governmental benefits: <em>Fusari v. Steinberg, </em>419 <em>U.S. </em>379, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>533, 42 L.Ed.2d 521 (1975) (unemployment compensation); <em>Perez v. Lavine, </em>378 <em>F.Supp. </em>1390 (S.D.N.Y.1974) (welfare); <em>Nelson v. Sugarman, </em>361 <em>F.Supp. </em>1132 (S.D.N.Y.1972) (same); <em>Viglietta v. Blum, </em>108 <em>Misc.2d </em>516, <em>437 N.Y.S.2d </em>625 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1981) (medical assistance). However, this case does not involve an individual\u2019s claim for governmental benefits but rather a determination of the reimbursement rates to be paid to providers of government funded services. In determining whether a party has presented a viable procedural due process claim, two fundamental considerations are the nature of the private interest involved and the risk that the challenged administrative practice will result in a deprivation of that interest. <em>See Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 <em>U.S. </em>319, 339-43, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>893, 905-07, 47 L.Ed.2d 18, 36-38 (1976). A Medicaid provider\u2019s interest in a prompt determination of a dispute over the level of its reimbursement rates is not at all comparable to an individual\u2019s need for a speedy determination of his or her entitlement to welfare benefits or other government assistance necessary to provide food, shelter and other essentials of life, such as was involved in the cases upon which appellants rely. <em>Compare Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>254, 260-66, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1011, 1016-20, 25 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 287, 295-98 (1970) <em>with Ritter v. Cohen, </em>797 <em>F.2d </em>119, 124 (3d Cir.1986), <em>and Cassim v. Bowen, </em>824 <em>F.</em>2d 791, 797-98 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Furthermore, appellants had a readily available remedy to prevent undue delay in the issuance of decisions in their rate appeals. As discussed in section I of this opinion, appellants could have filed a notice of appeal and motion for summary disposition to compel the Division to decide their appeals. The availability of such an expeditious judicial remedy may negate any claim that a party has been deprived of a constitutionally protected interest as a result of agency inaction. <em>See Anastasio v. Planning Bd. of Township of West Orange, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>499, 519-22, 507 A.2d 1194 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>46, 526 A.2d 136 (1986); <em>see also Rivkin v. Dover Township Rent Leveling Bd., </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>352, 378-79, 671 A.2d 567, <em>cert. denied, </em>519 <em>U.S. </em>911, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>275, 136 L.Ed.2d 198 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">In <em>Anastasio, </em>a developer obtained a judgment under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988 against members of a planning board on the theory that their delay in reviewing and approving a site plan application violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In reversing, we noted that plaintiff was \u201cfree at any time to bring an action in lieu of prerogative writs under state law to challenge the action of the board\u201d and concluded that \u201cas a matter of law plaintiff could suffer no violation of any constitutional right by reason of delay in approval of its site plan.\u201d 209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 520, 507 A.2d 1194. The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion in rejecting a developer\u2019s claim that a municipality\u2019s delay in issuing a building permit constituted a denial of procedural due process. <em>Bello v. Walker, </em>840 F.2d 1124, 1127-28 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>851, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>134, 102 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>107 (1988); see <em>also DeBlasio v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment of West Amwell, </em>53 F.3d 592, 597 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 <em>U.S. </em>937, 116 <em>S.Ct. 352, </em>133 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 247 (1995) (\u201c[W]hen a state affords a full judicial mechanism with which to challenge the administrative decision in question, the state provides adequate procedural due process, ... whether or not the plaintiff avails himself or herself of the provided appeal mechanism.\u201d) (quoting <em>Bello, supra, </em>840 F.2d at 1128). Similarly, appellants\u2019 own deliberate decision not to avail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>themselves of the readily available judicial remedy for administrative inaction precluded them from asserting a claim under the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Appellants\u2019 second federal claim was predicated upon a regulation of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-7\">The Medicaid agency must provide an appeals or exception procedure that allows individual providers an opportunity to submit additional evidence and receive prompt administrative review, with respect to such issues as the agency determines appropriate, of payment rates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">[42 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 447.253(e)(2000)J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">This regulation was adopted to implement the so-called \u201cBoren Amendment,\u201d under which states were required to establish Medicaid rates that were \u201creasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A). The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub.L. No. 105-33, 111 Stat. 251, 507-08 (1997), repealed the Boren Amendment and replaced the requirement of \u201creasonable and adequate\u201d rates with a requirement of a \u201cpublic process for determination of rates of payment.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A). However, because some of appellants\u2019 rate appeals were filed prior to the repeal of the Boren Amendment, it is arguable that this legislation and the regulations adopted thereunder, including 42 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 447.253(e), apply to this ease.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. &amp; Health Ctr. v. Belshe, </em>188 F.3d 1090, 1095 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">There is a conflict among the federal circuit courts of appeals as to whether an administrative regulation constitutes a \u201claw\u201d within the intent of 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983. <em>Compare Harris v. James, </em>127 F.3d 993, 1005-09 (11th Cir.1997), <em>with Boatman v. Hammons, </em>164 F.3d 286, 289 (6th Cir.1998). If an administrative regulation by itself cannot provide the foundation for a \u00a7 1983 claim, appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>lants\u2019 claim that the Division violated 42 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 447.253(e) would not be maintainable under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988. However, we do not need to decide this issue, because we conclude that 42 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 447.253(e) did not create a privately enforceable right.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">It is now firmly established that \u201cto seek redress through \u00a7 1983, ... a plaintiff must assert the violation of a federal <em>right, </em>not merely a violation of a federal <em>law.\u201d Blessing v. Freestone, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>329, 340, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>1353, 1359, 137 L.Ed.2d 569, 582 (1997). Three factors determine whether a statutory provision creates an individual federal right:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">First, Congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff. Second, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so \u201cvague and amorphous\u201d that its enforcement would strain judicial competence. Third, the statute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the States. In other words, the provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory rather than precatory terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">[Id at 340-41, <em>117 S.Ct. </em>at <em>1359, 137 L.Ed.2d </em>at 582.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">In determining whether a statutory provision satisfies these criteria, a court should not consider a statute \u201cas an undifferentiated whole,\u201d but should instead determine whether the specific provision relied upon by the plaintiff creates privately enforceable rights. <em>Id. </em>at 342, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1360, 137 L.Ed.2d at 583. Consequently, even though the Supreme Court concluded that the Boren Amendment\u2019s mandate that states establish Medicaid rates that are \u201cadequate to meet the costs that must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities,\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A), created a privately enforceable right, <em>Wilder v. Virginia Hosp. Ass\u2019n, </em>496 <em>U.S. </em>498, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2510, 110 L.Ed.2d 455 (1990), this does not mean that every other obligation imposed under authority of the Boren Amendment also gave rise to privately enforceable rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">We conclude that 42 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 447.253(e) did not create privately enforceable rights because it was couched in \u201cprecatory\u201d rather than \u201cmandatory\u201d terms. <em>Blessing, supra, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>at 340, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1359, 137 L.Ed.2d at 582. The essentially \u201cprecatory\u201d nature of the obligation imposed by 42 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 447.253(e) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>evidenced by the statement issued by DHHS when it adopted the regulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">With regard to the comment on establishing time periods, we believe that a greater degree of specificity in the appeals provision would not be in the interests of State flexibility nor would it necessarily result in any substantial benefit to the Medicaid program. We do agree that State appeal procedures should be consistent with the intent of the Federal provision regarding prompt administrative review as currently reflected in the regulation. Therefore, we are not revising the regulations to specify a given time period, for the State to act on appeal requests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">[48 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>56,046, 56,052 (1983).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">In view of the fact that DHHS made a deliberate policy decision not to require state Medicaid agencies to decide rate appeals within a specific period of time, we do not believe that 42 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 447.253(e) can be reasonably read to \u201cunambiguously impose a binding obligation on the States.\u201d <em>Blessing, supra, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>at 340, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1359, <em>137 L.Ed.2d </em>at 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Moreover, even if a plaintiff demonstrates by application of the three factors identified in <em>Blessing </em>that a statutory provision was intended to confer an individual right, this only establishes \u201ca rebuttable presumption that the right is enforceable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Blessing, supra, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>at 341, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1360, 137 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 582. Congress may foreclose relief under \u00a7 1983 either \u201cexpressly, by forbidding recourse to \u00a7 1983 in the statute itself, or impliedly, by creating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Appellants\u2019 claim was grounded solely upon 42 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 447.253(e), not any statutory provision. Consequently, the question is not one of congressional intent but rather whether DHHS intended to confer an individual right when it adopted 42 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 447.253(e). We are satisfied based on the language of this regulation and the previously quoted accompanying statement that DHHS did not intend to authorize an action under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 whenever a Medicaid agency failed to issue a timely decision in a rate appeal. <em>See Suter v. Artist M., </em>503 <em>U.S. </em>347, 357-64, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>1360, <em>1366-70, </em>118 L.Ed.2d 1, 12-16 (1992); <em>Harris v.
