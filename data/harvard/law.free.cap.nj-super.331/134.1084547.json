Plaintiff, a carpenter, lost one toe and severely damaged another after he had placed down a Skilsaw portable circular saw which \u201ctravelled\u201d eighteen inches across the subfloor of a house that plaintiff was framing and ran over his right foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Defendant seeks reversal of the judgment and a new trial on several grounds. Defendant contends the trial judge committed reversible error when he (1) charged the jury on the state-of-the-art defense, over defendant\u2019s objection; (2) gave a jury charge on the state-of-the-art defense, which improperly shifted the burden of proof to defendant; (3) permitted plaintiff to offer evidence of post-accident use of the saw though plaintiff had failed to disclose this evidence in discovery; (4) permitted plaintiff to offer evidence and make arguments that defendant\u2019s conduct was a basis for imposing liability; (5) permitted plaintiff to cross-examine defendant\u2019s expert by asking questions that had no good-faith factual basis; and (6) denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment at the close of all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Defendant also contends, for a number of reasons, that we should \u201coverrule\u201d <em>Tirrell v.

The propriety of <em>Tirrell </em>is also the subject of briefs submitted by the amici curiae. We find no reversible error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">On January 3, 1992 plaintiff filed a two-count complaint in the Superior Court, Law Division, Burlington County. The complaint sought compensatory and punitive damages from defendant and John Does 1 through 20 for injuries plaintiff sustained while using a Skilsaw portable circular saw (Skilsaw) during the course of his employment as a carpenter. The Skilsaw was manufactured by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">The first count alleged that (1) defendant negligently designed, manufactured, assembled, produced, tested, inspected, distributed, marketed, leased or sold the Skilsaw and negligently failed to properly instruct or warn plaintiff about its use; and (2) the Skilsaw was defective in its design, manufacture and lack of proper instructions and warnings. The second count alleged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>John Does 1 through 20 \u201cfailed and neglected to take any action to guard workers, such as plaintiff ... against dangers posed by the hazardous condition\u201d of the Skilsaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The motion judge granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiffs punitive damages claim with prejudice and his motion in limine to bar defendant from using the comparative negligence defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">During the seven-day jury trial before Judge Bookbinder and a jury in December 1996 plaintiffs theory of liability was design defect only. On December 11, 1996 the jury found that the Skilsaw was defectively designed and that the design defect was a proximate cause of plaintiffs injuries. The jury awarded plaintiff $160,000 in damages. On January 8, 1997 the award, plus prejudgment interest, was reduced to judgment in the amount of $200,155.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">On February 14, 1990 plaintiff was employed as a carpenter by Adonis Carpentry Contracting, Inc. (Adonis), a Voorhees, New Jersey company. He had worked for them for three weeks. On that day, he was framing a new house in Medford, Burlington County.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">As a carpenter, plaintiff was required to use a portable circular saw. On February 14 Adonis\u2019s carpenters had two such saws available for their use at the jobsite. Both were Skilsaws. Plaintiff chose the subject Skilsaw because it had \u201ca nice cord\u201d and a better blade than the other. The other saw was much older than the two-year-old saw plaintiff chose.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Plaintiff identified the Skilsaw in the courtroom as the saw he had been using at the time of his injury. He agreed it was \u201cin pretty much the same condition as it was\u201d on February 14, 1990. Plaintiff demonstrated how the injury occurred for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">Plaintiff said the Skilsaw had been sitting on the ground. Plaintiff propped the Skilsaw on his foot and, while firmly holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>it, made a straight cut through a \u201ctwo by four.\u201d Either as soon as the cut two by four fell to the ground or as the piece was falling to the ground, plaintiff let go of the saw\u2019s trigger and stood up. When plaintiff released the trigger, he heard the saw\u2019s motor stop. However, the blade continued to \u201cspin pretty fast.\u201d Plaintiff made sure there was a clear spot on the deck for the saw, which he found \u201cabout eighteen inches\u201d to his right. He did not want to put the saw down on a piece of wood lying there. When plaintiff set the saw down, it ran over his foot. About four to five seconds had elapsed between the time that plaintiff released the trigger and set the saw down. There was no debris in the area where plaintiff set down the saw. Plaintiff was wearing work boots which were almost new.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">At the time of the accident, the outside walls of the house were being framed. Although there were saw horses at the job site, none was on the second floor of the house. Plaintiff gave a number of reasons why he did not take a saw horse up to the second floor. In any event, he saw no advantage to using a saw horse. Plaintiff said that he had cut two by four\u2019s in the manner he did at the time of the accident \u201call [his] life.\u201d In fact, every carpenter he knew cut two by four\u2019s that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Plaintiff had used the Skilsaw for about two hours on the day of the accident. During that time, plaintiff made about twenty to thirty cuts but admitted that this was \u201chard to say.\u201d He cut one piece at a time and held each piece of wood very firmly over his left foot as he cut through it.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Plaintiff did not remember changing the saw\u2019s blade during that two-hour period. He did not notice any malfunction with the lower blade guard. Plaintiff had checked the lower blade guard that morning, though he could not recall when, because doing so was \u201ca common habit\u201d which was done to \u201cget all the sawdust out so that you\u2019re working with a safe tool.\u201d Plaintiff demonstrated his routine for checking the blade guard and said that he removed any sawdust by banging the lower guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Plaintiff pointed out the saw\u2019s lower guard to the jury and showed the jury how the guard was \u201csupposed to snap back like that.\u201d On the day of the accident, however, the guard \u201cdidn\u2019t come down. It stayed in the open position.\u201d Plaintiff knew that the guard did not close because the \u201csaw ran over my foot, And when I pulled the saw out of my foot, I looked and the guard was stuck open.\u201d This was when plaintiff first discovered that the guard had not closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">According to plaintiff, the saw\u2019s blade had made an eighteen-inch cut on the subfloor \u201cfrom where it traveled [backwards] across the deck.\u201d The \u201cdeck\u201d was actually the subfloor of the house. Plaintiff did not know why the saw\u2019s guard did not close.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Plaintiff said he never intentionally wedged a lower guard of a circular saw in the open position although other carpenters had done this on other occasions. He never used a saw which had the guard wedged open. To wedge the guard open, you place a wedge of wood up into the upper guard. Plaintiff had never seen this done with a nail, which he described as ridiculous. Plaintiff had seen another carpenter injured after wedging a guard open; this taught him never to make the same mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Plaintiff admitted that when he made compound miter cuts, he held the guard open but he did this with his left hand, not with a wedge. Plaintiff was not making such cuts on the day of the accident. Plaintiff was steadfast in his representation that he never intentionally wedged the guard open on the saw or tried to bypass the lower blade guard, including on the day of the accident. According to plaintiff, if he had wedged the guard open, this would have slowed his productivity significantly. He would have to wait for about twenty seconds after each cut for the blade to stop spinning. Thus, wedging the guard open would have made his job more difficult and more dangerous. Plaintiff could think of no common sense reason for wedging open the guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">After the accident, plaintiff never inspected the saw. The reattachment of his toe was more important to him at the <em>time. </em>Plaintiff explained that when he put the saw down, he was not able <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>to see if the guard was in place because only the side of the saw was visible; his focus was on finding a flat, even surface to set the saw upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">After the accident, plaintiff screamed for help. Co-worker Frank Flora, who had retrieved the missing toe, took him to the emergency room at West Jersey Hospital in Yoorhees, about twenty minutes away. The doctors were able to reattach a portion of plaintiffs fourth toe with a pin; they were unable to save the fifth toe, the one that Flora found. Plaintiff was hospitalized for three days.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Approximately two weeks after the injury, plaintiff returned to the worksite to thank his co-workers for their help. At the time of his visit, plaintiff observed the saw that he had been using at the time of his injury. The saw was plugged in, sitting on a deck. The Skilsaw in the courtroom had scratches on it, some of which plaintiff attributed to being stacked in the back of the truck where it was stored.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Co-worker John Scott testified on plaintiffs behalf. Scott did not know whether anyone had wedged the saw on the day of or prior to plaintiffs accident. He did know, however, that other people had wedged the Skilsaw after the accident though he did not know their names, and he never saw them do it. Scott relied on other people\u2019s statements in testifying that others had wedged the guard. Scott later said: \u201cit\u2019s just a fact when [some people] cut rafters they wedge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Scott had worked with plaintiff every day on the Medford jobsite for three weeks, until the accident. He saw plaintiff use the Skilsaw every day during that time. The lower guard was not intentionally wedged open during that time, including the day of the accident, and Scott had never seen plaintiff do so. On the day of the accident, Scott used the Skilsaw that injured plaintiff after plaintiff had been taken to the hospital. Scott was not asked how long he had used the saw or how many cuts he had made.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Louis E. Howarth (Howarth), a mechanical engineer, testified as an expert on behalf of plaintiff. Howarth inspected the saw three months after the accident. Howarth had no information that suggested the saw had been fixed or repaired after the accident. He did not remove the blade and look for wedge marks underneath.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">According to Howarth, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) had taken the position that Underwriters Laboratory (UL) 45 was the code which should be followed with respect to portable woodworking tools. The UL code stated that a saw should have a retractable lower guard, which shall automatically retract to the closed position when the saw is not in use. The code further stated that a guard retracting handle was acceptable on a circular saw if \u201cto manipulate the handle the operator\u2019s finger need not be in the area of which the teeth are exposed; and also that the guard is not likely to jam in any position during intended operation.\u201d This standard existed in 1988 when the subject Skilsaw was manufactured.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Howarth conceded that in 1988, the UL-45 did not require a blade brake on a portable circular saw. However, Howarth contended that, as of 1995, it did, though he did not have the UL-45 with him. According to Howarth, every portable circular saw sold as of the time of trial should have had a blade brake. Nonetheless, Howarth acknowledged that four saws purchased by defendant\u2019s counsel the day before contained no blade brakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Howarth identified the basic principles of accident prevention with respect to the manufacture of power tools as (1) the hazard should be designed out of the product; (2) if the hazard could not be designed out, then it should be guarded against; (3) if the hazard could not be guarded against without impinging upon the product\u2019s function, then warnings and instructions must be provided. According to Howarth, a guard was preferable to warnings because a warning might not be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The \u201cleading hazard\u201d of a portable circular saw is the blade. The hazard posed by the blade could not be designed out because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>the blade was necessary to the saw\u2019s function. However, there were two types of guards that were available. The first type was the upper blade guard, which was on this saw. The upper blade guard covered the upper part of the blade and prevented contact with the blade \u201cat all times, where the teeth are.\u201d The second type was the retractable blade guard. The retractable blade guard \u201cis supposed to come back every time after you finish a cut.\u201d The Skilsaw had both of these guards.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The retractable blade guard could work with two different types of springs. The first type operated like a screen door: \u201cwhen you let go it pulls the door shut.\u201d The second type was the torsion spring. The spring was wound up and when released, \u201cit shuts it and makes it close.\u201d According to Howarth, the lower blade guard protects the operator from contact with the front of the blade.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Howarth testified that sometimes the lower blade guard would not release after a cut \u2014 when for example, it was clogged by wood chips or saw dust. When this happened, the blade would continue to rotate even though the operator believed he had turned the machine off. The principle was similar to removing the foot from a ear\u2019s accelerator yet the car continued to move forward. According to Howarth, an exposed blade was a hazard because when the saw was put down, it would \u201crun backwards on the floor on you every time.\u201d If, however, the saw had a blade brake, the blade would not have continued to spin.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The subject saw had a coil extension spring lower blade guard, which was \u201cbasically an extension spring, and that\u2019s all it does is it just pulls the lower blade guard back.\u201d Howarth estimated that the blade would continue to rotate thirteen to fourteen seconds after the trigger had been released. Howarth twice demonstrated the blade\u2019s actual stop time before the jury. After the first trigger release, the blade continued to rotate for eighteen seconds. After the second release, the blade continued rotating for nineteen seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>In 1988, when the Skilsaw was made, an electronic dynamic brake (also known as a blade brake) existed which would have prevented the blade from continuing to spin after the trigger had been released. The blade brake had been in existence since the 1970\u2019s. The blade brake was a safety device because in the event that the lower guard did not go into position, the blade would stop as soon as the trigger was released. In 1974, the Consumer Products Safety Commission characterized the blade brake as a safety device.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">According to the Consumer Products Safety Commission \u201cfact sheet,\u201d a portable saw blade guard could malfunction by \u201cstaying in a retracted position after completion of the cut.\u201d When this occurred, the blade would keep rotating after the power was stopped. Electronic, or dynamic, braking would cause the blade to stop rotating more quickly. This was the device that should \u2022have been on the saw that plaintiff had used. Electronic blade brakes were very reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Howarth showed the jury an Ambiteeh electronic blade brake that had been available since 1974 and cost only $20 in 1995. According to Ambiteeh, the brake would stop a blade from spinning in \u201ca fraction of a second.\u201d Howarth claimed a blade brake could have been designed into the Skilsaw used by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">In 1988, defendant\u2019s competitors manufactured portable circular saws with blade brakes. Indeed, Sears manufactured such a saw in 1976 and 1977. Black and Decker also made a portable circular saw with a blade brake as did Makita. The manufacturers of these saws claimed that the blade would stop rotating either instantaneously or within a few seconds. Howarth, however, had never used such saws.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Although Howarth stated that cost was a factor when considering the specifications of saw designs he conceded that it was not a \u201cmajor consideration.\u201d A blade brake was not a convenience feature but a \u201ccomplete safety device.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Howarth concluded that defendant\u2019s saw, used by plaintiff, was defective because it was sold without a blade brake and, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission in 1974, the lower blade guard was known to fail to retract. Howarth continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7m\">This is common knowledge, to give a backup safety device, as they also say it is, put an electronic brake system or a dynamic brake system on that so as whenever the trigger is release [sic], it comes \u2014 the blade comes to a stop. And one just does not rely upon the retraction of the lower blade guard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">According to Howarth, the saw would have been much safer if designed with a blade brake. Howarth understood that plaintiff was injured after he had released the trigger and placed the saw on the floor with the blade still spinning, which \u201ccaused the entire saw to come around and kind of cut across his foot while the blade was still rotating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Howarth did not know why the guard did not work on the day of plaintiffs accident. However, he testified that the blade guard failed to close \u201c[pjrobably because it jammed up with a \u2014 sawdust or chips \u2014 wood chips of some sort, and it caused it to jam in the on position.\u201d Howarth was aware that this could happen based on his own knowledge and the writings of others. He also said that manufacturers had been told that this could happen. Consequently, this was a foreseeable hazard that wood chips could jam the guard open after a cut had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Howarth did no studies in which he replicated the guard \u201changing up\u201d as a result of wood chips or sawdust. He saw no marks that suggested to him that the guard was wedged. Therefore, he assumed that the handle had not been wedged. Howarth agreed that the guard could have been wedged by sticking a nail in it, though he could not believe that a carpenter would do such a thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Howarth concluded that plaintiff would not have been injured if the saw had a blade brake because \u201cthe blade would have braked much too fast.\u201d Moreover, \u201ceven if the guard was not in its full protective position, when he set [the saw] down only the points would have dug into the deck wherever he sat it, but it would not have been rotating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>In reaching his conclusions, Howarth took into consideration the report and deposition testimony of defendant\u2019s expert, Peter Domeny (Domeny). Howarth disagreed with Domeny\u2019s position that the saw did not need a blade brake. According to Howarth, a blade travelling at a linear top speed of 125 to 127 miles per hour was a danger to a worker like plaintiff \u201c[especially if the guard does not retract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Howarth understood that Domeny tested saws manufactured by Sears and Black and Decker. Neither saw lasted more than 10,000 cycles before the on/off switch had failed. According to Howarth, a saw would have had to have been used for ten years to get to 10,000 cycles. Though the on/off switches had failed, Howarth believed that the electronic blade brake always worked reliably and within three seconds. The brake never failed. Indeed, even the on/off switch problems could have been averted by normal maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Howarth testified that Domeny\u2019s tests were not reliable in terms of predicting the performance of an electronic brake on plaintiffs two-year-old saw because \u201cthe cyclic grading of the test [was] far beyond what would ever be expected in the field.\u201d Based on Domeny\u2019s test of the Sears model, Howarth concluded that the electronic brake device was a \u201cgood unit\u201d that would \u201coutlast the product.\u201d It was the same for the Black and Decker tests. Manufacturers\u2019 manuals, including defendant\u2019s, advise consumers that the switches and brushes may need to be replaced as part of the tool\u2019s maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The benefits of a blade brake \u201cfar outweigh[ed] any risk of injury that may occur.\u201d A blade brake and a lower blade retractable guard would make a saw \u201c[m]uch safer\u201d because \u201cwhenever the retractable lower guard is not closed on it and you release the trigger, you\u2019re stopping that blade so fast that any motion you have you would probably prevent an injury from occurring because the blade is stopped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Howarth also testified that as an alternative to the blade brake, the portable circular saw could have had a \u201cflag\u201d on it. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>would have alerted the operator when the lower blade guard had not returned to its protective position. The flag would not have been an actual flag. Rather, it would be orange paint which, when observed, would indicate that the guard was not in the proper position. The flag would not have impaired either the saw\u2019s or the guard\u2019s function. Howarth thought that the saw would have been safer even with just a flag. In fact, without the flag, the saw was not reasonably safe for its intended use. Such a flag would have warned plaintiff that the lower blade retractable guard was not in the closed position. With respect to the flags, Howarth conceded that other manufacturers\u2019 saws did not have orange flags. Consequently, he thought that all other manufacturers were violating the flag standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Ultimately, Howarth concluded that the saw had two defects: the absence of the brake and the absence of the flag. The circular saws manufactured without blade brakes by Black and Decker, Milwaukee, and Makita were defectively designed. Prior to the accident, manufacturers, including Black and Decker, manufactured saws with blade brakes and flags.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Domeny testified as an expert on behalf of defendant. At the time of trial, Domeny was employed by S.B. Power Tool Company in Chicago. S.B. was owned by Bosch GMbH in Germany. Prior to 1992, S.B. was known as the Skil Corporation. Until the Fall of 1996, S.B. was owned by Bosch and Emerson Electric Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Domeny started with defendant in 1969, one year after he immigrated to the United States from Czechoslovakia where he had received a degree in experimental physics. (Defendant shall mean Skil Corporation in its various forms from the time of Domeny\u2019s employment in 1969 up through the time of trial.) Since 1969, Domeny has worked continuously in the design and development of power tools. Domeny also has been involved in the evaluation of the safety of power tools, including the investigation of accidents and product safety development.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Domeny helped develop and design the Skilsaw that had injured plaintiff. He was the director of defendant\u2019s product safety department and, as such, was responsible for overseeing the development, design, testing and writing of manuals from a \u201csafety point of view.\u201d During the course of his employment, Domeny worked with \u201ca broad line of power tools from drills, grinders, circular saws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Domeny examined the subject saw after the accident. He turned it \u201con\u201d and then \u201coff\u2019 and found that it worked f\u00edne. He took measurements and used strobe photography to \u201cshow how fast and what is the timing of the guard closure from the open to the fully closed position.\u201d Domeny checked the guard system on the saw, \u201cand everything was working fine.\u201d When Domeny tested the speed at which the lower guard closed, it was .13 to .14 of a second, using strobe photography. The strobe photography created a permanent record of the progression of the guard from opening to closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">According to Domeny, UL-45 governed the design of circular saws. The standard required the guard to close in .30 of a second. UL-45 was adopted by various departments of the United States Government, as well as ANSI. Although ANSI had always recognized TJL-45, prior to 1984, UL-45 was incorporated by reference under ANSI standards C33.49 and 01.1. Contrary to Howarth\u2019s testimony, at the time of trial, the standard did not require an electric brake for a portable circular saw.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Upon examination of the subject saw, Domeny found \u201cquite extensive and strong evidence\u201d of wedging. He also found a concentration of scrape marks that were consistent with pushing an object, be it a nail or wood, between the handle and the outside surface of the upper guard. Domeny removed the saw\u2019s blade and found \u201cthe strongest evidence of the wedging.\u201d The evidence included \u201cgouges.\u201d To confirm that the gouges were the result of wedging, Domeny removed the blade. He then explained and demonstrated how the guard could be wedged by sticking a penny nail \u201cbetween the lower guard and the inner surface of the upper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>guard.\u201d The prying of the nail caused the marks. Domeny showed the jury pictures he had taken of -the inside of the saw, which he testified showed the wedge marks and gouges.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Domeny was able to tell when the wedging had been done by examining the saw. First, the aluminum underneath the marks had fresh color. Second, there was no sawdust accumulation in the gouges, which would have occurred over time. Third, no resin had accumulated over the gouges.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Domeny stated that the person identified earlier by Scott as having wedged open a saw before plaintiffs use could not have been the person who made the marks he observed because plaintiff testified that he had made thirty to fifty cuts on the day of the accident. (Actually, Scott never said that anyone had wedged the Skilsaw prior to the accident.) That number of cuts would have caused the gouges to fill with sawdust. Finally, the blade itself indicated wedging because dust appeared on it from a leather boot and blood. If the Skilsaw had been used extensively after the accident, the blood would have smeared away.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">According to Domeny, defendant could have incorporated a blade brake into its saws, as the principle had been known since the 1960\u2019s. In fact, Black &amp; Decker, Makita and Ryobi were using the technology in \u201c1986, \u201988.\u201d However, defendant made a conscious decision not to use the technology \u201cbecause of the benefits and detriments of the feature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">According to Domeny, \u201cthe benefit of the design has to outweigh the negatives of the design.\u201d The one safety benefit is that certain types of accidents could be eliminated by a brake. Domeny stated, however, that there were safety detriments to the incorporation of an electric brake into the portable circular saw. First, about fifty-five percent of all accidents occurred while the trigger was engaged and the operator was in the process of cutting. Second, about thirty-three percent of accidents occurred during a kickback, which also happened when the operator was in the process of cutting. Third, another ten percent of the accidents occurred as the result of someone having grabbed the blade itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>accidently while reaching for some other object. Thus, a blade brake would not have prevented ninety-eight percent of saw accidents. Or, as a corollary, a blade brake would have prevented only two percent of saw accidents. Domeny emphasized that the two percent did not mean two percent of all users, but rather two percent of all accidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Domeny agreed that it would be a good thing to help prevent even two percent of all accidents but only \u201cif the detriment of this device would not cause even more accidents than the two percent benefit that you gain out of it.\u201d There were three different categories of detriment posed by the brake. There was an increased risk of (1) electrocution, (2) switch failure, which would prevent the saw from stopping after the trigger was released and cause a kickback, and (3) unsafe behavior by operators who might view the brake as a back-up system when, in fact, the brake \u201cwill not work every time.\u201d In addition, there were carpenters who still would have wedged the guard open in the belief that the brake would protect them. Thus, in 1988, defendant made the decision that despite the technology and feasibility of the brake:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">The negative aspects: the electrocution, shock hazard, the unsafe motor component failures, and the reliability factor, all those combined negative aspects outweigh the potential benefit of saving two percent of the \u2014 all the accidents. There would be accidents of different nature happening if you incorporate the brake.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Defendant had used a \u201cflag\u201d at one point but discontinued its use because it caused the lower guard to hang up. Moreover, for a majority of users, after a while the color of the flag would become just another color like the color of the tool itself. No industry standard required a safety flag on the lower guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Domeny testified that plaintiffs use of his foot to stabilize the wood he was cutting was not recommended and defendant\u2019s manual advised against it. According to Domeny, the instability of positioning a piece of wood over one\u2019s foot could cause the saw to kick back. Nonetheless, Domeny did not believe that plaintiffs accident was caused by a kickback. Domeny concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>SMlsaw was not defectively designed and that \u201c[t]he manner in which it was used or misused contributed or caused the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The jury voted five to one that the Skilsaw was defectively designed and, by the same count, that the defective design was the proximate cause of plaintiffs injuries. As we can see, the case was squarely contested on the issue of defective design, not on the issue of \u201cstate-of-the-art.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Defendant raises these six issues which we will consider in serial fashion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">1. WHETHER THE TRIAL JUDGE COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN HE CHARGED THE JURY ON THE STATE-OF-THE-ART DEFENSE OVER DEFENDANT\u2019S OBJECTION AND, IF NOT, WHETHER THE CHARGE MISLEAD OR CONFUSED THE JURY AND PREJUDICED A SUBSTANTIAL RIGHT OF DEFENDANT\u2019S (defendant\u2019s points I and II).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">2. WHETHER THE TRIAL JUDGE COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN HE PERMITTED PLAINTIFF TO OFFER EVIDENCE OF POST-ACCIDENT USE OF THE PRODUCT BECAUSE PLAINTIFF HAD FAILED TO DISCLOSE SUCH EVIDENCE DURING DISCOVERY (defendant\u2019s point III).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-10\">3. WHETHER THE TRIAL JUDGE COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN HE PERMITTED CERTAIN QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED OF DEFENDANT\u2019S EXPERT, WHO WAS ALSO ITS EMPLOYEE, ON CROSS-EXAMINATION (defendant\u2019s point IV).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-11\">4. WHETHER THE TRIAL JUDGE COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN HE DENIED DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT AT THE CLOSE OF ALL THE EVIDENCE BECAUSE REASONABLE MINDS COULD NOT CONCLUDE THAT DEFENDANT\u2019S PRODUCT WAS DEFECTIVE (defendant\u2019s point VI).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-12\">5. WHETHER THE APPELLATE DIVISION SHOULD DECLINE TO FOLLOW <em>TIRRELL V. NAVISTAR INTERNATIONAL, INC., </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>390, 591 A.2d 643 (App.Div.), <em>CERTIF. DENIED, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>390, 599 A.2d 166 (1991), ORDER A NEW TRIAL, AND PERMIT DEFENDANT TO ASSERT THE COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE DEFENSE IN THIS PRODUCT LIABILITY CASE WHERE PLAINTIFF WAS INJURED BY DEFENDANT\u2019S PRODUCT WHILE USING IT IN THE WORKPLACE (defendant\u2019s points V, VTI, VIII).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-13\">6. WHETHER THE <em>TIRRELL </em>DECISION VIOLATES THE SEPARATION OF POWERS CLAUSE OF THE NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION, AS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>WELL AS THE DUE PROCESS AND EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSES OF THE NEW JERSEY AND UNITED STATES CONSTITUTIONS (defendant\u2019s points VII and VIII).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Defendant contends that the judge committed reversible error when, at plaintiffs request and over defendant\u2019s objection, he charged the jury on the state-of-the-art defense \u2014 a defense that defendant did not wish to assert. According to defendant, the charge imposed a burden upon it that it neither assumed nor the law permitted. Defendant maintains it was prejudiced by the charge because plaintiff had argued defendant did not meet its burden of proof on the state-of-the-art defense after defendant had rested without offering proofs on the defense. Finally, according to defendant, the instruction confused the jury on the issue of which party bore the ultimate burden of proof and denied defendant a fair trial. According to defendant, \u201cstate-of-the-art was not an issue\u201d in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">There was considerable discussion at the charge conference about whether the state-of-the-art defense should be charged and, if so, whether it should be in the form of 5.34(c) or 5.34(d) of the <em>Model Jury Charges, Civil. </em>According to defense counsel, defendant conceded that it could have placed a blade brake on the saw in 1988. However, defendant chose to forego the brake due to the \u201ccountervailing safety problems\u201d it created. This is consistent with Domeny\u2019s testimony. After some discussion, defense counsel appeared agreeable to the charge in 5.34(c), though he disagreed with the charge in 5.34(d), which represented the statutory state-of-the-art defense, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-3(a)(l). Ultimately, defense counsel told the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">Well, Judge, I\u2019ll make it \u2014 I\u2019ll make it easy, all right? If we \u2014 we\u2019re not invoking the \u2014 which is an affirmative offense [sic], I\u2019m not invoking the statutory provisions of the new Products Liability Act, okay? You can leave C in its entirety and I\u2019ll just deal with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">Later, when the discussion returned to the state-of-the-art charge and defendant\u2019s burden of proof, defense counsel interrupted the exchange between the judge and plaintiffs counsel by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>declaring: \u201cJudge, leave it in. Leave it in, forget it, I\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Plaintiff argues that these words amounted to a withdrawal of any objection that defendant had to the state-of-the-art charge and defendant waived its right to appeal the jury instruction. Moreover, plaintiff points out that defense counsel failed to object at subsequent opportune moments.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Despite defense counsel\u2019s statements to \u201cleave it in, forget it\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll deal with it,\u201d we conclude, given the extensive discussion about the charge and the obvious need to move the proceeding along, the objection to the charge was preserved, albeit in a general form. <em>R. </em>1:7-2. Moreover, during a sidebar discussion in the midst of plaintiffs counsel\u2019s summation, defense counsel reiterated the fact that he had agreed to a state-of-the-art charge only to move the case along. Thus, we do not think that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the state-of-the-art charge at each and every opportunity was a waiver of the objection, and we consider the issue on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Judge Bookbinder outlined the parties\u2019 burdens generally as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">Now, the plaintiff says that the saw was defective because it did not incorporate a safety flag and/or a blade brake. The defendant, on the contrary, says that the product was not defective and that it was reasonably safe for its intended and reasonably foreseeable purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">Now, burden of proof is on each person, each party, to establish their claim by a preponderance of the evidence. In other words, if a person makes an allegation then that person must prove the allegation. In this action Mr. Cavanaugh has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence all of the facts necessary to prove the following issues; one, that there is a defect, two, that the defect was a proximate cause of the injury, and, three, damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">Now, I\u2019m going to get into this a lot more in depth but this is just a little idea. Now, the defendant took on themselves a burden here because they are indicating that their \u2014 they complied with the state of the art and because of that they have a burden for that. And even if they don\u2019t prove that, that doesn\u2019t mean that they automatically lose the ease, just if they do prove that they automatically win the case. You\u2019ll hear a lot about that more \u2014 a lot later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Later, in charging the jury on the risk-utility analysis, Judge Bookbinder instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Now, in proving a defect in the design of the product the plaintiff need not prove that the manufacturer knew that the product was dangerous. We legally assume that the manufacturer is aware of any danger which you decide the product had and whether the defendant actually knew of the existence of the danger is meaningless. The question for you to decide is whether assuming the defendant knew of the danger in the product they nevertheless acted in a reasonably careful manner in marketing, selling or distributing the product.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">If the danger of the design was not known at the time of the manufacture, the defendant cannot be found to be at fault. But the burden on this point falls on the defendant. [If t]he defendant contends that the danger was unknowable it must prove that contention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">Okay. Now, in this case the defendant is not saying that the danger was unknowable so you don\u2019t have to worry about them assuming that burden. Now, let\u2019s talk about state of the art. I mentioned this a little bit before, I want to mention it again. The plaintiff has to prove the elements of the case. State of the art is something that if the defendant proved the elements they automatically win, and you\u2019ll hear that again. A couple of times you\u2019ll hear that again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">If they don\u2019t prove it they don\u2019t automatically lose, they can still win without proving each one of these elements. Even if they prove some of the elements they can still win, because, remember, the plaintiff has the burden of proving their elements. So, if the plaintiff fails to prove their elements the defense can still win even if they don\u2019t prove every one of these things. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-9\">So, there\u2019s been evidence of common practice and standards of evidence. The evidence bears upon the risk-utility analysis that you\u2019re being asked to make here or to measure the reasonableness of the conduct assuming knowledge of the harm the products can cause. Compliance of [sic] common practice or industry standards does not mean the product is safe, it may still be found to be defective in design, however, that compliance, along with all of the other evidence in this case, may satisfy you that the product is properly made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-10\">Now, they\u2019re saying that when the product left the defendant\u2019s control there was no practical and technically feasible alternative design for the product, the kind of design that would have prevented the harm while at the same time the kind of design that would not have substantially impaired intended or reasonable function of the product.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-11\">If there was no better design available when the product left the control of the defendant, that defendant cannot be held liable for a design defect. However, the defendant has the burden of proof on the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-12\">So, based on your review of the evidence ask yourselves, has the defendant proven that there\u2019s no other practical or workable design that would have prevented the harm that is claimed to have taken place in this case without substantially impairing or reducing the intended or reasonably anticipated function?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>If the defendant has met its burden of proof by the greater weight of the credible evidence on this issue, it must win on whether it defectively designed the product. Even if the defendant has not met its burden of proof, plaintiff may win only if they prove the design defect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">Okay, so, if they prove this, if the defendant proves it they must win. If they don\u2019t prove it then you have to look and see what the plaintiff proved and if plaintiff proved its case the defendant hasn\u2019t again prevented them from proving his case, if that\u2019s a possibility, then the plaintiff wins. But if plaintiff hasn\u2019t proven his case it was no win for the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Later, when the judge summarized the elements of plaintiff\u2019s proofs, he instructed: \u201cIf the defendant has proved \u2014 first of all, if the plaintiff has failed to establish any one of those then it goes to the defendant. In addition, if the defendant proved compliance with state of the art, then the defendant must win. Okay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u201cJury instructions must correctly state the applicable law in understandable language and plainly spell out how the jury should apply the facts as it may find them.\u201d <em>McDonough v.

Here, the crux of plaintiffs case really was not that \u201cthe product\u2019s risks outweighed its utility.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Rather, the plaintiffs theory was simple: that the Skilsaw \u201ccould have been designed in an alternative manner so as to minimize or eliminate the risk of harm.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This theory is recognized in the <em>Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability </em>\u00a7 2(b) (1998). We, in turn, recognize this <em>Restatement </em>design defect theory. <em>Green v. General Motors Corp., </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 518, 709 A.2d 205; <em>Fiorino v. Sears Roebuck and Co., Inc., </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>556, 563, 707 A.2d 1053 (App.Div.1998); <em>Congiusti v.

As stated previously, the Supreme Court of New Jersey recently signalled that it also recognizes this design defect theory. <em>Lewis v. American Cyanamid Co., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 570, 715 <em>A.2d </em>967. The Supreme Court appears to have recognized the theory as far back as 1982, albeit in the context of a failure-to-warn case. <em>Beshada v. Johns-Manville Products Corp., </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>191, 201 and n. 5, 447 A.2d 539 (1982) (citing <em>Freund v.

While the absence of such a model jury charge certainly does not preclude a trial judge from instructing the jury that a plaintiff must prove that there was a reasonable alternative design and that the omission of that alternative design rendered the product <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>not reasonably safe, <em>Congiusti v. Ingersoll-Rand Co., </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 139, 703 A.2d 340, the fact remains that the risk-utility analysis is still used when a plaintiff posits this theory. <em>Lewis v. American Cyanamid Co., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 571, 715 A.2d 967. According to the <em>Lewis </em>Court, a plaintiff who, like plaintiff here, asserts \u201cthat the product could have been designed more safely must prove under a risk-utility analysis the existence of an alternative design that is both practical and feasible.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The question remains, however, whether the state-of-the-art defense should be charged in such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In <em>Fabian v.

That state-of-the-art should not be charged when the parties agree, as in this case before us, that the suggested safety devices were \u201ctechnologically feasible and well-known\u201d when the product was manufactured, makes complete sense. Defendant\u2019s defense did not rest upon an argument that the blade brake was not technologically feasible or well-known. Indeed, Domeny expressly testified that the blade brake was available and he acknowledged that it had been used by other manufacturers. According to Domeny, defendant had considered, and rejected, the use of a brake because the additional hazards created by the brake outweighed the risk that a user would be injured in the manner that plaintiff claimed he had been injured. Thus, defendant\u2019s decision was not dictated by what it believed to be the state-of-the-art; the decision was a design judgment call.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Despite <em>Fabian\u2019s </em>sensible elimination of the state-of-the-art defense in cases where the parties agree that the alternative was known and technologically feasible, the <em>Lewis </em>Court has clearly stated that in cases where the plaintiff seeks to prove the existence of a \u201csafer, practical and feasible alternative design, defendant may assert the \u2018state-of-the-art\u2019 affirmative defense.\u201d <em>Lewis v.

Consider <em>Lewis v. American Cyanamid Co., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 544, 715 A.2d 967, for example. There, the plaintiff was burned over twenty-five percent of his body when he re-entered a room shortly after activating two foggers manufactured by the defendant, United Industries Corp. (United), one of which exploded. <em>Id. </em>at 551-52, 715 A.2d 967. The foggers, which were manufactured in either 1988 or 1989, used a hydrocarbon propellant. <em>Id. </em>at 552, 565, 715 A.2d 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">At trial, the plaintiff asserted that the foggers were defectively designed in that they should have used a compound known as P-22 rather than a hydrocarbon propellant. <em>Id. </em>at 552, 715 A.2d 967. United contended \u201cthat the use of P-22 would have posed risks equal to or greater than the risk of flammability to which plaintiff was exposed\u201d vis-a-vis the hydrocarbon propellant. <em>Id. </em>at 565, 715 A.2d 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">\u201cBoth plaintiff and defendants offered expert testimony regarding the practicality and feasibility of P-22 as an alternative design.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552, 715 A.2d 967. The plaintiffs expert testified that P-22 was safe and three times less flammable than the hydrocarbon propellant. <em>Ibid. </em>He also testified that P-22 was used by other manufacturers of foggers. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">The defendant did not challenge the fact that P-22 would be less flammable. <em>Id. </em>at 565, 715 A.2d 967. Instead, counsel for United cross-examined the plaintiffs expert on his calculations with respect to the concentration of propellant in the air at the time of the plaintiffs accident and then suggested that the concen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>tration of propellant was so high that even a P-22 propellant would have exploded. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The defendant\u2019s expert testified that P-22 was, among other things, \u201ctoo highly pressurized for safe use in the foggers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552, 715 A.2d 967. He contended that P-22 \u201cwould have created an increased danger of explosion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566, 715 A.2d 967. Nonetheless, the defendants\u2019 expert acknowledged that other fogger manufacturers had used P-22 as a propellant in 1988 and 1989. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">After a jury verdict in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, the trial court entered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, holding that the plaintiff had not met his burden of proving that P-22 was a feasible and practical design alternative because the defendants \u201chad adduced sufficient proof that P-22 was dangerous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 558, 715 A.2d 967. We reversed the judgment notwithstanding the verdict. <em>Ibid. </em>The Supreme Court affirmed our decision. <em>Id. </em>at 577, 715 A.2d 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The Supreme Court held that the \u201ccontested issue of fact regarding the practicality and feasibility of a proposed alternative design\u201d required the matter to go to the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 568, 715 A.2d 967. On the state-of-the-art defense, the Court explained that \u201c[e]ven if plaintiff can prove that P-22 was a safer, practical and feasible alternative design, defendant may assert the \u2018state-of-the-art\u2019 affirmative defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571, 715 A.2d 967. The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">United bears the burden of proving that its design of the foggers represented the state of the art. Thus, if United can prove that P-22 was not a practical and feasible alternative at the time the foggers left its control, it would not be liable for the alleged design defect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-11\">Whether United has proven the state-of-the-art defense is therefore a factual issue best left to the jury. It is for the jury to decide whether United has proven that P-22 was not a practical and feasible alternative at the time the foggers left defendant\u2019s control. On retrial, if the jury finds that United has proven the state-of-the-art defense, defendant would not be liable for the alleged design defect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 572, 715 A.2d 967.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>The Supreme Court then reviewed what typically occurs in cases where plaintiffs claim that a product was defective because an allegedly safer design was not used:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">Plaintiffs in products liability actions often try to prove that a product was defective because a safer alternative design existed when the product left the defendant\u2019s control.

American Cyanamid Co., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 544, 715 A.2d 967, is strikingly similar in principle to this case before us except the issue of whether a state-of-the-art defense charge should have been given to the jury was not present in <em>Lems. </em>However, the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion is clear that when proofs similar to those presented in this case before us are proffered, the state-of-the-art defense is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Here, plaintiff tried to prove the Skilsaw was defectively designed because a safer alternative existed, to wit: a portable circular saw with a blade brake. Defendant, through Domeny\u2019s testimony, tried to prove plaintiffs proposed safer alternative was neither practical nor feasible because a portable circular saw with a blade brake would be more dangerous than a portable circular saw without a blade brake. Defendant also took issue with the practicality of the \u201cflag,\u201d but defendant\u2019s brief focuses on the brake. Except for the type of product, this is exactly what happened in <em>Lewis, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 544, 715 A.2d 967. Under <em>Lewis, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 544, 715 A.2d 967, defendant here, in principle, had asserted the state-of-the-art defense. Indeed, even though defendant did not challenge the technological availability of a blade brake in 1988, it most certainly challenged its practicality. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-3(a)(l). The judge\u2019s decision to charge the jury on the state-of-the-art defense was not erroneous under <em>Lewis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">Despite the propriety of the judge\u2019s decision to give the state-of-the-art-defense charge in this case, the charge itself was somewhat problematic, if only technically. In his favor, the judge clearly and repeatedly told the jury that plaintiff bore the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>of proving that the saw was defectively designed. The judge also read 5.34(c) and 5.34(d) of the <em>Model Jury Charges, Civil </em>almost verbatim. However, before and after the judge read the model charges, he told the jury that defendant had the burden of proving that the Skilsaw complied with the state-of-the-art. This instruction may have technically violated <em>Fabian v. Minster Mach. Co., Inc., </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 261, 609 A.2d 487, and perhaps <em>Lewis, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 544, 715 A.2d 967. The judge should have instructed the jury that the defendant had the burden of proving the state-of-the-art defense and the plaintiff had the burden of proving noncompliance with the state-of-the-art.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Although the <em>Lewis </em>Court\u2019s initial declaration that the defendant had the burden of proving that \u201cits design of the foggers represented the state of the art,\u201d <em>Lewis v. American Cyanamid Co., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 571, 715 A.2d 967, may be contrary to <em>Fabian, </em>the Court\u2019s subsequent statements about the defendant\u2019s burden were consistent with <em>Fabian, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 261, 609 A.2d 487. For example, after stating that the defendant was required to prove that its product \u201crepresented the state of the art,\u201d the <em>Lewis </em>Court, in the next sentence, stated that the defendant would prevail if it could prove that P-22, the plaintiffs alternative design, \u201cwas not a practical and feasible alternative at the time the foggers left its control.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 572, 715 A.2d 967 (citing <em>Fabian, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 274, 609 A.2d 487). Later, the Court stated it was for the jury to decide whether the defendant had \u201cproven that P-22 was not a practical and feasible alternative at the time the foggers left its control.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Later still, the Court pronounced that the defendant had \u201can absolute defense if [it could] prove that ... a safer alternative was neither practical nor feasible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574, 715 A.2d 967. Thus, despite that first sentence that seemingly contradicts <em>Fabian, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>261, 609 A.2d 487, the <em>Lewis, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 544, 715 A.2d 967, decision maintains Fabian\u2019s pronouncement that the focus of a defendant\u2019s burden with respect to the state-of-the-art defense is the practicality and feasibility of the plaintiffs suggested alternative. The judge\u2019s instructions here to the effect that defendant was required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>to prove it complied with the state-of-the-art were perhaps erroneous. Yet, the inquiry does not end here for we must decide whether these unobjected-to instructions, <em>R. </em>1:7-2, had the capacity to confuse or mislead the jury and, as a result, were capable of \u201cprejudicing the substantial right of [defendant!.\u201d <em>Morlino v. Medical Ctr. of Ocean County, </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 125, 684 A.2d 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">We do not think this error had a capacity to confuse or mislead the jury. The alleged defects in the Skilsaw\u2019s design were the absence of a blade brake or flag. If the jury agreed that a blade brake or flag were the state-of-the-art, then the error made no difference because defendant clearly did not comply, and could not have complied, with either. In fact, defendant admitted as much, and it was obvious that the Skilsaw did not comply with the plaintiffs version of the state-of-the-art. The jury would have had to conclude that the brake or flag represented the state-of-the-art because if the jury did not, it would have been compelled to render a defense verdict. Moreover, the Skilsaw at issue complied in every respect with what defendant claimed its version of the state-of-the-art required. For these reasons, we do not think that the charge was capable of any prejudice to defendant. Despite the judge\u2019s possible violation of <em>Fabian v. Minster Mach. Co., </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 261, 609 A.2d 487, and <em>Lewis v. American Cyanamid Co., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 544, 715 A.2d 967, in charging the jury that defendant was required to prove that the Skilsaw complied with the state-of-the-art, the charge was not capable of misleading or confusing the jury to defendant\u2019s detriment. We reject defendant\u2019s appellate challenge to the charge because it could not have prejudiced a substantial right of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">This case was presented to the jury as a defective design case. The competing experts, as our review of the evidence clearly reveals, clashed directly in this design confrontation. Counsel argued the case to the jury on the competing design theories. The judge clearly charged the jury that plaintiff had the burden of proving a design defect. The jury found that the circular saw was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>\u201cdefectively designed\u201d in answer to special interrogatories. The jury found the defective design was \u201ca proximate cause of the accident.\u201d None of the verdict form special interrogatories dealt with the \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d issue. In this case \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d was clearly a subtext of defective design \u2014 a mantra of distraction but not of substance. We are satisfied that the issue of defective design was fairly fought out and clearly resolved by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Defendant contends that the judge committed reversible error when he permitted plaintiff to offer evidence of the saw\u2019s post-accident use despite the fact plaintiff had withheld this information from defendant in discovery. According to defendant, plaintiff expressly denied during discovery having had any information about post-accident use. Plaintiffs attorney had stated on the record at a deposition that he had no such information. Defendant argues that when, at trial, Scott, who testified on plaintiffs behalf, stated he had used the Skilsaw after plaintiffs accident, defendant was \u201csabotaged in a manner that destroyed its credibility in front of the jury.\u201d This is because the testimony came after defendant\u2019s counsel had made his opening statement and cross-examined Howarth. We conclude defendant\u2019s argument is without merit. Defendant never asked plaintiff during the course of discovery if he knew whether anyone had used the Skilsaw after he had been injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">At plaintiffs deposition in April 1993 defense counsel asked him whether the saw was used after the date of his accident. Plaintiff replied: \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you. I was in the hospital.\u201d Later at the deposition, defense counsel informed plaintiffs counsel that he was \u201cinterested in knowing if the saw had been used after the day of the accident.\u201d Plaintiffs counsel replied: \u2018We wouldn\u2019t know that information, anyway. Only Adonis Construction [plaintiffs employer] would know that.\u201d Plaintiffs counsel further stated: \u201cYou can take the deposition of Adonis.\u201d Defense counsel never deposed anyone from Adonis.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Defense counsel did propound interrogatories upon plaintiffs counsel. Defendant states that Interrogatory Nos. 8 and 9 asked for the contents of oral and written statements obtained by plaintiff or anyone acting on his behalf; plaintiff produced none. Defendant also points to Interrogatory Nos. 27 and 28, which sought information about whether the saw had been altered, modified, added to, removed or replaced, and complains that plaintiff \u201csupplied no information about post-accident use of or modification to the saw\u201d in response.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">At trial in December 1996, plaintiffs counsel confirmed that he had spoken to Scott, who informed him that he (Scott) had used the saw subsequent to plaintiffs accident. However, plaintiffs counsel also confirmed that he had not taken any written or recorded statement from Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The information pertaining to post-accident use was never precisely sought through interrogatories. Although Interrogatory Nos. 8 and 9 sought the contents of statements, plaintiffs counsel represented that while he talked to Scott, he did not take any memorialized statement from him. Although Interrogatory Nos. 27 and 28 sought information about whether the saw had been altered, modified, added to, removed or replaced, the questions did not seek information about whether the saw had been used. The interrogatories referenced by defendant do not support its argument that plaintiff failed to disclose that Scott had used the saw after plaintiffs accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">As for plaintiffs counsel\u2019s representation made at his client\u2019s deposition in April 1993 that he did not know whether the saw had been used after plaintiffs accident, there is nothing in this record to contradict the veracity of that statement at the time it was made. Moreover, during the next month, plaintiffs counsel subpoenaed the names of plaintiffs co-workers at Adonis. After plaintiffs counsel had received Adonis\u2019s response to the subpoena, a copy of the response, which identified the co-workers, including Scott, was sent to defendant\u2019s counsel with a letter in which plaintiffs counsel stated he was amending plaintiffs interrogatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>answers to include the co-workers who were identified as \u201cpersons with potential knowledge of the incident inasmuch as those persons were working with plaintiff on the day of the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Finally, though defendant claims that plaintiff testified at trial that he knew that Scott had used the Skilsaw after the accident, the citations to the record actually do not support this contention. In fact, plaintiff merely testified that when he returned to the worksite after the accident to thank his co-workers for assisting him, he observed that the Skilsaw he had been using at the time of his accident was plugged in. Plaintiff did not say that he saw Scott, or anyone else, using the saw.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Regardless of whether defendant had been misled or not, the judge gave an instruction to the jury to disregard the testimony that the saw was plugged in or that plaintiff even observed the saw when he went to the worksite. Plaintiff complains that despite the instruction, the judge later permitted Scott to testify about his own use of the saw after the accident. Scott\u2019s testimony was direct evidence of post-accident use. Plaintiffs testimony clearly was not, which is why the judge instructed the jury to disregard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Defendant was aware of Scott\u2019s identity more than three years before trial. Had defendant\u2019s investigator interviewed Scott during that three-year-period, there would have been no surprise at trial. In addition, the fact remains that defendant never asked plaintiff about post-accident use of the Skilsaw during discovery, and no evidence counters plaintiffs counsel\u2019s statement at the time of the deposition in April 1993 that he did not know whether the saw had been used after the accident. We reject defendant\u2019s contention that the judge committed reversible error when he permitted Scott to testify about his post-accident use of the Skilsaw. The defense could have interviewed Scott before trial and learned this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Defendant contends that the judge committed reversible error by permitting plaintiffs counsel to offer evidence on irrelevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>issues and cross-examine Domeny, defendant\u2019s expert, with bad faith questions. According to defendant, the judge permitted plaintiffs counsel to introduce evidence with respect to and make argument about defendant\u2019s conduct which, defendant claims, is irrelevant in a product liability case. Also, according to defendant, the judge permitted plaintiffs counsel to cross-examine Domeny based upon questions that had no good faith basis. Due to the large number of allegedly objectionable questions (we counted 22), we address them in categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Defendant maintains that it was improper for plaintiffs counsel to question Domeny about whether defendant chose to (1) compete in the \u201ccheaper saw market\u201d; (2) take a \u201ccalculated risk\u201d that it would spend more money paying claims for injuries sustained in a manner similar to that claimed by plaintiff than it would in putting blade brakes on the Skilsaw; (3) how many serious injuries and deaths would have to occur before defendant would change the Skilsaw\u2019s design; (4) whether there would have been no lawsuit if Domeny were a better product safety director; and (5) whether the Skilsaw\u2019s warnings were adequate. Defendant argues that these questions focused on defendant\u2019s conduct, which was not an issue in this product liability case.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Defendant also maintains that plaintiffs counsel \u201cexploited\u201d the answers to these improper questions during his closing argument by arguing that (1) defendant ignored a consumer safety report by designing its saw without a blade brake; (2) defendant was motivated by profit in designing the saw \u201cto the minimum acceptable standard\u201d; (3) defendant decided not to use a blade brake because it would make more money in the \u201ccheaper\u201d saw market than it would paying claims; and (4) that there were insufficient warnings on the saw.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Defendant\u2019s expert, Domeny, was also its employee. A defendant\u2019s employee, if qualified, may serve as its expert. <em>Cf. Corcoran v. Sears Roebuck and Co., </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>117, 134, 711 A.2d 371 (App.Div.1998) (where employee of product manufacturer testified as expert witness). As with any other witness, an expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>is subject to cross-examination. The court has \u201cbroad discretion in determining the sco\u2019pe of cross-examination.\u201d <em>State v. Silva, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>438, 444, 621 A.2d 17 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Though plaintiffs counsel was very hard on Domeny, we do not conclude that his cross-examination of the witness went beyond the bounds of proper cross-examination, except for the \u201cwarnings\u201d questions. Most of plaintiffs counsel\u2019s questions were simply his \u201cspin\u201d or argumentation on answers previously given by Domeny. On direct, Domeny testified that defendant could have made more money selling saws with blade brakes \u2014 thus, plaintiffs counsel\u2019s suggestion on cross-examination that defendant made the decision to participate in the \u201ccheaper\u201d saw market. Domeny also testified that under a risk-utility analysis, there would be more injuries from saws with blade brakes than there would be with saws without blade brakes \u2014 thus, plaintiffs counsel\u2019s inquiry as to the number of injuries that would have to occur for that analysis to change. This no doubt prompted counsel\u2019s argumentative suggestion during closing that defendant was motivated by profit in designing the saw \u201cto the minimum acceptable standard\u201d and decided not to use a blade brake because it would make more money in the \u201ccheaper\u201d saw market than it would paying claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The questions about whether the product would have been safer if Domeny were a better product safety director went to the issue of whether Domeny was biased. \u201cA paramount purpose of cross-examination is the impeachment of the credibility of the witness.\u201d <em>Perna v. Pirozzi, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>446, 456, 457 A.2d 431 (1983). Indeed, cross-examination is generally considered the most effective means of challenging a witness\u2019s credibility. Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment 6 on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>607 (1998-1999) (citing <em>State v. Silva, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>438, 444, 621 A.2d 17 (1993)). Certainly, a witness\u2019s bias may affect credibility. <em>State v. Gorrell, </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>142, 149, 687 A.2d 1016 (App.Div.1996). Again, while these questions were more in the nature of cheap theatrics, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>always with risk to the questioner, than clever cross-examination, they were within the bounds of cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Other than its claim that this action was based upon design defect and did not include a failure-to-warn claim, defendant makes no argument that would support a claim that the judge abused his discretion in permitting the \u201cwarnings\u201d questions to be asked. Though plaintiffs counsel conceded that he was not pursuing a warning claim, Howarth testified on direct examination, with no objection raised, that a flag would have warned plaintiff that the lower guard was not in place. Defendant does not object to this question here. Rather, defendant objects to a series of questions asked of Domeny on cross-examination. Defendant objected to all of these questions. However, defendant fails to mention that, except for a question pertaining to a warning in a manual that the user should support the wood being cut, none was ever answered following the objection. With respect to the question about the manual, the issue of properly supporting the wood was raised by Domeny on direct examination. Certainly, plaintiffs counsel was free to pursue that testimony on cross-examination. The judge did not abuse his discretion in permitting questions to be asked, which ultimately were never answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The questions that defendant claims lacked a \u201cgood faith basis\u201d involved those which suggested that (1) \u201cthe accident occurred in a manner unsupported by the evidence\u201d and (2) Domeny had a personal relationship with defense counsel. These claims are similarly without merit. First, the specific questions defendant objects to on appeal, which did not involve the suggestion that the accident occurred in a certain manner, were rephrased or were not objected to at all. Moreover, the questions pertained to plaintiffs counsel\u2019s exploration of Domeny\u2019s opinion, which was based upon his understanding of how the accident occurred. In addition, Domeny had acknowledged that a wood chip could have jammed the guard. With respect to the questions that \u201csuggested\u201d Domeny\u2019s opinion and investigation were really that of defense counsel, we conclude that, however tacky, they go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>to the issue of bias and credibility and were proper. There is no reason to reverse the judgment based upon plaintiffs counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Domeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Defendant contends that the trial judge committed reversible error when he denied its motion for judgment at the close of all the\u2019 evidence. In support of its contention, defendant argues that \u201creasonable minds could not conclude that plaintiff met his burden of proving a defect in Skil\u2019s product.\u201d In other words, \u201c[b]ased on the evidence presented, reasonable minds could not conclude that the alternative designs plaintiff offered would have made Skil\u2019s product safer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">On a motion for judgment under <em>R. </em>4:40-1, the trial judge \u201cmust accept as true all evidence supporting the position of the non-moving party, according that party the benefit of all legitimate inferences that can be deduced from such evidence.\u201d <em>Rena, Inc. v. Brien, </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>304, 311, 708 A.2d 747 (App.Div.1998). \u201cIf reasonable minds could differ, the court must deny the motion.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Whether this case is governed by the state-of-the-art defense or the risk-utility analysis, plaintiff was required to prove that a feasible and technologically practical alternative design would have made the Skilsaw safer. According to plaintiffs expert, the saw would have been safer if it had a blade brake or a safety flag. According to defendant\u2019s expert, a blade brake would have made the saw dangerous in other respects, and a flag handle would not have lasted. This was enough to get the matter to a jury. <em>Lewis v. American Cyanamid, Co., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 576, 715 A.2d 967. Thus, the judge did not commit reversible error when he denied defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Defendant takes issue with the specifics of plaintiffs proofs. For example, he challenges Howarth\u2019s use of the Ambiteeh brake on the grounds that no one uses it. Defendant\u2019s contention concerning the Ambiteeh brake is spurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>First, Howarth had the Ambitech blade brake with him as an <em>example </em>of an electric brake that he could show the jury. Indeed, he refused to use the Ambitech brake with the saw because he did not \u201cknow the rating on this particular switch in comparison to the current on that particular saw\u201d and because the brake and the saw must be designed together. Defense counsel expressly stated that he had no problem with Howarth\u2019s explaining the concept of a blade brake and showing the Ambitech device to the jury. Ultimately, defense counsel withdrew his objection to the demonstration of the blade brake with the Ambitech device though it appeared he did so only for purposes of moving the matter along for his schedule\u2019s sake.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Second, despite the lack of \u201cproof\u2019 that the Ambitech brake was used by other saw manufacturers, it was undisputed that other circular saw manufacturers did use blade brakes of some kind. Howarth testified that \u201cif not that one [Ambitech], a blade brake certainly could be designed into the saw, and has been in other saws.\u201d While he testified that other manufacturers used blade brakes, he never said that they used Ambitech brakes. Plaintiffs counsel acknowledged that the particular device could not be used on the Skilsaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Defendant also urges that reasonable minds could not \u201cinfer a defect from the custom of industry\u201d because the evidence showed only that a few manufacturers used blade brakes, and plaintiff failed to show the risks and utility of the alternative design. Howarth testified that he could not envision any increased risk from the incorporation of a blade brake into a portable circular saw. He testified the utility of such a saw was it would stop the blade from spinning the moment the trigger was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Defendant also criticizes Howarth\u2019s interpretation of its data with respect to the failure of the switches. Defendant claims that Howarth misinterpreted the data. This was for the jury to determine. Clearly, defendant cannot criticize Howarth for relying upon defendant\u2019s own data. To say that Howarth relied upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>surmise because he misinterpreted data is not the same as saying that Howarth relied upon surmise because he used no data.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Defendant\u2019s claim that there was \u201cno factual basis for the jury to reasonably conclude that Mr. Howarth\u2019s accident reconstruction was accurate\u201d is also rejected. The law merely requires that the opinion be stated in terms of probability. <em>Malin v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>428, 439, 530 A.2d 794 (App.Div.1987). Howarth stated his opinion in terms of a probability. Although it could not have been based upon direct evidence, the opinion was based upon the writings of others, including manufacturers of portable circular saws. Moreover, defendant\u2019s own expert agreed that a wood chip could have caused the accident. There was enough basis in Howarth\u2019s testimony for the defect issue to go to a jury. <em>Lewis v. American Cyanamid Co., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 576, 715 A.2d 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">5.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Defendant next contends that it should have been permitted to raise a comparative negligence defense. Defendant argues that under <em>Suter v. San Angelo Foundry &amp; Machine Co., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>150, 406 A.2d 140 (1979), comparative negligence remains a viable defense in a workplace setting so long as the plaintiff is not a factory worker who was injured while performing an assigned task on a factory machine. Defendant further argues that the Products Liability Act \u201cdid not address comparative fault principles and ... was not intended to alter <em>Suter.\u201d </em>Finally, defendant argues that we misinterpreted \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s intent and actions\u201d in <em>Tirrell v. Navistar Intern., Inc., </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>390, 591 <em>A.2d </em>643 (App.Div.). Defendant asserts that it did not raise this issue at trial because the judge was bound to follow <em>Tirrell v. Navistar Intern. </em>Thus, defendant argues there would be no prejudice if this court exercised its original jurisdiction and considered the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">We usually do not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal unless they go to jurisdiction, are of great public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>importance, or involve plain error on the part of the trial court. <em>R. </em>2:10-2; <em>Scott v. Salerno, </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437, 446-47, 688 A.2d 614 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>409, 694 A.2d 194 (1997). Defendant does not address any of these factors. However, despite defendant\u2019s claim that it did not raise the issue below, prior to trial, the issue was raised before Judge Sweeney, who had granted plaintiffs motion in limine to bar defendant from putting on a comparative negligence defense. Moreover, we are interested in addressing this issue since we permitted amicus briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In 1972, the Supreme Court of New Jersey considered whether the comparative negligence defense was applicable in a products liability case. <em>Bexiga v. Havir Manufacturing Corp., </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>402, 290 A.2d 281 (1972). In that case, John Bexiga, Jr., a minor, injured his hand while operating a punch press. <em>Id. </em>at 404, 290 A.2d 281. His father sued the manufacturer of the press on several grounds, including strict liability in tort. The machine had no safety devices that would have prevented John Jr.\u2019s injuries. The plaintiffs expert testified that there were two devices available that would have prevented John Jr.\u2019s accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The trial judge dismissed the action at the close of the plaintiffs case. We affirmed. The Supreme Court of New Jersey reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">One of the issues before the Supreme Court was whether John Jr. was contributorily negligent in the operation of the press. <em>Ibid. </em>In addressing this issue, the Court observed that \u201c[cjontributory negligence may be a defense to a strict liability action as well as to a negligence action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412, 290 A.2d 281. Yet, the <em>Bexiga </em>Court held the defense inapplicable to the facts of that case because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">The asserted negligence of plaintiff: \u2014 placing his hand under the ram while at the same time depressing the foot pedal \u2014 was the very eventuality the safety devices were designed to guard against. It would be anomalous to hold that defendant has a duty to install safety devices but a breach of that duty results in no liability for the very injury the duty was meant to protect against.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">In <em>Cepeda v. Cumberland Engineering Co., Inc., </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>152, 386 A.2d 816 (1978), the Supreme Court expressly acknowledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the assumption of the risk defense in strict liability actions. There, the plaintiff machine operator sued the manufacturer of a pelletizing machine for damages resulting from the loss of four of his fingers while operating the machine. <em>Id. </em>at 160, 386 A.2d 816. The machine in <em>Cepeda </em>had a guard that would have prevented the accident. <em>Id. </em>at 160-61, 386 A.2d 816. However, the guard had been removed. <em>Id. </em>at 161, 386 A.2d 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">While the plaintiff knew that the guard had been removed, he had not removed it. <em>Id. </em>at 165, 386 A.2d 816. The defendant claimed that (1) it was not reasonably foreseeable that the machine would have been operated without the guard, and (2) the plaintiff was contributorily negligent in having operated the machine without the guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The jury awarded the plaintiff $125,000. We reversed the judgment entered in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, holding that the manufacturer could not be held responsible for the plaintiff\u2019s use of the machine without the guard, which we considered \u201c \u2018unforeseeable negligence\u2019 \u201d on his part. <em>Id. </em>at 162, 386 A.2d 816 (quoting <em>Cepeda v. Cumberland Engineering Company, Inc., </em>138 <em>N.J.Super. </em>344, 351, 351 A.2d 22 (App.Div.1976)). The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the matter for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 194, 386 A.2d 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">After reviewing various strict liability cases in which contributory negligence either was or was not a valid defense, the Court stated that assumption of the risk was (1) a defense to strict liability in tort actions and (2) \u201cconventionally expressed\u201d as \u201ccontributory negligence, in its broad aspect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183-85, 386 A.2d 816. The Supreme Court rejected the plaintiffs argument that <em>Bexiga v. Havir Manufacturing Corp., </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>at 402, 290 A.2d 281, required the \u201crejection of the defense of contributory negligence, even in its limited assumption of risk aspect, as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186-87, 386 A.2d 816. The Court explained why John Jr. (in <em>Bexiga, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>at 402, 290 A.2d 281) had not assumed any risk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">The plaintiff was not unreasonable in working the machine; either he worked it \u2018as is\u2019 or he had no job. There is no indication that the unsafety of the machine was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>known to him. He did not voluntarily expose himself to a known danger. His negligence, if any, was in the inadvertent contact with the foot pedal \u2014 conduct characteristically not a bar under the contributory negligence distinction----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 188, 386 A.2d 816.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">The Court further explained why a jury could have found that the plaintiff in <em>Cepeda v. Cumberland Engineering Co., Inc., </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 188, 886 A.2d 816, had assumed the risk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">The evidence here would permit a jury to find that plaintiff knew the purpose of the guard, knew it was off the machine when he came to work and also that he had been warned that he could be seriously injured if he worked the machine without the guard. The jury could also infer that plaintiff could have had the guard placed back on the machine by calling the attention of the foreman to the matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">In short, the <em>Cepeda </em>Court was steadfast in its commitment to \u201cthe continuance of unreasonable voluntary exposure of oneself to a known danger as a defense to strict liability in tort.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189-90, 386 A.2d 816. One year later, <em>Cepeda </em>was reversed. <em>Suter v. San Angelo Foundry &amp; Machine Co., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>150, 406 A.2d 140 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">In <em>Suter, </em>the Supreme Court considered \u201cthe impact of the Comparative Negligence Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:15-5.1 to 5.3, in strict liability actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153, 406 A.2d 140. In that case, the plaintiff, another machine operator, instituted an action for strict liability in tort against the defendant manufacturer of an industrial sheet metal rolling machine in which his hand was caught. <em>Id. </em>at 154, 406 A.2d 140. At trial, the judge charged the jury that the plaintiff \u201cwould be guilty of contributory negligence if he had not exercised that degree of care which a reasonably prudent person would have exercised under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The jury found the plaintiff and the defendant equally at fault. After the verdict, the trial judge denied the plaintiffs motion to dismiss the contributory negligence defense and, applying the principles of comparative negligence, reduced the plaintiff\u2019s award by one-half.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">The plaintiff appealed, and we modified the award to the whole amount of damages, holding that under <em>Bexiga v. Havir Manufacturing Corp., </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>at 402, 290 A.2d 281, the contributory negligence defense was unavailable to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 155, 406 A.2d 140. The Supreme Court affirmed and expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>reversed <em>Cepeda v. Cumberland Engineering Co., Inc., </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 152, 386 A.2d 816. <em>Id. </em>at 177, 406 A.2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In <em>Suter, </em>the plaintiff was injured when he accidently brushed against a gear lever, which activated the rollers on the machine, while attempting to remove something from the machine. <em>Id. </em>at 157, 406 A.2d 140. The plaintiff\u2019s expert testified that there were two methods available which would have prevented the accidental activation of the machine\u2019s rollers. Though the defendant\u2019s expert agreed with the plaintiffs, he testified that the accident occurred because the plaintiff had \u201cplaced himself in an unsafe position while reaching inside the cylinder without first cutting off the power to the machine.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The Supreme Court began its analysis by reviewing the types of conduct that \u201cmay constitute contributory negligence in a strict liability suit.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court observed that contributory negligence is unavailable when the plaintiff merely failed to discover the product\u2019s defect or guard against the possibility of the defect\u2019s existence. The Court further observed that \u201cgenerally where a plaintiff with actual knowledge of the danger presented by the defective product knowingly and voluntarily encounters that risk, a trial court should submit the defense of contributory negligence to the jury.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court distinguished assumption of the risk, as a defense, from a plaintiffs unintended and unforeseeable misuse of the product, which \u201csheds no light on whether the product is reasonably fit and safe for its intended or reasonably anticipated use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159, 406 A.2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The Supreme Court held that \u201cthe Comparative Negligence Act is applicable to strict liability actions in those circumscribed areas in which plaintiffs conduct may be found to constitute contributory negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164, 406 A.2d 140. After concluding that the plaintiff, who was intimately familiar with the machine, had operated it as many as a thousand times, was in charge of the operation, and was operating the machine carelessly would not be guilty of contributory negligence under <em>Cepeda v. Cumberland Engineering Co., Inc., </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 152, 386 A.2d 816, the <em>Suter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Court noted the anomaly: \u201cCepeda, who was operating the machine carefully, may be barred from recovery. Suter, though careless, cannot be.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166, 406 A.2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">It should not matter whether the manufacturer\u2019s duty is to prevent an employee from coming into contact with dangerous machine parts or to prevent an employee from accidentally setting a dangerous machine in motion. In the one instance, the risk is that the employee who knows the machine is or will accidentally get his hands caught in the machine and in the other that the employee will accidentally activate the machine, with the same consequences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">\n<em>ram</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-10\">In our view an employee engaged at his assigned task on a plant machine, as <em>in Bexiga, </em>has no meaningful choice. Irrespective of the rationale that the employee may have unreasonably and voluntarily encountered a known risk, we hold as a matter of policy that such an employee is not guilty of contributory negligence. Accordingly, we reject <em>Cepeda\u2019s </em>limitation of <em>Bexiga </em>to those cases where there was no \u2018indication that the unsafety of the machine was known\u2019 to the employee. 76 <em>N.J. </em>at 188, 386 <em>A.2d 816.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 167, 406 A.2d 140 (some citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">The Court explained its holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-13\">The imposition of a duty on the manufacturer to make the machine safe to operate whether by installing a guard or, as in <em>Cepeda, </em>by making it inoperable without a guard, <em>means </em>that the law does not accept the employee\u2019s ability to take care of himself as an adequate safeguard of interests which society seeks to protect. The policy justification for <em>Bexiga </em>is sound. We see no reason to depart from <em>Bexiga\u2019s </em>elimination of contributory negligence where an employee is injured due to a defect (whether design or otherwise) in an industrial accident while using a machine for its intended or foreseeable purposes. The defendant manufacturer should not be permitted to escape from the breach of its duty to an employee while carrying out his assigned task under these circumstances when observance of that duty would have prevented the very accident which occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-14\"><em>[Id. </em>at 167-68, 406 A.2d 140.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-15\"><em>Suter\u2019s </em>holding was restated in <em>Green v. Sterling Extruder Corp., </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>263, 264, 471 A.2d 15 (1984), where Justice Clifford wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-16\">Under the current state of our law in the strict liability context, contributory negligence in any of its varied forms (excluding, of course, any intentional or willful act) will not foreclose a factory worker who is injured while using a defective machine for a reasonably foreseeable purpose from recovering against the machine's manufacturer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>In 1987, the New Jersey Legislature passed the New Jersey Products Liability Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:58C-1 to -7, now <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-1 to -11. The act was not \u201cintended to codify all issues relating to product liability, but only to deal with matters that require[d] clarification.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:58C-l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The act did not alter the elimination of the contributory negligence defense to actions in which a factory worker was injured while using a machine for a reasonably foreseeable purpose. <em>Cf. Johansen v. Makita USA, Inc., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>86, 94-95, 98, 607 A.2d 637 (1992). However, evidence pertaining to the plaintiffs use of the product was admissible to show that plaintiffs conduct, rather than any defect in the product, was the proximate cause of the accident. <em>Id. </em>at 103, 607 A.2d 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">By 1993, our Supreme Court continued to recognize that a plaintiffs comparative fault in cases where the plaintiff was injured in the workplace \u201cwhile using a machine in a reasonably foreseeable manner\u201d remained \u201cirrelevant.\u201d <em>Jurado v.

In the meantime, however, we had expressly recognized that <em>Suter v. San Angelo Foundry &amp; Machine Co., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 150, 406 A.2d 140, should not be limited to plaintiffs who were working (1) in a factory (2) at an assigned task (3) on a plant machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">In <em>Crumb v.

The \u201crisk\u201d referred to \u201csitting cross-legged and cutting logs in the immediate proximity of his thigh.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527, 499 A.2d 530. The jury answered \u201cyes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 526, 499 A.2d 530. Ultimately, the plaintiffs complaint was dismissed because the jury found him sixty percent responsible for the accident. We vacated the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Though we vacated the dismissal, we disagreed with the plaintiffs blanket assertion that under <em>Suter v. San Angelo Foundry &amp; Machine Co., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 150, 406 A.2d 140, \u201chis conduct should not be assessed at all since he was engaged in an employment task at the time of his injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527, 499 A.2d 530. We said: \u201cThe test of <em>Suter </em>is not simply whether plaintiff was injured while performing a task in the course of his employment. Such is a workers\u2019 compensation standard, not that applied in a products liability case.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">After quoting <em>Suter'</em>s holding, we stated that the \u201cessence of the <em>Suter </em>rule is that the employee had no meaningful choice.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cHe either worked at his assigned task or was subject to discipline or being labelled as a troublemaker.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Ultimately, we did not reach the \u201cmeaningful choice\u201d issue because the plaintiff had chosen to use his own saw. <em>Id. </em>at 528, 499 A.2d 530. Nonetheless, we found that the plaintiff was not contributorily negligent because the guard \u201cwas designed to protect against the precise inadvertent motion that resulted in plaintiffs accident, <em>ie., </em>one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>that would bring an unguarded blade in contact with the user.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Since <em>Crumb </em>we have continued to state the <em>Suter </em>holding in broader terms. <em>Grier v. Cochran Western Corp., </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>308, 324, 705 A.2d 1262 (App.Div.1998) (\u201ca plaintiff who sustains an injury from a defective product in a work setting will not have his or her recovery diminished under comparative negligence principles for having allegedly encountered a known risk\u201d); <em>Congiusti v. Ingersoll-Rand Co., </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 134, 703 A.2d 340 (\u201cno question that the comparative negligence of a plaintiff is generally disregarded in a workplace setting\u201d); <em>Fabian v. Minster Mach. Co., Inc., </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 278, 609 A.2d 487 (comparative negligence not applicable where employee is injured at \u201cworkplace task\u201d); <em>Tirrell v. Navistar Intern., Inc., </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 390, 591 A.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">In <em>Tirrell v. Navistar Intern., Inc., </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 394, 591 A.2d 643, Walter Tirrell was killed when a tractor-trailer ran over him while backing up. At the time of the accident, Tirrell and a co-worker were talking to their foreman at a jobsite where they had recently arrived. The tractor-trailer was delivering a backhoe the co-worker was to operate and Tirrell was to maintain.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Tirrell\u2019s widow instituted a product liability action against the manufacturer of the tractor-trailer. She claimed the tractor-trailer was defectively designed; the manufacturer had failed to install a back-up signal. The jury awarded her more than $2 million. The manufacturer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The witnesses agreed that the tractor-trailer had blind spots. Plaintiffs expert testified that a tractor-trailer with blind spots could be backed up safely only if there were a signal person or a distinctive audible alarm. There was no signal person observing the tractor-trailer at the time of the accident. The type of alarm described by plaintiffs expert had been available for thirty years, would not have affected the tractor-trailer\u2019s utility, and was both inexpensive and easy to install.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>On appeal, the defendant contended that it was not subject to the <em>Suter </em>ban on the employee\u2019s comparative negligence defense because Tirrell \u201cwas neither responsible for nor directly concerned with the operation of the trailer.\u201d <em>Tirrell v. Navistar Intern., Inc., </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 399-400, 591 A.2d 643. We rejected the defendant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">In rejecting the defendant\u2019s contention in <em>Tirrell </em>that <em>Suter </em>had limited the \u201cemployee exception\u201d to the comparative negligence defense to \u201c \u2018an employee engaged at his assigned task on a plant machine,\u2019 \u201d <em>Tirrell v. Navistar Intern., Inc., </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 400, 591 A.2d 643 (citing <em>Suter v. San Angelo Foundry &amp; Machine Co., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 167, 406 A.2d 140), we first referred to the following Assembly and Senate Statements accompanying the Act: \u201cIn particular, sections 2 through 4 are not intended to affect the holding in <em>[Suter </em>], with respect to the application of the principle of comparative fault in cases involving workplace injuries.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Accordingly, \u201cby the Legislature\u2019s use of the term \u2018workplace injuries,\u2019 any limitation of the <em>Suter </em>principle to a factory setting would now clearly be inappropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401, 591 A.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">We also considered and rejected the question of whether a plaintiff should \u201ccontinue to be absolved from a workplace injury when he voluntarily and unreasonably encounters a known risk.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Although resolution of this question was \u201cless clear from the text of the Act,\u201d we noted in <em>Tirrell </em>that \u201cthe Committee Statements indicate that the Legislature did not want to change the comparative fault rules of <em>Suter.\u201d Ibid. </em>We continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">Furthermore, in <em>Crumb, </em>we interpreted the <em>Suter </em>principle:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">The essence of the <em>Suter </em>rule is that the employee had no meaningful choice. He either worked at his assigned task or was subject to discipline or being labelled as a troublemaker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 527, 499 A.2d 530. It is true that had decedent known that there was no back-up alarm on the trailer, he could have refused to work on the job. But, as we noted in <em>Crumb, </em>such action could subject him to disciplinary action or other adverse consequences. He had no meaningful choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-13\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">In <em>Tirrell, </em>we skirted the assumption of risk issue by noting that a back-up alarm \u201cwas not meant to warn an attentive worker\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>but instead \u201cwas meant to attract the attention of inattentive persons in the area of the danger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401-02, 591 A.2d 643. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">Even if decedent had known that he was working with a trailer without a back-up alarm, and the <em>Suter </em>employer comparative fault rule were inapplicable, it would be against public policy, as expressed in <em>Bexiga, Suter, </em>and then- progeny, for decedent to be barred by a finding that he proceeded in the face of a known danger under the circumstances of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 402, 591 A.2d 643.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Other decisions have permitted plaintiffs to recover without a bar for injuries that occurred in non-factory workplace settings even though they were not performing an assigned task on a factory machine. Consider, for example, <em>Mettinger v. W.W. Lowensten, Inc., </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>293, 678 A.2d 1115 (App.Div.1996), <em>aff'd, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>371, 709 A.2d 779 (1998). In that case, the plaintiff-employee lacerated his hand when, as he was emptying a trash can, he slipped and lost his balance. <em>Id. </em>at 301, 678 A.2d 1115. \u201cInstinctively, he reached out with his right arm to grab something to steady himself.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>That \u201csomething\u201d turned out to be an operating slicing machine. <em>Ibid. </em>We observed that the trial judge properly declined to give a comparative negligence charge to the jury because comparative negligence \u201cis not applicable to a workplace setting where the worker has no meaningful choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312, 678 A.2d 1115.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">In <em>Grier v. Cochran Western Corp., </em>308 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 313-14, 705 A.2d 1262, the plaintiff-employee was injured when he stepped off a conveyor belt leading from the cargo hold of a plane and fell thirteen to fourteen feet below. At the time of the accident, the belt\u2019s guardrail was not in the raised position. We held that the trial judge properly instructed the jury that the \u201cplaintiffs conduct was irrelevant to the question of whether the product was defective, and that plaintiffs conduct was to be considered only on the issue of proximate cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325, 705 A.2d 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">Although defendant correctly asserts that the Products Liability Act did not alter <em>Suter v. San Angelo Foundry &amp; Machine Co., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 150, 406 A.2d 140, its assertion that the comparative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>negligence defense is precluded only when the employed is a factory worker who was injured while performing an assigned task on a machine on the shop floor too narrowly construes <em>Suter </em>and ignores what the <em>Crumb v. Black &amp; Decker (U.S., Inc.), </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 521, 499 A.2d 530, court described as \u201cthe essence\u201d of Suter\u2019s holding, namely \u201cthat the employee had no meaningful choice.\u201d Indeed, the <em>Suter </em>Court did not limit its holding to factory workers who are injured during an \u201cassigned task on a plant machine.\u201d <em>Suter v. San Angelo Foundry &amp; Machine Co., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 167, 406 A.2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In <em>Suter </em>the Supreme Court expressly left open the possibility that there would be \u201cother situations wherein an employee may similarly be held to have had no meaningful choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167 n. 5, 406 A.2d 140. Indeed, it would be ludicrous to allow a factory employee to recover but not a construction worker solely because the former works inside a building on the factory floor. It would be equally ludicrous and unjust to permit an employee to recover for injuries sustained by a freestanding, stationary machine but not by a hand-held saw. Of course, the essence of <em>Suter </em>is whether the employee had a meaningful choice. Therefore, the holding in <em>Tirrell v. Navistar Intern., Inc., </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 390, 591 A.2d 643, is consistent with <em>Suter </em>which cannot be read to apply only to factory workers injured while performing assigned tasks on factory machines on the factory floor. Defendant\u2019s claim that the <em>Crumb </em>panel ruled that \u201ccomparative fault was a defense to an employee\u2019s claim <em>because </em>he was hurt in a non-factory workplace\u201d is simply inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">We conclude <em>Tirrell </em>is consistent with <em>Suter, </em>and plaintiff should not be barred from recovery solely because he did not work in a factory. In short, <em>Suter </em>is not \u201cdisturbed\u201d by <em>Tirrell v. Navistar Intern., Inc., </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 390, 591 A.2d 643. <em>Tirrell </em>represents the movement of <em>Suter </em>to the next logical step, which was left open in footnote 5 of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">However, defendant offered evidence that the Skilsaw had been purposely wedged open. This evidence goes beyond mere negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>gence. Indeed, the wedging theory presented by defendant goes to an intentional act on the part of plaintiff that would have created the very situation that gave rise to the accident. Plaintiff testified that he knew about wedging open the lower guard. In other words, had plaintiff wedged open the lower guard, he would have voluntarily proceeded to encounter a known risk \u2014 a risk he had purposely created. This type of conduct is not exempted by <em>Suter </em>or <em>Tirrell. </em>However, defendant\u2019s argument does not seem to be based upon a knowing and voluntary assumption of the risk. Instead, it appears to be based upon plaintiffs <em>negligence </em>and defendant\u2019s desire to have fault apportioned between the parties even though defendant, at one point, mentions plaintiffs assumption of the risk. While plaintiffs alleged wedging of the guard, if proven, would have constituted misuse of the product on plaintiffs part, the misuse was obviously foreseeable to defendant inasmuch as Domeny testified that he had seen workers wedge open lower guards. Yet, misuse goes to the issue of proximate cause, a jury charge defendant does not challenge. <em>Jurado v. Western Gear Works, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>at 389, 619 A.2d 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The judge properly refused to give the jury a comparative negligence charge based upon plaintiffs conduct. Whether he should have given an assumption of the risk charge is not at issue and, in any event, the charge would have been based upon plaintiffs misuse of the product, which really goes to the issue of proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">6.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Defendant contends that the <em>Tirrell </em>decision violates the separation of powers clause of the New Jersey Constitution, as well as the due process and equal protection clauses of the New Jersey and United States Constitutions. This issue was not raised below.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Defendant argues that the Comparative Negligence Act \u201cgave product manufacturers the right to assert this defense in all product liability actions,\u201d yet the <em>Tirrell </em>decision \u201cusurped the Legislature\u2019s function and violated the Separation of Powers Clause of the New Jersey Constitution\u201d when it \u201cstruck the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>comparative negligence defense in all workplace settings.\u201d The usurpation of the Legislature\u2019s function in turn deprived defendant of its property rights without due process as required by the United States Constitution. Thus, the <em>Tirrell </em>panel, according to defendant, violated the New Jersey and United States Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">According to defendant, the Comparative Negligence Act, which was adopted in 1973, provided that a plaintiffs own negligence would not bar his or her recovery in a negligence action unless the plaintiffs negligence were greater than the defendant\u2019s. Defendant notes the <em>Suter </em>Court\u2019s use of the word \u201cnegligence\u201d in the decision. Indeed, the <em>Suter </em>Court expressly held that \u201cthe Comparative Negligence Act is applicable to strict liability actions in those circumscribed areas in which plaintiffs conduct may be found to constitute contributory negligence.\u201d <em>Suter v. San Angelo Foundry &amp; Machine Co., </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 164, 406 A.2d 140. But, defendant overlooks the <em>Suter </em>Court\u2019s recognition that \u201cthe nature of that contributory negligence is sharply circumscribed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 158, 406 A.2d 140. Indeed, the defense is available only when the plaintiff \u201cwith actual knowledge of the danger presented by the defective product knowingly and voluntarily encounters that risk.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, comparative negligence has always remained alive and well in strict liability actions, albeit in a restricted fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Defendant is of the mistaken belief that <em>Tirrell, </em>\u201cruled that ... comparative negligence must be barred in all workplace settings.\u201d To the contrary, the court there expressly stated that such a ruling \u201cwould require us to reconsider the <em>Suter </em>rule, an action which the court has shunned since 1979.\u201d <em>Tirrell v. Navistar Intern., Inc., </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 401, 591 A.2d 643. Because <em>Tirrell </em>did not \u201c[e]liminat[e] comparative negligence in all workplace settings,\u201d defendant\u2019s argument that it has been deprived of a property interest without due process falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">For the same reasons, defendant\u2019s equal protection argument is also rejected; it rests upon the same faulty premise. In addition, it should be axiomatic that, unless a product manufacturer can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>prove otherwise, an employee really has no meaningful choice when asked by the employer to perform a task, whether indoors or outdoors, with a machine or piece of equipment belonging to the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Amicus Curiae Product Liability Advisory Council, Inc. (Council) argues that the 1995 amendments to the Comparative Negligence Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-5.2 to 5.8, which expressly included strict liability actions within the types of actions subject to the comparative negligence defense, requires the reconsideration of <em>Suter. </em>The Council\u2019s argument is without merit. First, the amended statute applies only to causes of actions filed on or after June 29, 1995. L.1997, c. 90 \u00a7 2; L.1995, c. 140, \u00a7 3. This action was filed in 1992. Second, although the <em>Suter </em>Court spoke in terms of comparative negligence, the exception that it carved out in strict liability actions did not involve comparative negligence at all. Instead, the exception pertained to a plaintiffs voluntary assumption of a known risk, which does not involve negligence. <em>Lewis v. American Cyanamid Co., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 558-59, 715 A.2d 967 (comparative negligence requires a showing that plaintiff \u201cvoluntarily and unreasonably encountered [a] known risk\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The Council also argues that <em>Suter </em>was an \u201cambivalen[t]\u201d decision and that it \u201cdiverges from the mainstream of modern jurisprudence.\u201d Regardless, <em>Suter </em>remains controlling law in New Jersey, <em>Lewis v. American Cyanamid Co., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 558-59, 715 A.2d 967, and may only be modified or rejected by our highest Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
