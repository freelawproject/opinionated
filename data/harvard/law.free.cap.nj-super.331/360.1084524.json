On June 10, 1999, the Family Part entered an order requiring defendant to appear at 1:30 p.m. on July 29,1999 \u201cto provide testimony as to why the Court should not enter an order terminating [his] parental rights\u201d to L.R.N. The record reflects that defendant had been served personally in court at a prior proceeding with the order scheduling the guardianship proceeding for July 29, 1999. In addition, notice of the proceedings had also been sent to T.R.\u2019s home by regular and certified mail. On July 29,1999, T.R. failed to appear and the Family Part judge entered a default against him \u201cwith the understanding that he may apply within 30 days to vacate the default____\u201d Subsequently, it appears that the default was vacated after T.R.\u2019s attorney advised the court that T.R. claimed he was not present on July 29, 1999 because he had been involved in an accident on July 28,1999.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Thereafter, T.R.\u2019s attorney sent notice by regular and certified mail to defendant that the guardianship proceedings had been rescheduled for September 13,1999. On September 13,1999, T.R. again failed to appear. Consequently, the judge entered a default, allowed his counsel to be relieved, and directed the Division to proceed with its termination case on a default basis. At the conclusion of the proof hearing, the judge did not make any findings of fact or conclusions of law; he simply entered an order on September 27, 1999, concluding that the Division \u201chas met all of the standards for termination of parental rights as established by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1\u201d and that it was in \u201cthe best interests of the minor\u201d that T.R.\u2019s parental rights be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">T.R. did not file a motion for reconsideration or move to vacate the entry of the default judgment terminating his parent rights to L.R.N. and conferring guardianship over the child to the Division. Instead, he filed this appeal challenging the adequacy of the notice to him of the guardianship proceeding, arguing that the trial court should have ordered counsel to serve him personally with notice of the new trial date and that the inadequacy of the notice \u201cdeprived him of an opportunity to be heard regarding this most important issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">We conclude that defendant\u2019s challenge to the notice procedure employed by the trial court is clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E). '</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">In addition, to the extent T.R.\u2019s appeal attempts to overturn the default judgment on this appeal by arguing the merits, we reject the attempt. Notably, defendant does not explain why he failed to appear. Neither does he provide us with any evidence to contradict the experts\u2019 opinions upon which the trial judge presumably relied in terminating his parental rights, except to state that he has always maintained visitation with L.R.N.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">However, the rule in New Jersey is that a direct appeal will not lie from a judgment by default. <em>Haber v. Haber, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>413, 416, 601 A.2d 1199 (App.Div.1992) (citing <em>McDer</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>mott v. City of Paterson, </em>122 <em>N.J.L. </em>81, 84, 4 A.2d 306 (E. &amp; A.1939)). The proper course was for T.R. to apply to the trial court for relief from the default judgment pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:50-1 where he was obligated to demonstrate both excusable neglect and a meritorious defense. In <em>Haber, </em>quoting the court of Errors and Appeals, Judge Keefe stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\">The reason underlying this rule is that the very theory and constitution of a court of appellate jurisdiction is only the correction of errors which a court below may have committed, and a court below cannot be said to have committed an error when its judgment was never called into exercise, and the point of law was never taken into consideration, but was abandoned by acquiescence or default of the party who raised it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 416, 601 A.2d 1199.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">As we observed in <em>Haber, </em>the trial judge is in the best position to decide the merits of a defaulted defendant\u2019s arguments, and the \u201c[djefendant\u2019s voluntary conduct in absenting himself from the proceedings should not give him a better advantage on direct appeal than he would have as a movant under <em>R. </em>4:50-1 where he is obligated to prove both excusable neglect and a meritorious defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417, 601 A.2d 1199.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal without prejudice and grant leave to T.R. to file a motion under <em>R. </em>4:50-1 to vacate the default judgment. We do not take any position as to whether such an application should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">However, we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge the significant effect our disposition here may have on L.R.N. in the sense that it will undoubtedly cause delay in securing his permanent placement should defendant seek relief from the default judgment in the Family Part. <em>See Matter of K.H.O., </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>337, 364 fn. 1, 736 A.2d 1246 (1999) (noting that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:40-15.1 has been amended \u201cplacing an emphasis on permanent placement\u201d). With this in mind, we therefore direct the following accelerated proceedings to be implemented should defendant file a motion for relief from the judgment under <em>R. </em>4:50. <em>See Enourato v. New Jersey Bldg. Authority, </em>182 <em>N.J.Super. </em>58, 66, 440 A.2d 42 (App.Div.1981), <em>aff'd </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>396, 448 A.2d 449 (1982) (citing <em>DeSimone v. Greater Englewood Housing Corp. No. 1, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>428, 267 A.2d 31, (1970)) (noting that <em>R. </em>1:1-2 and 2:9-2 permits a court to accelerate proceedings when a prompt final disposition is required).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">If defendant determines to challenge the default judgment, defendant shall file his motion to vacate within twenty days of the date of our filing this decision. The Family Part shall consider and decide the motion within five days of hearing the application. If the motion is denied, the Family Part judge shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, stating the reasons why defendant has not demonstrated both excusable neglect and a meritorious defense, which shall include a full explanation of the basis for the judge\u2019s decision to terminate defendant\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">If defendant decides to appeal from the denial of his motion under <em>R. 4:50, he </em>shall file his notice of appeal within five days of receipt of the order denying the relief and shall order a transcript of the proceedings on an expedited basis. Briefs shall be exchanged twenty days after receipt of the transcript and the matter shall be set down for oral argument on this court\u2019s first available calendar after the appeal is perfected.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The appeal is dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-7\"> However, nowhere in the record does he claim that he did not receive such notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\"> The Division, however, disputed that account, countering that L.R.N. had been seen by a Division caseworker on July 29, 1999 at which time T.R. is purported to have stated that he had forgotten about the court date.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
