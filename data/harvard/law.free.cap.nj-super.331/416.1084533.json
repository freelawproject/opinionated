After plaintiff bought the property at the foreclosure sale, they entered into a contract to sell the property. Egnasko closed the sale and accepted a settlement check for $87,293.56 on plaintiffs behalf. The settlement check payable to William Leeds, Carol Leeds, and Isabel Gibbs,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was a United Jersey Bank teller\u2019s check drawn at that bank\u2019s Hackensack, New Jersey branch. Summit Bank is the successor-in-interest to United Jersey Bank (hereinafter \u201cSummit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Following the closing, and unknown to Leeds, Egnasko altered the settlement check by typing \u201c * * *Louis Egnasko, as attorney for* * * \u201d above the payee line, so that the check then read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH_\">* * \"LOUIS EGNASKO AS ATTORNEY FOR* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACfV\">* \"WILLIAM LEEDS, CAROL LEEDS, ISABEL GIBBS* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Egnasko alone endorsed the check \u201cfor deposit only, 067003443\u201d and deposited the check into his attorney trust account at Chemical Bank. Chemical Bank stamped the back of the check \u201cEndorsement guaranteed.\u201d Defendant Chase Manhattan Bank is the successor-in-interest to Chemical Bank (hereinafter \u201cChase\u201d). Chase presented the check for collection in the ordinary course, and Summit honored its own teller\u2019s check. The check was negotiated between May 8 and May 16,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">On June 6, 1996, Egnasko drew a check for $92,050 payable to William and Carol Leeds from an attorney trust account he held at the Trust Company of New Jersey (Trasteo). This check apparently covered the proceeds of the sale of the home. Trasteo honored the check drawn to Leeds, and Leeds received payment on that check. However, Egnasko\u2019s Trasteo account also contained funds that Egnasko had obtained by similarly altering and depositing a check payable to Shrewsbury State Bank (\u201cShrews-bury\u201d), which was intended to pay off a mortgage loan in an unrelated real estate transaction. Instead of delivering that check to Shrewsbury, Egnasko again inserted his own name, \u201cLouis Egnasko as attorney,\u201d above the payee\u2019s name and deposited the check into his Trasteo attorney trust account. Egnasko thus used funds that belonged to Shrewsbury to pay Leeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Facing a claim for conversion by Shrewsbury, Trasteo filed suit against Egnasko and Leeds in New York, seeking repayment of monies traceable to Egnasko\u2019s fraud.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Leeds filed an answer and crossclaim in the New York action on December 5,1997, admitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>receipt of the Trasteo check from Egnasko, but denying that \u2018William and Carol Leeds owe [Trasteo] the traceable converted proceeds of the check delivered to William Leeds with interest</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">On December 24, 1997, Leeds filed this action alleging strict liability for payment on the altered settlement check against both Chase, the depository bank, and Summit, the drawer/drawee/pay- or bank.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In support of their motion for summary judgment, defendants argued that (1) Leeds had been paid and therefore suffered no damages; (2) Leeds would only be ordered to return that payment in the Trasteo action if Leeds were found to have accepted payment with knowledge that the funds were stolen; and (3) if Leeds knowingly accepted stolen monies, the equitable doctrine of unclean hands would bar recovery against the banks. Although defendants\u2019 answer included among its separate defenses the Uniform Fiduciaries Law, <em>N.J.S.A </em>3B:14-52 to -61 (the UFL), defendants did not argue the UFL defense in support of their summary judgment motion or in opposition to Leeds\u2019 cross-motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Leeds argued in opposition to summary judgment and in support of his cross-motion that Chase, as the depository bank, is strictly liable for conversion under <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-420, including damages related to the cost of defending the New York suit. The motion judge granted summary judgment in favor of both Chase and Summit dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The order for summary judgment merely states that \u201cplaintiffs have not and may not in the future suffer damages at defendant\u2019s hands,\u201d and the order denying plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment simply says \u201cdenied.\u201d The absence of findings of fact and conclusions of law to explain these orders is contrary to <em>R. </em>1:7-4 and <em>R. </em>2:5-l(b). <em>See, e.g., Curtis v. Finneran, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>563, 569-70, 417 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>A.2d 15 (1980); <em>Schwarz v. Schwarz, </em>328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>275, 282, 745 A.2d 592 (App.Div.2000). In the interest of justice, and given the passage of time, we nevertheless resolve the legal issues properly-raised by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">On appeal, both parties reiterate their arguments in the Law Division. After careful review of the record, the briefs, and the arguments of counsel, we conclude that summary judgment was erroneously granted to defendant Chase, and partial summary judgment against Chase on liability was erroneously denied to plaintiff. As we shall explain below, we also conclude that defendant Summit is entitled to summary judgment, although for a reason different from that stated in the order appealed from. <em>See Hughes v. Eisner, </em>8 <em>N.J. </em>228, 229, 84 A.2d 626 (1951) (we affirm or reverse judgments, and not reasons).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">We first address Leeds\u2019 cause of action in conversion against Chase. The applicable provision of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3A20a, states<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">The law applicable to conversion of personal property applies to instruments. <em>An instrument is also converted if </em>it is taken by transfer, other than a negotiation, from a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or <em>a bank makes or obtains payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment. </em>An action for conversion of an instrument may not be brought by the issuer or acceptor of the instrument or a payee or indorsee who did not receive delivery of the instrument either directly or through delivery to an agent or a co-payee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">[Emphasis added.J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">Although the check was not actually delivered to Leeds, it was delivered to Egnasko as Leeds\u2019 attorney, with intent that title be transferred to Leeds, the payee. Thus Leeds is entitled to bring this action for conversion as one who \u201creceive[d] delivery of the instrument ... through delivery to an agent ....\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>12A:3-420a. <em>See Interchange State Bank v. Veglia, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>164, 184-87, 668 A.2d 465 (App.Div.1995), <em>certif. denied, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>377, 676 A.2d 1092 (1996) (finding standing by virtue of constructive delivery under the prior law, <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3419); <em>Humberto Decorators, Inc. v. Plaza Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>180 <em>N.J.Super. </em>170, 174, 434 A.2d 618 (App.Div.1981). It is undisputed that Egnasko was not authorized by Leeds to indorse the check and had no right to receive or enforce payment on that check.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Section 3-420a does not explicitly refer to \u201cforgery\u201d or \u201calteration,\u201d but instead addresses a class of persons who are \u201cnot entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment.\u201d However, there can be no question that because the Summit teller\u2019s check payable to Leeds was altered by Egnasko, he was not \u201centitled\u201d to payment on the instrument. Such an alteration constitutes a forgery under the Code and the common law. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3407a; <em>Teas v. Third Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>125 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>224, 227-28, 4 A.2d 64 (E. &amp; A.1939) (\u201cThere is no substantial difference between an unauthorized endorsement and a forged endorsement, the result being the same in so far as concerns the passing of title.\u201d); <em>see also Nutt v. The Chemical Bank, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>57, 62-63, 555 A.2d 8 (App.Div.1989); <em>Humberto Decorators, </em>180 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 174, 434 A.2d 618. By crediting Egnasko\u2019s trust account with the face amount of the check, Chase paid the check to \u201ca person not entitled to ... receive payment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-420a.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">As a depository bank under the Uniform Commercial Code, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-105b, Chase is strictly liable for conversion on a forged or stolen instrument. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-420, comment 1; <em>New Jersey Lawyers\u2019 Fund for Client Protection v. First Fidelity Bank, N.A, </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>208, 226-27, 696 A.2d 728 (App.Div.l997)(finding liability under both the 1995 enactment of \u00a7 3-420 and the predecessor \u00a7 34119); <em>Nutt v. Chemical Bank, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 62, 555 A.2d 8 (under the predecessor \u00a7 3419). Indeed, the 1995 revision of \u00a7 3-420 eliminated the defense that had been provided by former \u00a7 3-419(3) for a depository bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>that acted \u201cin good faith and in accordance with the reasonable commercial standards applicable to the business .... \u201d <em>See New Jersey Lawyers\u2019 Fund, </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 228, 696 A.2d 728 (\u201cEven if [the bank] was commercially reasonable when it accepted the forged checks in this case, [it] is still strictly liable for conversion for paying on forged indorsements.\u201d); <em>see also Uniform Commercial Code, </em>comment 3 to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-20. Therefore, Chase is strictly liable on Leeds\u2019 claim for conversion under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-420a, because Chase \u201c[made or obtained] payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment.\u201d <em>See New Jersey Lawyers\u2019 Fund, </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 224, 696 A.2d 728.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The justification for strict liability upon the depository bank is that \u201cthe loss should normally come to rest upon the first solvent party in the stream after the one who forged the indorsement ....\u201d 2 James J. White &amp; Robert S. Summers, <em>Uniform Commercial Code </em>\u00a7 18-4 at 209-10 (4th ed.1995). <em>See also Uniform Commercial Code, </em>comment 3 to <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-420:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">The depositary bank is ultimately liable in the ease of a forged indorsement check because of its warranty to the payor bank under Section 4-208(a)(l) and it is usually the most convenient defendant in cases involving multiple checks drawn on different banks. There is no basis for requiring the owner of the check to bring multiple actions against the various payor banks and to require those banks to assert warranty rights against the depositary bank.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">We are therefore convinced that the motion court improperly entered summary judgment against Leeds and in favor of Chase. We are also convinced that Chase is not entitled to summary judgment based upon the defense of payment, in light of Leeds\u2019 continuing exposure to the New York action, until that action has been resolved. If Leeds is not required in that action to disgorge the payment received from Egnasko, Chase will be entitled to set off that payment against its liability for conversion. <em>Cf. County Concrete Corp. v. Smith, </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>50, 61-62, 721 A.2d 34 (App.Div.1998).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Leeds cannot be allowed a double recovery. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Leeds is required to disgorge, we will then address Chase\u2019s \u201cunclean hands\u201d defense on a complete record. That Leeds\u2019 damage claim may be limited (or even dismissed) in the future does not affect our determination of Chase\u2019s liability here and now.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"> We next address Leeds\u2019 cause of action in conversion against Summit. Summit is the drawer, the drawee, and the payor bank on the altered check under the Code definitions. A drawee bank is also strictly liable for conversion when it pays on a forged endorsement. <em>County Concrete, </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 56, 721 A.2d 34 (under former <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-419(2)); <em>Mandelbaum v. P &amp; D Printing Corp., </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>427, 432, 652 A.2d 1266 (App.Div.1995). In <em>Gast v. American Cas. Co. of Reading, Pa., </em>99 <em>N.J.Super. </em>538, 541, 240 A.2d 682 (1968), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">As both drawer and drawee defendant had the responsibility to make payment to the named payees on the instrument____The statute [the former <em>N.J.S.A </em>12A:3-419] created an absolute right to recover in favor of plaintiffs ... upon proof that the draft was paid on the forged indorsements. Plaintiffs\u2019 indorsements were concededly forged. It follows that defendant, having paid the draft, was rendered liable for the conversion in the face amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">However, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-420c limits damages for conversion against</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">[a] representative, other than a depository bank, who has in good faith dealt with an instrument or its proceeds on behalf of one who was not the person entitled to enforce the instrument ... [for any more than] the amount of any proceeds that it has not paid out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Summit is not a depositary bank in this case. Summit has paid out the entire face amount of the forged check and is not alleged to have acted other than in good faith; it therefore cannot be liable to Leeds for conversion under \u00a7 3-420. Whether Summit could have been found liable for negligence, as a result of its failure to detect the alteration on its own teller\u2019s check, is not before us. Plaintiff has not pled or argued a negligence cause of action against Summit. Summary judgment is therefore affirmed in favor of Summit.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">Finally, we address defendants\u2019 contention that the banks are protected by the Uniform Fiduciaries Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:14-52 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>to -61 (the UFL).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Defendants\u2019 reliance upon the protection of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:14-58 is misplaced. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">a. <em>If a fiduciary makes a deposit </em>in a bank to his personal credit <em>of checks drawn by him </em>upon an account in his own name as fiduciary, <em>or of checks drawn by him </em>upon an account in the name of his principal, if he is empowered to draw thereon, <em>or, </em>except as provided in subsection b. of this section, <em>if he othemri.se makes a deposit of funds held by him as fiduciary, the bank receiving the deposit is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing thereby a breach of his obligation as fiduciary. </em>The bank is authorized to pay the amount of the deposit of [sic] any part thereof upon the personal check of the fiduciary without being liable to the principal, unless the bank receives the deposit or pays the check with actual knowledge that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in making the deposit or in drawing the check, or with knowledge of facts that its action in receiving the deposit of paying the check amounts to bad faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">b. In the case of an instrument payable to the principal or the fiduciary as fiduciary, the bank has notice of the breach of fiduciary duty if the instrument is deposited to an account other than an account of the fiduciary, as fiduciary, or an account of the principal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">With respect to Summit, where Egnasko never maintained an account or deposited the check, \u00a7 58 does not apply by its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">Section 58 also does not apply with respect to Chase. Egnasko did not draw the check he deposited with Chase, and the funds he deposited were not \u201cheld by him as fiduciary\u201d because he altered the check to add his name as payee.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">The UFL protects a bank from responsibility for monitoring a fiduciary\u2019s disposition of funds in its fiduciary account so long as the bank does not have \u201cknowledge of facts that its action in receiving the deposit or paying the check amounts to bad faith.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>3B:14-58(a). The bank is liable only if it has acted in bad faith or with actual knowledge of the fiduciary\u2019s defalcation. <em>See New Jersey Title Ins. Co. v. Caputo, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>143, 155-56, 748 A.2d 507 (2000); <em>New Amsterdam Cas. Co. v. Nat\u2019l Newark &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>Essex Banking Co., </em>117 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>264, 270-71, 175 A. 609 (N.J.Ch.1934), aff<em>'d o.b., </em>119 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>540, 182 A. 824 (E. &amp; A.1936). The UFL does not insulate the bank from liability under the UCC just because the depositor or endorser also happens to be a fiduciary. <em>See Salsman v. National Community Bank of Rutherford, </em>102 <em>N.J.Super. </em>482, 246 A.2d 162 (Law Div.1968), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>105 <em>N.J.Super. </em>164, 251 A.2d 460 (App.Div.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">In <em>Salsman, </em>an attorney persuaded his client that a check payable to her as the sole beneficiary of her deceased husband\u2019s profit-sharing plan belonged to his estate. The attorney had the client sign a restrictive indorsement to the estate, and then altered the indorsement for deposit to himself as \u201ctrustee.\u201d The proceeds were accepted for deposit to the attorney\u2019s trust account. After finding the depository bank liable under several sections of the UCC, the Law Division Judge explained his rejection of the bank\u2019s separate defense under the UFL:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">To exonerate the bank it must be shown that [the attorney] came into possession of the funds as a fiduciary____ Since [he] had no right to the funds, was not a fiduciary of the [payee] and was not authorized to indorse checks on behalf of the [payee], the bank cannot claim the protection of this statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">[102 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 495[, 246 A.2d 162].]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-9\"><em>Cf. Standard Acc. Ins. Co. v. Pellecchia, </em>15 <em>N.J. </em>162, 177, 104 A.2d 288 (1954) (\u201c[Tjhere is nothing in [the predecessor to \u00a7 58] that in any way relieves a bank from its guaranty of prior endorsements.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">Chase\u2019s liability to Leeds is not for the bank\u2019s failure to inquire into Egnasko\u2019s \u201cbreach of his obligation as a fiduciary.\u201d It is for accepting a forged/altered check for deposit, irrespective of the circumstance that the forger was also a fiduciary with respect to his clients and the owners of funds in his attorney trust account. Chase cannot avail itself of the protection of \u00a7 58, because Chase\u2019s liability here arises out of its payment on an altered check\u2014 conversion as defined by the UCC \u2014 and not out of Egnasko\u2019s subsequent disposition of the proceeds of that check.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">Defendants\u2019 proposed application of the UFL implicitly treats the altered check as if it were properly payable to and indorsed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Egnasko as fiduciary for Leeds, thereby ignoring <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-420. If we were to accept the argument that the shield of the UFL supercedes the liability imposed by \u00a7 3-420, the result would be to allow a dishonest fiduciary, indeed a forger, to insulate his bank from liability not just for his misapplication of funds entrusted to him as a fiduciary, but also for conversion of funds <em>not </em>entrusted, funds obtained by his forgeries, for which the bank would otherwise be strictly liable. We see no policy reason for accepting such a broad interpretation of the UFL, and every public policy reason for rejecting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Defendant\u2019s supplemental brief addressing the UFL defense ignores Chase\u2019s affirmative liability under the UCC. Each of the cases on which defendants rely to support the UFL defense involves a common law claim of misappropriation,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> breach of contract,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> embezzlement<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or common law conversion<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of funds in a fiduciary account, based upon the fiduciary\u2019s improper disposition of those funds. These cases involve a plaintiffs attempt to recover against the bank where the dishonest fiduciary has diverted funds from a fiduciary account to his own personal account or creditor, and therefore require a showing of the bank\u2019s bad faith or actual knowledge of a fiduciary\u2019s defalcation. These cases do not implicate the issue before us: liability for conversion under the UCC as a result of accepting an altered check. Indeed, <em>Strong v. City Natl Bank of Phila., </em>355 <em>Pa. </em>390, 50 A.2d 323 (1947), also relied upon by defendants, actually supports the outcome we reach.
