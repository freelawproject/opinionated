For the reasons that follow,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">Prior to trial, Celestine Green dismissed her \u201cindividual\u201d claims. Petitioner\u2019s evidence included the videotaped deposition testimony of Dr. John F. Rosen. The following transpired during Dr. Rosen\u2019s direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Now looking at [Plaintiffs Exhibit] No. 7, [a summary of Petitioner\u2019s lead level tests] and this document, just so you know, Dr. Rosen, will be blown up so the jury can see it as you\u2019re talking about it even though they\u2019re not here with us today, could you please tell us if you found any indication of whether or not to a medical degree of medical probability of whether [Petitioner] was poisoned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">WITNESS: She was lead poisoned by definition as of September 26, [1996].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: How long, let\u2019s go back a second. You told us that her first blood lead level according to Exhibit No. 7 was in November of 1995, a blood level of 9. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-8\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Can you tell the members of the jury to a reasonable degree of medical probability as to whether that blood lead level amount has any medical significance to you as a pediatrician (inaudible)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">WITNESS: It does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: And what significance is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-11\">WITNESS: The significance of that is the blood lead value of 9 when she was roughly 10 months old followed about five weeks later with a blood lead of 8 micrograms per deciliter, both indicated that she was within 10 to 20 percent of reaching the level of 10 micrograms per deciliter and that indicates that she was (inaudible) exposed to lead during that time frame prior to the lead level (inaudible) deciliter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT-\">[PETITIONER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Does the fact, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, that [Petitioner] did not reach the definition of lead poisoning, that is 10 micrograms per deciliter, mean that those two levels did not affect her or did not cause her any injury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-12\">WITNESS: They did impact her in terms of (inaudible) that blood lead range, in terms of loss of IQ points, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Prior to jury deliberations, the Circuit Court entered judgment against all Respondents on the issue of whether they were negligent in their ownership and/or management of the property where Petitioner was exposed to lead-based paint, as well as on the issue of whether they had violated the Consumer Protection Act. Counsel to the parties agreed that the jury should be presented with a VERDICT SHEET that contained two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">1. Do you find that Kelly Green suffered any injury as previously defined for you in my instructions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">If your answer is YES, ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">2. What amount of damages, if any, do you award Plaintiff Kelly Green for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">Non-economic damages sustained in the past and reasonably probable to be sustained in the future for injuries found to her mental health and well-being:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">The jury received the following instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-10\">Ladies and gentlemen, the Court has found that the Defendants, NBS, Incorporated; Dear Management, Inc.; Charles Runkles, individually; and Stanley Rochkind, individually, were negligent as it pertained to their duties owed at 1547 Montpelier Street in Baltimore City, Maryland, and that this conduct was in violation of the Consumer Protection Act. You are instructed that proximate cause exists only where the Plaintiff produces evidence that indicates that it is more probable than not that there is a direct connection between the act complained of and the act finally resulting in injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-11\">For the Plaintiff to recover damages, the Defendant\u2019s negligence must be a cause of the Plaintiffs injury. Each person whose negligent act is a cause of an injury is responsible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-12\">You are instructed that proximate cause exists only w[h]ere the Plaintiff produces evidence that indicates that it is more probable than not that there is a direct connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>between the act complained of and the act finally resulting in the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">The burden is on the Plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence each item of damage claimed to be caused by the Defendants. In considering the items of damage, you must keep in mind that your award must fairly and adequately compensate the Plaintiff, but an award should not be based upon guesswork or speculation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">In this action for damages you shall consider the following\u2014the personal injuries sustained by the Plaintiff and their extent and duration\u2014and by the Plaintiff, we mean Kelly Green[ ]\u2014the effect the injuries have on the overall mental health and well being of the Plaintiff, which with reasonable probability may be expected to be experienced in the future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">In awarding damages in this case you must itemize your verdict or award to show the amount intended for the non-economic damages, if any, sustained in the past and reasonably probable to be sustained in the future by the Plaintiff, for injuries found to her mental health and well being.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The record shows that the following transpired when the jury returned its verdict.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">THE CLERK: ... Kelly Green[ ], a minor by her mother and next friend, Celestine Green[ ], Plaintiff versus NBS, Inc., et al, Defendants,.... Verdict Sheet, Issue 1, \u201cDo you find that Kelly Green[ ] suffered any injury as previously defined for you in my instructions, yes/no?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-10\">JURY FOREPERSON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-11\">THE CLERK: Issue 2. \u201cWhat amount of damages, if any, do you award Plaintiff, Kelly Green[ ], ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-12\">JURY FOREPERSON: 2.8 million.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-13\">After the Circuit Court entered judgment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration and/or Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment that included the following assertions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>1. On or about March 26, 2007, after a lengthy trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the minor plaintiff in the amount of Two Million Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,300,000.00). This sum represented compensation for brain damage sustained as a result of lead poisoning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">2. Prior to the return of the verdict, this Honorable Court had directed a verdict against all the defendants on the issue of defendants\u2019 negligence and their violations of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act (CPA).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">* <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-7\">6. Further, even if the Cap is constitutional, which Plaintiff expressly denies, it does not apply in this case. The Cap does not apply in this case because the jury\u2019s award was for defendants\u2019 violation of the CPA, a statutory cause of action and, pursuant to Section 3(i) the limitation imposed by the Cap applies only to \u201cvictims of tortious conduct.\u201d In other words, a violation of the CPA is not a tort. Since the Cap only applies to awards for tortious conduct, the Cap does not apply in this case, and this Honorable Court should not have reduced the jury\u2019s verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">7. The logic set forth above was adopted by the Court of Appeals in <em>United States v. Streidel, </em>329 Md. 533, 620 A.2d 905 (1993). In <em>Streidel, </em>the Court of Appeals refused to apply the Cap to the statutory cause of action of wrongful death cases because, among other reasons, such causes of actions are not traditional tort actions for personal injury. After <em>Streidel, </em>the legislature amended the act to include actions for wrongful death. Interestingly, the legislature did not amend the Cap to include other statutory cause of actions, such as actions for injuries like those in this case, caused by violations of the CPA. In fact, the legislature specifically added section 3(i) which expressly limits application of the CAP to causes of actions for tortious conduct. As the legislature is presumed to know the law, it must be assumed that it intended to limit the instances when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Cap applies to non-tortious conduct only to wrongful death actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">In <em>Edmonds v. Murphy, </em>83 Md.App. 133, 573 A.2d 853 (1990) <em>aff'd, Murphy v. Edmonds, </em>325 Md. 342, 601 A.2d 102 (1992), the Court of Special Appeals, speaking of wrongful death actions, said: \u201c[t]he General Assembly would be well within its authority to abolish wrongful death actions if it chose to do so. Certainly, it would be well within its authority to repeal the 1969 statute permitting recovery for noneconomic loss in wrongful death actions. Within its powers to create a cause of action or abolish a statutory cause of action is the power to modify such statutory actions.\u201d In the case at bar, the legislature created the statutory cause of action under the CPA. It could have, if it so chose, limited (modified) damages recoverable pursuant to the Cap. It chose not to do so. This Honorable Court should not have reduced the jury\u2019s verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Subsequent to a hearing on the post-judgment motions, the Circuit Court filed a Memorandum Opinion that included the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">Motions were filed on behalf of the Plaintiffs for Reconsideration and/or Alteration or Amendment of the Judgment. Those arguments fall into two distinct categories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">I. Assuming that the provisions of Md. Ann.Code \u00a7 11-101 <em>et seq., </em>Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. apply, Plaintiffs assert that the judgment should be reduced to $530,000. The Court, pursuant to \u00a7 11\u2014108(d), entered judgment in the amount of $515,000. The relevant consideration is whether the statutory authority of \u00a7 11-108 that raises the \u201ccap\u201d on non-economic damages effective October 1, 1996 is the appropriate measure for these damages. All parties agree that the evidence indicated that the minor Plaintiff had an elevated lead blood level on September 26, .1996.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">Plaintiffs assert that since the Baltimore City Housing Code has been interpreted to establish a continuous duty upon the landlord of premises to keep subject property in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>compliance with the Code, any potential causes of action that arises from a landlord\u2019s violation of said Code also continue and, therefore, the \u201ccap\u201d date should be the last date upon which Plaintiffs exposure generated an elevated lead blood level. The Court rejects this analysis----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">Here, the verdict sheet submitted to the jury, which was agreed upon by all parties, did not request the jury to decide the date upon which any cause of action arose. Accordingly, this Court is unwilling to substitute its judgment for that of the jury, which made its finding as to non-economic damages sustained by Plaintiffs upon the evidence produced at trial. Since the evidence is undisputed that the minor Plaintiff sustained an elevated blood level on September 26, 1996, the Court sees no reason to amend the judgment to reflect a cause of action arising at a later date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">II. In the alternative, Plaintiffs assert that the provisions of \u00a7 11-108 are inapplicable to this matter. Plaintiffs argue that not all of its asserted causes of action are brought as personal injury actions that arose out of direct tortious conduct, <em>see </em>\u00a7 11\u2014108(A)(b)(3)(i), but that asserted causes of action also arise out of Defendants\u2019 violations of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, Md. Ann.Code, \u00a7 13-301, <em>et seq., </em>Comm. Law, and the Baltimore City Code, Art. 13 <em>et seq., </em>Housing and Urban Renewal. Accordingly, Plaintiff asserts that since those claims fall outside of the statutory scheme envisioned by the legislature in enacting \u00a7 11-108, any damages awarded for those claims were not intended to be reduced. Plaintiffs argue that since actions for wrongful death were specifically addressed by the statute, the fact that the legislature did not address other nontortious causes of action supports the position that \u00a7 11\u2014 108 is inapplicable in this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">Again, the Court is unpersuaded by Plaintiffs\u2019 argument____ [A]s discussed <em>supra, </em>all parties agreed on the verdict sheet submitted to the jury, which did not ask the jury to differentiate between potential causes of action and award damages accordingly. It is therefore impossible for the Court, after the fact, to parse out which damages were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>awarded for which claims and to do so would improperly infringe on the decision of the jury panel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\">Accordingly, Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Reconsideration and/or Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment is hereby denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Petitioner noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. As stated above, after that Court affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court, this Court issued a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"A5u\">I. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Petitioner was entitled to bring an action under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act (CPA), which is set forth in Title 13 of the Commercial Law Article (CL). CL \u00a718-408, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">(a) <em>Actions </em>authorized.\u2014In addition to any action by the Division or Attorney General authorized by this title and any other action otherwise authorized by law, any person may bring an action to recover for injury or loss sustained by him as the result of a practice prohibited by this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">Section 11-108 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJ) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-10\">Personal injury action\u2014Limitation on noneconomic damages</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-11\">(a) Definitions.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-12\">(1) In this section the following words have the meanings indicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-13\">(2) (i) \u201cNoneconomic damages\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-14\">1.

Sometimes, as in this case, personal injury actions are based upon statutory causes of action. Because a cause of action based on the CPA is a statutory cause of action and not a tort, the Cap does not apply and the trial court erred when it reduced the jury\u2019s award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The brief that Petitioner filed in this Court includes the following argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">This case is not a \u201cpersonal injury action.\u201d ... Petitioner\u2019s claim under the CPA is not a \u201cpersonal injury action\u201d because, in furtherance of the Legislature\u2019s wishes, Petitioner is seeking relief from Respondents\u2019 prohibited deceptive practices, not compensation for the personal injuries she sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Under these circumstances, Respondent Rochkind argues that (in the words of his brief), \u201cPetitioner cannot assert, for the first time in this Court, and in direct contradiction to her earlier judicial statements, that her action for damages is not for personal injury.\u201d We shall, however, hold that Petitioner\u2019s CPA claim <em>is </em>a personal injury action, and that CJ \u00a7 11-108 is applicable to a proceeding in which a consumer asserts a claim for money damages to compensate for injuries sustained as a result of a Consumer Protection Act violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">Applying the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis </em>to \u00a7 11\u2014 108(a)(2)(f),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it is clear that the cap statute is applicable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>brain injuries sustained as a result of lead poisoning. In rejecting Petitioner\u2019s argument that the cap statute does not apply because a CPA action \u201cis a statutory cause of action and not a tort,\u201d the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">\u201cTortious\u201d is defined as \u201c[cjonstituting a tort; wrongful.\u201d Blacks Law Dictionary 1497 (7th ed. 1999). A \u201ctort\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] civil wrong for which a remedy may be obtained, usually in the form of damages; a breach of a duty that the law imposes on everyone in the same relation to one another as those involved in a given transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1496. Therefore, the term \u201ctort\u201d as defined by Blacks encompasses all \u201ccivil wrongs,\u201d not just wrongs that were recognized as a civil wrong at common law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">180 Md.App. at 646-47, 952 A.2d at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 analysis of the words \u201ctortious conduct\u201d included a discussion of <em>Lee v. Cline, </em>384 Md. 245, 863 A.2d 297 (2004), in which this Court was presented with the issue of whether State personnel have immunity from liability for tortious acts or omissions that violate State constitutional rights. The Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-8\">In <em>Lee, </em>the Court [of Appeals] interpreted the term \u201ctortious act or omission\u201d to include causes of action to recover for constitutional torts. 384 Md. at 266[, 863 A.2d at 310]. This is important for our purposes because a constitutional tort is obviously not a \u201ccommon law\u201d tort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-10\">Although perhaps not dispositive of the issue here presented, the interpretation of the term \u201ctortious injury\u201d by the <em>Lee </em>Court at least suggests that the term \u201ctortious conduct\u201d includes more than conduct that constituted a tort at common law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 647, 649, 952 A.2d at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">The Court of Special Appeals then cited several \u201clong-arm statute cases,\u201d as well as \u201cnumerous other cases from other jurisdictions standing for the proposition that the fact that a cause of action arises out of a statute does not mean that a tort has not been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 651, 952 A.2d at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>As to Petitioner\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Streidel, </em>829 Md. 533, 620 A.2d 905 (1993), the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">The <em>Streidel </em>Court never used the phrase \u201ctraditional tort action for personal injury\u201d in its analysis and nothing said in <em>Streidel </em>supports [Petitioner\u2019s] position that one of the reasons that the cap statute was deemed inapplicable to a wrongful death action was because such actions were not \u201ctraditional tort aetion[s].\u201d The crux of the <em>Streidel </em>decision was that wrongful death statute cases were not governed by the cap statute because such suits did not assert a claim for personal injury. <em>Id. </em>at 539-44[, 620 A.2d at 908-11].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">180 Md.App. at 653, 952 A.2d at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">After discussing \u201cthe pertinent legislative history behind the 1994 amendment to the cap statute,\u201d the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">It is clear to us that the legislature added the language, upon which appellant relies, in order to answer the question that the <em>Streidel </em>Court had left unanswered, i.e., to make it clear that cap amounts are applied to the tort victim and all persons who claim injury by or through that victim in a personal injury or a wrongful death action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">We do not believe that the legislature, when it amended the cap statute, intended to expand the statute to cover wrongful death actions but at the same time intended to narrow its application so that rather than applying \u201cto all actions for personal injuries,\u201d as it did before the amendment <em>{Kent Village [Associates Joint Venture v. Smith], </em>104 Md.App. [507,] at 532, 657 A.2d 330), it was now to cover wrongful death actions and all actions for personal injury so long as the victims were injured as the result of common law torts. One reason for reaching this conclusion, aside from the ones already discussed, is the fact that nothing in the rather extensive legislative history surrounding the enactment in 1994 of Senate Bill 283 gives any indication that the General Assembly wanted to narrow the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>the cap statute in any respect. More specifically, nothing in the legislative history suggests that the General Assembly even thought of the difference between actions claiming personal injury due to common law torts as opposed to causes of action claiming personal injury arising out of statutory or constitutional torts. And, when interpreting a statute, a court must presume that the legislature did not intend to make any alteration other than what is specified and plainly pronounced. <em>N. Cent. Ry. Co. v. Green, </em>112 Md. 487, 76 A. 90 (1910). Also, in light of the reasons for the original cap statute, and its amendment, it is impossible to believe that the legislature intended to narrow the statute in the way appellant suggests so that insurers would now have to cover non-economic damages awards that exceeded the cap so long as the personal injury action arose out of the violation of a statute or a constitutional provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">180 Md.App. at 659-60, 952 A.2d at 376-77. (Footnote omitted). We agree with that analysis, and affirm the holding of the Court of Special Appeals \u201cthat the [CJircuit [Cjourt was correct when it ruled that the cap statute applied to appellant\u2019s claim for damages that arose, in part, out of a violation of the CPA.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">I. B.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">There is no merit in Petitioner\u2019s argument that CJ \u00a7 11-108 violates the prohibition against the enactment of \u201cspecial laws,\u201d which is set forth in Section 33 of Article III of the Maryland Constitution. In <em>Prince George\u2019s Co. v. B. &amp; O. R.R. Co., </em>113 Md. 179, 77 A. 433 (1910), this Court stated that \u201c[a] special law is one that relates to particular persons or things of a class, as distinguished from a general law which applies to all persons or things of a class.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 77 A. at 434. In <em>State v. Burning Tree Club, Inc., </em>315 Md. 254, 554 A.2d 366 (1989), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">In <em>Cities Service Co. v. Governor, </em>290 Md. 553, 567, 431 A.2d 663 (1981), this Court examined decisions applying \u00a7 33, concluding that \u201cno mechanical rules for deciding cases\u201d exist. Nonetheless, the Court enumerated several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>factors to be considered in deciding whether a statute is a \u201cspecial law.\u201d The Court reiterated the importance of these factors in <em>State v. Good Samaritan Hospital, </em>299 Md. 310, 473 A.2d 892 (1984). The factors include: whether \u201cthe underlying purpose of the legislation is to benefit or burden a particular class member or members\u201d; whether particular people or entities are identified in the statute; and what \u201cthe substance and \u2018practical effect\u2019 \u201d of a statute is and not simply its form. <em>State v. Good Somaritan Hospital, supra, </em>299 Md. at 330, 473 A.2d at 902; <em>Cities Service Co. v. Governor, supra, </em>290 Md. at 569, 431 A.2d at 672-673. Our past decisions have also considered whether particular entities or individuals sought and obtained special advantages under the legislation or if other similar entities or individuals were discriminated against by the legislation. <em>Cities Service Co., supra, </em>290 Md. at 570, 431 A.2d at 673. In deciding whether a law violates \u00a7 33 in applying to only certain members of a class, we have looked to whether the statute\u2019s distinctions are arbitrary or unreasonable. <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, this Court has held that some enactments were not special laws even though they applied to only a single entity. Such laws are permissible where unique circumstances render the entity a class unto itself, <em>Cities Service Co., supra, </em>290 Md. at 568, 431 A.2d at 672, or where the enactment, although it affects only one entity currently, would apply to other similar entities in the future, <em>Reyes v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>281 Md. 279, 305-306, 380 A.2d 12 (1977); <em>Potomac Sand &amp; Gravel v. Governor, </em>266 Md. 358, 379, 293 A.2d 241 (1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 273-74, 554 A.2d at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The Court of Special Appeals noted that Petitioner\u2019s \u201cspecial law\u201d argument was identical to the argument rejected by that Court in <em>Univ. of Maryland Med. Sys. Corp. v. Malory, </em>143 Md.App. 327, 795 A.2d 107 (2001), <em>cert. denied </em>368 Md. 527, 796 A.2d 696 (2002). The <em>Malory </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">Here, we are faced with the task of determining whether a statute applying to all tort victims in the State of Maryland is a \u201cspecial law.\u201d The law simply does not have the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>effect as the statute at issue in <em>Cities; </em>rather, C.J. \u00a7 11-108 applies to <em>\u201cany </em>action for damages for personal injury.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Therefore, it is a general law and does not violate the constitutional prohibition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 354, 795 A.2d at 122-23. (Emphasis in original). We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the cap statute is not a \u201cspecial law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Petitioner argues in the alternative that, even if the \u201ccap\u201d applies, she is entitled to a judgment in the amount of $530,000 rather than $515,000. According to Petitioner, because she was \u201ccontinuously exposed\u201d to the lead paint, her cause of action \u201ccontinued\u201d to arise after October 1, 1996. In <em>Green v. N. Arundel Hosp. Ass\u2019n, </em>366 Md. 597, 785 A.2d 361 (2001), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">[A] cause of action in negligence arises when facts exist to support each element of the action. The elements of a cause of action for negligence are (1) a legally cognizable duty on the part of the defendant owing to the plaintiff, (2) a breach of that duty by the defendant, (3) actual injury or loss suffered by the plaintiff, and (4) that such injury or loss resulted from the defendant\u2019s breach of the duty. <em>Brown v. Dermer, </em>357 Md. 344, 744 A.2d 47 (2000); <em>Valentine v. On Target, Inc., </em>353 Md. 544, 727 A.2d 947 (1999). As we noted in <em>Owens-Illinois [v. Armstrong, </em>326 Md. 107, 604 A.2d 47 (1992)], in a negligence action, the elements of duty, breach, and causation tend naturally to precede the element of injury, which \u201cwould seemingly be the last element to come into existence.\u201d <em>Owens-Illinois, </em>supra, 326 Md. at 121, 604 A.2d at 54. Accordingly, in determining when, in a time sense, a cause of action for negligence arises, the focus is often on when that last element of injury occurs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 607, 785 A.2d at 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">This theory is inconsistent with Petitioner\u2019s fifteen count Complaint, which contains five \u201cnegligence\u201d counts that include the following assertions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>10. That the Plaintiff was exposed to the toxic conditions complained of herein on each and every instance in which the Plaintiff was present at the property. Each and every instance of exposure resulted in the introduction of lead into the Plaintiffs bloodstream. This lead in the Plaintiffs bloodstream caused immediate permanent cellular damage in each instance. Lead was deposited in the Plaintiffs internal organs\u2014spleen, liver and kidneys\u2014and in the Plaintiffs brain and bones. In addition to the aforesaid immediate injury, the lead also caused permanent continuing chronic injury. Lead, once introduced into the human body, is very, very slowly eliminated. Lead is released from bone over years. [Tjhus leaving aside the actual period of exposure, even after exposure cased the Plaintiff continued with lead throughout the Plaintiffs body and during that entire following period the Plaintiff continued to suffer injury, disruption of normal bodily functions, and cellular destruction and retardation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">This theory is also inconsistent with the theory of the case presented to the jury. The opening statement of Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel included the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">No level of lead is safe in a child, ... lead is a toxin, ... there [is an! inverse relationship between lead and I.Q. That means the more lead you have the less your I.Q., inverse, opposite.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">Lead has been associated with learning disabilities and the most common source of lead in children is what? Lead-based paint ... which is why we\u2019re here today, is the most important source of lead exposure. A blood lead level equal to or greater 10 micrograms per deciliter is the definition of childhood lead poisoning and you know what? There is no safe level of lead. The doctor that we have is going to show you, ladies and gentlemen. That\u2019s lead and look at Kelly\u2019s lead levels [shown on Plaintiffs Exhibit No. 71 She had twice the level of lead that the CDC says is the definition of [lead poisoned]. And there is no safe level and all those levels that you see[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Moreover, Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel elicited Dr. Rosen\u2019s expert opinion that Petitioner \u201cwas lead poisoned by definition as of September 26, [1996].\u201d In <em>Owens-Illinois v. Armstrong, </em>326 Md. 107, 604 A.2d 47 (1992), this Court relied upon expert testimony presented at trial for its holding that, \u201c[t]he only reasonable conclusion, even viewed in the light most favorable to Owens-Illinois, is that Armstrong had asbestosis prior to July 1,1986.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124, 604 A.2d at 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">On the basis of Dr. Rosen\u2019s testimony, Petitioner had sustained a legally cognizable injury no later than September 26, 1996. We therefore agree \"with the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals that Petitioner\u2019s cause of action arose prior to October 1, 1996. Under these circumstances, the jury\u2019s verdict was properly \u201ccapped\u201d at $515,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; PETITIONER TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-13\">.
