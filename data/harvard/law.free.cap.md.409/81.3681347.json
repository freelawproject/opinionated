Yol. &amp; Supp. 2008) for the face amount of the check, when an imposter, posing successfully as another individual in securing a loan (the proceeds of which were represented by the check) from the issuer, subsequently negotiated the check at the check cashing business. We shall hold that, under the circumstances presented in this case, the issuer of the check is liable for the amount of the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">On 20 June 2007, American General Financial Services, Inc., (\u201cAmerican General\u201d) was contacted by telephone by a man, later revealed to be an imposter posing as Ronald E. Wilder (we shall refer to this person as the \u201cimposter\u201d, though he was not known to be so at most relevant times in this case). The imposter sought a $20,000.00 loan. Based on the information supplied by him over the telephone, American General ran a credit check on Ronald E. Wilder, finding his credit to be excellent. American General informed the imposter that it would need personal tax returns for the prior two years, and asked him what he intended to do with the proceeds of the desired loan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The imposter sent by electronic facsimile to American General the requested tax returns of Mr. Wilder and explained that he wanted the loan to renovate a property he owned. On Friday, 22 June 2007, American General\u2019s District Manager received the completed loan application and tax returns, performed a cash flow analysis, and obtained approval from senior management for an $18,000.00 loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>On that same morning, American General informed the imposter that the loan was approved. The imposter appeared at noon at American General\u2019s Security Boulevard office in Baltimore County. He proffered an apparent Maryland driver\u2019s license bearing Mr. Wilder\u2019s personal information and the imposter\u2019s photograph. He remained in the loan office for approximately thirty minutes, meeting with the branch manager and a customer account specialist during the loan closing. After all the loan documents were signed, American General issued to the imposter a loan check for $18,000.00, drawn on Wachovia Bank, N.A., and payable to Ronald E. Wilder.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">Later that afternoon, the imposter presented the check to State Security Check Cashing, Inc. (\u201cState Security\u201d), a check cashing business. At the time the imposter appeared in State Security\u2019s office, also on Security Boulevard in Baltimore County, only one employee was on duty, Wanda Decker. Decker considered the same driver\u2019s license that the imposter presented to American General, and reviewed the American General loan documents related to the check. She also compared the check to other checks issued by American General which had been cashed previously by State Security. Deeming the amount of the check relatively \u201clarge,\u201d Decker called Joel Deutsch, State Security\u2019s compliance officer, to confirm that she had taken the proper steps in verifying the check. Deutsch directed Decker to verify the date of the check, the name of the payee on the check, the address of the licensee, the supporting loan paperwork, and whether the check matched other checks in State Security\u2019s system from the issuer. Decker confirmed the results of all of these steps, and, upon Deutsch\u2019s approval, cashed the check, on behalf of State Security, for the imposter for a fee of 3-5%<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the face value of the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">On Monday, 25 June, the next business day after the imposter negotiated the check at State Security, the real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Ronald E. Wilder appeared at the offices of American General indicating that he had been notified by the U.S. Secret Service that a person applied for a loan in his name. At that time, the true Ronald E. Wilder completed an Affidavit of Forgery. As a result of the Affidavit, Thurman Toland, the Branch Manager of American General\u2019s Security Boulevard branch, called Wachovia Bank to determine whether the $18,000.00 check had been presented for payment. Learning that the check had not been presented yet, Toland placed a \u201cstop payment\u201d on the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">State Security filed a civil claim in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Baltimore County, against American General for the face value of the check, plus interest, asserting that it was a holder in due course of American General\u2019s check, that it received the check in good faith, without knowledge of fraud, and that it gave value for the check. On 3 December 2007, the District Court conducted a bench trial. During the trial, the testimonies of Deutsch and Toland revealed three additional, potentially important points: (a) had State Security personnel called American General on 22 June 2007 to verify that American General issued a check to Ronald E. Wilder for $18,000.00, Toland would have confirmed that to be the case; (b) State Security employed a thumb print identification system for its check-cashing business, but, at the time the imposter cashed the check, it was unclear whether it was functional;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (c) although, as part of the loan application process, American General obtained names and telephone numbers of personal references from the imposter, it did not call any of the references before delivering the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>On 19 December 2007, the District Court held in favor of American General, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-4\">What was the one action that either party could have taken \u201cto prevent the loss\u201d? In the Court\u2019s view Security could have withheld payment, to the imposter, until the check cleared on the Defendant\u2019s \u201cout of town\u201d bank. But Security is in the business of cashing checks and charges a fee of between 3% and 5% for the check cashing service; and with a check of this amount, it probably earned a fee of approximately nine hundred ($900.00) dollars. If one is charging that type of a fee, a customer cashing a check on Friday is not going to wait until the following Monday to receive the proceeds. That is a risk of doing the type of business[ ] the Plaintiff chooses to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The District Court concluded that, under Md.Code, Commercial Law Art. \u00a7 3-404(d),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> State Security had not exercised ordinary care in paying the imposter\u2019s check, and that its failure to exercise ordinary care contributed substantially to the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>State Security appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. A hearing was held on 24 July 2008, based on the record made in the District Court. On 8 August 2008, the Circuit Court issued its Memorandum Opinion and Order affirming the judgment of the District Court, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-4\">[The District Court judge] applied the \u00a7 3-404(d) analysis to [State Security] as the \u201cparty who paid the instrument,\u201d and determined that [State Security] failed to exercise ordinary care in paying the $18,000.00 check and that the failure to do so substantially contributed to the loss resulting from payment of the instrument. The decision of the District Court turned on the question of \u201cwhat was the one action that either party could have taken to \u2018prevent the loss?\u2019 \u201d [The District Court judge] determined that [State Security] was the only party who could have prevented the loss by withholding payment to the \u201cimposter\u201d until the check cleared on [American General\u2019s] out-of-town bank and that [State Security\u2019s] failure to do so substantially contributed to the loss resulting from the payment of the $18,000.00 check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">The uncontroverted evidence at trial in the District Court shows that [State Security] immediately paid the $18,000.00 instrument to the imposter without utilizing its thumbprint identification system or waiting until the check cleared on [American General\u2019s] bank. Therefore, there is substantial evidence to support [the District Court judge\u2019s] determination that [State Security] failed to exercise ordinary care in paying the instrument as required by \u00a7 3-404(d), and that failure substantially contributed to the loss. Thus, the decision of the District Court is not clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>State Security pressed on. It filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court, pursuant to Md.Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Art. \u00a7\u00a7 12-305 and 12-307 (2006 Repl. Vol. &amp; Supp. 2008),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> seeking review of the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment. We issued the writ. <em>State Sec. v. Am. Gen., </em>406 Md. 443, 959 A.2d 793 (2008).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Tn the District Court and the Circuit Court, State Security argued that, under Md.Code, Commercial Law Art. \u00a7 3-302, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>was a holder in due course of the check issued by American General. Neither the District Court nor the Circuit Court, however, resolved that claim in reaching their respective judgments. In order to resolve the rights of the parties, it is necessary to address State Security\u2019s \u00a7 3-302 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">A. Commercial Law Art. \u00a7 3-302</p>\n<p id=\"AC\">Section 3-302 of the Commercial Law Article provides, in its entirety, that the definition of a \u201cholder in due course\u201d is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">(a) Subject to subsection (c) and \u00a7 3\u2014106(d), \u201cholder in due course\u201d means the holder of an instrument if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">(1) The instrument when issued or negotiated to the holder does not bear such apparent evidence of forgery or alteration or is not otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">(2) The holder took the instrument (i) for value, (ii) in good faith, (iii) without notice that the instrument is overdue or has been dishonored or that there is an uncured default with respect to payment of another instrument issued as part of the same series, (iv) without notice that the instrument contains an unauthorized signature or has been altered, (v) without notice of any claim to the instrument described in \u00a7 3-306, and (vi) without notice that any party has a defense or claim in recoupment described in \u00a7 3-305(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">(b) Notice of discharge of a party, other than discharge in an insolvency proceeding, is not notice of a defense under subsection (a), but discharge is effective against a person who became a holder in due course with notice of the discharge. Public filing or recording of a document does not of itself constitute notice of a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">(c) Except to the extent a transferor or predecessor in interest has rights as a holder in due course, a person does not acquire rights of a holder in due course of an instrument taken (i) by legal process or by purchase in an execution, bankruptcy, or creditor\u2019s sale or similar proceeding, (ii) by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>purchase as part of a bulk transaction not in ordinary course of business of the transferor, or (iii) as the successor in interest to an estate or other organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-4\">(d) If, under \u00a7 3-303(a)(l), the promise of performance that is the consideration for an instrument has been partially performed, the holder may assert rights as a holder in due course of the instrument only to the fraction of the amount payable under the instrument equal to the value of the partial performance divided by the value of the promised performance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">(e) If (i) the person entitled to enforce an instrument has only a security interest in the instrument and (ii) the person obliged to pay the instrument has a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument that may be asserted against the person who granted the security interest, the person entitled to enforce the instrument may assert rights as a holder in due course only to an amount payable under the instrument which, at the time of enforcement of the instrument, does not exceed the amount of the unpaid obligation secured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">(f) To be effective, notice must be received at a time and in a manner that gives a reasonable opportunity to act on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">(g) This section is subject to any law limiting status as a holder in due course in particular classes of transactions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Neither party argues that any subsection other than subsection (a) is applicable to the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">The first prerequisite to being deemed a holder in due course is that the item held must be an \u201cinstrument.\u201d As used in Title 3 of the Commercial Law Article, \u201c \u2018[\u00a1Instrument\u2019 means a negotiable instrument.\u201d Md.Code, Com. Law Art. \u00a7 3-104. Section 3-104, in relevant part, defines \u201cnegotiable instrument\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">(a) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d), \u201cnegotiable instrument\u201d means an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money, with or without interest or other charges described in the promise or order, if it:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>(1) Is payable to bearer or to order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\">(2) Is payable on demand or at a definite time; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">(3) Does not state any other undertaking or instruction by the person promising or ordering payment to do any act in addition to the payment of money, but the promise or order may contain (i) an undertaking or power to give, maintain, or protect collateral to secure payment, (ii) an authorization or power to the holder to confess judgment or realize on or dispose of collateral, or (iii) a waiver of the benefit of any law intended for the advantage or protection of an obligor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">(c) An order that meets all of the requirements of subsection (a), except paragraph (1), and otherwise falls within the definition of \u201ccheck\u201d in subsection (f) is a negotiable instrument and a check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">(f) \u201cCheck\u201d means (i) a draft, other than a documentary draft, payable on demand and drawn on a bank or (ii) a cashier\u2019s check or teller\u2019s check. An instrument may be a check even though it is described on its face by another ' term, such as \u201cmoney order\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">The parties do not dispute that the check issued to the imposter by American General satisfies the definition of a negotiable instrument for the purposes of Title 3 of the Commercial Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Under subsection (a) of section 3-302 of the Commercial Law Article, there are multiple additional requirements that the holder of the instrument must satisfy in order to be a holder in due course. As iterated previously, those requirements are: the \u201cinstrument when issued or negotiated to the holder does not bear such apparent evidence of forgery or alteration or is not otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity\u201d; and the holder took the instrument (1) for value, (2) in good faith, (3) \u201cwithout notice that the instrument is overdue or has been dishonored or that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>there is an uncured default with respect to payment of another instrument issued as part of the same series,\u201d (4) without notice that the instrument contains an unauthorized signature or has been altered, (5) \u201cwithout notice of any claim to the instrument described in \u00a7 3-306,\u201d and (6) \u201cwithout notice that any party has a defense or claim in recoupment described in \u00a7 3-305(a).\u201d State Security alleges that all of the requirements are satisfied in the present case. American General disputes State Security\u2019s allegations as to only one of the prerequisites\u2014the good faith requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">American General argues that, because of the \u201csuspicious circumstances\u201d under which the imposter negotiated the check with State Security, State Security failed to satisfy the Title 3 requirement of good faith. In support of this position, American General advances five points, which, the company argues, when considered together, should defeat State Security\u2019s claim: (1) State Security\u2019s failure to develop any special procedures to validate the authenticity of large checks being presented at its check cashing business, as confirmed by the testimony of Decker and Deutsch that all checks are treated the same, regardless of amount, and that when Decker called Deutsch for assistance, Deutsch merely re-traced the steps Decker already had taken; (2) State Security \u201cshould have known that no competent businessman uses a check-cashing facility for an $18,000 check unless a stop payment order is likely\u201d (in support of this contention, American General states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai\">State Security was much better positioned to detect the fraud because reasonable businessmen, while they commonly use finance companies to obtain $18,000 loans to develop property, rarely, if ever, use check-cashing services that immediately slice 3-5% off their investment to process their loans....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">Appellee American General, a finance company, had no reason to suspect a customer who had two years of tax returns showing he was self-employed, a high credit score, and a valid Maryland driver\u2019s license was perpetrating a crime when seeking an $18,000 loan purportedly to develop a property he owned. Appellant State Security, however, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>fee-charging check cashing service, had every reason to suspect wrongdoing when someone walked in off the street with an out-of-state $18,000 loan check and agreed to share several hundred dollars of it with State Security. Yet, seeing a hefty transaction fee, State Security turned a blind eye to these suspicious circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">(footnote omitted)); (3) Wilder had not been a customer of State Security previously and was not a member of State Security\u2019s business. <em>(See </em>Md.Code, Fin. Inst. Art. \u00a7 12-120(b) (2003 Repl. Vol. &amp; Supp. 2008) (capping check cashing service membership fees at a one-time fee of $5); (4) State Security\u2019s failure to use its thumbprint identification system, even though the system may not have been functioning at the time of the transaction, was critical because \u201c[h]ad State Security told the impostor that it would not complete the transaction without his thumbprint, he likely would not have proceeded and looked instead for a more careless victim\u201d; and, 5) the imposter presented the check to State Security on a Friday afternoon, \u201cjust hours before most banks and businesses closed for the weekend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">State Security retorts that, under the circumstances of this case, its actions were sufficient to satisfy the good faith statutory requirement. State Security argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">It cannot be seriously argued that State Security did not act in good faith. There was no evidence that it had any idea that the person presenting the check was not Ronald E. Wilder. To the contrary, all the evidence points to State Security having made all commercially reasonable efforts to verify that the person presenting the check was the person who was intended to have the check. By matching the signatures on the loan documents with the signature of the person who presented the check, and by verifying that against the driver\u2019s license, State Security did all that could be expected of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The definition of \u201cgood faith,\u201d for the purposes of Title 3 of the Commercial Law Article, is found in Commercial Law Article \u00a7 3-103(a)(4): \u201c \u2018Good faith\u2019 means honesty in fact and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.\u201d Md.Code, Com. Law Art. \u00a7 3-103. Official Comment 4 to \u00a7 3-103 expounds further regarding the intended meaning of \u201cgood faith\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\">\u25a04. Subsection (a)(4) introduces a definition of good faith to apply to Titles 3 and 4. Former Titles 3 and 4 used the definition in Section 1-201(19). The definition in Subsection (a)(4) is consistent with the definitions of good faith applicable to Titles 2, 2A, 4, and 4A. The definition requires not only honesty in fact, but also \u201cobservance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.\u201d Although fair dealing is a broad term that must be defined in context, it is clear that it is concerned with the fairness of conduct rather than the care with which an act is performed. Failure to exercise ordinary care in conducting a transaction is an entirely different concept than failure to deal fairly in conducting the transaction. Both fair dealing and ordinary care, which is defined in Section 3-103(a)(7), are to be judged in the light of reasonable commercial standards, but those standards in each case are directed to different aspects of commercial conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Md.Code, Com. Law Art. \u00a7 3-103 cmt. 4. Professors White and Summers explain this definition of \u201cgood faith,\u201d and the commentary provided in Comment 4, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">What does all of that mean? And what evidence is likely to be introduced to prove lack of reasonable commercial standards? Note that under section 3-308(b) a plaintiff confronted with defenses or claims has the burden of proving \u201crights of a holder in due course,\u201d and thus the burden will be on the creditor plaintiff to show good faith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">Where might this arise? One can imagine many variations on this basic theme: a depositary bank takes a check, only to have other banks say <em>they </em>would not have taken such a check and that to do so violated commercial standards. For example, would it violate commercial standards for a bank to take a $100,000 cheek to open an account and later to allow the depositor to withdraw the funds? If not, the bank could be a holder in due course who might take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>free of a drawer\u2019s claim to that instrument even though the person with whom it dealt was a thief, not so? For reasons stated below we think the bank here would be in good faith. Can a payee violate commercial standards by demanding payment on a \u201cdemand note\u201d where there has been no default in the underlying obligation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\">Similar arguments might well arise at the closing of a kite, where one of the banks seeks to defend itself against a restitution claim by arguing it gave value in good faith and is protected by 3-418. That bank might be met with the argument that it was not a good faith holder of the checks passing through its hands because by observing reasonable commercial standards it should have understood the checks to be part of a kite. As we indicate elsewhere, we hope that few people are successful in asserting restitution causes of action after kites, but we anticipate that those arguments will be made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">Before one concludes that the banks described in the preceding paragraphs are not in good faith, return to the definition. A bank that fails to follow commercial standards is not in good faith only if it deviates from commercial standards of \u201cfair dealing.\u201d Deviating from such standards on the side of generosity and gullibility rather than venality does not render one\u2019s act in bad faith. So beware, good faith does not require general conformity to \u201creasonable commercial standards,\u201d but only to \u201creasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.\u201d The issue is one of \u201cunfairness\u201d not of \u201cnegligence.\u201d If the Code is tilting back toward an objective standard, it is going only so far. We are clear on that point, but the courts are divided. As we see below, some courts insist on confusing negligence with unfairness. Some also find a duty for a depositary bank to consider the interests of all parties involved, including the drafter of the note with whom the banks has never had dealings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">2 James J. White &amp; Robert S. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 17-6, at 191-92 (5th ed. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Both parties here find solace in <em>Any Kind Checks Cashed, Inc. v.

The issue before the Florida court was whether a check cashing store, Any Kind Checks Cashed, Inc., qualified as a holder in due course of a $10,000 check written by an elderly man, John G.

Talcott and Rivera spoke again the next day, at which time Rivera indicated that $10,000 was more than was needed for expenses, and that $5,700 would be sufficient. <em>Id. </em>As a result of that conversation, Talcott called his bank and placed a stop payment on the $10,000 check. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Despite the 11 January conversation between Talcott and Rivera, Guarino appeared at Any Kind\u2019s office in Stuart, Florida, on 11 January and presented the $10,000 check. <em>Id. </em>The store supervisor, Nancy Michael, who had the authority to approve checks over $2,000, examined Guarino\u2019s driver\u2019s license and the Federal Express envelope from Talcott in which Guarino received the check. <em>Id. </em>She asked Guarino the purpose of the check, and, consistent with the information on Guarino\u2019s customer card with Any Kind, he informed her that he was a broker and that the maker of the check sent it to him for investment purposes. <em>Id. </em>Michael was unable to contact Talcott by telephone. <em>Id. </em>Believing that the check was good, based on her experience, and the fact that it was sent to Guarino, the payee, in the Federal Express envelope, Michael cashed the check for Guarino for the $10,000 amount, minus a 5% check cashing fee. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">On 15 January 2000, Rivera called Talcott and asked about the requested $5,700. <em>Id. </em>That same day, Talcott sent a check for that amount, under the impression that Rivera knew that Talcott had stopped payment on the $10,000 check. <em>Id. </em>On 17 January, Guarino went into Any Kind and presented the $5,700 check to the teller on duty at the time, Joanne Kochaki<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>an. <em>Id. </em>Guarino also presented the Federal Express envelope in which the check had come. <em>Id. </em>Any Kind\u2019s company policy required a supervisor to approve a check over $2,000. <em>Id. </em>Kochakian noticed that Michael approved previously the $10,000 check, and called Michael, who was working at another location, to notify her of the $5,700 check. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Any Kind did not have any written procedures that a supervisor was required to follow in determining whether to cash a check over $2,000. <em>Id. </em>Michael possessed the discretionary power to decide whether a presented check was \u201cgood.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On this occasion, Michael instructed Kochakian not to cash the check until she contacted the drawer, Talcott, and obtained approval. <em>Id. </em>at 163. Kochakian was able to reach Talcott by telephone, and Talcott approved cashing the $5,700 check. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">On 19 January, Rivera called Talcott to inform him that Guarino was a thief. <em>Id. </em>Talcott immediately contacted his bank and stopped payment on the $5,700 check. <em>Id. </em>The trial court found that there was no dispute that Guarino and Rivera had scammed Talcott by inducing him to issue both checks. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Any Kind filed a two-count complaint against Guarino and Talcott, alleging that it was a holder in due course of both checks. <em>Id. </em>The trial court found in favor of Any Kind regarding the $5,700 check, but in favor of Talcott as to the $10,000 check. <em>Id. </em>The trial court found that the circumstances surrounding the cashing of the $10,000 check were sufficient to put Any Kind on notice that \u201csome confirmation or explanation should be obtained.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">On review, the Florida appellate court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding that Any Kind was not a holder in due course of the $10,000 check because the company did not act \u201cin good faith,\u201d within the meaning provided in Florida\u2019s commercial law statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 168.

The $10,000 personal check was not the typical check cashed at a check cashing outlet. The size of the check, in the context of the check cashing business, was a proper factor to consider under the objective standard of good faith in deciding whether Any Kind was a holder in due course. <em>See [Me. Family Fed. Credit Union v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Can., </em>727 A.2d 335, 344 (Me.1999)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-4\">Guarino was not the typical customer of a check cashing outlet. As the trial judge observed, because of the 5% fee charged, it is unusual for a small businessman such as a broker to conduct business through a check cashing store instead of through a traditional bank. Guarino did not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>a history with Any Kind of cashing checks of similar size without incident. The need for speed in a business transaction is usually less acute than for someone cashing a paycheck or welfare check to pay for life\u2019s necessities. The need for speed in cashing a large business check is consistent with a drawer who, for whatever reason, might stop payment. Fair dealing in this case required that the $10,000 check be approached with a degree of caution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\">If a drawer has a right to stop payment of a check, and a traditional bank usually places a hold on uncollected funds after a payee deposits a check into an account, then the legal dispute after a stop payment will usually be between the drawer of the check and the payee, the two parties that had the dealings leading to the payment. Thus, where a check is cashed at a bank or savings and loan, the law will often place the loss on the wrongdoer in the underlying transaction. This is a desirable goal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">When a check cashing store releases funds immediately, the holder in due course doctrine steps in, frequently putting the loss on a wronged maker, in furtherance of the policy that facilitating the transfer of checks benefits the economy. In this case, the policy reasons behind easy negotiability do not outweigh the reasons for caution. Very loose application of the objective component of \u201cgood faith\u201d would make check cashing outlets the easy refuge of scam artists who want to take the money and run. The concept of \u201cfair dealing\u201d includes not being an easy, safe harbor for the dishonest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 167-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Arguing that the policy rationale of <em>Taleott, </em>in particular the <em>Talcott </em>court\u2019s association that the need for speed in cashing a large business check \u201cis consistent with a drawer who, for whatever reason, might stop payment,\u201d American General contends that the ersatz Wilder\u2019s negotiation of the $18,000 check for a 3-5% fee at a check cashing store should have put State Security on \u201cinquiry notice that some confirmation or explanation should be obtained,\u201d and that because State Security applied the same level of scrutiny to checks presented, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>regardless of their amounts, State Security \u201cmakes itself a magnet for impostors,\u201d thereby shedding its ability to claim \u201cgood faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">State Security responds by noting a factual distinction between the situation presented in <em>Talcott </em>and the situation here. It points out that in <em>Talcott </em>the appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s holding that the check cashing store was a holder in due course of the $5,700 check, but not the $10,000 check. State Security interprets the Florida court\u2019s opinion as indicating that the real issue was whether, under the circumstances presented there, the check cashing company should have verified with the maker of the $10,000 check that the $10,000 check was valid. Had the check cashing store asked Talcott whether the $10,000 check was valid when it was presented by Guarino, it w\u2019ould have learned that Talcott had placed a stop payment order on it. In contrast, by confirming with Talcott, the drawer, that the $5,700 check was valid at the time it was presented, the check cashing store satisfied the good faith requirement for a holder in due course.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Thus, not surprisingly, State Security reasons that the relevant inquiry in the present case is whether it took adequate steps before cashing the check to ensure that the $18,000 check issued by American General was valid. State Security posits that \u201cfj]ust as [the check cashing store in TalcottJ was not required to make sure that Mr. Talcott was not the victim of a scam, so too, State Security cannot be legally obligated to determine that American General should not have wanted to issue the check it issued.\u201d It points here to the testimony of Toland, American General\u2019s Branch Manager, who stated that, had State Security called him, he would have verified that the check represented the proceeds of a loan transaction American General had closed with someone it believed to be Wilder. Based on this distinction, State Security argues that <em>Talcott </em>actually supports a finding of good faith here because had State Security contacted American General regarding the validity of the check presented by the imposter, it would have learned only that the check was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Professors White and Summers express some skepticism at how many courts have viewed check cashing businesses with regard to the good faith requirement for a holder in due course:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">Check cashing companies appear to be the pariahs of holder in due course law. In <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Camp, </em>[159 Ohio App.3d 784, 825 N.E.2d 644 (2005),] a check cashing company sued drawer for payment after drawer contacted his bank and ordered the bank to stop payment. Drawer of check had negotiated with a contractor for services to be completed over the next three days and drawer drafted a post-dated check as payment. (The check bore the date of the projected date of completion of the services.) Contractor immediately cashed check with plaintiff, who submitted the check for payment. The drawer, fearing services would not be completed, contacted his bank the same day and ordered it to stop payment. The court held that the future date on the check should have put the check cashing company on notice that the check might not be good. The court also held that the company failed to act in a commercially reasonable manner, and did not take the check in \u201cgood faith,\u201d when it did not attempt to verify the check. We are less certain than the court is about the commercial practice with respect to postdated checks. In some circumstances it might be commercially unreasonable to take a postdated check over-the-counter without some explanation from the customer, but that surely would not be true of a check presented to an ATM.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">In <em>Any Kind Checks Cashed, Inc. v. Talcott, </em>a court held that the check cashing service did not act in good faith and should have verified a $10,000 check drawn on a 93 year-old\u2019s account when presented for cashing by a financial broker. \u201c[The] procedures followed were not reasonably related to achieve fair dealing, ... taking into consideration all of the participants in the transaction.\u201d The court held that the financial broker was not the typical customer of a check cashing outlet because small businessmen rarely use a check cashing service that charges a 5% fee instead of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>traditional bank. The business check is not the welfare or payroll check usually cashed at such an establishment. The court held that the need for speed in cashing a large business check is consistent with a drawer who might stop payment and fair dealing requires that the $10,000 check be approached with caution. \u201cThe concept of \u2018fair dealing\u2019 includes not being an easy, safe harbor for the dishonest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7x\">Both the Buckeye Check-Cashing case and the Any Kind Checks Cashed case show courts that are quick to deny holder in due course status to check cashing facilities. We wonder how these courts would have handled these cases had the plaintiffs been banks and not check cashing facilities. In effect the courts are asking check cashers to adhere to a higher standard than might be required of a bank. Given the clientele of check cashing facilities, the courts\u2019 skepticism might be justified, but we would like to see a little more evidence that check-cashing facilities are a home for persons engaged in fraudulent behavior before we would subject them to higher standards than might be applied to a bank.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">White &amp; Summers, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 17-6, at 197-98 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Under \u00a7 3-308(b),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the burden is on a plaintiff to prove \u201crights of a holder in due course,\u201d including situations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>such as the present, where the defense is that the plaintiff did not take the instrument in good faith. White &amp; Summers, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 17-6, at 191; <em>see </em>Md.Code, Com. Law Art. \u00a7 3-308 cmt. <em>2 </em>(\u201cSubsection (b) means only that if the plaintiff claims the rights of a holder in due course against the defense or claim in recoupment, the plaintiff has the burden of proof on that issue.\u201d). We conclude here that State Security is entitled to enforce the check because it has met its burden of proving that it took the check in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The core of the dispute between banking institutions over the good faith requirement most often distills to one banking institution taking a check, only to have another banking institution charge that, under the circumstances, it would not have taken that check, and that taking the check was a violation of commercial standards. <em>See </em>White &amp; Summers, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 17-6, at 191 (\u201cWhere might th[e good faith issue] arise? One can imagine many variations on this basic theme: a depositary bank takes a check, only to have other banks say <em>they </em>would not have taken such a check and that to do so violated commercial standards.\u201d). This is the dispute presented in the present case, albeit not between two banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Here, unlike in <em>Talcott </em>where the check presented to the check cashing business was a personal check sent via Federal Express, State Security took a check, issued by American General to the imposter in person, and relied on much of the same documentation and/or identification that American General had relied on in giving the imposter the loan proceeds check in the first place.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That the check presented in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>case was a check drawn by American General, a financial institution, is a significant distinction from that of the personal check presented in <em>Talcott </em>for two reasons: the check itself was more likely to be valid, including the drawer\u2019s signature, as confirmed by State Security\u2019s comparing it to prior American General checks it had cashed; and the payee of the check was more likely to have been subjected to an examination of her or his personal identification, credit-worthiness, and purpose for taking out the loan, as confirmed by State Security\u2019s review of the driver\u2019s license presented and the loan documents before cashing the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">American General\u2019s position that State Security did not take the check in good faith seems anomalous when State Security relied on the same document for personal identification, as well as the loan documents that American General generated in issuing the check to the imposter, when cashing the check.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because the check was issued by American General as the proceeds of a loan, a transaction verified by State Security,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>adoption of American General\u2019s position would require us to hold State Security, a check cashing business, to a higher commercial standard than American General, simply because the financial institution was duped into issuing the check to an imposter.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">American General\u2019s desire that we hold the check cashing company here to a higher standard shall not carry the day.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> First, although it may be \u201cunusual\u201d for a person in the imposter\u2019s situation to use a check cashing business, instead of a traditional bank, <em>Talcott, </em>830 So.2d at 168-69, whatever inhering \u201cunusualness\u201d does not inexorably negate good faith on State Security\u2019s part. State Security examined the same document of identification of the imposter (the forged driver\u2019s license), as well as the accompanying loan documents American General had prepared, to verify that the check presented by the imposter was the proceeds of a loan issued validly by American General, with the imposter as the intended payee, before cashing the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The other four points of concern advanced by American General are too speculative to alter our analysis. The fact that State Security \u201chas no special procedures to validate large checks\u201d is irrelevant for two reasons: a) the procedures State Security did utilize were quite similar to that of American General; and b) American General presented no evidence of any procedure State Security was \u201clacking\u201d when it cashed the imposter\u2019s check that, if present, should have persuaded State Security to proceed other than as it did. Second, the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>that Ronald E. Wilder had not been a customer of State Security previously is irrelevant because of the verification steps State Security took before cashing the check, and because it does not appear from the record that American General itself was familiar with Wilder before the transactions in question. Third, we find American General\u2019s assertion that, had State Security asked the imposter to submit a thumbprint, the imposter likely would not have proceeded, to be the most speculative argument of all. The testimony in the record reveals that State Security\u2019s thumbprint machine may not have been working at the time and, in any event, because the machine was not connected to any centralized database, the thumbprint could be effective only in identifying the imposter after the fact or for future transactions at State Security. Without any supporting evidence, we do not accept American General\u2019s bald assertion that this imposter, who obtained and utilized two years of tax returns and other personal identification information for Mr. Wilder, would have been dissuaded from accomplishing the final step of an identity theft by being asked for his thumbprint.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> And fourth, the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>imposter presented the check at State Security on a Friday afternoon is equally likely to be coincidental, in light of the substantial identity theft actions undertaken, with the timing of his receipt of the check from American General\u2014that same Friday afternoon\u2014than with the conclusion that the timing was premeditated because the weekend was near.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">We conclude therefore that State Security overcame American General\u2019s defense of a lack of good faith, as required under \u00a7 3-308(b), and, thus, that State Security took the check from the imposter in \u201cgood faith,\u201d defined as \u201chonesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.\u201d Md.Code, Com. Law Art. \u00a7 3-103. As State Security indicates, there was no evidence at the time the check was presented that the person presenting the check was not the true Ronald E. Wilder, and State Security, as we have concluded, took commercially reasonable efforts to verify that the person presenting the check was the person who was intended to have the check as the proceeds of a valid loan issued by American General. Because we conclude that State Security took the check in \u201cgood faith,\u201d and American General does not dispute any of the other requirements for State Security to be considered a holder in due course of the check, we resolve that State Security was a holder in due course of the check cashed by the imposter.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">B.

Law Art. \u00a7 3-404. Regarding our imposter in the present case, the District Court ruled, under \u00a7 3-404(d), that State Security did not exercise ordinary care in paying the check presented by him, and that the failure to exercise such care contributed substantially to the loss. The Circuit Court, in affirming that judgment, concluded that there was substantial evidence to support the District Court\u2019s finding, and therefore the District Court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">The scope of appellate review of an appeal taken on the record from the District Court, with regards to that court\u2019s findings of fact, is the same as that provided under former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Maryland Rule 1386, now embodied in current Maryland Rule 8-131(c). <em>Ryan v. Thurston, </em>276 Md. 390, 392, 347 A.2d 834, 836 (1975). Maryland Rule 8-131(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\">(c) Action tried without a jury. When an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Md. Rule 8\u2014131(c). In <em>$3,417.46 U.S. Money v. Kinnamon, </em>326 Md. 141, 604 A.2d 64 (1992), we elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">In <em>Ryan v. Thurston, </em>276 Md. 390, 391-92, 347 A.2d 834 (1975), we analogized the scope of review of a circuit court under Maryland Rule 1386 to that possessed by this Court and the Court of Special Appeals under former Maryland Rules 886 and 1086 (the provisions of both now being contained in Maryland Rule 8-131(c)). <em>See Housing Comm\u2019n v. Lacey, </em>322 Md. 56, 59, 585 A.2d 219 (1991). These rules have been consistently interpreted in our cases to require that appellate courts accept and be bound by findings of fact of the lower court unless they are clearly erroneous. And as we said in <em>Ryan v. Thurston, supra, </em>276 Md. at 392, 347 A.2d 834, \u201c[t]he appellate court must consider evidence produced at the trial in a light most favorable to the prevailing party and if substantial evidence was presented to support the trial court\u2019s determination, it is not clearly erroneous and cannot be disturbed.\u201d Moreover, as we reiterated in <em>Housing Comm\u2019n v. Lacey, supra, </em>322 Md. at 59-60, 585 A.2d 219, the trial court is not only the judge of a witness\u2019s credibility but also of the weight to be attached to the evidence. It is thus plain that the appellate court should not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court on its findings of fact but will only determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>light of the total evidence. <em>See Kowell Ford, Inc. v. Doolan, </em>283 Md. 579, 584, 391 A.2d 840 (1978).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><em>Kinnamon, </em>326 Md. at 149, 604 A.2d at 67-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\"> We review the trial court\u2019s application of law to the facts, however, for legal error (a non-deferential standard). <em>See Liddy v. Lamone, </em>398 Md. 233, 247, 919 A.2d 1276, 1285 (2007) (\u201cWith respect to the standard of review for mixed questions of fact and law, in <em>Bowers v. Eastern Aluminum Corp., </em>on the other hand, we held that this Court must affirm the trial court\u2019s decision on mixed questions of fact and law when \u2018we cannot say [that its findings] were clearly erroneous!,] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [a]nd we find no error in [its] application of the law to the facts.\u2019 240 Md. 625, 214 A.2d 924 (1965).\u201d). Similarly, we review the trial court\u2019s pure conclusions of law under the <em>de novo </em>standard. <em>See id. </em>at 246-47, 919 A.2d at 1285 (\u201cIn addition, this Court has held that questions of law, <em>i.e. </em>whether the facts taken together are sufficient to sustain the defense of laches, are subject to review under the <em>de novo </em>standard.\u201d) (citations omitted). In the present case, we find, for the reasons that follow, that the District Court erred as a matter of law in concluding that State Security did not meet the statutory standard of ordinary care, and that the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed substantially to the loss. Hence, the Circuit Court erred in affirming the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The District Court determined initially and correctly that the imposter rule applies in this case because all of the pertinent requirements of Commercial Law Art. \u00a7 3-404(a) were present. As noted, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3-404(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">(a) If an impostor, by use of the mails or otherwise, induces the issuer of an instrument to issue the instrument to the impostor, or to a person acting in concert with the impostor, by impersonating the payee of the instrument or a person authorized to act for the payee, an indorsement of the instrument by any person in the name of the payee is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>effective as the indorsement of the payee in favor of a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Md.Code, Com. Law Art. \u00a7 3-404(a). Although \u201cimposter\u201d is not defined in the Commercial Law Article, in <em>Bank of Glen Burnie v. Elkridge Bank, </em>120 Md.App. 402, 707 A.2d 438 (1998), the Court of Special Appeals concluded that \u201c \u2018[ijmposter\u2019 is defined as \u2018one who poses as another to obtain benefits under a negotiable instrument.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bank of Glen Burnie, </em>120 Md.App. at 408-09, 707 A.2d at 441 (citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 756 (6th ed. 1991)). There is no doubt that, by appearing in person at both American General and State Security to conduct transactions, which included the presentation of a forged driver\u2019s license with the imposter\u2019s picture, but the name and personal identification information of Ronald E. Wilder, the individual in this case was a person who posed as another to obtain the benefits of the check issued by American General. There also is no doubt that, by posing as Mr. Wilder, the imposter induced American General to issue the check to him.

Comment 3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">3. In cases governed by subsection (a) the dispute will normally be between the drawer of the check that was obtained by the impostor and the drawee bank that paid it. The drawer is precluded from obtaining recredit of the drawer\u2019s account by arguing that the check was paid on a forged indorsement so long as the drawee bank acted in good faith in paying the check. Cases governed by subsection (d) are illustrated by Cases # 1 through # 5 in Comment 2. <em>In Cases # 1, #2, and </em># <em>3 there is no forgery of the check, thus the drawer of the check takes the loss if there is no lack of good faith by the banks involved. </em>Cases # 4 and # 5 are forged check cases. Depositary Bank is entitled to retain the proceeds of the check if it didn\u2019t know about the forgery. Under Section 3-418 the drawee bank is not entitled to recover from Depositary Bank on the basis of payment by mistake because Depositary Bank took the check in good faith and gave value for the check when the credit given for the check was withdrawn. And there is no breach of warranty under Section 3-417(a)(l) or (3) or 4-208(a)(1) or (3). Unless Section 3-406 applies the loss is taken by the drawee bank if a forged check is paid, and that is the result in Case # 5. In Case # 4 the loss is taken by Corporation, the drawer, because an agreement between Corporation and the drawee bank allowed the bank to debit Corporation\u2019s account despite the unauthorized use of the check-writing machine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\"><em>If a check payable to an impostor, fictitious payee, or payee not intended to have an interest in the check is paid, the effect of subsections (a) and (b) is to place the loss on the drawer of the check rather than on the drawee or the Depositary Bank that took the check for collection. Cases governed by subsection (a) always involve fraud, andffaud </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number><em>is almost always involved in cases governed by subsection (b). The drawer is in the best position to avoid the fraud and thus should take the loss. This is true in Case </em># <em>1, Case </em># <em>2, and Case # 3. But in some cases the person taking the check might have detected the fraud and thus have prevented the loss by the exercise of ordinary care. In those cases, if that person failed to exercise ordinary care, it is reasonable that that person bear loss to the extent the failure contributed to the loss. Subsection (d) is intended to reach that result. It allows the person ivho suffers loss as a result of payment of the check to recover from the person who failed to exercise ordinary care. In Case # 1, Case </em># <em>2, and Case </em># <em>3, the person suffering the loss is Corporation, the d,rawer of the check. In each case the most likely defendant is the depositary bank that took the check and failed to exercise ordinary care. In those cases, the dranver has a cause of action against the offending bank to recover a portion of the loss. The amount of loss to be allocated to each party is left to the trier of fact. Ordinary care is defined in Section 3-103(a)(7). </em>An example of the type of conduct by a depositary bank that could give rise to recovery under subsection (d) is discussed in Comment 4 to Section 3-405. That comment addresses the last sentence of Section 3-d05(b) which is similar to Section 3\u2014404(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-4\">In Case # 1, Case # 2, and Case # 3, there was no forgery of the drawer\u2019s signature. But cases involving checks payable to a fictitious payee or a payee not intended to have an interest in the check are often forged check cases as well. Examples are Case # 4 and Case # 5. Normally, the loss in forged check cases is on the drawee bank that paid the check. Case # 5 is an example. In Case # 4 the risk with respect to the forgery is shifted to the drawer because of the agreement between the drawer and the drawee bank. The doctrine that prevents a drawee bank from recovering payment with respect to a forged check if the payment was made to a person who took the check for value and in good faith is incorporated into Section 3-418 and Sections 3\u2014417(a)(3) and 4\u2014208(a)(3). This doctrine is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>based on the assumption that the depositary bank normally has no way of detecting the forgery because the drawer is not that bank\u2019s customer. On the other hand, the drawee bank, at least in some cases, may be able to detect the forgery by comparing the signature on the check with the specimen signature that the drawee has on file. But in some forged check cases the depositary bank is in a position to detect the fraud. Those cases typically involve a check payable to a fictitious payee or a payee not intended to have an interest in the check. Subsection (d) applies to those cases. If the depositary bank failed to exercise ordinary care and the failure substantially contributed to the loss, the drawer in Case # 4 or the drawee bank in Case # 5 has a cause of action against the depositary bank under subsection (d). Comment 4 to Section 3-405 can be used as a guide to the type of conduct that could give rise to recovery under Section 3-404(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Md.Code, Com. Law Art. \u00a7 3-404 cmt. 3 (emphasis added). As Official Comment 3 indicates, the default loss in cases involving imposters lies with the drawer because the drawer is the party that dealt directly with the imposter and thus was in the best position to detect the fraud. <em>Cf. Dominion Bank, N.A. v. Household Bank, F.S.B., </em>827 F.Supp. 463, 466-67 (S.D.Ohio 1993) (\u201cThe loss is shifted to the drawer, because the drawer is presumed to have been in the best position to have prevented the fraud. The rationale supporting the impostor rule is essentially the same as that supporting the general rule: the party with the closest contact with the forger ought to bear the responsibility for the loss occasioned by the forgery.\u201d); <em>N. Side State Bank v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>894 P.2d 1046, 1053 (Okla.1994) (\u201cKnown as the \u201cimpostor rule,\u201d \u00a7 3-405(l)(a) creates an exception to the general notions that govern forged documents. This is so because this section places the loss on the drawer when one who impersonates a third person fraudulently induces the drawer to issue a check and places him in possession. The drawer in that scenario is in the best position to prevent forgery by exercising reasonable care in identifying the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>for whom the check is to be issued.\u201d) (footnotes omitted); <em>Fair Park Nat\u2019l Bank v. Sw. Inv. Co., </em>541 S.W.2d 266, 269-70 (Tex.Civ.App.1976) (\u201cThis interpretation is consistent with the policy of the impostor rule, which is to throw the loss resulting from dealing with an impostor on the person who dealt with the impostor, and, presumably, had the best opportunity to take precautions that would have detected the fraud, rather than on a subsequent holder, who had no similar opportunity.\u201d) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In certain situations, a drawer may reduce its loss by recovering damages from a person who failed to exercise ordinary care in paying the instrument or taking it for value or collection, if that failure contributed substantially to loss resulting from payment of the instrument, to the extent the failure to exercise care contributed to the loss. Md.Code, Com. Law Art. \u00a7 3\u2014404(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">The District Court\u2019s ruling in favor of American General erred in two respects: a) the ruling is not in accord with the statutory definition of \u201cordinary care,\u201d in light of the uncontradicted testimony of Deutsch, State Security\u2019s compliance officer, and b) the ruling erred by shifting the default burden of loss in an imposter case to the subsequent holder, State Security, rather than the party who was in the best position to detect the fraud, the drawer, American General.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">With regard to the interpretation of \u201cordinary care,\u201d the statutory definition of \u201cordinary care\u201d contains three elements: 1) observance of reasonable commercial standards, 2) which prevail in the area in which the person is located, 3) with respect to the business in which the person is engaged. Md.Code, Com. Law Art. \u00a7 3-103(a)(7). In the proceedings before the District Court, the testimony of Deutsch, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>manager who \u201crun[s] State Security Check Cashing,\u201d bore directly upon State Security\u2019s conduct on the day in question and, more generally, upon State Security\u2019s general business procedures in the check cashing business. Deutsch testified that he has been involved in the check cashing business for twenty-two years and that he had occasion to cash \u201clarge\u201d checks in the past. American General did not challenge Deutsch\u2019s testimony on cross-examination, nor did American General offer any countervailing testimony reflecting upon State Security\u2019s conduct in light of its business practices or the location of its branch office. The only testimony American General elicited on point was through cross-examination of Wanda Decker, State Security\u2019s clerk, who testified that State Security, before disbursing, does not hold a check (regardless of the amount) to ascertain whether the funds are available. That testimony alone, however, does not diminish State Security\u2019s conduct in the matter in question. Thus, American General did not present sufficient evidence at trial to establish that State Security\u2019s conduct lacked \u201cordinary care\u201d under the statutory definition.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>With regard to the burden of loss, the District Court imagined that the one action either party could have taken to prevent the loss was for State Security to have withheld payment until American General\u2019s check cleared. The trial court concluded that State Security chose not to delay the payment because it earned a fee from cashing the check, and that in so doing, it ran the risk that the check may be dishonored.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Simply put, the conclusion the trial court reached does not comport with sustainable \u201cordinary care\u201d analysis. That a business charges a fee for the utilization of its services, albeit here a check cashing business, for cashing the check, is not determinative of whether the conduct of that business on the occasion in question lacked \u201cordinary care.\u201d Under the circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s reasoning seems directed more towards the \u201cgood faith,\u201d rather than the \u201cordinary care,\u201d requirement. As Judge Easterbrook stated succinctly in <em>State Bank of the Lakes v. Kansas Bankers Surety Co., </em>328 F.3d 906 (7th Cir.2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">\u201c[G]ood faith\u201d is in a different phylum from \u201cdue care\u201d .... Article 3 of the UCC, which contains a definition of \u201cgood faith[,]\u201d ... links commercial reasonableness to \u201cfair dealing.\u201d Avoidance of advantage-taking, which this section is getting at, differs from due care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 909. The trial court seemed persuaded that by cashing the check for a percentage fee, State Security took unfair advantage of the situation. We have already rejected, <em>supra, </em>however, American General\u2019s claim that State Security\u2019s taking the check from the imposter in the circumstances noted above lacked \u201cgood faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">More significantly, the trial court\u2019s ruling in favor of American General is contrary to the position emphasized in Official Comment 3 of \u00a7 3-404 that \u201c[i]f a check payable to an impostor ... is paid, the effect of subsections (a) and (b) is to place the loss on the drawer of the check rather than on the drawee or the Depositary Bank that took the check for collection.\u201d Md.Code, Com. Law Art. \u00a7 3-404 cmt. 3. This is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>due to the recognition that the \u201cdrawer is in the best position to avoid the fraud and thus should take the loss.\u201d Md.Code, Com. Law Art. \u00a7 3^104 cmt. 3. We found no evidence in the record of this case to suggest the application of this default rule would be inappropriate. Of either party involved here, American General had the best means available by which to protect itself against the fraud, the least of which included contacting the personal references the imposter listed on the credit application, which may have helped protect American General against the fraud. We reject American General\u2019s attempt to shift the burden of the loss here to State Security on so tenuous a basis as State Security\u2019s failure to ask the imposter for his thumbprint before cashing the check, where State Security examined the same driver\u2019s license and the loan documents American General created and found satisfactory in issuing the check. <em>See supra </em>notes 14 and 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE DISTRICT COURT AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO ENTER JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF APPELLANT; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-8\">.

Toland testified that American General required the following from the imposter in processing and approving his loan application: a paper application, personal tax returns for 2005 and 2006, a credit report, driver's license, references, and signed loan documents. Decker, State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Security\u2019s teller, testified that State Security required the following in cashing the imposter's check: the check, which was verified for authenticity against other American General checks State Security had cashed, driver's license, and the American General loan documents, which were used to verify the name and signature with those on the check.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b135-6\">. State Security, however, did not require the imposter to present the 2005 and 2006 tax returns, nor did it run a credit check.

We do not consider of sufficient significance to alter our conclusions the fact that State Security did not call American General to confirm that the check represented the proceeds of a valid loan because Thurman Toland, American General\u2019s Branch Manager, testified that had State Security called, he would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>confirmed that the check was the proceeds of a valid loan.

Although being asked for a thumbprint may serve as a powerful deterrent to those attempting 1o pass bad checks, we cannot accept American General's position here, without more support, that an imposter, who already went to the lengths of securing two years of Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Wilder's tax returns and much of his personal information for the forged driver's license and credit applications, likely would have stopped short of completing this theft by being asked for his thumbprint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\">. The effect of being a holder in due course is provided in \u00a7 3-306: A person taking an instrument, other than a person having rights of a holder in due course, is subject to a claim of a property or possessory right in the instrument or its proceeds, including a claim to rescind a negotiation and to recover the instrument or its proceeds. A person having rights of a holder in due course takes free of the claim to the instrument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b139-5\">. As noted above, the entirety of Commercial Law Art. \u00a7 3-404 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">(a) If an impostor, by use of the mails or otherwise, induces the issuer of an instrument to issue the instrument to the impostor, or to a person acting in concert with the impostor, by impersonating the payee of the instrument or a person authorized to act for the payee, an indorsement of the instrument by any person in the name of the payee is effective as the indorsement o\u00ed the payee in favor ol a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">(b) If (i) a person whose intent determines to whom an instrument is payable (\u00a7 3-110(a) or (b)) does not intend the person identified as payee to have any interest in the instrument, or (ii) the person identified as payee of an instrument is a fictitious person, the following rules apply until the instrument is negotiated by a special indorsement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">(1) Any person in possession of the instrument is its holder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">(2) An indorsement by any person in the name of the payee stated in the instrument is effective as the indorsement of the payee in favor of a person who, in good faidi, pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">(c) Under subsection (a) or (b), an indorsement is made in the name of a payee if (i) it is made in a name substantially similar to that of the payee or (ii) the instrument, whether or not indorsed, is deposited in a depositary bank to an account in a name substantially similar to that of the payee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-11\">(d) With respect to an instrument to which subsection (a) or (b) applies, if a person paying the instrument or taking it for value or for collection fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to loss resulting from payment of the instrument, the person bearing the loss may recover ft om the person failing to exercise ordinary care to the extent the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\">. The imposter\u2019s indorsement of the check, in the name of Mr. Wilder, satisfied subsection (c) of \u00a7 3-404, a matter not disputed here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b143-6\">. We pause to note that the parties here are in the inverse position of the typical \u00a7 3-404(d) scenario. State Security, the party that bore the original loss, sued American General, which interposed \u00a7 3-404(d) as a defense for the stop payment order it placed on the check that it drew in this case, the check State Security is seeking to enforce. Section 3-404(d) states that \u201cthe person bearing the loss may recover from the person failing to exercise ordinary care to the extent the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.\u201d Md.Code, Com. Law Arl. \u00a7 3-404(d). Thus, the scenario \u00a7 3-404(d) typically contemplates would be if American General's check had been honored and paid to State Security, with American General subsequently bringing an action against State Security under \u00a7 3-404(d) seeking damages for State Security\u2019s alleged negligence in cashing the check. Regardless, the inverse scenario presented here achieves the same result because under either scenario the intent of subsection (d) is achieved: allocation of loss among the parties based upon each party's respective comparative negligence. As Professors White and Summers explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">Although 3-406 and 4 -406 have always had a provision that diminished (even to zero) a bank's rights if it was negligent, that was not true of 3-405 until 1990. In the absence of a stated contributory negligence standard in former 3-405 (and despite our arguments to the contrary), courts mostly held that the depositary bank's negligence was not relevant in a case under former 3-405. This was so even though negligence contributing to the loss could easily be committed by a bank that cashed or took a padded payroll check for deposit. The 1990 revision changed that. The preclusions in 3-404 and 3-405 are both subject to a comparative negligence standard similar to that described above with respect to 3-406.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">White &amp; Sommers, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 19-4, at 305 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b147-6\">. American General indicates correctly that these three cases were decided under a version of the imposter rule in the Uniform Commercial Code (as adopted in these jurisdictions) that did not include the ordinary care exception. The addilion of the ordinary care exception to the imposter rule does not render these authorities unpersuasive, as American General argues, because Official Comment 3 to \u00a7 3-404 reiterates the policy that the default loss in imposter cases is on the party best able to prevent the loss, the drawer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b148-4\">. At oral argument before us, counsel for American General acknowledged that no evidence was offered by it as to impropriety of any of State Security\u2019s business practices. Counsel indicated correctly, however, that in <em>Talcott, </em>the Florida appellate court was presented with a similar situation, in that no evidence was presented at trial concerning the check cashing industry's commercial standards. <em>Talcott, </em>830 So.2d at 166. The Florida court accepted, as an apparent alternative, scholarly studies regarding the niche occupied by check cashing businesses in the banking and financial industiy. <em>See id. </em>at 166-68. Counsel for American General suggested that we adopt the discussion of the check cashing industry by the Florida appellate court in <em>Talcott. </em>Even were we to accede to that suggestion, it would be of no help to American General because American General would still not have presented any evidence reflecting whether State Security's conduct here lacks commercial reasonableness, particularly due to the fact that the <em>Talcott </em>court limited its analysis exclusively to the \u201cgood faith\u201d requirement. <em>See id. </em>at 166 (\"Even assuming that Any Kind's procedures for checks over $2,000 met the industry's gold standard, we hold that in this case the procedures followed were not reasonably related to achieve fair dealing with respect to the $10,000 check, taking into consideration all of the participants in the transaction, Talcott, Guarino, and Any Kind.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
