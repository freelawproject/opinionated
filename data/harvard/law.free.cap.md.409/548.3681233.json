Under Count 1, did the defendant The Programmers\u2019 Consortium breach a contract between Karl Clark and The Programmers\u2019 Consortium?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">2.

To find there was no bona fide dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant, you must find that the defendant acted in bad faith and without any reasonable basis in refusing to pay the plaintiff the wages that he knew were owed to the plaintiff. An employee\u2019s right to compensation vest when the employee does everything required to earn the wages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>The record shows that the following transpired when the jury returned its verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\">THE CLERK: Number one, under Count 1, did the defendant The Programmers\u2019 Consortium breached [sic] a contract between Karl [Clark] and The Programmers\u2019 Consortium?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-5\">THE FOREPERSON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">THE CLERK: Number 2, state the amount of damages suffered by Mr. Clark as a result of the breach of contract by the defendant The Programmers\u2019 Consortium.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">THE FOREPERSON: $1.00 plus reasonable counsel fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhI\">THE CLERK: Three, under Count 2, did the defendant The Programmers\u2019 Consortium [fail] to pay wages due to Karl Clark at the conclusion of his employment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-8\">THE FOREPERSON: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">THE CLERK: What amount of wages are due to Karl Clark from The Programmers\u2019 Consortium?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\">THE FOREPERSON: $80,000.01.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-11\">THE CLERK: Were the wages to Mr. Clark withheld in violation of the law and not as a result of a bonafide dispute between the parties?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-12\">THE FOREPERSON: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-13\">THE CLERK: Did the plaintiff/counter defendant Karl Clark breach a contract between The Programmers\u2019 Consortium and Karl Clark?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-14\">THE FOREPERSON: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-15\">Petitioner\u2019s post-trial motions were accompanied by a memorandum that included the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-16\">4. <em>There Is No Basis For An Award of [AJttomey\u2019s </em>Fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-17\">Plaintiff filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The motion was filed prematurely, since judgment specifying an award of attorney\u2019s fees has not been entered by the Court. Nevertheless, the Court entered a judgment for attorney\u2019s fees. This was inappropriate under Maryland law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>The jury awarded damages of one dollar ($1.00) plus attorney\u2019s fees under Count 1 of the complaint for breach of contract. No attorney\u2019s fees were awarded under Count II, not [sic] could any fees have been awarded under Count II because the jury found that any failure to pay wages by defendant was no [sic] willful and was the result of a bona fide dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-4\">The jury\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees under Count I was inappropriate. Maryland follows the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d which provides that attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable in a breach of contract action unless specified in a written contract. <em>Wells Fargo Bank Minn., N.A. v. Diamond Point Plaza, </em>171 Md.App. 70, 908 [A.2d] 684 (Md.App.2006). Even in a case alleging breach of contract for failing to pay wages, a prevailing plaintiff can only recover attorney\u2019s fees if there is a written employment contract that provides for payment of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Stevenson v. Branch Banking &amp; Trust Corp., </em>159 Md.App. 620, 861 A.2d 735, 756 (Md.App. 2004). In sum, there was no basis for the jury\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees for breach of contract and, accordingly, no basis for an award of attorney\u2019s fees in this case. The judgment must be amended to strike any award of attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">An award of attorney\u2019s fees was also inappropriate under any statutory wage claim. The only case authority cited by plaintiff in support of this argument, <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>373 Md. 501, 819 A.2d 354 (2003), states that an award of attorney\u2019s fees is only appropriate under \u00a7 3-501.1 if a jury makes a finding that the failure to pay wages was willful. The <em>same paragraph of Friolo </em>quoted in plaintiffs brief plainly states that attorney\u2019s fees are recoverable in a wage claim action <em>\u201conly </em>in those situations where the employer acted willfully\u2014in the absence of a bona fide dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>[at 517, 819 A.2d] at 364. This conclusion is mandated by the language of \u00a7 3-501.1, which plainly requires a finding that an employer acted willfully and without a bona fide dispute in failing to pay wages as a predicate to an award of attorney\u2019s fees. In this case, the jury verdict was that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>defendant had not acted willfully or without a bona fide dispute in failing to pay wages. Accordingly, there is no basis for the claim of attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\">If the Court disagrees with the foregoing argument and awards attorney\u2019s fees, defendant contests the quantum of attorney\u2019s fees requested in this case. Defendant requests document production and discovery of attorney\u2019s fees and a hearing on the issue. Counsel for plaintiff repeatedly stated that he was handling this case on a contingency basis. It is [sic] appears that the record submitted by plaintiff in support of his claim for attorney\u2019s fees was created after the fact, and lumps large numbers of hours for work done over several months into a few time entries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The Circuit Court denied Petitioner\u2019s motions and entered the following Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">UPON CONSIDERATION of the Plaintiffs Motion for Attorney\u2019s Fees and Costs, Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support thereof, ... Defendant The Programmer\u2019s Consortium, Inc.\u2019s Opposition thereto, ... the parties having been heard, and the Court having found that the attorney\u2019s fees and costs are more than reasonable in light of the approximate two (2) year span of litigation, which included significant hours expended on a mediation, four (4) depositions, trial preparation, as well as, drafting and reviewing pleadings, letters, and other documents, it is hereby this 25th day of September, 2007, by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County ORDERED, that the Plaintiffs Motion for Attorney\u2019s Fees and Costs, be and hereby is GRANTED,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">ORDERED, that $41,100.00 in attorney\u2019s fees and $2,794.17 in costs be reduced to a Judgment in favor of the Plaintiff and again the Defendant, The Programmer\u2019s Consortium, Inc.[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Petitioner noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In <em>Programmers\u2019 Consortium, Inc. v. Karl Clark, </em>180 Md.App. 506, 951 A.2d 914 (2008), while affirming the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>judgment of the Circuit Court \u201cin all other respects,\u201d the Court of Special Appeals vacated the award of attorney\u2019s fees and remanded the case for further proceedings on that issue. In doing so, the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-4\">We fully agree with the appellant that the judge had no authority to award attorney\u2019s fees to the appellee for the breach of contract. The appellee, indeed, does not contest this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">If an award could be properly authorized in this case, it could only be by virtue of the Wage Payment Act and, more specifically, by \u00a7 3-507.1(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">We agree with the appellant that under \u00a7 3-507.1 (b) neither enhanced damages may be awarded nor may the payment of attorney\u2019s fee and costs be shifted to the non-prevailing party for an ordinary violation of the Wage Payment Act. Section 3-507.1(b) only comes into play when the basic violation is aggravated by the additional factor that the employer withheld the payment of wages without an even plausibly good reason for having done so, to wit, \u201cnot as a result of a bona fide dispute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">Under \u00a7 3\u2014507.1(b), there are two types of questions calling for decision. There is the substantive question of, \u201cWhat must be decided?\u201d There is, quite distinctly, the procedural question of \u201cWho shall do the deciding?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">The appellant ... asserts, as an axiom not subject to question, that the judge, as a matter of course, is bound by the jury\u2019s decision with respect to the threshold question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>* * ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\">The appellant relies exclusively on the legal argument that the jury\u2019s failure to find that the triggering event under \u00a7 3-507.1(b) occurred forecloses any such finding by the trial judge for his independent qualifying purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">Our holding to the contrary is that the trial judge is free to make such a qualifying determination for his purposes regardless of what the jury may have determined for its very different purposes. Our holding, however, is that the judge, before proceeding with an award for attorney\u2019s fees, \u25a0will be required to make such an actual threshold determination .... In this case, ... we do not know whether the trial judge erroneously awarded attorney\u2019s fees for the breach of promise or permissibly awarded attorney\u2019s fees for the violation of the Wage Payment Law----Even under the Wage Payment Law, moreover, an award of attorney\u2019s fees may not even be considered absent an affirmative threshold finding that the withholding of the wages \u201cwas not as a result of a bona fide dispute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 520-22, 527, 531, 951 A.2d at 922-23, 926, 928.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Petitioner then requested that this Court issue a writ of certiorari to address the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-10\">\n<em>a.

After a jury had determined Higgins\u2019 entitlement, if any, to damages resulting from deficiencies in construction, the trial judge should have determined whether specific performance was appropriate.

Liberty Homes, Inc., </em>100 Md.App. 222, 640 A.2d 743 (1994), Judge Wilner, then Chief Judge of the Court of Special Appeals, explained that the holdings of <em>Higgins </em>and <em>Edwards </em>require the following procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">[Wjhere issues presented in an action at law are triable before a jury, those issues must be presented to a jury notwithstanding that they are also raised in an additional or alternative equitable action, and that, in ruling upon the equitable claim, the court is bound by the jury\u2019s determination of the common issues. Quoting from <em>Gutzwiller v. Fenik, </em>860 F.2d 1317, 1333 (6th Cir.1988), the <em>[Edwards </em>] Court noted the Federal rule that, where equitable claims are to be resolved by the court and legal claims are to be resolved by the jury, the judge is \u201c \u2018without power\u2019 to reach a conclusion inconsistent with that of the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 229, 640 A.2d at 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The procedure required by <em>Higgins </em>and <em>Edwards </em>is fully applicable to the case at bar, in which (1) Respondent requested that the jury award him treble damages, and (2) the jury\u2019s special verdict included a \u201cno\u201d answer to the question of whether Petitioner\u2019s withholding of Respondent\u2019s wages was not as a result of a bona fide dispute. Under these circumstances, because the jury answered \u201cno\u201d to question 5, the Circuit Court was bound by that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>In concluding that the Circuit Court was not bound by the jury\u2019s answer to question 5, the Court of Special Appeals noted that in <em>Admiral Mortgage, Inc. v. Cooper, </em>357 Md. 533, 745 A.2d 1026 (2000), this Court stated that in a Wage Payment Act case, \u201calthough the discretionary additional damages is for the trier of fact to determine, the determination of attorney\u2019s fees, and costs, is for the judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553, 745 A.2d at 1036. In that case, because the jury had decided that the employee was entitled to enhanced damages, the Circuit Court had the power to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs. That case, however, does not hold that the Circuit Court has the power to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs even if the jury had found in the employer\u2019s favor on the issue of whether the decision to withhold wages was or was not because of a bona fide dispute. On remand, the Circuit Court had the power to grant the employee\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees and costs, as well as the power to deny that claim for other reasons, but the Circuit Court was not empowered to deny that claim on the ground that the wages had been withheld \u201cas a result of a bona fide dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">In the case at bar, the Court of Special Appeals also concluded that, in <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>403 Md. 443, 942 A.2d 1242 (2008) <em>(Friolo III)</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this Court \u201ccleared up\u201d the issue of whether the Circuit Court is bound by the jury\u2019s decision, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">The issue of enhanced damages pursuant to \u00a7 3-507.1(b) had been submitted to the jury in <em>Friolo v. Frankel. </em>The jury did not find that the employer\u2019s withholding of the employee\u2019s wages was \u201cnot the result of a bona fide dispute.\u201d Accordingly, it did not award enhanced damages to the employee. By the appellant\u2019s reckoning, that circumstance would absolutely foreclose any possibility of an attorney\u2019s fee being awarded to the employee for the violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>the Wage Payment Law. The necessary trigger, such argument ran, had never been pulled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\">The Court of Appeals in <em>FHolo III, </em>however, nonetheless remanded the case to the tidal court for its independent determination of whether an award of attorney\u2019s fees to the employee should be made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">180 Md.App. at 527-28, 951 A.2d at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">To determine what factual findings the <em>Friolo </em>jury did\u2014and did not\u2014make, it is necessary to examine the \u201cspecial verdict\u201d sheet in the record of that case. We take judicial notice that the SPECIAL VERDICT FORM in the <em>Friolo </em>record contains the following questions and answers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">1. Do you find that Defendants have failed to pay Plaintiff Joy Friolo all bonus monies that they were obligated to pay her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">If you answered \u201cyes\u201d, please go on to #2. If you answered \u201cno\u201d, please go on to # 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-11\">2. If your answer to # 1 above is \u201cyes\u201d, how much in bonus monies to you find that Defendants owe Plaintiff Friolo? $6841</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-12\">3. If you awarded a sum to Plaintiff Friolo under #2 above, how much in additional damages, if any (up to three times the amount set forth in # 2), do you award to Plaintiff Friolo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-13\">$_0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-14\">4. Do you find that Defendants have failed to pay Plaintiff Joy Friolo all overtime pay that they were obligated to pay her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-15\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-17\">If you answered \u201cyes\u201d, please go on to # 5. If you answered \u201cno\u201d, please go on to # 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-18\">5. If your answer to # 4 above is \u201cyes\u201d, how much in overtime pay do you find that Defendants owe Plaintiff Friolo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>$ 4937.55</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\">6. If you awarded a sum to Plaintiff Friolo under # 5 above, how much in additional damages, if any (up to three times the amount set forth in # 5), do you award to Plaintiff Friolo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">$_0</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Although the <em>Friolo </em>jury did not award any additional damages, that jury was not asked to answer the precise question that was answered by the jury in the case at bar: Were the wages owed to the employee withheld in violation of the law rather than as a result of a bona fide dispute between the parties? Because (1) a jury may not award enhanced damages unless it finds that the employee\u2019s wages were not withheld as a result of a bona fide dispute, but (2) a jury may decide not to award enhanced damages even though it is persuaded that the wages were not withheld as a result of a bona fide dispute, the remand in <em>Friolo </em>did not violate the procedure required by <em>Higgins </em>and <em>Edwards.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">In <em>Edwards, supra, </em>this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">Situations such as the one at bar were contemplated by [Md. Rule 2-522(c) ]. \u201c[A] special verdict may be required if the court is to make factual findings on equitable claims following the entry of a verdict.\u201d <em>Maryland Rules Commentary </em>at 311. Niemeyer and Richards explain,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">\u201cAny issues not submitted to the jury by way of a special question are decided by the court following the entry of a verdict. The failure to counsel to request a question on a particular issue or to object to the failure to include a question on a particular issue constitutes a waiver of the right to trial by jury on that issue. It is therefore critical to review all questions to ensure that all facts and issues to be submitted to the jury have been covered by the questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 312. Thus, it is counsel\u2019s responsibility to assure that all critical issues are submitted to the jury. The judge may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>fill in the gaps when necessary to resolve issues remaining after entry of a special verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 549, 588 A.2d at 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Unlike <em>Admiral Mortgage </em>Inc.\u2014in which the jury decided that the employee was entitled to enhanced damages, and unlike Friolo\u2014in which the jury was not asked the precise question of whether the wages owed to the employee had been withheld in violation of the law rather than as a result of a bona fide dispute between the parties, there were no \u201cgaps\u201d to be \u201cfilled in\u201d by the Circuit Court in the case at bar. Because the jury answered \u201cno\u201d to the precise question of whether the wages owed to Respondent had been withheld in violation of the law rather than as a result of a bona fide dispute between the parties, the Circuit Court was without power to award counsel fees and costs under LE \u00a7 3-507.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Although there is no merit in the argument that the jury\u2019s verdict was \u201cfatally flawed,\u201d Respondent is not entitled to an award of damages under both counts. We therefore direct that judgment be entered in favor of Respondent on Count II only.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT, AND TO REMAND TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY FOR ENTRY OF JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF RESPONDENT ON COUNT II, AND ENTRY OF JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF PETITIONER ON RESPONDENT\u2019S CLAIM FOR ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES AND LITIGATION COSTS; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN PETITIONER AND RESPONDENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-12\">. Maryland Rule 2-522, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-13\">(e) Verdict containing written findings. The court may require a jury to return a verdict in the form of written findings upon specific issues. For that purpose, the court may use any method of submitting the issues and requiring written findings as it deems appropriate, including the submission of written questions susceptible of brief answers or of written forms of the several special findings that might properly be made under the pleadings and evidence. The court shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>inslruct the jury as may be necessary to enable it to make its findings upon each issue. If the court fails to submit any issue raised by the pleadings or by the evidence, all parties waive their right to a trial by jury of the issues omitted unless before the jury retires a party demands its submission to the jury. As to an issue omitted without such demand, the court may make a finding or, if it fails to do so, the finding shall be deemed to have been made in accordance with the judgment entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-11\">No party may assign as error the submission of issues to the jury, the instructions of the court, or the refusal of the court to submit a requested issue unless the party objects on the record before the juiy retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection. Upon request of any party, the court shall receive objections out of the hearing of the jury.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b591-6\">.
