Vol.), \u00a7 8-201 of the Criminal Procedure Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant, Joseph Earnest Simms, was convicted in 1998 of two counts of first degree murder. In 2008, he filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for DNA testing of certain evidence that the State collected during its investigation of the crimes, and he requested a hearing on the petition. The Circuit Court subsequently issued an order denying the petition, without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Appellant, now represented by the Public Defender\u2019s Office, noted an appeal to this Court, seeking reversal of the Circuit Court\u2019s order and a remand to that court for a hearing on the petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we hold that the court erred in summarily denying the petition. We therefore vacate the order of the Circuit Court and remand the matter to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">On April 6, 1998, a jury sitting in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City convicted Appellant of the first degree premeditated murder of Peter Wendell Williams and Belinda M. Baylor. For those convictions, Appellant is presently serving two consecutive terms of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">Appellant noted a timely appeal. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgments in an unreported opinion, <em>Simms v. State, </em>126 Md.App. 721 (1999). Appellant later filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>a postconviction petition, which the Circuit Court denied on June 26, 2001. The Court of Special Appeals denied Appellant\u2019s application for leave to appeal the denial of postconviction relief. Appellant then filed a motion to reopen the postconviction proceeding. That motion, too, was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">On January 7, 2008, Appellant, representing himself, filed a \u201cMotion for New Trial and Release of Evidence for DNA Testing,\u201d with a supporting memorandum and attachment (collectively, \u201cthe petition\u201d). The petition invokes \u00a7 8-201 and seeks DNA testing of certain material collected by the police during the murder investigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The petition contains a certificate of service indicating that Appellant mailed a copy of the petition to the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City. The State did not file a response to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Appellant alleges in the petition that he has \u201cmaintained from the time of his arrest in this case that he had no involvement in the murders of the decease (sic) and his defense at trial consisted of a complete denial of criminal agencies.\u201d He further alleges that the State\u2019s case at trial \u201cconsisted entirely [of] circumstantial evidence regarding his relationship [of] discord with Belinda M. Baynor and the selective DNA testing of clothing the assailant allegedly wor[e] when the murders were committed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Appellant also alleges in the petition that the police collected \u201cmassive amounts\u201d of evidence from the crime scene and additional evidence from a trash bag the police found outside a house located several doors away from where Appellant was staying at the time. The trash bag contained bloody clothes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Appellant alleges that the police selected items for DNA testing from those two sources of evidence, choosing \u201ca cutting from a jacket, shoes, belt, socks, towel, sanitary napkins\u201d; the police also took blood samples from him and the murder victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Appellant alleges that the items selected were first tested using a restriction fragment length polymorphism (\u201cRFLP\u201d) test but, because the results were \u201cinconclusive,\u201d the items were sent for polymerase chain reaction (\u201cPCR\u201d) testing. Appellant alleges that the results of the PCR test \u201cconcluded\u201d that neither he nor Peter Williams, one of the two murder victims, was \u201ca possible source of the DNA from the jacket cutting, shoes, pants and belt\u201d; however, Belinda Baynor, the other murder victim, \u201ccould not be excluded as the source.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Appellant argues that \u201cSTR [Short Tandem Repeats] DNA testing of the physical evidence in this case has the potential to detect the presence of other DNA on the items tested and those not tested from the crime scene.\u201d He further argues: \u201cIn addition this type of DNA testing is far more sensitive and discriminating than the RFLP and PCR testing that was preformed (sic) on the selected tested items.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Noting that he has a degenerative skin disease on both of his legs, and supporting that information with a medical report, Appellant alleges: \u201cThe socks and other items tested would have shown skin cells, or other fabers(sic) associated with the Defendant if the items tested were from the Defendant.\u201d Moreover, \u201cSTR DNA testing of the materials collected] at the crime scene would support Defendant\u2019s contention of innocence and that someone other than the defendant murdered the decease[d].\u201d The petition includes a request for a hearing on the motion, the appointment of counsel,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>court order requiring the Baltimore City Police Department to release the evidence to be tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The Circuit Court did not hold a hearing on the petition nor, insofar as we can discern from the record, did the court require the State to answer it. On February 20, 2008, the court issued an order summarily denying the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">On March 11, 2008, Appellant, at that time still representing himself, noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. On October 2, 2008, the Court of Special Appeals issued an order transferring the notice of appeal to this Court. <em>See </em>\u00a7 8-201(j)(6); Md. Rule 8-132.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Appellant, now represented by the Office of the Public Defender, poses a single question for review: \u201cDid the trial court err in denying the motion for release of evidence for DNA testing without a hearing, without making any factual findings, and without any stated reason?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">Section 8-201 entitles persons convicted of certain serious crimes to pursue DNA testing of physical evidence that is in the possession of the State and might produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence relevant to a claim of wrongful conviction or sentencing. <em>Arey v. State, </em>400 Md. 491, 507, 929 A.2d 501, 510 (2007) (identifying the purpose under-girding the General Assembly\u2019s enactment of \u00a7 8-201); <em>see also Thompson v. State, </em>395 Md. 240, 252, 909 A.2d 1035, 1042 (2006) (stating that \u201cthe primary purposes behind the enactment of \u00a7 8-201\u201d is \u201cto facilitate the establishment of claims of actual innocence for serious crimes\u201d). The statute has undergone a number of amendments since its enactment in 2001, and because we have discussed its legislative history on sever<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>al occasions, we do not repeat that discussion here. <em>See Gregg v. State, </em>409 Md. 698, 708-12, 976 A.2d 999, 1004-07 (2009); <em>Blake v. State, </em>395 Md. 213, 218-26, 909 A.2d 1020, 1023-27 (2006); <em>Thompson, </em>395 Md. at 252-53, 909 A.2d at 1042-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Several subsections of \u00a7 8-201 are pertinent to the issues raised in this appeal. Section 8-201 (b) provides that a petitioner who meets the threshold requirements of conviction of a qualifying crime, <em>see supra </em>note 3, \u201cmay file a petition for DNA testing of scientific identification evidence that the State possesses as provided in subsection (i) of this section and that is related to the judgment of conviction[.]\u201d \u201cScientific identification evidence\u201d is defined in \u00a7 8-201 (a)(5) as evidence that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-6\">(i) is related to an investigation or prosecution that resulted in a judgment of conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-7\">(ii) is in the actual or constructive possession of a law enforcement agency or agent of a law enforcement agency; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-8\">(iii) contains biological evidence from which DNA may be recovered that may produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence relevant to a claim of a convicted person of wrongful conviction or sentencing if subject to DNA testing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">Section 8-201(a)(2), in turn, defines \u201cbiological evidence\u201d as evidence that \u201cincludes, but is not limited to, any blood, hair, saliva, semen, epithelial cells, buccal cells, or other bodily substances from which genetic marker groupings may be obtained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">Section (c) of \u00a7 8-201, upon which the parties focus much of their attention in this appeal, reads:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7u\">Subject to subsection (d)[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] of this section, a court shall order DNA testing if the court finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>(1) a reasonable probability exists that the DNA testing has the scientific potential to produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence relevant to a claim of wrongful conviction or sentencing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-4\">(2) the requested DNA test employs a method of testing generally accepted within the relevant scientific community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Appellant challenges the court\u2019s summary denial of the petition. Evidently referring to <em>Blake, supra, </em>he points out that the court ruled \u201cwithout a hearing, without factual findings, and without any stated reason or reasons why it was denied.\u201d <em>See Blake, </em>395 Md. at 227, 909 A.2d at 1028 (observing that \u201c[t]he court should make some findings of fact and should set forth the underlying reasons when it dismisses a petition for testing\u201d). Appellant assumes, reasonably so, that the court denied the petition on the grounds that it failed to meet the requirements of \u00a7 8-201 (c), and he argues that the petition in fact satisfies both requirements of that subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">With regard to the requirement of \u00a7 8-201(c)(l), Appellant argues that the petition alleges sufficient facts to show that \u201ca reasonable probability exists that the DNA testing has the scientific potential to produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence relevant to a claim of wrongful conviction or sentencing.\u201d He highlights three factual allegations in the petition: first, the subsequent PCR testing excluded him and one of the two murder victims (but not the other victim), as the source of the blood on the clothing; second, the State\u2019s theory at trial was that the bloody clothing was worn by the assailant at the time of the murders; and, third, the State connected him to the crime through \u201ccircumstantial evidence\u201d regarding his relationship with [the female murder victim, Ms. Baynor], With regard to the requirement of \u00a7 8\u2014201(c)(2), Appellant argues that the requested STR testing \u201ci[s] more sensitive and discriminating than the RFLP and the PCR testing that was performed in 1998\u201d and, therefore, the STR testing would have the potential to \u201cdetect the presence of other DNA on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>the items tested and those not tested from the crime scene.\u201d Appellant emphasizes that the State did not respond to the petition and therefore his assertions are \u201cuncontradicted.\u201d He argues that he was entitled, at the least, to the hearing he requested before the court ruled on the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The State responds that the Circuit Court was correct to deny the petition without a hearing. The State argues: \u201c[T]he statute does not give a right to a hearing, and where\u2014 as here\u2014the petition fails to even make a prima facie case for relief, no hearing is necessary.\u201d The State adds that, even had a hearing been scheduled, the petition lacked the necessary factual specificity to permit the State to respond in opposition. The State contends that a petition must include sufficient facts to \u201cenable the court and the State to determine what biological evidence is sought, what test the petitioner wishes to have performed, what would constitute a \u2018favorable\u2019 outcome of the test, and why this outcome would give rise to a substantial probability of a different verdict in his case.\u201d Applying those criteria, the State argues that the petition is lacking in almost every area.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The State asserts, in particular, that the petition fails both to \u201coffer some specificity as to what items the petitioner wishes to test\u201d and to identify the \u201cbiological evidence\u201d he wishes to test; Appellant\u2019s request is outside the purview of the DNA statute. Then, assuming the premise that the petition must allege how the DNA testing will lead to a \u201cfavorable result\u201d by creating a \u201creasonable probability of a different outcome at Appellant\u2019s trial,\u201d the State argues that the petition fails to make such a showing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">Section \u00a7 8-201(c) states that the Court \u201cshall order DNA testing,\u201d if the court finds that the petition satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 8\u2014201(c)(1) and (2). A court therefore has no discretion to deny the petition summarily, if the petition makes out a <em>prima facie </em>case of entitlement to the testing sought. <em>See Gregg, </em>409 Md. at 721, 976 A.2d at 1012. Therefore, we must decide whether the court in the present case acted properly when it denied the petition, by determining, whether the petition makes out a <em>prima facie </em>case of Appellant\u2019s entitlement to the testing he seeks. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">We begin by recognizing that we are dealing here with a petition filed by an unrepresented inmate. It is the practice of the federal courts to construe liberally court filings that are prepared by <em>pro se </em>prisoners. <em>See Hughes v. Rowe, </em>449 U.S. 5, 10 n. 7, 101 S.Ct. 173, 176 n. 7, 66 L.Ed.2d 163, 170 n. 7 (1980) (stating, in a case involving an unrepresented inmate, that civil complaints prepared by pro <em>se </em>litigants are held to \u201c \u2018less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 292, 50 L.Ed.2d 251, 261 (1976)) (per curiam); <em>accord Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081, 1086 (2007) (stating, in a case involving an unrepresented inmate, that \u201c[a] document filed <em>pro se </em>is \u2018to be liberally construed,\u2019 [ ] and \u2018a <em>pro se </em>complaint, however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Estelle, </em>429 U.S. at 106, 97 S.Ct. at 292, 50 L.Ed.2d at 261).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>appropriate to give Appellant the benefit of a liberal construction of the petition, particularly in light of the salutary purpose of the postconviction DNA statute, the dearth of case law until today\u2019s filing of <em>Gregg, supra, </em>concerning what a petition must contain in order to satisfy the strictures of \u00a7 8-201(e), and the lack, so far, of rules of procedure to guide the process. <em>See Arey, </em>400 Md. at 506, 506 n. 11, 929 A.2d at 510, 510 n. 11 (commenting about the lack of rules of procedure relating to \u00a7 8-201 petitions).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">We conclude that, given a liberal construction, the petition easily meets the pleading requirements of \u00a7 8-201 (c) so as to survive summary denial. Preliminarily, Appellant alleges that he stood convicted of the first degree murder of Belinda Baynor and Peter Williams, thereby establishing his standing to file the petition, under \u00a7 8-201 (b). And, the petition shows that he mailed the petition to the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City, satisfying the requirement of \u00a7 8-201(d). Indeed, in neither regard does the State argue the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Further, the petition makes a <em>prima facie </em>case, under \u00a7 8-201(c)(1) and (2), for Appellant\u2019s entitlement to at least some of the DNA testing he seeks. We begin by rejecting the State\u2019s contention that the petition fails to allege with sufficient specificity the items Appellant wants tested and the biological evidence he seeks to have subjected to DNA testing. As we shall see, the allegations in the petition make sufficiently plain that Appellant seeks, at the least, to have the items found in the trash bag\u2014the jacket, shoes, pants, belt and socks\u2014retested using the STR method.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The petition also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>plainly alleges that there are \u201cskin cells\u201d (hereafter, \u201cepithelial cells\u201d) to be found on the items that Appellant seeks to have tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">Moreover, the petition alleges sufficient facts to demonstrate, pursuant to \u00a7 8-201(c)(l), that a reasonable probability exists that STR DNA testing of the epithelial cells on the clothing has the scientific potential to produce exculpatory or mitigating evidence relevant to Appellant\u2019s claim of wrongful conviction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Specifically, the petition alleges that the police collected bloody clothing from a bag that was found near a house where Appellant was staying at the time of the murders. The petition also alleges that the State\u2019s theory at trial was that the assailant had been wearing the bloody clothing when the murders were committed. And, the petition alleges that, if the socks and other items of bloody clothing found in the bag had been worn by him, then the more sophisticated STR DNA testing of the epithelial cells would disclose that fact. In short, Appellant alleges, albeit somewhat inartfully, that testing of the epithelial cells will establish that someone else, not he, was wearing the clothing at the time of the murders and therefore is the killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The petition also satisfies the requirement of \u00a7 8-201(c)(2) that the method of DNA testing Appellant wants performed is \u201cgenerally accepted within the relevant scientific community.\u201d The petition specifically alleges that the biological evidence will be subjected to STR DNA testing. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>testing is generally accepted in the relevant scientific community,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the State does not contend otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">In sum, we hold that Appellant presents in the <em>pro se </em>petition a <em>prima facie </em>case for STR DNA testing of the clothing found in the trash bag. The Circuit Court erred in summarily denying the petition, and we vacate the order denying it, accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">That Appellant\u2019s petition has survived the preliminary test of <em>prima facie </em>sufficiency does not mean, however, that the court, at this early juncture in the proceedings, should grant him the relief sought in the petition. We noted at the outset of this opinion that the State has not answered the petition. We shall remand the case to the Circuit Court with the direction that it order the State to answer the petition, presenting any arguments why the court should not grant it. Appellant, who the Public Defender has agreed to represent if this case is remanded for further proceedings, may respond to the State\u2019s answer. Should any disputes arise from the parties\u2019 submissions that are material to the disposition of the petition, then the court must hold a hearing to resolve the disputes and make any necessary findings of fact, before ruling on the petition. <em>See Arey, </em>400 Md. at 507, 929 A.2d at 510; <em>Blake, </em>395 Md. at 227 n. 11, 909 A.2d at 1028 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>THIS OPINION.

The State supports that argument, in part, with references to the trial transcript. Because the transcript is not in the record before us, the State requests that we take judicial notice of it. An appellate court's decision to take judicial notice of certain adjudicative facts is discretionary. <em>See Dashiell v. Meeks, </em>396 Md. 149, 176, 913 A.2d 10, 25 (2006) (holding that, pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-201(c), \"there is no mandatory requirement for this Court or the Court of Special Appeals to take judicial notice of any such adjudicative fact, but both courts, if they choose to do so, <em>may </em>take judicial notice of adjudicative facts.\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>(emphasis in original).

State, </em>341 Md. 175, 195, 670 A.2d 398, 408 (1995) (noting that \"we have long held that a defendant in a criminal case who chooses to represent himself is subject to the same rules regarding reviewability and waiver of questions not raised at trial as one who is represented by counsel\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1027, 117 S.Ct. 581, 136 L.Ed.2d 512 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\">. We agree with the State that the petition does not allege with sufficient specificity what items among the \"massive\u201d evidence collected at the crime scene (as opposed to the items in the trash bag) he seeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>to have tested. Appellant has the right, on remand, to ask for leave to amend the petition to include sufficiently specific allegations concerning what he wishes to have tested for DNA and why such testing would satisfy the requirements of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b763-7\">. The State is incorrect in asserting that a person requesting DNA testing must prove, at the petition stage of the proceedings, that the testing will produce a \u201cfavorable result\u201d by creating a \"reasonable probability of a different outcome at Appellant\u2019s trial.\u201d This is not the standard by which eligibility for DNA testing is measured under the statule. <em>See </em>\u00a7 8-201(c)(1); <em>Gregg, </em>409 Md. at 720, 976 A.2d at 1011-12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b764-7\">.
