Since her birth, her maternal aunt, Catherlina Queen, raised her. At some time early in Lanay\u2019s life, she and her aunt moved into a property on Reisterstown Road in Baltimore City (\u201cthe Subject Property\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> where they resided until 1994. While Lanay and Ms. Queen lived there, the Subject Property was owned by the Daniel Realty Company and allegedly managed by, among others, Daniel and Wendy Perlberg (collectively \u201cRespondents\u201d). In October 1995, Daniel Realty sold the Subject Property; thereafter, no Respondent retained an interest in it. They had no knowledge of what, if any, repairs were performed on the Subject Property after 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">At some point after Lanay and Ms. Queen moved out of the Subject Property, Ms. Queen became suspicious that Lanay may have been exposed to lead by ingesting peeling and flaking lead-based paint while residing at the Subject Property. Accordingly, she sought the advice of counsel. In 1999, counsel for Lanay and Ms. Queen hired ARC Environmental (\u201cARC\u201d), an environmental consulting firm, to test the rooms and structures of the Subject Property for the presence of lead in paint. ARC\u2019s tests revealed the presence of lead-based paint. Three years later, when Lanay was 11 years old, Ms. Queen, as her next friend, sued Respondents, alleging that Lanay was exposed to peeling and flaking lead-based paint at the Subject Property which caused her to suffer permanent brain damage. Ms. Queen, in her own right, also sued Respondents, seeking damages as a result of medical expenses that she incurred caring for Lanay, as well as for severe emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Counsel for Lanay and Ms. Queen conducted a <em>de bene esse </em>deposition of ARC\u2019S President, Shannon Cavaliere, an environmental expert. He identified the report that ARC prepared in May 1999 as the result of its testing the Subject Property (\u201cthe Un-Redacted ARC Report\u201d). The Un-Redacted ARC Report included a \u201cLead-Based Paint Testing Data Sheet\u201d summarizing the findings of the technicians who conducted the testing. The data sheet included descriptions of the tested rooms and structures, the levels of lead (if any) detected, and the condition of the paint at the tested locations. With the exception of two of the 38 locations tested at the Subject Property, the Un-Redacted ARC Report described the conditions of the paint as \u201cintact,\u201d meaning that none of the paint was chipping, peeling, flaking, or otherwise separating from the substrate. The two locations where the paint was not \u201cintact\u201d were described as \u201cfair,\u201d defined as meaning that 10% or less of the surface was cracked or worn.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Mr. Cavaliere explained that his technicians used an XRF<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> machine, capable of detecting lead below the top layer of paint, which led him to conclude that two-thirds of the tested locations in the Subject Property contained lead-based paint. On cross-examination, he conceded that an XRF machine does not ascertain whether the detected lead is in the outermost layer of paint, the lowest layer of paint, or anywhere specifically in between. Thus, a structure or surface painted at one time with lead-based paint, but subsequently painted over one or more times with unleaded paint, could yield a positive reading by an XRF machine. Mr. Cavaliere acknowledged that other testing devices (not used here) are capable of determining how close the detected lead is to the surface of a tested location.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The jury trial began on 19 June 2006 in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and concluded nine days later. Ms. Queen testified during the plaintiffs\u2019 case-in-chief that, when she and Lanay first moved into the Subject Property, the paint was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>good condition; however, five or six months later, the paint began peeling and chipping in several locations. On cross-examination, Respondents impeached Ms. Queen with her pretrial deposition testimony. In doing so, they inferentially undermined her memory of the Subject Property by pointing out inconsistencies regarding who lived at the Subject Property with her and Lanay when the alleged exposure occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Lanay and Ms. Queen did not offer the <em>de bene esse </em>deposition (or any part thereof) of Mr. Cavaliere in their casein-chief; instead, they called Dr. Jerome Paulson, an expert in childhood lead poisoning. Dr. Paulson is a pediatrician and a professor of environmental and occupational health at the School of Public Health of George Washington University. Based on the results of ARC\u2019S testing, he opined that Lanay was exposed to lead-based paint at the Subject Property. Referring to the May 1999 testing by ARC, he commented, \u201cwe have documentation from an inspection done of the home at that address that there was lead paint on the surface, on multiple surfaces at that address. Lead-based paint was found at over 20 sites at that address when the home was inspected in May of 1999.\u201d Counsel for Lanay and Ms. Queen then approached Dr. Paulson with a copy of the 1999 ARC report; however, in this copy, the description of the condition of the paint at the tested locations on the data sheet was redacted (\u201cthe Redacted Version\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel:] Dr. Paulson, I\u2019m showing you what has been marked as Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit Number 1 for identification. Can you tell me that\u2019s a fair and accurate yet redacted copy of the report that you relied upon to determine that there was lead paint at [the Subject Property]? [Defendants\u2019 counsel]: Objection. He said redacted copy? I don\u2019t want I don\u2019t want\u2014to speak out here but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>My problem is, your Honor, he gave his expert witness materials to rely upon, which he did and I\u2019m entitled to see that in its form that he received it. Not in a redacted form\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-4\">[Trial Judge]: All right. Wait. So what you are telling me is that you were\u2014Dr. Paulson has now seen the unredacted version of the exhibit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel]: That\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">[Trial Judge]: Why did you give him a redacted version?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHH\">[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel]: Because the portion that we redacted pertains to the condition of the property, the actual physical condition of the paint itself in 1999, five years\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">... [I]t pertains to the condition of the property, the paint. Whether the paint in 1999, was chipping, peeling, or flaking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap4\">[Trial Judge]: But why would you show him a document with some information omitted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel]: Because that\u2019s the point, your Honor, why it\u2019s redacted. The condition of the paint in 1999\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3u\">[Trial Judge]: You did not want him to consider that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxV\">[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel]: It has nothing to do with the condition of the paint in 1990 when Lanay was living there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">[Trial Judge]: Okay. And, so, your problem is[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-10\">[Defendants\u2019 counsel]: First of all, this witness has seen an un-Redacted copy\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-11\">[Trial Judge]: And when was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-12\">[Defendants\u2019 counsel]:\u2014that was in his file when he made his opinion in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-13\">[Trial Judge]: So during deposition he referred to an unredacted copy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-14\">[Defendants\u2019 counsel]: It was in his records, absolutely. So that\u2019s an incorrect statement. I\u2019m entitled to show the jury what he saw to rely on. Now, accurate. He saw the unredacted version\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>[Trial Judge]: Okay. I\u2019m going to let [Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel] hand [Dr. Paulson] a redacted copy. When you get him on cross you can show him an un-redacted copy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">[Defendants\u2019 counsel]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">[Trial Judge]: All right [Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel], you may proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel]: Now [Dr. Paulson], is Exhibit 1 the redacted version of the report that you used to determine that there was lead based paint at [the Subject Property]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGd\">[Dr. Paulson]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel]: What was the date of that report again, Dr. Paulson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">[Dr. Paulson]: May 26, 1999.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">[Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel]: Let me ask you this question. Can you explain to the members of the jury how you can use a test for lead in 1999 to determine whether Lanay was exposed back in 1990 to 1994?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-11\">[Dr. Paulson]: The lead-based paint that\u2019s placed on a wall or a floor, or a door jam does not deteriorate over time. So once it stays there unless it\u2019s physically removed it is, it\u2019s there. So that\u2019s one point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-12\">Also, since 1978 it has been illegal to use lead-based paint for painting interior surfaces in homes. So if one were to assume that there was no lead-based paint at [the Subject Property] at the time Lanay Brown lived there and that there is lead-based paint or there was lead-based paint on May 26, 1999, one would have to assume that the house, the interior of the house had been painted with lead-based paint between the time she moved out and the time that this test was done. Given the age of the home it is very likely that the home was painted with lead-based paint when it was built after it was built and that that\u2019s the origin of lead-based paint. It would make no sense that between 1994 when the family moved out of that address in 1999 someone would have gone in and something illegal, that is paint, use lead-based paint in a house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Dr. Paulson concluded that, in his expert opinion, this exposure caused Lanay to suffer lead poisoning. Following the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case-in-chief, the trial judge granted Respondents\u2019 unopposed motion for judgment as to Ms. Queen\u2019s individual claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In their defense, Respondents adduced evidence that, before moving to the Subject Property, Lanay lived at another house in Baltimore City, insinuating that, if she wa$ poisoned by lead, her exposure may not have occurred at the Subject Property. Additionally, Daniel Perlberg, who managed the Subject Property until 1995, testified that he painted and wallpapered the Subject Property before Ms. Queen and La-nay moved in and continued performing repairs and painting while Ms. Queen and Lanay lived there. Respondents also introduced evidence that Ms. Queen\u2019s parents (Lanay\u2019s grandparents), who signed the lease for the Subject Property, inspected the property and did not find any defects. Furthermore, Respondents introduced a 1992 inspection report of the Subject Property prepared by the Baltimore City Health Department\u2019s Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program. The report form allowed for the inspector to circle \u201cloose paint/plaster\u201d as one of the potential \u201cHazardous items around the home\u201d; however, the inspector who filled-out the form for the Subject Property did not circle it. Moreover, the inspector\u2019s notes attached to the report revealed that Ms. Queen stated, at the time, that Lanay was poisoned at a previous address.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Respondents also attacked Ms. Queen\u2019s credibility during the defense\u2019s case by reading into evidence excerpts from her deposition. Unfortunately, there were technical difficulties with the Circuit Court\u2019s recording system, resulting in a gap in the transcript of that stage of the trial. The parties stipulate on appeal that counsel for Respondents read portions of Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition and that Lanay objected, but her objection was overruled; however, the parties do not recall specifically what was actually read, nor the specific grounds, if any, argued by Lanay in her objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Counsel for Respondents also read Mr. Cavaliere\u2019s <em>de bene esse </em>deposition and offered into evidence the Un-Redacted ARC Report, which Mr. Cavaliere had identified; however, again, there is a gap in the transcribed record because of technical difficulties with the Circuit Court\u2019s recording system. The parties stipulate that Lanay objected when Respondents introduced the Un-Redacted ARC Report into evidence, but her objection was overruled. They also stipulate that Lanay argued that the Un-Redacted ARC Report was irrelevant because it described conditions of paint as they existed in 1999, while Respondents argued that the Un-Redacted ARC Report was admissible because Lanay\u2019s experts relied on it in forming their opinions. Neither party now claims that the trial court admitted the un-redacted report for any purpose other than that asserted by Respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">In his closing argument, Lanay\u2019s counsel attacked head-on the manner in which he anticipated that Respondents would use the Un-Redacted ARC Report. To that end, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACUT\">Now, I want to talk to you about an exhibit that came into evidence.... And that\u2019s the report from Mr. Cavaliere. I have a feeling, can\u2019t guarantee it, but I have a feeling that [Respondents\u2019 counsel] is going to stand up in ... closing argument and say, \u201cLook at the report from ARC Environmental. Yes, it has lead there, but look all the surfaces are [intact].\u201d That\u2019s what I think [Respondents\u2019 counsel] is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>going to say. And then he\u2019s going to say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s [intact]. If it\u2019s [intact] it wasn\u2019t flaking. IIow is the landlord negligent and how is the landlord exposed?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">But I want you to remember this ladies and gentlemen because it is, for lack of a better word, a bogus argument and here is why. If you look at the first page of [the Un-Kedacted ARC Report] the inspection was done on May 26, 1999. That\u2019s five years after Lanay moved out of the property. It\u2019s four years after Mr. Perlberg and Daniel Realty and Wendy Perlberg sold the property. Mr. Perl-berg and Ms. Perlberg had never once stepped in to the property. Never inspected the property. Never saw the property. They have no idea what .. . the new owner did to that property in terms of renovation and painting after they sold it in that four[-year] period from the time they sold it until the time it was tested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">Yes, this document shows lead in the property. As a matter of fact, if you can remember [Respondents\u2019 counsel\u2019s] opening statement, he admitted to you all that there was lead at [the Subject Property], I don\u2019t think that fact is disputed. But don\u2019t let ... the defendants pull the wool over your eyes. The condition of the property in 1999 has nothing to do with the condition of the property between 1990 and 1994 when Lanay was living there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Counsel for Respondents answered, making use of the UnRedacted ARC Report (as anticipated) as well as Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition in his closing statement. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">Ms. Queen testified there was chipping and peeling paint at the property, no doubt about it. But I ask you to think about when I read portions of her deposition she didn\u2019t remember if [her] father and mother lived there. In fact, she said in her deposition they didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t remember the whole new wallpaper when I asked her. This was 17 years ago. But what did she say at the time when the Baltimore City Health Department was at the door in the home? She said, \u201cNo paint plasterL,] it wasn\u2019t noted.\u201d And she says, \u201cThe poisoning!,] the exposure occurred somewhere else.\u201d That\u2019s what she said at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>There\u2019s no dispute here that at homes all through Baltimore City lead is at the bottom of the paint. No dispute about that. You\u2019ve heard that from every witness, I told you that at opening. Every home ..., where ever we are in this city there is a likelihood that there\u2019s lead in that home. No one contests that. And [Mr. Cavaliere] used a machine where he knew he would ... find lead. And he told you that. He said, \u201cThere are machines I could have used which would tell you where it was in the paint, was it up near the surface.\u201d And he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do that. We don\u2019t use those machines in my (inaudible).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\">But he said, \u201cI could have.\u201d He admits I could have taken samples from the area and said, \u201cI[s] this chip at the top [of] the paint[,] is that lead based paint?\u201d And he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do that either.\u201d I don\u2019t dispute his results. He found lead in the home. What I dispute is, is that lead a hazard? If it\u2019s several layers down we know it\u2019s not a hazard, because every home or the tremendous majority of the homes in the city have that surface paint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">This is the most important part. Here\u2019s the third inspection.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> [Lanay\u2019s counsel] wants an inspection. We have three. His own people come to the [Subject Property], being hired by him, and they found the condition of the paint to be intact. Again, does it absolutely prove what condition the paint was in 1992? No. In and of itself it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s a piece of evidence that you look at with these other pieces. But every piece of evidence we have shows this property to have intact paint. This is from an individual who again was looking at it from their point of view. He was the home town announcer on behalf of the plaintiff and they found it to be intact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Now paint typically doesn\u2019t get better as it ages and you can assess that when you\u2019re making the decision as well. Thirty-six of 38 areas were intact. And I\u2019m going to show you the science results. Here\u2019s the third inspection. Look at the results, intact. The one condition here fair, and it\u2019s going to be tough to read, was the handrail and it was fair. Look over here, though. It\u2019s negative for lead. There was no lead in that area. That\u2019s a negative result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">Look at the walls, because we wallpapered these walls. Now the walls all tested negative. What they did is find wooded areas in the home that are going to test positive for lead. And told you any wooded surfaces in the home [are] going probably [to] test positive for lead. And so what he did is he tested the door casings, the windows, and he found positive results. Doesn\u2019t surprise anyone. What he didn\u2019t find is any chipping or peeling paint. And what he didn\u2019t find was any (inaudible) Lanay at that address. And he told you that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">Look at the next page of the report. Again, intact paint with one fair condition. Now ladies and gentlemen, this property was in good shape. This property was painted, maintained, papered; it looked good. Every piece of objective evidence shows us that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">After closing arguments, the trial judge submitted the case to the jury. The first issue for the jury to resolve, according to the verdict sheet, was whether there was chipping, peeling, or flaking at the Subject Property while Lanay lived there. The jury found in the negative and, accordingly, made no other findings of fact.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Circuit Court entered judgment for Respondents in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict. Lanay moved for a new trial, arguing that the court erred by allowing Respondents to use Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition against her and by allowing Respondents to introduce the Un-Redacted ARC Report. The Circuit Court denied the motion, and Lanay noted a timely appeal. The Court of Special Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>affirmed in a reported opinion. <em>Brown v. Daniel Realty Co., </em>180 Md.App. 102, 949 A.2d 6 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Specifically, the intermediate appellate court held that Respondents, in the defense\u2019s case-in-chief, were entitled to read excerpts from Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition pursuant to Rule 5-802.1,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which allows the use of a prior inconsistent statement, as substantive evidence, if the witness is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement. The court observed that, although she was no longer on the witness stand at the time, Ms. Queen was available to be re-called as a witness in rebuttal by Lanay following Respondents\u2019 counsel reading excerpts of the deposition. Thus, the court reasoned, Ms. Queen was subject to further cross-examination concerning her deposition testimony. To the extent that whatever Respondents\u2019 counsel read into the record was not inconsistent with Ms. Queen\u2019s trial testimony, the court concluded that Lanay was not prejudiced. Because it held the deposition excerpts admissible pursuant to its interpretation of Rule 5-802.1, the Court of Special Appeals expressly declined to resolve whether the fact that Ms. Queen\u2019s individual claims were no longer at issue rendered the deposition testimony otherwise inadmissible under Rule 2-419(a)(2)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or Rule 5-803(a),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which, respectively, permit the use for any purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>an adverse party\u2019s deposition and the prior statement of a party-opponent.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">With respect to the Un-Redacted ARC Report, the intermediate appellate court held that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in admitting it under Rule 5-708,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which permits the use of otherwise inadmissible evidence if relied on by an expert witness in her or his testimony. The court observed that Mr. Cavaliere and Dr. Paulson reviewed, and had opportunity to consider, the data in the Un-Redacted ARC Report in forming their respective opinions. Additionally, the court held that the un-redacted report was admissible as relevant evidence under Rule 5-401<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to the extent that it showed that the ARC testing could produce a positive reading for lead, even if the paint was intact, and that the existence of lead does not mean necessarily that the paint was peeling, chipping, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>flaking.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Lanay, Petitioner, filed with this Court a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, which we granted. <em>Brown v. Daniel Realty, </em>405 Md. 505, 954 A.2d 467 (2008). The petition essentially posed two questions: (1) Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that the Circuit Court properly allowed counsel for Respondents to read into evidence, during the defense\u2019s case-in-chief, excerpts from Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition testimony?<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>; and, (2) Whether the Court of Special Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>erred in holding that the Circuit Court properly allowed Respondents to introduce the Un-Redacted ARC Report? For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">It often is said that a trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is reviewed pursuant to the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard. <em>Matthews v. Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>368 Md. 71, 91, 792 A.2d 288, 300 (2002); <em>see also Figgins v. Cochrane, </em>403 Md. 392, 419, 942 A.2d 736, 752 (2008). Such rulings, it is maintained, are \u201cleft to the sound discretion of the trial court\u201d and will not be reversed on appeal \u201cabsent a showing of abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Matthews, </em>368 Md. at 91, 792 A.2d at 300 (quoting <em>Farley v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>355 Md. 34, 42, 733 A.2d 1014, 1018 (1999)). We have stated, however, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">Application of [the abuse of discretion] standard [ ] depends on whether the trial judge\u2019s ruling under review was based on a discretionary weighing of relevance in relation to other factors or on a pure conclusion of law.

Ms. Queen\u2019s Deposition.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Petitioner urges that the Circuit Court committed reversible error in permitting Respondents to read into the record excerpts from Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition testimony as substantive evidence in the defense\u2019s case. As noted earlier, there is a gap in the transcribed record of this case at a point pertinent to this issue. The parties, however, stipulate that Petitioner objected and that Respondents proffered that Ms. Queen was a party for purposes of Rule 2-419(a)(2), thus allowing them to use her deposition \u201cfor any purpose.\u201d The parties also stipulate that Petitioner argued that Ms. Queen ceased to be a party when her individual claims were disposed of in Respondents\u2019 favor at the close of her and Petitioner\u2019s case-in-chief, but that Petitioner\u2019s objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">Before considering the directives of Maryland Rule 2-419(a) (2), we reiterate that, when interpreting the Maryland Rules, we ordinarily employ the rules of statutory construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>tion. <em>Hurst v. State, </em>400 Md. 397, 417, 929 A.2d 157, 168 (2007). A cardinal principle in that regard states that if the language of a rule is clear and unambiguous, it will be applied thusly in a common-sense manner. <em>Id. </em>Maryland Rule 2-419 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">Deposition-Use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">(a) When may be used.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">(2) The deposition of a party or of anyone who at the time of taking the deposition was an officer, director, managing agent, or a person designated under Rule 2-412(d) to testify on behalf of a public or private corporation, partnership, association, or governmental agency which is a party may be used by an adverse party for any purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Petitioner maintains that Rule 2M19(a)(2) does not provide Respondents with an evidentiary basis for using Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition as substantive evidence in their defense case because, so she asserts, Ms. Queen ceased to be a \u201cparty,\u201d as required by the rule, when her individual claims were disposed of in Respondents\u2019 favor before the defense\u2019s case commenced. Respondents have two responses. Initially, they posit that determination of a deponent\u2019s status as a \u201cparty\u201d for purposes of Rule 2-419(a)(2) reckons back to the time that her or his deposition was taken, not the time of the deposition\u2019s use as evidence. Thus, according to them, because Ms. Queen was a party in her own right at the time of her deposition, they were entitled to use that deposition \u201cfor any purpose\u201d at trial. Alternatively, Respondents assert that, even when they offered Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition as evidence in their defense case, Ms. Queen was a \u201cparty\u201d due to her continuing status as Petitioner\u2019s next friend. We shall discuss each of Respondents\u2019 contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">This Court has not had an opportunity previously to consider whether Rule 2-419(a)(2) permits a litigant to use \u201cfor any purpose\u201d the deposition of a person who was a party in the same case at the time of the deposition, but ceased to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>a party by the time the deposition was offered into evidence<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>; however, the wording of the Rule, which we presume to be deliberate, directs our answer. Rule 2\u2014419(a)(2) covers two types of depositions: (1) those of natural persons who are parties, and (2) those of representatives of institutions that are parties. With respect to both, the Rule speaks in the present tense, allowing that either \u201cmay be used by an adverse party for any purpose.\u201d With respect to the depositions of representatives of institutions, however, the Rule explicitly recognizes that a deponent\u2019s capacity as a representative of the institutional party may change between the taking of the deposition and the trial, without affecting the right of the institution\u2019s opponent to use the deposition against the institution for any purpose. Rule 2-419(a)(2) makes no similar provision for allowing a litigant to use for any purpose the deposition of a former party (either as a natural person or as an institution testifying through a representative) whose status as a <em>party </em>changed between the deposition and the time that the litigant attempts to use the deposition at trial. Therefore, for an adverse party to use a party deponent\u2019s deposition -for any purpose under Rule 2-419(a)(2), the deponent (or the institution that the deponent represented) must be a party when the deposition is offered into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">In this regard, we agree with the reasoning of the Court of Appeals of Colorado, which interpreted that state\u2019s equivalent to Maryland Rule 2-419(a)(2) and, likewise, concluded that the time that a deposition (or a part thereof) is offered into evidence constitutes the relevant point for determining the status of the deponent (or the institution speaking through the deponent) for purposes of the rule\u2019s applicability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-6\">This conclusion is supported by the language of the rule. The rule, in essence, states that the deposition of a party who is a natural person, or a person who was at the time of the deposition testifying as an agent or representative of an entity <em>which is a party, </em>may be used by an adverse party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>lor any purpose. The rule speaks in the present tense as to both circumstances, but recognizes the status of a deponent as to an entity may change between the deposition and trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4N\"><em>Rojhani v.

Decisions of this Court generally recognize a distinction between infant litigants and their next friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">More than a century and a half ago, this Court, considering whether an infant that was a defendant in an action should be bound by his next friend\u2019s answer to a plaintiffs bill of complaint, iterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">Regularly an infant\u2019s answer by his guardian is not evidence against him, because he is not sworn, and it is only for the purpose of making proper parties. It is not in reality the answer of the infant, but of the guardian only who is sworn; and there is great danger to the interests of an infant, in permitting such an answer to be read against him, who from his tender years, may know nothing of the contents of the answer put in for him by his guardian, or not be able to judge of it, or of its effect. And the guardian <em>ad litem </em>is so appointed, as often to know nothing of the matter himself; and too much caution cannot well be observed, in guarding the rights of infants, not only against the improvident answers of honest guardians, but against the answers of such as may have sinister views; to say nothing of how far an infant may ordinarily be bound by a decree, upon an answer by his guardian, admitting the facts of the bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">The better and safer course, therefore, for all concerned, is in every case, in which an infant is a defendant, answering by his guardian, to put the plaintiff upon the proof of the material allegations in his bill, in the same manner, as if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>nothing had been admitted by the answer, unless otherwise expressly provided by law. It is the proper course, and that which prevails elsewhere.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><em>Kent\u2019s Adm\u2019rs v. Taneyhill, </em>6 G. &amp; J. 1, 3 (Md.1833).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Almost a century later, this Court pondered, in <em>Pindell v. Rubenslein, </em>whether a minor plaintiff was bound by the hearsay admissions of his next friend. 139 Md. 567, 575, 115 A. 859, 862 (1921). There, the minor plaintiff, through his mother as his next friend, sued the defendants alleging that their wooden gate fell on him while he walked past it on his way to the store, breaking one of his legs. At trial, the mother testified on direct examination that she sent the minor plaintiff to the store with her sister, the minor\u2019s aunt, and that she knew nothing of the accident until her sister brought the injured child home. <em>Id. </em>at 572, 115 A. at 861. The defendants sought to introduce evidence that the mother visited one of the defendants shortly after the accident and told that defendant that it was the minor\u2019s fault that he was hurt, and not the defendants\u2019 fault. The defendants proffered further that the mother said she did not see the accident, but learned from the minor\u2019s aunt, who was with the minor at the time of the accident, that he was climbing on the gate before it fell on him. <em>Id. </em>at 575, 115 A. at 862. In holding that the admission by the minor plaintiffs mother was not admissible, we opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_M\">[The minor plaintiffs mother] had positively disclaimed any knowledge of the accident or the instrumentality which caused it. Anything which she may have said therefore as to it was necessarily hearsay, irrelevant and collateral to any issue involved in this case. <em>She was in no sense a party to the cause within the meaning of the rule permitting evidence to be given of admissions against interest made by a party, and her admissions were not competent to affect the interest of the infant whom she represented.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-7\"><em>Id. </em>(italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">While this Court has not revisited recently the issue of whether a next friend is a \u201cparty,\u201d we have reaffirmed, in other contexts, the distinctions recognized between a next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>friend and an infant litigant. In <em>Berrain v. Katzen, </em>we held that it was an abuse of discretion for a trial court to enter a default judgment against minor plaintiffs as a sanction for the failure of the plaintiffs\u2019 next friend to comply with the reasonable discovery requests of the defendants. 331 Md. at 706, 629 A.2d at 715-16. There, the plaintiffs were three minor siblings who suffered permanent brain damage, allegedly from exposure to lead-based paint. <em>Id. </em>at 695, 629 A.2d at 707. Through their mother as their next friend, the children initiated an action against their landlord; however, the case was dismissed without prejudice, due to a lack of prosecution. <em>Id. </em>Two years later, the children, again through their mother as next friend, filed a new suit against the same landlord. <em>Id. </em>at 696, 629 A.2d at 707. The defendant landlord propounded interrogatories to the plaintiff children through their mother, and, after waiting more than seven months for a response, sought sanctions against the plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 629 A.2d at 707-08. Finding it to be the appropriate sanction under the circumstances, the trial court dismissed the plaintiff children\u2019s action with prejudice and denied their motion for reconsideration. <em>Id. </em>In reversing the trial court,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> we observed that \u201c[h]ad the plaintiffs ... been adults, the record and our decisions would clearly support ... the trial court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice\u201d; however, \u201cwhere neglect ... lies with the next friend, an officer of the court, not the minor plaintiffs,\u201d the harshest of discovery sanctions was not warranted. <em>Id. </em>at 710-11, 629 A.2d at 715-16. We suggested instead that the trial court should have replaced the next friend with someone willing to represent diligently the plaintiffs\u2019 interests or, if no such person was available, dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 action without prejudice so that they could pursue their claims upon reaching the age of majority. <em>Id. </em>at 711, 629 A.2d at 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">In <em>Fulton v. K &amp; M Assocs., </em>another lead paint case, we held that it was abuse of discretion for a trial court to decline to dismiss without prejudice the suit of a minor plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>where the next Mend, the minor plaintiffs mother, did not cooperate with counsel\u2019s endeavors to have the minor plaintiff examined by a medical expert. 331 Md. 712, 713-14, 629 A.2d 716, 717 (1993). There, counsel for the minor plaintiff informed the trial court, on the day of trial, that he was not prepared to proceed, citing the lack of cooperation on the part of the minor plaintiffs mother in taking the child for psychometric testing to determine whether his disabilities were consistent with lead poisoning. <em>Id. </em>at 714, 629 A.2d at 717. Counsel for the minor plaintiff accordingly moved for a voluntary dismissal in order to preserve the cause of action. The trial court denied the motion, and the minor plaintiff proceeded with his case without expert medical testimony. After the plaintiff\u2019s case-in-chief, the court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 714-15, 629 A.2d at 719. \u201cBased on the same reasoning which supported our decision in <em>Berrain,\u201d </em>we reversed the trial court\u2019s decision not to grant the motion for a dismissal without prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 717, 629 A.2d at 719.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We observed that the apparent negligence on the part of the next friend should have prompted the trial court to \u201cintervene[ ] on behalf of the minor plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718, 629 A.2d at 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"><em>Berrain </em>and <em>Fulton </em>are reconcilable with other cases in which we have declined to enforce rigidly the status of a next Mend as separate and distinct from that of the infant litigant whom the next friend represents. In <em>Alters v. Leitch, </em>we held that the testimony of a next Mend is subject to the same limitations under the \u201cdead man\u2019s statute\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> as would be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>testimony of a minor plaintiff 213 Md. 390, 392, 131 A.2d 458, 459 (1956). Accordingly, the next friend of a minor plaintiff, in a suit against the estate of a decedent, was not competent to testify concerning a transaction with the decedent. <em>Id.; see also Snyder v. Crabbs, </em>263 Md. 28, 30-31, 282 A.2d 6, 8 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">More recently, in <em>Aventis Pasteur, Inc. v. Skevofilax, </em>we held that it was not an abuse of discretion for a trial court to deny a motion by a minor plaintiff, through his parents as next friends, to dismiss his claims without prejudice in order to preserve his cause of action, where there was no evidence of fraud, conflict of interest, or neglect on the part of his next friends. 396 Md. at 435-36, 914 A.2d at 131. In <em>Skevofilax, </em>the minor plaintiff, through his next friends, designated a medical expert for the purpose of rendering an expert opinion as to whether the minor plaintiffs autism spectrum disorder was caused by a mercury preservative in the defendants\u2019 pediatric vaccines; however, after the trial court entered several revised scheduling orders due to the expert\u2019s inability to compile the data necessary for him to provide an opinion on causation, the expert finally declined to participate in the litigation, assertedly, because of other commitments. <em>Id. </em>at 413-14, 914 A.2d at 118-19. When it became clear that the sole causation expert designated by the plaintiff would not be available, counsel for the defendants moved for summary judgment. Counsel for the minor plaintiff moved for a dismissal without prejudice. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss without prejudice, citing \u201cthe significant time and money that had been expended in preparing pleadings and preliminary motions, and the conduct of extensive discovery,\u201d and awarded summary judgment to the defendants due to the lack of expert testimony on causation. <em>Id. </em>at 415, 914 A.2d at 119. The Court of Special Appeals reversed, relying on this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Berrain </em>and <em>Fulton; </em>however, we re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>versed the intermediate appellate court. <em>Id. </em>at 416, 914 A.2d at 120. We reasoned that \u201cabsent conflict of interest, fraud, or neglect by a parent, guardian, next friend, or the minor\u2019s attorney, a motion for voluntary dismissal made on behalf of a minor should not be analyzed differently than a motion for dismissal without prejudice filed by any plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436, 914 A.2d at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">From the foregoing cases, we glean that a child who, due to her or his infancy, must rely on a next friend during litigation should not be subjected to an interpretation of the rules of evidence and discovery that effectively would penalize her or him for prosecuting or defending a cause through a next friend; conversely, in the interests of justice and fairness to the opponents of infant litigants, a child should not be permitted to evade, by prosecuting or defending a cause through a next friend, application of the rules of evidence and discovery. In the present case, we resolve that the trial judge erred by allowing Respondents to read into evidence during their defense case the deposition testimony of Ms. Queen. As stated, Rule 2-419(a)(2) mandates that the deposition be of someone who is a party at the time the deposition is offered into evidence. As Petitioner\u2019s next friend, Ms. Queen was not a \u201cparty\u201d when Respondents offered her deposition into evidence. <em>See Pindell, </em>139 Md. at 575, 115 A. at 862. The present case is not one, like <em>Skevofilax, </em>in which Petitioner evades application of the rules of evidence or discovery because of her infancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Nevertheless, we will not reverse a judgment if the trial court\u2019s error was harmless. <em>Crane, </em>382 Md. at 91-92, 854 A.2d at 1185. A successful proponent of error ordinarily has the additional burden of showing that the error complained of probably, as opposed to possibly, influenced the unfavorable verdict. <em>Id. </em>Here, Petitioner is not able to carry the day. She complains that she \u201cwas particularly prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s ruling because [Ms. Queen\u2019s] credibility was obviously an issue.\u201d She does not articulate any harm to her cause other than that the deposition testimony undermined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Ms. Queen\u2019s credibility. She directs our attention to a portion of the closing argument of Respondents\u2019 counsel in which he said to the jury, \u201cI ask you to think about when I read portions of [Ms. Queen\u2019s] deposition and she didn\u2019t remember anything about the house. She didn\u2019t remember if [her] father and mother lived there. In fact she said in her deposition they didn\u2019t.\u201d Petitioner contends that Respondents \u201cshould not have been able to impeach [Ms. Queen\u2019s] credibility after their counsel already had the chance to cross-examine her.\u201d She claims that they \u201ctook advantage of the trial court\u2019s error by emphasizing the \u2018read-in\u2019 portions of the deposition in closing argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The flaw with Petitioner\u2019s contention is that, when Respondents\u2019 counsel read into evidence the deposition testimony of Ms. Queen during the defense\u2019s case, Respondents had used the deposition previously to impeach Ms. Queen during their cross-examination of her during Petitioner\u2019s case-in-chief. In other words, the damaging features of Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition testimony (to which Petitioner directs us) already were before the jury, regardless of Respondents\u2019 potentially duplicative use of the deposition during their defense case. Petitioner, however, does not complain here about Respondents\u2019 use of Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition during their cross-examination of her; nor does it appear from the record (which is intact for this part of the trial) that Petitioner objected to its use at that time. The following exchange from the cross-examination of Ms. Queen is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">[Respondents\u2019 counsel:] Now, first of all you were talking about your step-father, Mr. Brown, living with you [at the Subject Property?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">[Ms. Queen]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">Q Do you recall telling me in deposition ... that Mr. Brown didn\u2019t live at [the Subject Property]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">A He lived there but he just wasn\u2019t being there. He lived there. That was his residence. He lived there. Yes, he lived there. I don\u2019t recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Q Do you recall pointing out to us in deposition that Mr. Brown ... had his own apartment somewhere?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">Q Okay. Did Mr. Brown live at [the Subject Property]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">Q Okay. Let me refer you to\u2014and I\u2019ll give you a copy of your deposition\u2014page thirty-three. I\u2019m going to hand it to you, if you don\u2019t mind. There it is. There is page thirty-three.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">A Well I said it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">Q ... On page thirty-three, you were asked: \u201cYou don\u2019t know if your father lived with you at [the Subject Property]?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">Answer: \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014no, I am not sure. He lived there but he didn\u2019t come there. So I say no.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-12\">Question: \u201cHe lived there but he didn\u2019t come there?\u201d Answer: \u201cHe paid everything, paid the bills. It is their house but they don\u2019t stay there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-13\">Question: \u201cWe are referring to Robert Brown?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-14\">Answer: \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-15\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-16\">Q So do you recall testifying that Mr. Brown, in fact, didn\u2019t live at [the Subject Property]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-17\">A I said\u2014you said I said he lived there but he don\u2019t stay there. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-18\">Q Okay. Now, when you said in this testimony that they didn\u2019t live there, that they didn\u2019t stay there\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-19\">A My mother stayed there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-20\">Q Now, when you said in your sworn deposition testimony that they didn\u2019t stay there, were you referring to the fact that your parents didn\u2019t live there at times?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">Q For instance, you just told us that there were four bedrooms and they were all occupied with others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">A And I said they stay down in the basement. I know what I said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">Q So your parents stayed in the unfinished basement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">AI said they decorated it theirself. That\u2019s what I said. [Trial Judge]: But the question is, did they stay in the basement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">AI said yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">[Respondents\u2019 counsel]: And that basement was unfinished? A I said they decorated it theirself but it was unfinished at first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-11\">Q Did Robert Brown stay with you the entire time you were at [the Subject Property]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-12\">A No. No is the best way to answer you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">Petitioner does not explain how the impeachment value of Respondents\u2019 use of Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition during the defense\u2019s case-in-chief, which Petitioner objected to and continues to protest, differed in substance or effect from the use of the deposition during the foregoing dialogue, which engendered no protest from Petitioner. In fact, as the foregoing dialogue reveals, counsel for Respondents read an excerpt from the deposition during his cross-examination of Ms. Queen. That excerpt concerned whether Ms. Queen\u2019s mother and step-father lived at the Subject Property, and it is the relevant portion of the deposition testimony that he referenced in his closing argument to the jury. Counsel for Respondents also iterated in his closing argument that Ms. Queen did not recall new wallpaper at the Subject Property; however, that point was developed as well during cross-examination, regardless of whether it came out again when he read the deposition during Respondents\u2019 defense case.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">Petitioner asserts that the excerpts read into evidence during Respondents\u2019 defense case also might have included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>some statements in which Ms. Queen admitted that Respondents occasionally sent people to the Subject Property to make repairs, a point Petitioner believes prejudices her by undermining the believability of Ms. Queen. If, however, counsel for Respondents in fact read into evidence this part of the deposition, the prejudice to Petitioner was not sufficient to warrant reversing the jury\u2019s verdict in this case. First, Ms. Queen acknowledged during her direct examination that Respondents sent people to the Subject Property to make repairs, testifying that Daniel Realty \u201cpatched the hallway up and had some men on the roof.\u201d Second, it is not apparent how the fact that Respondent sent repairmen to the Subject Property, if believed, likely influenced the jury to conclude erroneously that the Subject Property <em>did not </em>contain chipping or peeling paint, lead-based or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Accordingly, the trial judge\u2019s error in allowing Respondents, under Rule 2-419(a)(2), to read into evidence excerpts from Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition testimony during their defense case was harmless on the record as presented to us. Because we conclude as such, we do not reach the issue of whether the deposition testimony alternatively was admissible under Maryland Rule 5-802.1, as so resolved by the intermediate appellate court. At least according to the parties\u2019 stipulations, Rule 5-802.1 was not relied upon by the Circuit Court in allowing use of the deposition.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>\n<em>II. The Un-Redacted ARC Report.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Petitioner next contends that the Circuit Court committed reversible error by allowing Respondents to offer as evidence the Un-Redacted ARC Report. She maintains that it was irrelevant because it detailed the condition of the Subject Property five years after she and Ms. Queen moved out. She asserts that she was prejudiced by this evidence because it described the paint at the Subject Property, for the most part, as \u201cintact.\u201d Respondents, however, rejoin that Petitioner\u2019s experts reasonably relied upon the un-redacted report in forming their opinions, therefore rendering it admissible under Maryland Rule 5-703.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">Maryland Rule 5-703 provides, in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">(a) In general. The facts and data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the expert at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">(b) Disclosure to the jury. If determined to be trustworthy, necessary to illuminate testimony, and unprivileged, facts and data reasonably relied upon by an expert pursuant to section (a) may, in the discretion of the court be disclosed to the jury even if those facts and data are not admissible in evidence. Upon request, the court shall instruct the jury to use those facts and data only for the purpose of evaluating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>the validity and probative value of the expert\u2019s opinion or inference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Thus, four elements must be satisfied for a document to be admissible under this rule. The document must be (1) trustworthy, (2) unprivileged, (3) reasonably relied upon by an expert in forming her or his opinion, and (4) necessary to illuminate that expert\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Tn the present case, Petitioner does not argue that the UnRedacted ARC Report was privileged or untrustworthy. Instead, she asserts that it was neither relied upon by her experts, Dr. Paulson and Mr. Cavaliere, nor necessary to illuminate their testimonies. Petitioner contends that the trial judge abused her discretion in concluding otherwise because, so she claims, Mr. Cavaliere testified (in deposition) only that paint on the Subject Property contained lead and Dr. Paulson testified (in trial) only that Petitioner was poisoned there by ingestion of lead. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">\u201c \u2018[TJhe admissibility of evidence, including rulings on its relevance, is left to the sound discretion of the trial court, and absent a showing of abuse of that discretion, its rulings will not be disturbed on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dehn v. Edgecombe, </em>384 Md. 606, 628, 865 A.2d 603, 616 (2005) (quoting <em>Farley v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>355 Md. 34, 42, 733 A.2d 1014, 1018 (1999)). An abuse of discretion lies where no reasonable person would share the view taken by the trial judge. <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. 295, 312, 701 A.2d 110, 118 (1997). Recently, this Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">\u201c[A] ruling reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard will not be reversed simply because the appellate court would not have made the same ruling. The decision under consideration has to be well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-9\"><em>King v. State, </em>407 Md. 682, 697, 967 A.2d 790, 799 (2009) (quoting <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 13-14, 648 A.2d 1025, 1031-32(1994)). In the instant case, we cannot conclude that the trial judge\u2019s ruling was so far removed from the center <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>mark that no reasonable person could have taken the same view.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">First, the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in determining that Petitioner\u2019s experts relied on the Un-Redacted ARC Report. As Petitioner\u2019s counsel laid the foundation for Dr. Paulson\u2019s opinion, it was patent that Dr. Paulson relied on the Un-Redacted ARC Report. Indeed, when Petitioner\u2019s counsel presented Dr. Paulson with the Redacted Version, he asked, \u201cCan you tell me [if] that\u2019s a' fair and accurate <em>yet redacted copy of the report, that you relied upon </em>to determine that there was lead paint at [the Subject Property]?\u201d (italics added). Dr. Paulson testified that it was. Additionally, Mr. Cavaliere testified in his <em>de bene esse </em>deposition that he formed his opinion that the Subject Property contained lead-based paint by reviewing the Un-Redacted ARC Report, which his technicians prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Second, the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in concluding that the Un-Redacted ARC Report was necessary to illuminate the testimonies of Petitioner\u2019s experts. In testifying to his expert opinion that Petitioner was poisoned by lead at the Subject Property, Dr. Paulson referred to the report generated by ARC, which, as we observed, apparently was the Un-Redacted ARC Report. He stated, \u201cwe have documentation from an inspection done of the home at that address that there was lead paint <em>on the surface, on multiple surfaces </em>at that address. Lead-based paint was found at over 20 sites at that address when the home was inspected in May of 1999.\u201d (italics added). The Un-Redacted ARC Report clarified that the detection of lead-based paint at a particular location does not mean necessarily that the paint is peeling or chipping. It also undermined the connection asserted by Dr. Paulson between \u201clead paint on ... multiple surfaces\u201d of the Subject Property and Petitioner\u2019s poisoning by clarifying that, in the report cited by Dr. Paulson, the paint on the surfaces was actually intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Petitioner counters that Dr. Paulson\u2019s reference to lead-based paint on the \u201csurfaces\u201d of the Subject Property is taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>out of context, suggesting that what he really meant was only that there was lead-based paint in \u201cplaces\u201d or \u201careas\u201d of the Subject Property. He did not mean, so Petitioner claims, that lead was in the top layer of paint. This may be so; however, as he was her expert witness, it was her responsibility to make certain that he explained himself in a manner that would not confuse the trier of fact (let alone appellate courts). If Dr. Paulson meant simply that lead-based paint was somewhere at the Subject Property and he did not rely on the Un-Redacted ARC Report in reaching that opinion, Petitioner had the opportunity to develop fully his testimony to be clear that that was the case. We, on appellate review, shall not reverse the discretionary ruling of the trial judge by assuming that Dr. Paulson meant what Petitioner now claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Petitioner next complains that, even if the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in admitting the Un-Redacted ARC Report under Rule 5-703, the report was not relevant to the condition of the paint at the Subject Property while Petitioner resided there from 1990 to 1994. She points out that Respondents, as reflected in their counsel\u2019s closing argument, relied on the un-redacted report to bolster their winning argument that there was no peeling, chipping, or flaking paint at the Subject Property during that time-frame. According to Petitioner, Respondents did not lay a proper foundation for the proposition that the condition of the paint in May 1999 (as represented by the Un-Redacted ARC Report) accurately reflected the condition of the paint from 1990 to 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Respondents counter that Petitioner waived this contention because she did not request a limiting instruction under Maryland Rule 5-703 and did not object to the manner in which they relied on the Un-Redacted ARC Report in their closing argument. We agree with Respondents. Neither the parties\u2019 briefs, the joint stipulation, nor the record provided suggests to us that the Un-Redacted ARC Report was admitted for any purpose other than to illuminate the testimony of Petitioner\u2019s experts. Thus, Petitioner\u2019s assertion\u2014that the un-redacted report was not relevant to the question of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>paint\u2019s condition while she resided at the Subject Property\u2014 takes aim only at the manner in which Respondents relied on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Petitioner concedes that she never requested a limiting instruction under Rule 5-703(b) (\u201cUpon request, the court shall instruct the jury to use those facts and data only for the purpose of evaluating the validity and probative value of the expert\u2019s opinion or inference.\u201d); however, she seeks to excuse her failure by claiming that Respondents did not raise Rule 5-703 as a basis for admitting the Un-Redacted ARC Report. Her excuse is not convincing. Even if Respondents never cited expressly the rule, the joint stipulation provided by the parties reveals that Respondents argued before the trial court that the un-redacted report was admissible because Petitioner\u2019s experts relied on it. Additionally, as with any evidence that potentially could be misused, Petitioner could have requested a limiting instruction under Rule 5-105<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> as well. Moreover, Petitioner did not object when, during closing argument, Respondents\u2019 counsel cited the Un-Redacted ARC Report as evidence that the paint at the Subject Property was \u201cintact\u201d while Petitioner resided there. <em>See Farley v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>355 Md. 34, 733 A.2d 1014 (1999) (\u201cEven if Allstate\u2019s comments during closing arguments were prejudicial and resulted in an inadequate verdict, it was incumbent upon Farley\u2019s counsel to immediately object so that the trial judge could properly rule on the matter.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Accordingly, we resolve that Petitioner\u2019s argument\u2014that the Un-Redacted ARC Report did not constitute relevant evidence of the paint\u2019s condition between 1990 and 1994\u2014has been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number> In addition to waiving her relevancy objection, Petitioner also fails to establish that she was prejudiced by the Respondents\u2019 use of the Un-Redacted ARC Report, even if the report was admitted erroneously as evidence relevant to whether peeling, chipping, or flaking paint existed at the Subject Property between 1990 and 1994, as Judge Murphy\u2019s dissent persuasively reasons. We are not persuaded that a different result would have obtained if the trial court excluded the Un-Redacted ARC Report. <em>See Flores, </em>398 Md. at 34, 919 A.2d at 720. Ms. Queen\u2019s testimony was the only evidence adduced by Petitioner to support the claim that the paint at the Subject Property was chipping, peeling, or flaking during Petitioner\u2019s residence. Respondents, on the other hand, adduced evidence that the paint was intact when Petitioner initially moved into the Subject Property and that no \u201cloose paint/plaster\u201d was observed in 1992 by the Baltimore City Health Department. The report prepared by the Health Department also revealed that Ms. Queen informed the inspector that Petitioner was poisoned at another property. Additionally, Respondents adduced testimony by one of the manager\u2019s of the Subject Property that Petitioner\u2019s grandparents (the tenants identified on the lease) inspected the Subject Property before Petitioner moved in and did not find any defects, as well as evidence that the Subject Property was painted and wallpapered shortly before Petitioner began residing there and that the property manager did not receive any complaints about the paint.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Keeping in mind that, \u201c[i]n any tort action, ... the burden is on the plaintiff to prove by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>preponderance of the evidence that it is more probable than not that the defendant\u2019s act caused his injury,\u201d Petitioner\u2019s argument\u2014that the Un-Redacted ARC Report likely changed the outcome of this case\u2014falls short. <em>See Med. Mut. Lib. Soc\u2019y v. B. Dixon Evander &amp; Assocs., 339 Md. </em>41, 54, 660 A.2d 433, 439 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">We affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. Petitioner, on the record before us, was not shown to be harmed sufficiently by the trial judge\u2019s decision (though found in hindsight to be erroneous) to permit Respondents to read into evidence excerpts from Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition during the defense case, and the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in allowing Respondents to introduce into evidence the UnRedacted ARC Report under Md. Rule 5-703. Even had it been error to admit the un-redacted report, Petitioner failed to persuade us that she was prejudiced by its admission or its use at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">BELL, C.J., Dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">MURPHY, J., Concurs and Dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b600-8\">.

A more substantive problem is that the intermediate appellate court did not decide whether Rule 2-419(a)(2) allows a litigant to use the deposition of a former adverse party after the latter ceases to be a party to the case. The Court of Special Appeals wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-10\">We need not resolve the interesting issues raised by the parties regarding the legal status of a next friend or the use of a deposition of a witness who was previously a party but is no longer a party to the case. In our view, the circuit court did not err by permitting appellees to read into evidence relevant portions of Ms. Queen's deposition, even though she was no longer pressing her individual claims against appellees by that point in the trial proceedings, because (1) the inconsistent deposition testimony was admissible as substantive evidence under Rule 5-802.1 [ ], and (2) to the extent that the deposition testimony was not inconsistent with the trial testimony, its admission was harmless error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-11\"><em>Brown v.

Now, can you tell us, please, what if anything you noticed happened to the painted areas around the area in the kitchen and the dining room where the water was coming in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">\u201c[Ms. Queen]: It was starting to chip more.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">The respondents\u2019 cross-examination of Ms. Queen sought to establish discrepancies between her trial testimony and that given on deposition and, thereby, undermine her credibility. One of the avenues they pursued to do so was to focus on who, besides her and Lanay Brown, resided at the subject premises during the relevant and applicable period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>of the plaintiffs\u2019 case-in-chief, the respondents made a motion for judgment as to each of Ms. Queen\u2019s individual claims. Without opposition, the tidal court granted that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Nevertheless, even though Ms. Queen was no longer a party to the action, the respondents sought, during their case-in-chief, to read Ms. Queen\u2019s pre-trial deposition testimony to the jury as substantive evidence, and, over the petitioner\u2019s objection, the trial court permitted them to do so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>holds, correctly, that, because Ms. Queen was not a \u201cparty\u201d when they read portions of her deposition into evidence during their case-in-chief, it was error for the trial court to have admitted it as substantive evidence. 409 Md. 565, 596, 976 A.2d 300, 318-19. Interpreting Rule 2-419(a)(2), it explains that the respondents were not, on that account, permitted to use Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition testimony freely for \u201cany purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596, 976 A.2d at 318-19. With this holding and rationale, I agree. Rather than reversing and remanding for a new trial, however, the majority proceeds to declare the error harmless. With this conclusion, I cannot agree. In my opinion, the trial court\u2019s erroneous evidentiary ruling was anything but harmless. Indeed, because the effect of the ruling was to revisit and re-categorize testimony presented earlier at trial and unduly emphasize it, its impact on Lanay Brown\u2019s case was devastating. Undoubtedly, it impacted the jury\u2019s verdict, thus prejudicing Lanay Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">To be sure, Ms. Queen was an important witness for the petitioner. It is likewise true that Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition testimony differed from her trial testimony and, as a result potentially, could have undermined her credibility and, as a result, the petitioner\u2019s case. Moreover, the discrepancy was before the jury. The respondents presented, during their cross-examination of her testimony in chief, as impeachment evidence\u2014not substantive evidence\u2014, Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition testimony as a counterpoint to Ms. Queen\u2019s testimony at trial. Whether that evidence did, or would, or how significantly, if at all, undermine Ms. Queen\u2019s credibility and, consequently, the petitioner\u2019s case, was a jury question. But the jury did not get to answer that question. When the case was presented to the jury for decision, notwithstanding that the only plaintiff remaining was Lanay Brown, as to whom the only evidence properly considered by the jury to decide her case was that amassed during her case-in-chief, impeachment evidence of Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition testimony again had been offered and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>permitted to be read into the record as substantive evidence. Never mind that Ms. Queen was no longer a party, evidence, admissible only if she were\u2014her deposition testimony as substantive evidence\u2014and which earlier has been admitted to impeach Ms. Queen, was nevertheless admitted, thus giving it undue emphasis and making it available to combine with its earlier incarnation, as impeachment evidence, to undercut Ms. Queen\u2019s credibility and, in turn and predictably, to prejudice Lanay Brown\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">The first question on the special verdict sheet required the jury to determine whether the paint at the subject premises was \u201cflaking, chipping, or peeling ... while Lanay Brown resided there[.]\u201d How it was resolved was an issue critical and of paramount importance to both sides. Its resolution also was largely, if not entirely, dependent on credibility of the witnesses and of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">At trial, the jury heard conflicting evidence about the condition of the paint at the Subject Property when the petitioner resided there with Ms. Queen. As indicated, Ms. Queen testified on behalf of the petitioner. Her testimony is set forth hereinbefore. That testimony was countered by the respondents, who offered largely documentary evidence tending to contradict Ms. Queen. Daniel Perlberg, a respondent, and also the landlord and partial owner of Daniel Realty, offered documentary evidence that Daniel Realty paid to have the inside of the subject premises wallpapered before Ms. Queen and Lanay moved in, suggesting that any assertions of chipping, peeling or flaking paint by the petitioner were not to be believed. The respondents also offered a Lead Inspection Report that was conducted by the Baltimore City Health Department when the petitioner and Ms. Queen resided at the property. Significantly, they proffered, the inspector who completed the Report did not circle that there was \u201cLoose paint/plaster\u201d in the Subject Property. According to the respondents, this further supported their contention that there was no chipping, peeling or flaking paint at the Subject Property when the petitioner and Ms. Queen lived there. The respondents also presented evidence that Ms. Queen\u2019s parents, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>the lessees of the premises, inspected the property upon signing the lease and found no chipping, peeling or flaking paint.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">\u201cIn the interest of the orderly administration of justice, and to avoid useless expense to the state and to litigants in its courts, it has long been the settled policy of this [CJourt not to reverse for harmless error.\u201d <em>Johnson &amp; Higgins, Inc. v. Simpson, </em>163 Md. 574, 588, 163 A. 832, 837 (1933). The justification for this policy is the need to conserve scarce resources, which is accomplished when the litigants are not forced to relitigate a case where the error had no impact on the outcome of the trial. <em>Id. </em>In civil cases, the complaining party has the burden of establishing that the trial court committed an error and that the error was prejudicial. <em>Flores v. Bell, </em>398 Md. 27, 33, 919 A.2d 716, 719 (2007); <em>Harris v. Harris, P.A., </em>310 Md. 310, 319, 529 A.2d 356, 360 (1987) (citing <em>Beahm v. Shortall, </em>279 Md. 321, 330, 368 A.2d 1005, 1011 (1977)). There is prejudice, our cases have concluded, when the error influenced the outcome of the case. <em>Benik v. Hatcher, </em>358 Md. 507, 537, 750 A.2d 10, 26 (2000); <em>Beahm v. Shortall, </em>279 Md. 321, 330-31, 368 A.2d 1005, 1018 (1977); <em>State Roads Comm\u2019n v. Kuenne, </em>240 Md. 232, 235, 213 A.2d 567, 568 (1965). In order to determine whether an error was prejudicial, an appellate court must proceed on a case-by-case basis. <em>Beahm, </em>279 Md. at 332, 368 A.2d at 1012. \u201cBefore we can reverse the ruling excepted to, we must be able to see that the party really has ground for exception, and may have been injured by what was done.\u201d <em>Lawson v. Price, </em>45 Md. 123, 133(1876). In making a harmless error determination, we must determine whether the alleged error probably, as opposed to possibly, prejudiced the complaining party. <em>Crane v. Dunn, </em>382 Md. 83, 91, 854 A.2d 1180, 1185 (2004); <em>Blondes v. Hayes, </em>29 Md.App. 663, 671, 350 A.2d 163, 167 (1976) (noting that appellate courts are \u201crestricted to seeking probabilities of prejudice as opposed to proofs thereof\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">As we have seen, the majority has held that, permitting the respondents to read Ms. Queen\u2019s pre-trial deposition testimony to the jury as substantive evidence during their case-in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>chief was error. <em>See </em>409 Md. at 596, 976 A.2d at 318-19. Thus, the petitioner has cleared the first hurdle, established the error. In concluding that the error was harmless, the majority relies on the fact that the portions of Ms. Queen\u2019s pre-trial deposition that were read to the jury by the respondents had already been brought to the jury\u2019s attention when Ms. Queen was cross-examined during the plaintiffs\u2019 case-in-chief. <em>See </em>409 Md. at 597, 976 A.2d at 319. It reasons: \u201cIn other words, the damaging features of Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition testimony already were before the jury, regardless of Respondents\u2019 potentially duplicative use of the deposition during their defense case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The majority is wrong for two reasons. First, the fact of the matter is that, due to a technical malfunction with the audio recording device during the trial, during the respondents\u2019 case-in-chief, coupled with the inability of the parties to recall, it is impossible to know precisely what portions of Ms. Queen\u2019s pre-trial deposition testimony were read to the jury during the respondents\u2019 case-in-chief. <em>See </em>409 Md. at 576, 976 A.2d at 306. In fact, having no independent recollection, and being unable to agree, all the parties could do was stipulate as to which portions of Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition <em>might have been read </em>to the jury, based on marks made by the respondents\u2019 counsel in their trial notes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In my opinion, given the state of this record, the petitioner has cleared the second hurdle.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">To prevail, I submit, at minimum, there must be an identity between what the respondents presented to impeach Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Queen\u2019s testimony during the petitioner\u2019s case-in-chief and what they read into the record as substantive evidence during their case-in-chief. To the extent that the substantive evidence differs from the impeachment evidence, because it is admissible only as to Ms. Queen and inadmissible against the petitioner, it prejudices the petitioner. There are glaring gaps in the record respecting this question. The identity of the evidence cannot be established by conjecture, surmise or speculation. To hold otherwise is to apply a different, hitherto unrequired, standard and place an impossible burden on the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">As indicated, the parties do not agree as to what was read to the jury. As we have seen, only the portion of Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition relating to the residence of her step father was read into the record during her cross-examination by the respondents. Thus, it is only that portion of the deposition that, when read in the respondents\u2019 case-in-chief, could arguably be the basis for finding harmless error. Assuming that it was read into the record during the respondents\u2019 case-in-chief, the petitioner argues that, during the respondents\u2019 case,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>portions of the deposition may have been read into the record as substantive evidence also. Specifically, she asserts, based on the respondents\u2019 statement during closing argument,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that it is likely that the respondents read to the jury the portion of Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition testimony where she did not recall that the subject property had been newly wallpapered and those portions in which Ms. Queen admitted that the respondents occasionally sent people to the subject property to make repairs. On this record, it is not even clear that the same portion of Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition used by the respondents in their cross-examination of Ms. Queen during the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>case-in-chief was also read to the jury during their case-in-chief. But even were we to accept the respondents\u2019 position that they read the same portion of Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition both in Lanay Brown\u2019s case-in-chief, and in theirs, it must also be accepted, as the respondents suggested in their closing argument, that they read more than that.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">As important, there is a difference between impeaching a witness on cross-examination with her pre-trial deposition testimony and reading that same testimony to the jury as substantive evidence. For example, when a witness is impeached on cross-examination with a prior inconsistent statement, that statement cannot be used for the truth of its assertion, assuming that it does not fall within a hearsay exception. <em>See </em>McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 34, at 67 (Edward W. Cleary, 2d ed.1972). Rather, the inconsistent statement can be used by the jury, if it so chooses, to draw a negative inference on that witness\u2019s credibility. McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 33, at 66 (Edward W. Cleary, 2d ed.1972). Substantive evidence on the other hand, which is how Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition was categorized when the trial judge erroneously permitted the respondents to read it to the jury, is not so limited in its effect. Substantive evidence can be used not only as a foundation to diminish the credibility of the witness who made a prior inconsistent statement under oath, but it also can be used by the jury to establish the truth of the matters asserted in that statement. McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 251, at 601 (Edward W. Cleary, 2d ed.1972). Thus, due to the dual nature in which it can be used, substantive evidence takes on \u2022 a different quality than simple impeachment evidence. For example, Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition testimony, during the petitioner\u2019s case-in-chief, could have been used by the respondents on cross-examination only to impeach Ms. Queen. The trial judge\u2019s erroneous evidentiary ruling, however, allowed the respondents to amplify and reconfigure the adverse impact of Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition testimony by permitting the respondents to use it as substantive evidence during the respondents\u2019 case-in-chief. The majority\u2019s opinion does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>even mention or appreciate this important evidentiary distinction or its potential impact on the jury\u2019s use of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">More important, in a case in which credibility was critical, as a result of the trial court\u2019s error, the jury was presented on multiple, qualitatively different, occasions with evidence of inconsistencies in an important plaintiff witness\u2019s testimony and her pre-trial deposition. Its first exposure came early in the trial, during the plaintiffs case, and it was proper. The second presentation came in the defendants\u2019 case, well into the case. Moreover, the evidence of inconsistency presented on the second occasion, which was not even the same evidence as that presented on the first\u2014it arguably was much more extensive, covering more incidents and instances\u2014was met with a timely and meritorious objection. Overruling the objection permitted the respondents to call attention to the earlier evidence of inconsistency, to highlight it, and introduce other inconsistencies. In addition, offering the deposition testimony later in the trial and as substantive evidence was designed to, and did, emphasize, unduly so, the inconsistencies they contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The more a jury is exposed to evidence the greater the danger, which is inherent, that the jury will give more weight to that evidence than it is due. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Walker, </em>1 F.3d 423, 430 (6th Cir.1993) (making that point in the context of \u201cread back\u201d of a witness\u2019s testimony during jury deliberations) (citing <em>United States v. Padin, </em>787 F.2d 1071, 1076 (6th Cir.1986)); <em>United States v. Varsalona, </em>710 F.2d 418, 421 (8th Cir.1983). Reading deposition testimony late in the trial, after the deponent has testified, and after some of the deponent\u2019s deposition has earlier been read into the record to impeach the deponent on the witness stand, certainly could have, and I submit had, that effect in this case. And, as indicated, timing does matter. When evidence, in this case, the deposition, is presented, it may well influence, and likely did in this case, the importance the jury ascribes to it. Not only were the respondents permitted to revisit Ms. Queen\u2019s cross-examination and highlight the discrepancies, of which it then apprised the jury, they were permitted\u2014when to do so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>was inappropriate and violative of the Rules\u2014to present additional discrepancies, not earlier presented, so as to be able to buttress their argument that Ms. Queen was not to be believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The majority\u2019s harmless error determination is based not only on an incomplete record but also on faulty logic. Indeed, one must ask, \u201cIf reading Ms. Queen\u2019s pre-trial deposition testimony was not prejudicial or harmful to the petitioner\u2019s case, then why would the respondents do it?\u201d This is the question that the majority cannot answer. That the respondents sought to, and did, read portions of Ms. Queen\u2019s deposition testimony to the jury, as substantive evidence, during their case-in-chief makes clear that they thought that those portions helped their case, and that such evidence was prejudicial to the petitioner. They viewed the evidence as solidifying the attack on Ms. Queen\u2019s credibility and, in so doing, harming the petitioner\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In this case, the petitioner recognized the prejudice and interposed a timely objection. There was nothing more she could do. A party who prevails on an objection should not bear the brunt of an erroneous trial ruling, urged by the party who did not. There should be some consequence for an erroneous ruling and, correspondingly, some reward to a vigilant litigant, especially where there is no lapse in that vigilance. If there is not, future litigants are given the \u201cgreen light\u201d to push the evidentiary rules to the furthest extent possible, knowing that an appellate court is not likely to order a new trial. If the evidentiary rules in this State are to mean anything, then appellate courts must create incentives for trial litigants to apply these rules correctly in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">I dissent.

The driver testified that the accident occurred after he passed a road sign indicating a curve to the right, and slowed down in anticipation of that curve. Unfortunately, that road sign was \u201cincorrect.\u201d According to Baltimore County\u2019s Director of Traffic Engineering, (1) when the \u201cincorrect\u201d sign was installed on May 1, 1970, the Department should have installed \u201ca left reverse curve sign at this location,\u201d and (2) the mistake was corrected on October 5, 1970, on which day the Department removed the sign \u201cshowing the curve to be in the direction opposite to the direction of the actual curve.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530, 308 A.2d at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">At the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 case-in-chief, Baltimore County argued that \u201cthere was no evidence that the sign was incorrect at the time of the accident,\u201d and the Circuit Court\u2019s \u201cdirected verdict\u201d was based on its finding \u201cthat there was no evidence that the County had knowledge of an erroneous sign, nor was there any evidence of when the erroneous sign became so[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 536, 308 A.2d at 437.

Moreover, the fact that Respondents sold the property in 1995 constitutes \u201cevidence from which a change in the condition [of the paint] could be reasonably inferred.\u201d Under these circumstances, I would hold that Petitioners were unfairly prejudiced by (1) the Circuit Court\u2019s erroneous failure to exclude the UnRedacted ARC Report, and (2) the argument of Respondents\u2019 counsel that this report constituted <em>relevant </em>\u201ccircumstantial evidence\u201d that \u201cthe paint was never chipping, peeling, or flaking while [Petitioners] lived there[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">While Maryland Rule 5-403 provides trial judges with the discretion to exclude relevant evidence, trial judges do not have discretion to admit irrelevant evidence. Maryland Rule 5-402, in pertinent part, provides that, \u201c[e]vidence that is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d To resolve the issue of whether the Un-Redacted ARC Report constituted relevant circumstantial evidence in this case, it may be helpful to hypothesize a jury trial of a money damage action for alleged lead paint exposure that will take place later this year. Assume that (1) the family of the injured child lived in the subject property from 1994 to 1997, (2) the defendants who owned this property during that period of time sold it in 1998, (3) an ARC inspector, who was never in the subject property until 2002, conducted tests for \u201csubsurface\u201d lead during that year, and prepared a report that includes a section in which the inspector noted that, \u201cbecause I observed so much of the paint to be chipping and peeling, <em>almost none </em>of the painted surfaces in the property were \u2018intact,\u2019 \u201c and (4) the ARC inspector took photographs of the chipping and peeling paint. Could the plaintiffs introduce the <em>entire </em>report into evidence? Should the Circuit Court overrule the defendants\u2019 objection to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>ARC inspector\u2019s testimony that he observed chipping and peeling paint in 2002? Would the photographs taken in 2002 be admitted as circumstantial evidence of what the subject property looked like from 1994 to 1997 without foundational testimony that these photographs fairly and accurately showed the condition of the paint during those years? I am persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the answer to each of these questions should be \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The trial judge must order that inadmissible portions of otherwise admissible records be excised or redacted. For example, hospital records include information about whether a person injured in an auto accident was or was not wearing a seatbelt, and whether a person injured while operating a motorcycle was or was not wearing a motorcycle helmet. In personal injury actions arising out of such accidents, however, (1) evidence that the plaintiff was not using his or her seatbelt is prohibited by \u00a7 22-412.3 of the Transportation Article, and (2) evidence that the plaintiff was not wearing his or her motorcycle helmet is prohibited by \u00a7 21-1306 of the Transportation Article. It is clear that a defendant-driver could not get prohibited evidence before the jury merely because the plaintiffs medical expert reviewed an \u201cun-redacted\u201d hospital record that included the prohibited information. It is equally clear that Respondents should not have been permitted to get the Un-Redacted ARC Report before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Moreover, the record shows that Respondents argued to the Circuit Court that the Un-Redacted ARC Report should be admitted on the ground that it had been relied upon by Petitioners\u2019 experts, and then argued to the jury that this exhibit supported their claim that the paint was intact while Petitioners lived in the property. Under these circumstances, \u201cto curtail abuses, [the ruling admitting the exhibit into evidence should be] subject to review as to the actual use made of the object.\u201d <em>Smith v. Ohio Oil Company, et al., </em>10 Ill.App.2d 67, 134 N.E.2d 526, 531 (1956). I would therefore hold that the \u201cactual use [that Respondents made of the Un-Redacted Report] proved to be an abuse of the ruling.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>I recognize that, during his direct examination, Dr. Paulson testified that \u201cthere was lead paint ... on multiple surfaces at that address ... when the home was inspected in May of 1999.\u201d Because evidence of the condition of the paint in 1999 does not permit a rational inference that the same condition existed in 1994, this testimony was clearly irrelevant. The record shows, however, that Respondents did not object to this testimony and did not request that it be stricken. Under these circumstances, Respondents were not entitled to introduce their own irrelevant evidence \u201cas an answer to [Dr. Paulson\u2019s] irrelevant testimony.\u201d <em>Baltimore &amp; Susquehanna R.R. Co. v. Woodruff, 4 </em>Md. 242, 255 (1853).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">In <em>Lake Roland Elevated Ry. Co. v. Weir, </em>86 Md. 273, 37 A. 714 (1897), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">If [a party\u2019s] evidence be clearly irrelevant, it should not be admitted on the ground that other irrelevant evidence had already been introduced, unless the latter was admitted by the Court after objection. If the irrelevant evidence is offered by one party, the other side should object to it, and if it be given before its irrelevancy is apparent, the Court should strike it out on proper application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 277, 37 A. at 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">In my opinion, Petitioners should be awarded a new trial on the ground that they were unfairly prejudiced by the erroneous admission of the Un-Redacted ARC Report.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
