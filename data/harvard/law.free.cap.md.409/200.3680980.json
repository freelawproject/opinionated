The issue is essentially one of statutory interpretation, and we conclude that \u00a7 5-518(c) waives the Board\u2019s governmental immunity, meaning its general sovereign immunity and the immunity guaranteed by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for all claims in the amount of $100,000 or less. Therefore, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">/.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">We shall adopt the facts as set forth in the reported opinion of the Court of Special Appeals. <em>See Zimmer-Rubert v. Board of Ed., </em>179 Md.App. 589, 947 A.2d 135 (2008). The intermediate appellate court recited the facts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Born on January 16, 1949, [Ms. Zimmer-Rubert] is an experienced educator qualified to teach English, Spanish, German, and French. In March of 2004, [she] filed an application to teach foreign language in [the Baltimore County] high schools. Unsuccessful in her quest to secure a teaching position and, upon learning that young teachers were hired to fill vacant positions for which she was qualified, [Zimmer-Rubert] filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. On March 17, 2006, [Zimmer-Rubert] was granted a Right to Sue letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-4\">Within ninety days, [Zimmer-Rubert] filed a Complaint in the [Circuit [C]ourt[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] against [the Board], alleging age discrimination and \u201cdemanding judgment for compensatory damages in the amount of $100,000, attorney fees, pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(b), interest and the costs of the action.\u201d [The Board] subsequently moved to dismiss [Zimmer-Rubert]\u2019s suit [contending that it was entitled to the immunity guaranteed by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">A hearing on [the Board]\u2019s motion was held on May 25, 2007. In a ruling from the bench on that same day, the trial court granted [the Board]\u2019s motion, finding that [Zimmer-Rubert]\u2019s ADEA claim was barred by [the Board]\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity. Explaining her decision, the trial judge opined that, \u201con further reflection in looking at C.J. \u00a7 5-518, as well as <em>Alden v. Maine, </em>527 U.S. 706, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999), that [sic] the 11th Amendment immunity must be specifically waived, and it\u2019s not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-6\"><em>Zimmer-Rubert, </em>179 Md.App. at 592-93, 947 A.2d at 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court. <em>Zimmer-Rubert, </em>179 Md.App. at 612, 947 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>at 149.

We have long considered county school boards to be State agencies rather than independent, local bodies. <em>See, e.g., State v.

According to the Board, \u201cstates enjoy Eleventh Amendment immunity in their own courts\u201d that can only be waived by explicitly consenting to suit in federal court. (Petr.\u2019s Br. 13, 20). Conversely, Zimmer-Rubert maintains that the Board\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity is but a manifestation of its broader sovereign immunity that the General Assembly waived by virtue of \u00a7 5~518(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The Eleventh Amendment reads: \u201cThe Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XI. Although the Amendment, by its terms, applies only to suits brought against a state by citizens of another state or foreign state in federal court, the United States Supreme Court has \u201clooked to \u2018history and experience and the established order of things,\u2019 rather than \u2018adhering to the mere letter\u2019 of the Eleventh Amendment, in determining the scope of the States\u2019 constitutional immunity from suit.\u201d <em>Alden v. Maine, </em>527 U.S. 706, 727, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 2253, 144 L.Ed.2d 636, 661 (1999) (quoting <em>Hans v. Louisiana, </em>134 U.S. 1, 13, 14, 10 S.Ct. 504, 506, 33 L.Ed. 842, 847 (1890)). Thus, for example, the Supreme Court has held that the Eleventh Amendment bars suits against states by their own citizens, <em>Hans, </em>134 U.S. at 11, 10 S.Ct. at 505, 33 L.Ed. at 845, and by Native-American tribes, <em>Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, </em>517 U.S. 44, 47, 116 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>S.Ct. 1114, 1119, 184 L.Ed.2d 252, 261 (1996). In so holding, the Supreme Court \u201cha[s] understood the Eleventh Amendment to stand not so much for what it says, but for the presupposition of our constitutional structure which it confirms: that the States entered the federal system with their sovereignty intact; that the judicial authority in Article III is limited by this sovereignty....\u201d <em>Blatchford v. Native Vill. of Noatak, </em>501 U.S. 775, 779, 111 S.Ct. 2578, 2581, 115 L.Ed.2d 686, 694 (1991); <em>see Fed. Mar. Comm\u2019n v. S.C. State Ports Auth., </em>535 U.S. 743, 754, 122 S.Ct. 1864, 1871, 152 L.Ed.2d 962, 974 (2002) (\u201c[T]he sovereign immunity enjoyed by the States extends beyond the literal text of the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">In <em>Alden, </em>527 U.S. at 735, 754, 119 S.Ct. at 2257, 2266, 144 L.Ed.2d at 666, 678, while recognizing that the Eleventh Amendment served previously to limit only the Article III jurisdiction of the federal courts, the United States Supreme Court pointed out that states have the right to assert the defense of sovereign immunity in state court proceedings. <em>Alden </em>involved a suit by a group of probation officers against their employer, the State of Maine, pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d). The Supreme Court held that Congress lacked authority under its Article I Commerce Clause powers to subject nonconsenting states to private suits in their own courts. <em>Alden, </em>527 U.S. at 712, 119 S.Ct. at 2246, 144 L.Ed.2d at 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The import of <em>Alden </em>extends beyond its specific holding. The case is notable for analyzing the relationship between the broad doctrine of sovereign immunity and the more specific grant of immunity in the Eleventh Amendment. The Supreme Court thus recognized that the doctrine of sovereign immunity predated the ratification of the Eleventh Amendment, which is not an exhaustive expression of the doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMr\">The Eleventh Amendment makes explicit reference to the States\u2019 immunity from suits \u201ccommenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\u201d We have, as a result, sometimes referred to the States\u2019 immuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>ty from suit as \u201cEleventh Amendment immunity.\u201d The phrase is convenient shorthand but something of a misnomer, for the sovereign immunity of the States neither derives from, nor is limited by, the terms of the Eleventh Amendment. Rather, as the Constitution\u2019s structure, its history, and the authoritative interpretations by this Court make clear, the States\u2019 immunity from suit is a fundamental aspect of the sovereignty which the States enjoyed before the ratification of the Constitution, and which they retain today (either literally or by virtue of their admission into the Union upon an equal footing with the other States) except as altered by the plan of the Convention or certain constitutional Amendments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\">[Sjovereign immunity derives not from the Eleventh Amendment but from the structure of the original Constitution itself. The Eleventh Amendment confirmed, rather than established, sovereign immunity as a constitutional principle; it follows that the scope of the States\u2019 immunity from suit is demarcated not by the text of the Amendment alone but by fundamental postulates implicit in the constitutional design.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">[WJhile the Eleventh Amendment by its terms addresses only \u201cthe Judicial power of the United States,\u201d nothing ... suggested the States were not immune from suits in their own courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-6\"><em>Alden, </em>527 U.S. at 712-713, 728-29, 742, 119 S.Ct. at 2246-47, 2254, 2260, 144 L.Ed.2d at 652, 662, 670 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Alden </em>also emphasized that \u201ca State may waive its sovereign immunity and consent to suit.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Alden, </em>527 U.S. at 737, 119 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>S.Ct. at 2258, 144 L.Ed.2d at 667. The specific defense of Eleventh Amendment immunity will be waived \u201cwhere stated \u2018by the most express language or by such overwhelming implications from the text as [would] leave no room for any other reasonable construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 673, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1361, 39 L.Ed.2d 662, 678 (1974) (quoting <em>Murray v. Wilson Distilling Co., </em>213 U.S. 151, 171, 29 S.Ct. 458, 464, 53 L.Ed. 742, 751 (1909)). As the Supreme Court further explained in <em>Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, </em>473 U.S. 234, 241, 105 S.Ct. 3142, 3146-47, 87 L.Ed.2d 171, 179 (1985):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">Although a State\u2019s general waiver of sovereign immunity may subject it to suit in state court, it is not enough to waive the immunity guaranteed by the Eleventh Amendment. \u201c[A] State\u2019s constitutional interest in immunity encompasses not merely <em>whether </em>it may be sued, but <em>where </em>it may be sued.\u201d Thus, in order for a state statute or constitutional provision to constitute a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity, it must specify the State\u2019s intention to subject itself to suit in <em>federal court.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">(Citations omitted.) <em>See also Port Auth.

We held that the plain language \u201cin a court of the State\u201d excluded Eleventh Amendment immunity from \u00a7 12-201\u2019s general waiver of sovereign immunity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Turning to the instant case, we note that discerning the extent to which \u00a7 5\u2014518(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article waives the Board\u2019s governmental immunity requires a two-part determination. First, applying Maryland law, we must determine whether the statute constitutes a waiver of the Board\u2019s general sovereign immunity as to Zimmer-Rubert\u2019s ADEA suit. If \u00a7 o\u2014518(c) constitutes such a waiver, then we must also determine whether the statute waives the Board\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>the latter determination involves a question of federal constitutional law, our inquiry is not limited to Maryland common law principles. As to both determinations, however, we shall apply traditional rules of statutory interpretation, remaining mindful of the policies underlying governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">In <em>Kushell v. DNR, </em>385 Md. 563, 576-77, 870 A.2d 186, 193-94 (2005), we recited the principles of statutory interpretation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. <em>See Collins v. State, </em>383 Md. 684, 688, 861 A.2d 727, 730 (2004). Statutory construction begins with the plain language of the statute, and ordinary, popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of its terminology. <em>Deville v. State, </em>383 Md. 217, 223, 858 A.2d 484, 487 (2004).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">If statutory language is unambiguous when construed according to its ordinary and everyday meaning, then we give effect to the statute as it is written. <em>Collins, </em>383 Md. at 688-89, 861 A.2d at 730. \u201cIf there is no ambiguity in that language, either inherently or by reference to other relevant laws or circumstances, the inquiry as to legislative intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>ends; we do not need to resort to the various, and sometimes inconsistent, external rules of construction, for \u2018the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arundel Corp. v. Marie, </em>383 Md. 489, 502, 860 A.2d 886, 894 (2004) (quoting <em>Witte v. Azarian, </em>369 Md. 518, 525, 801 A.2d 160, 165 (2002)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">Nevertheless, we may resort to legislative history to ensure that our plain language interpretation is correct. <em>See Kramer v. Liberty Property, </em>408 Md. 1, 22, 968 A.2d 120, 132 (2009). \u201c \u2018We avoid a construction of the statute that is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walzer v. Osborne, </em>395 Md. 563, 573, 911 A.2d 427, 432 (2006) (quoting <em>Blake v. State, </em>395 Md. 213, 224, 909 A.2d 1020, 1026 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">By its plain language, \u00a7 5-518(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article waives the defense of sovereign immunity \u201cto <em>any </em>claim of $100,000 or less\u201d (emphasis added). We cannot conclude that such broad and unambiguous language preserves the defense of sovereign immunity as to Zimmer-Rubert\u2019s claim, arising pursuant to the ADEA for the amount of $100,000. We thus agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 determination that \u201cthe words \u2018any claim\u2019 cannot reasonably be read to exclude certain categories of claims.\u201d <em>Zimmer-Rubert, </em>179 Md.App. at 612, 947 A.2d at 149; <em>accord Norville, </em>160 Md.App. at 70, 862 A.2d at 511 (\u201cUnder the settled approach to statutory interpretation, the words \u2018any claim\u2019 [in \u00a7 5-518(e) ] cannot reasonably be read to exclude certain categories of claims.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In addition, reference to legislative history confirms that the words \u201cany claim\u201d in \u00a7 5-518(c) mean <em>\u201call </em>claims.\u201d What is currently known as Md.Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-518 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article was first introduced in 1971 as House Bill 610. Originally, the House proposed that county school boards carry liability insurance \u201cfor personal injury claims.\u201d H.B. 610, 373rd Leg., Reg. Sess. (Md.1971). This language, however, was stricken in favor of language requiring <em>\u201ccomprehensive </em>liability insurance\u201d (emphasis added). We conclude that such a change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>exemplifies the intent of the General Assembly to apply \u00a7 5-518(c) to all claims, including those for personal injury and alleged employment law violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Having concluded that \u00a7 5-518(c) embraces all claims, thereby effecting a waiver of sovereign immunity in this case, we also hold that the statute effects a waiver of the Board\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity. A waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity will be found \u201cwhere stated \u2018by the most express language or by such overwhelming implications from the text as [would] leave no room for any other reasonable construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Edelman, </em>415 U.S. at 673, 94 S.Ct. at 1361, 39 L.Ed.2d at 678 (quoting <em>Murray, </em>213 U.S. at 171, 29 S.Ct. at 464, 53 L.Ed. at 751). A state waives Eleventh Amendment immunity by \u201cspecifying its] intention to subject itself to suit in federal court.\u201d <em>Atascadero, </em>473 U.S. at 241, 105 S.Ct. at 3146-47, 87 L.Ed.2d at 179. Here, the State specified its intention to subject itself to suit in federal court, as the words \u201cany claim\u201d in \u00a7 5-518(c) encompass a claim brought in either state <em>or </em>federal court. Thus, in contrast to the statute at issue in <em>Sharafeldin, </em>382 Md. at 149, 854 A.2d at 1219, the General Assembly has not demonstrated an intent to preserve its Eleventh Amendment immunity. In other words, as <em>Sharafeldin </em>makes plain, \u00a7 5-518(c) is an express waiver of all governmental immunity; if the General Assembly intended to preserve the State\u2019s Eleventh Amendment protection, that body knew how to do so by merely limiting the State\u2019s liability to any claim brought \u201cin a court in this State,\u201d or words to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Moreover, our principles of statutory interpretation avoid a result that is illogical or inconsistent with common sense. <em>Walzer, </em>395 Md. at 573, 911 A.2d at 432 (quoting <em>Blake, </em>395 Md. at 224, 909 A.2d at 1026). The policy underlying sovereign immunity is to \u201cprotect[ ] the State from burdensome interference with its governmental functions.\u201d <em>Katz, </em>284 Md. at 507, 397 A.2d at 1030. It would defy logic for the General Assembly to have waived sovereign immunity as to \u201cany claim,\u201d thereby allowing all claims, whether in state or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>federal court, while simultaneously intending to preserve Eleventh Amendment immunity. We therefore conclude that \u00a7 5-518(c) of the Court and Judicial Proceeding Article waives the Board\u2019s governmental immunity, including its Eleventh Amendment immunity, for all claims in the amount of $100,000 or less.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-10\">. The Eleventh Amendment provides that \"[ll he Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\u201d U.S. Const amend.

Whether the State of Maryland, pursuant to Section 4-105 of the Education Article, <em>Annotated Code of Maryland, </em>and Section 5-518(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, <em>Annotated Code of Maryland, </em>enacted a valid waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">ii. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in finding that Maryland comity boards of education may not assert Eleventh Amendment immunity as an affirmative defense to \"any claim\" for $100,000 or less, even claims pursuant to federal statutes under which county boards are entitled to absolute Eleventh Amendment immunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">iii. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred by treating the \"concept of sovereign immunity\" and \"Eleventh Amendment immunity\u201d as interchangeable by limiting the right of State agencies to assert Eleventh Amendment immunity from liability based upon an overly broad reading of Section 5-518(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\">iv. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in finding that Eleventh Amendment immunity only extends to claims brought by citizens of that state in federal court.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b237-5\">. Also cited in the question presented is Md.Code (1978, 2008 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 4-105 of the Education Article. Section 4-105(d) provides that \u2018\u2018[a] county board [of education] shall have the immunity from liability described under \u00a7 5-518 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\">. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Alden </em>also recognized another exception to the defense of sovereign immunity. That is, Congress may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>abrogate a State\u2019s sovereign immunity pursuant to its enforcement powers under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Alden, </em>527 U.S. at 756, 119 S.Ct. at 2267, 144 L.Ed.2d at 679. The issue of abrogation is not currently before us, as the Supreme Court held in <em>Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, </em>528 U.S. 62, 91, 120 S.Ct. 631, 650, 145 L.Ed.2d 522, 547 (2000), that \u201cthe ADEA is not a valid exercise of Congress\u2019 power under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b243-5\">. In so doing, we acknowledge that there has been some conflict in this Court as to the impact of the Eleventh Amendment in state court proceedings. <em>Compare Glover v. Glendening, </em>376 Md. 142, 150 n. 3, 829 A.2d 532, 536 n. 3 (2003) (\"The Eleventh Amendment, ltowever, is not applicable to actions in a Maryland trial court. An Eleventh Amendment \u2018argument is essentially one of federal court jurisdiction and federal constitutional law.\u2019 \") (quoting <em>Widgeon v. E. Shore Hosp. Center, </em>300 Md. 520, 537, 479 A.2d 921, 929 (1984)), <em>with Md. Military Dep\u2019t v. Cherry, </em>382 Md. 117, 122, 854 A.2d 1200, 1203 (2004) (stating that in <em>Alden </em>\"the Supreme Court held that the Eleventh Amendment is applicable to actions in state court\u201d). An abundance of authority suggests that the United Slates Supreme Court's decision in <em>Alden </em>relied exclusively on common law principles of sovereign immunity, that the Eleventh Amendment serves to limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts only, and that the Amendment has no application in state court proceedings. <em>See, e.g., Alden v, Maine, </em>527 U.S. 706, 760, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 2269, 144 L.Ed.2d 636, 682 (1999) (Souter, J\u201e dissenting) (stating that the <em>Alden </em>majority recognized that \"the state forum render[ed] the Eleventh Amendment beside the point\u201d); <em>Pittman v.

Lyles, </em>797 So.2d 432, 436 (Ala.2001) (\u201cWhile the Eleventh Amendment governs the jurisdiction of federal courts over the states and immunizes the states from certain actions in the federal courts, the Eleventh Amendment is not the source of a state's immunity from actions in its own courts.\u201d (citing <em>Alden, </em>527 U.S. 706, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636)); <em>Severson v.

Notwithstanding, we need not resolve that conflict in this case, for we conclude that the plain language of \u00a7 5-518(c) of the Court and Judicial Proceedings Article waives all of the Board\u2019s governmental immunity, including its Eleventh Amendment immunity, to claims of $100,000 or less.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
