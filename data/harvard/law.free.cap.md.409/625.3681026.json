Rubin of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, sitting as a juvenile judge, to change the permanency plan for a one-year-old child, Faith H., from the goal of reunification with her parents, Dana H. and Michael B., to adoption by a non-relative, pursuant to Section 3-823(e)(l)(i)(3)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. We are asked to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>whether he committed reversible error in a permanency planning review hearing, by allowing the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cDepartment\u201d) to submit written reports in lieu of live testimony as its case-in-chief. The case revolved around whether Faith, who had been declared a child in need of assistance (\u201cCINA\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at an earlier adjudicatory<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and disposition hearing,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> should have her permanency plan changed from reunification with her parents to adoption by a non-relative. We granted certiorari on our own initiative, <em>In re Faith H., </em>408 Md. 148, 968 A.2d 1064 (2009), prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, to review the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">Did the trial court commit reversible error by allowing the Department to present its case-in-chief through written reports without any in person testimony where the natural parent objected?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>We conclude that the Department was not required to present its case-in-chief through \u201cin person\u201d testimony, and that the trial court did not err by allowing the Department to present its case-in-chief through written reports. Therefore, we affirm the Circuit Court\u2019s order that Faith\u2019s permanency plan be changed to adoption by a non-relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Faith H. was born on September 19, 2007, to Dana H. (\u201cMs. H.\u201d) and Michael B. (\u201cMr. B.\u201d). On September 20, 2007, the Department received a report that at birth, Faith and her mother tested positive for cocaine. The Department filed a CINA petition, and Faith was placed in shelter care on September 21, 2007. On September 24, 2007, the juvenile court sustained allegations that both Faith and Ms. H. tested positive for cocaine, that Ms. H. was not employed and lacked stable housing, and that Mr. B. was incarcerated for abusing a sibling of Faith. The court ordered Faith to remain in shelter care until the adjudicatory hearing and granted limited guardianship of Faith to the Department. On October 18, 2007, the juvenile court held an adjudicatory hearing during which Ms. II. and Mr. B. stipulated to the facts and Department\u2019s recommendations in the Amended CINA petition and consented to the juvenile court\u2019s finding that Faith was a child in need of assistance. The court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">(T]he Child is a child in need of assistance BECAUSE: 1) the Child was born exposed to cocaine; 2) the Child\u2019s mother tested positive for cocaine upon the Child\u2019s birth; 3) this is the second Cina Child of the parents; 4) David, the Child\u2019s sibling, born in June 2006, tested positive for cocaine upon his birth, and Ms. H. also tested positive for cocaine and opiates upon his birth; 5) the Child has been neglected by the Child\u2019s parents, Dana H. and Michael B.; 6) the Child\u2019s parents are unable to give proper care and attention to the Child\u2019s needs; and the stipulations of the parties presented sustained the finding that continuation ol' the aforesaid Child in the Child\u2019s home is contrary to the Child\u2019s welfare and that it is not possible to return the Child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>to that home of either parents because the following circumstances exist: 1) the Child\u2019s parents permitted the Child to be born exposed to cocaine; 2) the Child\u2019s parents permitted the Child\u2019s sibling, David, to be born exposed to cocaine,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak5L\">(emphasis in original). The judge entered an order placing Faith under the jurisdiction of the court and committed her to the Department to be placed in foster care with supervised visitation by Mr. B. and Ms. H. Additionally, the court ordered Mr. B. to complete an anger management program through the Montgomery County Abused Persons Program, to provide the Department with proof of residence and employment, and to participate in parenting classes through the Montgomery County Responsible Fathers Program. Ms. H. was ordered to complete an outpatient drug treatment program, submit to urinalysis twice weekly, attend Narcotics Anonymous meetings twice weekly and provide verification of attendance, seek and maintain stable housing, provide the Department with proof of residence and employment, participate in parenting classes, and participate in the Abused Persons Program.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In anticipation of the permanency planning hearing initially scheduled for March 31, 2009, but ultimately postponed to April 15, 2009, the Department prepared a report,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provided it to the court and all parties updating the court and parties regarding its recommendations, its efforts at reunification, a suggested permanency plan of adoption by a non-relative, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>progress made by the parties, and the Department\u2019s reasons for its recommendations. In its report, the Department recommended that Ms. H. attend a drug treatment program, Narcotics Anonymous, individual therapy, and parenting classes; follow recommendations from a psychological evaluation done in conjunction with Faith\u2019s siblings\u2019 cases;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and participate in urinalysis for drug testing. The Department also recommended that Mr. B. attend parenting classes and participate in an anger management program.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The report also described the Department\u2019s efforts at reunification as attempting to contact the parents, supervise Faith in her current placement, make referrals for assessment and treatment programs, supervise visitation, and provide transportation to visitation. The Department recommended the permanency plan of adoption by a non-relative, because Faith had been in foster care for six months, her other siblings had been in foster care for eighteen months, neither parent had taken advantage of reunification services offered by the court or followed through with the court\u2019s orders, and Faith needed stability. The report stated that it was unlikely reunification would happen then or in the near future because of Faith\u2019s mother\u2019s substance dependence and Faith\u2019s father\u2019s procrastination in complying with the court\u2019s orders in Faith\u2019s sibling David\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">On March 31, 2008, the court granted the parents\u2019 attorneys\u2019 motion to postpone the permanency planning hearing. On April 15, 2008, the juvenile court conducted the permanency planning hearing and found that the Department had made reasonable efforts to achieve the permanency plan of reunification, but the court rejected the Department\u2019s recommended plan of adoption by a non-relative and ordered that Faith remain committed to the Department with continued placement in foster care. The court ordered Mr. B. to participate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>in the Responsible Fathers Program parenting classes, to participate in the Abused Persons Program\u2019s 26-week anger management program, to follow all recommendations of the psychologist\u2019s evaluation, including individual therapy and a bonding study, to sign all necessary releases of information from treatment providers to the Department, and to provide the Department with proof of residency and employment. The court ordered Ms. H. to follow all treatment recommendations from the substance abuse evaluation, to participate in the Abused Persons Program, to follow all recommendations of the psychologist\u2019s evaluation, to participate in individual therapy, to supply the Department with proof of residency and employment, to participate in parenting classes, to participate in urinalysis twice weekly, and to attend Narcotics Anonymous meetings. The court conditioned Ms. H.\u2019s visitation with Faith on clean urine tests and attendance at Narcotics Anonymous meetings and ordered supervised visitation between Faith and Ms. H. and Mr. B. The court admonished that the permanency plan of reunification could be changed to another permanency plan, including the filing of a petition for termination of parental rights, if the parents did not make significant progress to remedy the circumstances that caused Faith\u2019s removal, or were unwilling to give their child proper care and attention. A permanency plan review hearing was set for May 27, 2008, but was later rescheduled for September 2008 in order for the Reginald S. Lourie Center for Infants and Young Children to complete the court-ordered bonding study.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Between the time of the April permanency planning hearing and the September permanency plan review hearing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Department filed two more permanency planning reports dated June 12, 2008, and July 14, 2008; the Lourie Center completed a report dated July 15, 2008 (\u201cLourie Center Report\u201d); and the Montgomery County Citizens\u2019 Review Board for Children <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (\u201cReview Board\u201d) filed two reports.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The Department\u2019s June Report incorporated the behavioral recommendations in its March Report, as well as the court\u2019s orders for Ms. H.\u2019s drug testing and Mr. B.\u2019s participation in the court ordered bonding study. The report outlined the Department\u2019s efforts to facilitate reunification between Faith and Ms. H. and Mr. B., but also explained that both Ms. H. and Mr. B. had failed to adhere to court orders, and Mr. B. continued to procrastinate. The June Report, nevertheless, recommended that the permanency plan remain reunification with both, to allow Mr. B. more time to fully prepare to have Faith returned to his care.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">In its July Report, the Department changed its recommendation from reunification to adoption by a non-relative because of Ms. H.\u2019s and Mr. B.\u2019s failure to comply with court orders and to engage in the services Offered by the Department. The Department noted that Ms. H. had not visited with her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>children and that Mr. B. had failed to complete the court ordered services since December 2007, that Mr. B. had been recently terminated from the Abused Persons Program, had not acquired appropriate housing, had not provided employment verification, and had not completed parenting classes. The Department also relied on the recently completed bonding-study conducted by the Lourie Center\u2019s Child Placement Consultation Team (\u201cCPCT\u201d), which found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">While [Mr. B.] has shown positive interactions with Faith and David during his weekly supervised visitations and the CPCT observation, the CPCT has serious concerns about [Mr. B.\u2019s] ability to respond to Faith\u2019s and David\u2019s social-emotional and developmental needs <em>over time. </em>The history of [Mr. B.\u2019s] conviction and incarceration for child abuse, his own physical abuse history, his poor judgment regarding his long and ongoing relationship with [Ms. H.], his relationship instability, his emotional difficulties ... his housing instability, and lack of follow through on several therapeutic recommendations, including the Abused Person\u2019s Program and parenting classes, indicate that both David and Faith would be placed at significant risk of. exploitation for neglect and/or abuse should reunification occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">(emphasis in original). By the time the juvenile court convened on September 26, 2008, the Department and the Lourie Center had submitted reports, provided to the court and all parties, stating that it was in Faith\u2019s best interest to have her permanency plan changed from reunification to adoption by a non-relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">On September 26, 2008, the juvenile court held a permanency planning review hearing with respect to Faith and her brother David.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Department presented its case-in-chief by offering into evidence its July Report and the Lourie Center Report in lieu of live testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>[DEPARTMENT:] And I believe that\u2019s the extent of, I think those [reports] amply set out the Department\u2019s case for the permanency plan that the Department\u2019s requesting of adoption by a non-relative. And we would propose under <em>In Re: Ashley E., </em>[387 Md. 260, 874 A.2d 998 (2005) ] that the Department submit for Your Honor\u2019s consideration those reports in lieu of live testimony....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">[DEPARTMENT:] But it\u2019s not our intention to elicit any testimony today, but merely submit these reports.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The only objection raised by Ms. H. was that the Department\u2019s Report had not been updated since she received it in July of 2008.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">In addition to a request to redact the words \u201caddiction\u201d and \u201caddicted,\u201d with reference to Faith, from the Department\u2019s Report, Mr. B. did object to the Department proceeding without eliciting direct testimony from any witnesses and argued that he would be at a disadvantage if the Department were not to call the reports\u2019 authors for direct examination, because he would have to call them as adverse witnesses. In response, the court clarified that Mr. B. would be allowed to cross-examine the reports\u2019 authors were he to call them to the stand, and also noted that the authors were available in court for cross-examination. The judge also remarked that Mr. B. could present any relevant or admissible evidence on his behalf:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-9\">[MR. B.\u2019S COUNSEL:] And in reference to, to Your Hon- or\u2019s question, we do want the Department to present their case in full, because we think that if we only get to cross-examine the, the Department\u2019s witnesses that puts us in a situation where we probably would be calling them as adverse witnesses and we think we are, we would be at a disadvantage if we were to do that. Because, and we\u2019re\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>THE COURT: Why? I\u2019ll let you lead them to a fair thee well, you\u2019ll take them on cross. You don\u2019t, you\u2019re not, you\u2019re not sponsoring the witness, you can cross him by any appropriate method possible. And since you know exactly what they\u2019re going to say, you\u2019re not at a disadvantage at all. You have exactly what they\u2019re going to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">[MR. B.\u2019S COUNSEL:] Well, we still have to develop what they are, what their testimony would be. And we don\u2019t want to be in that position. We just want to be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">THE COURT: No, you don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">\u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">[MR. B.\u2019S COUNSEL:] This case was set for a whole day, and so it\u2019s not a time factor. That\u2019s not the reason why the Department doesn\u2019t want to put on their case. They just find it for convenience sake. And had we known this is the way they were going to, they would have proceeded, we also would\u2019ve written our report and had, and had our clients available, you know, for cross-examination. And\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-9\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not stopping you from presenting any relevant or admissible evidence that you want. Present away.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">Available in the court at that hearing were Faith\u2019s foster parents, social workers Tiffani Bradley and Dianna McFarlane, who signed the Department\u2019s Report, and Dr. James Venza from the Lourie Center, who authored the bonding study. Although Ms. H. and Mr. B. declined to cross-examine Faith\u2019s foster parents, Dr. Venza was subjected to cross-examination regarding the Lourie Center Report, and specifically, with respect to Faith\u2019s \u201csecure attachment\u201d to her foster parents, as opposed to her \u201canxious attachment\u201d to Mr. B., Mr. B.\u2019s counsel asked whether it was possible \u201cthat secure attachment could then be given to a third person if that third person were to spend more time with them,\u201d to which Dr. Venza replied that it was possible \u201cunder very specific conditions.\u201d The State then proceeded to conduct a \u201cre-direct examination\u201d of Dr. Venza regarding the congruency of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>finding of \u201canxious attachment\u201d compared with his concern about Mr. B.\u2019s ability to parent, at which time Mr. B.\u2019s counsel objected to the amount of time Dr. Venza took to evaluate Mr. B. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">[MR. B.\u2019S COUNSEL:] We renew our objection to proceeding in this manner again, because it puts us at a disadvantage. I mean, why would I, I want to go ahead and ask the doctor something like that that\u2019s already in the report? It doesn\u2019t make any sense. Had he testified, we don\u2019t know what exactly he would have testified to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">THE COURT:\u2014that is not a new objection. It\u2019s a, you can renew it, and the same ruling you have had\u2014you know, most lawyers in cases wish would, would, would give a lot of money for the direct testimony of a witness on a, on a hard piece of paper before they conduct their cross-examination because they know exactly what was said, they know exactly how it was said, and they don\u2019t have to sit there and write notes furiously. Not only are you not at a disadvantage, you are at an advantage. And I know that from trying cases for 25 years. It is much easier to cross-examine a witness when you have in writing the report of an expert. It\u2019s much easier to take the expert\u2014no offense, take the expert apart when you have that. It\u2019s hard to do if they\u2019re just giving you on direct in open court what they\u2019re going to have to say, because not only do you have to listen and watch the witness and write it down at the same time. So I completely disagree you\u2019re disadvantaged. Overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The parties proceeded to cross-examine Tiffani Bradley and Dianna McFarlane, signers of the Department\u2019s Report. Ms. Bradley was cross-examined by Mr. B.\u2019s counsel concerning her observations of Mr. B. during his visits with Faith and his completion\u2014or lack thereof<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2014of anger management and parenting classes. Although Mr. B. was able to interact with Faith during his one hour visits, according to Ms. Bradley, the Department was concerned about Mr. B.\u2019s ability to care for his children 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Mr. B.\u2019s counsel proceeded to cross-examine Ms. McFarlane and focused on the Department\u2019s actions in helping Mr. B. obtain housing. Counsel sought and gained confirmation that Mr. B. had complied with several court ordered classes and evaluations. Ms. McFarlane also testified that Mr. B. came prepared to visits with David and Faith and engaged with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Neither Ms. H. nor Mr. B. took the stand or presented any testimony. Numerous exhibits offered by the parents were received into evidence and read by the judge at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Thereafter, Judge Rubin filed a fourteen page opinion, in which he adopted the findings of the Department\u2019s reports, found that the witnesses testified credibly at the September 26, 2008, permanency planning review hearing, and applied the factors set forth in Sections 5\u2014525(e)(1)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and 5\u2014525(e)(2)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>the Family Law Article. Judge Rubin found that Ms. Bradley testified credibly and further found that the Department had offered substantial services to the parents in an effort to achieve a permanency plan other than adoption. The court also found that Ms. H. and Mr. B. repeatedly failed to timely and substantially comply with court-ordered and Department-offered services, and that since Faith\u2019s sibling David was removed from his parents in October 2006, both parents continued to procrastinate, preferring instead to lead a life of fulfilling their own personal wants and needs, which did not leave room for the fulfillment of parental obligations. The court also found that Dr. Venza\u2019s testimony, regarding the Lourie Center Report, thoroughly and cogently explained why removing Faith from her foster parents, and returning her to her biological parents, would be inimical to Faith\u2019s best interests. The court concluded that, \u201c[(Respite being afforded ample reunification efforts,\u201d neither Ms. H. nor Mr. B. \u201cmeaningfully ameliorated the conditions that brought [Faith] into care,\u201d and both were \u201cwholly incapable of fulfilling parental obligations.\u201d In assessing the factors set forth in Section 5-525(e)(1) of the Family Law Article, Judge Rubin found that Faith was \u201cattached to her current caregivers and ... would suffer emotional, developmental, and educational harm if she wore removed from their care.\u201d Further applying the factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>set forth in Section 5-525(e)(2) of the Family Law Article, the judge found that Faith had also \u201cestablished positive relationships and family ties with her current caregivers.\u201d After considering the record evidence, Judge Rubin concluded that it would not be safe for Faith to be returned to her mother, that Faith would suffer emotional harm and neglect if she were returned to her biological parents\u2019 care, that Faith had bonded with her foster parents, and that Faith would suffer emotional harm if she was removed from her current placement. After finding no relative placement reasonably available for Faith, the court concluded that it would not be in Faith\u2019s best interests to remain in foster care indefinitely and ordered that Faith\u2019s permanency plan be changed to a plan of adoption by a non-relative, from which Mr. B. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Mr. B. contends that he was entitled to a mode of presentation at the hearing that included live testimony because he had the right to confront witnesses. He maintains that in person testimony would permit a judge to assess witness credibility and demeanor, and that there is no \u201csupport for the proposition that the Department ... can proceed by way of proffer and refuse to present their case-in-chief by way of live testimony when the parent objects to this process.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> He also claims that his due process rights were violated by the mode of presentation and that he was prejudiced by the lack of direct testimony by the authors of the reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Conversely, the State argues that the Department\u2019s challenged reports were admitted and, in fact, the Department\u2019s Report and the Lourie Center Report were admissible under Sections 3-823 <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and 3-826,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and 3-816,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> respectively, of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, none of which, they argue, requires them to present live testimony as a condition precedent to admissibility. In addition to the argument that evidence standards are more flexible in permanency planning hearings, under <em>In re Ashley E., </em>the State maintains that the Lourie Center Report met the Report was timely served on the parties, and the parents were permitted to challenge the Report\u2019s findings through cross-examination of the Report\u2019s authors. Additionally, the State argues that the Department was required to prepare a permanency planning report for the review hearing, and the juvenile court was required to consider the Department\u2019s reports in determining the appropriate plan for Faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The statutory scheme governing dispositional and review hearings in CINA cases envisions that the juvenile court will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>rely on reports submitted by the Department and other entities. In the present case, three reports were submitted to the court\u2014the Department\u2019s Report, the Lourie Center Report, and the Review Board\u2019s Report\u2014although only the first two appear to be the subject of Mr. B.\u2019s challenge.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Once a child has been found CINA, pursuant to Section 3-819<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, and a child is committed to an \u201cout-of-home placement,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> a permanency planning hearing must be held within 11 months to determine an appropriate plan for the child under Section 3-823(b)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, and periodic reviews must be conducted by the court pursuant to Section 3-823(h)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In prepara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>tion for a hearing, the Department of Health and Human Services is statutorily required to develop and implement a permanency plan that is in the best interests of the child pursuant to Section 5-525(b)(2)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> of the Family Law Article and to provide all parties and the court with a copy of the plan at least 10 days before any scheduled disposition, permanency planning, or review hearing. Sections 3-823(d) and 3-826(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. In the present case, there is no challenge to the fact that the Department satisfied all preconditions and distribution requirements of the reports by timely filing its permanency plan reports on March 21, 2008, June 13, 2008, and July 16, 2008, and by providing copies to the court and all parties at least 10 days before the April 15, 2008, permanency planning hearing and 10 days before the September 26, 2008, permanency planning review hearing, nor does Mr. B. challenge the fact that the Departmental Report was admissible under the statutory scheme.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In addition to the departmental reports, other studies \u201cconcerning the child, the child\u2019s family, the child\u2019s environment, and other matters relevant to the disposition of the case\u201d may be required by the court pursuant to Section 3-816(a)<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, and are admissible as evidence at a dispositional hearing, so long as the report of the study is filed and provided to all parties at least 5 days before the hearing. Section 8-816(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article; <em>see also </em>Rule 11-105.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In the present case, the juvenile court ordered an evaluation of Faith, Mr. B., and Faith\u2019s foster parents by the Lourie Center. The Lourie Center Report was filed on July 16, 2009, at least 5 days before the September 26, 2009, permanency planning review hearing, and was provided to all parties. Again, the Lourie Center Report was appropriately admitted into evidence; Mr. B. does not challenge its admissibility.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">In the present case, not only were the reports admissible but Mr. B. never raised any objection regarding the admissibility of the documents, including any challenges to their authenticity under Rule 5-901,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> hearsay under Rule 5-802,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> nor their inclusion of possible inadmissible opinions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>under Rules 5-702<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and 5-703.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> When the reports were admitted into evidence, they became available for consideration for any purpose and could be accorded any weight by the court, depending on any extrinsic challenge of reliability by admission of other evidence. <em>See Ellsworth v. Sherne Lingerie, Inc., </em>303 Md. 581, 495 A.2d 348 (1985); <em>Haile v. Dinnis, </em>184 Md. 144, 40 A.2d 363 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Mr. B., however, argues that the Department was required to offer live testimony in addition to the reports because otherwise the judge had \u201cno opportunity to assess the credibility and demeanor\u201d of the proponents of the reports and could not accord them their proper weight. Mr. B. argues that he was disadvantaged because \u201cthe court presupposed that all of the conclusions reached in the written reports would have been supported by the Department\u2019s direct evidence, without any contradictions, memory lapses, or corrections.\u201d He also contends that he was prejudiced and that the \u201cburden was shifted from the Department to prove the facts they wished to have admitted into evidence to the Appellant to disprove their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>occurrence, or lack thereof.\u201d The State conversely asserts that the Department is not required to present live testimony and that the reports satisfied its burden of proof and that the burden was not inappropriately shifted to Mr. B.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Mr. B. has no cause to complain for many reasons: he never challenged the reliability of the reports for authenticity, hearsay, or inadmissible opinions; Mr. B. had the reports for at least two months prior to the hearing; and he was offered the opportunity to cross-examine the reports\u2019 authors, which he took. Mr. B. cites no authority that requires live testimony in addition to the reports to support their reliability. He also cites no authority for the proposition that his due process rights require that live testimony be offered by the Department or that a certain mode of trial be followed, according to his dictates.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Mr. B. had the opportunity to call other witnesses and to challenge the reliability of the reports.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The judge even noted that he was \u201cnot stopping [Mr. B.] from presenting any relevant or admissible evidence that [he wanted]. Present away.\u201d Here, the Department\u2019s reports were admitted into evidence, but Mr. B. chose not to present testimony to demonstrate weakness or error in the Department\u2019s reports. He offered and had accepted into evidence various exhibits which the judge read.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Mr. B. cites to <em>Atkinson v. State, </em>331 Md. 199, 627 A.2d 1019 (1993), to support his contention that the Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>had to forgo the presentation of its case-in-chief by the admission of its report and the Lourie Center Report and submit in-person testimony. His reliance on <em>Atkinson </em>is misplaced, because in that case we found the evidence of physical control of a vehicle in a DWI case offered as a stipulation to be insufficient to sustain a conviction. The case does not stand for the proposition that a stipulated set of facts would not be sufficient to sustain a conviction in other cases, or that testimony was required in addition to the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Judge Rubin did not err in admitting the reports into evidence, and there is no authority that requires the Department to present its case-in-chief through live testimony or to augment its documentary evidence with live testimony, after admission. We can find no case or statute, which supports Mr. B.\u2019s theory. That the judge agreed with the reports filed by the Department and the Lourie Center did not obviate Mr. B.\u2019s due process rights\u2014he was afforded a fair process but not guaranteed the outcome he wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED.

Rule 5-802 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Except as otherwise provided by these rules or permitted by applicable constitutional provisions or statutes, hearsay is not admissible.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b676-7\">. Rule 5-702 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">Expert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In making that determination, the court shall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b676-9\">. Rule 5-703 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-10\">(a) In general. The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the expert at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-11\">(c) Right to challenge expert. This Rule does not limit the right of an opposing party to cross-examine an expert witness or to test the basis of the expert's opinion or inference.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b677-8\">. Mr. B. contends that <em>Wilson v. State, </em>345 Md. 437, 693 A.2d 344 (1997), and <em>Void v. State, </em>325 Md. 386, 601 A.2d 124 (1992), support his argument that the Department needed live testimony in lieu of the reports. In <em>Wilson, </em>however, a trial judge denied the defendant the opportunity to put on testimony of a witness who he had subpoenaed, but who did not show up at trial, because the judge refused to issue a body attachment; we held that the trial court had erred because the defendant had the right to call witnesses on his behalf. Similarly, in <em>Void, </em>we held that a trial court erred when it quashed a defendant\u2019s subpoenas for three witnesses, without having a proffer of their testimony to determine relevancy. In the present case, Mr. B. was afforded the opportunity to call his own witnesses and present any relevant or admissible evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
