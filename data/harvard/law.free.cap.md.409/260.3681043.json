It is clear in both of these cases that neither of the prosecutors presented the cases well, nor did the defense attorneys adequately represent their clients. Nevertheless, it is the presiding judge who is the subject of the questions presented. Diggs presents the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">1. Was Mr. Diggs deprived of a fair trial because the trial court failed to preserve an attitude of impartiality in his questioning of witnesses?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-6\"><em>Diggs v. State, </em>406 Md. 443, 959 A.2d 792 (2008). In the companion bypass case,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ramsey presents the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">1. Did the trial court violate Damon Ramsey\u2019s constitutional right, under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, to a fair trial where the trial judge acted as a second prosecutor and created a hostile courtroom environment for defense counsel in front of the jury, all of which suggested extreme bias against the defense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">2. Did the trial court violate Damon Ramsey\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront his accuser when the trial judge prevented defense counsel from challenging the credibility of the only police officer to testify against Damon Ramsey? [<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-9\"><em>Ramsey v. State, </em>406 Md. 744, 962 A.2d 370 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">Steven Diggs was arrested and charged in Baltimore City with possession of marijuana, possession of marijuana with an intent to distribute, operating an unregistered motor vehicle, driving an uninsured vehicle, and driving without a license. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>During the course of trial proceedings that occurred on June 1, 2007, Diggs was tried for possession of marijuana and possession of marijuana with an intent to distribute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A jury found Diggs guilty on the charge of possession of marijuana, but was unable to render a unanimous decision on the charge of possession of marijuana with an intent to distribute. Diggs appeals from his conviction, alleging that he was denied a fair trial as a result of judicial bias, premised upon repeated and egregious behavior of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Diggs\u2019 first allegation of bias involves statements made by the judge during the direct examination of Detective John Giganti, who testified that he pulled Diggs\u2019 vehicle over because it had no license plates and thereafter discovered what he believed to be marijuana. When the prosecutor did not adequately lay the foundation for distribution of the marijuana, the judge pursued his inquiry more specifically about the packaging of the marijuana:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY:] Now, based on your expertise and experience, did you draw any conclusion as to the number of ziplock baggies recovered, the thirty-five baggies?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">[DETECTIVE GIGANTI:] It was not for personal use. It was for street level distribution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And what about the money in the console?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">THE COURT: Let me stay with that for a second. Why do you say that, sir, that it would be for street level distribution, not for personal use. What is about it\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">[DETECTIVE GIGANTI:] Thirty-five bags of marijuana is a lot of personal use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">THE COURT: Okay. How about the individual packages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>[DETECTIVE GIGANTE] They are probably worth about ten dollars a piece.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\">THE COURT: And they\u2019re packaged individually?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJB\">[DETECTIVE GIGANTE] They\u2019re packaged individually in small ziplock bags and the money again with small denominations other than a hundred dollar which would be consistent with ten dollar or dime bags as they\u2019re known on the street, of marijuana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Diggs also contends that the judge interfered during Detective Georgiades\u2019 direct examination, because after Detective Georgiades could not recall telling Detective Giganti that he had previous contact with Diggs or previously had arrested Diggs, the judge allegedly attempted to rehabilitate the officer by stating: \u201cIt was over two and a half years ago, right? I mean we\u2019re talking November and the event would have been September '04 so okay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Diggs further posits that the judge acted as a co-prosecutor during the direct examination of Diggs\u2019 first witness, Sherienne Diggs, Diggs\u2019 sister. The first instance of bias allegedly arose when Sherienne Diggs failed to recall various details about money and marijuana bags found in her car, and the judge pressed her for details:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Okay. How much money? Did you count the money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">[MS. DIGGS:] Yeah, I counted it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] How much was there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">[MS. DIGGS:] It was $1,800.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-12\">THE COURT: Do you remember the denominations of the bills?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-13\">[MS. DIGGS:] No, not exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-14\">THE COURT: Do you remember if there were any hundred dollar bills in there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-15\">[MS. DIGGS:] It might have been.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-16\">THE COURT: Not might have been. Do you remember one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Do you remember or don\u2019t? It doesn\u2019t matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">[MS. DIGGS:] No, I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">THE COURT: You\u2019d probably remember a hundred dollar bill, wouldn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">[MS. DIGGS:] Not if you see a lot of them all the time. THE COURT: Did you see a lot of them that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">[MS. DIGGS:] Later on that day I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">THE COURT: How about earlier\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\">[MS. DIGGS:] I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-11\">THE COURT: When he handed you the money you remember a lot of hundred dollar bills?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-12\">[MS. DIGGS:] I remember a lot of twenties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-13\">THE COURT: A lot of twenties. Do you remember a hundred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-14\">[MS. DIGGS:] I\u2019m not sure. I think so. I\u2019m not sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmZ\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. So you don\u2019t recall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-15\">[MS. DIGGS:] No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-16\">During cross-examination, Diggs points to numerous instances in which the judge allegedly acted inappropriately. When the State questioned Ms. Diggs about her recollection of how long her brother had been staying at her house, she responded \u201c[n]ot long\u201d and \u201c[m]aybe weeks.\u201d The judge intervened and again pressed for details:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-17\">THE COURT: Was it weeks or was it days? You have a very good memory on everything else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-18\">THE COURT: Days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-19\">[MS. DIGGS:] Days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-20\">THE COURT: Days. How many days?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-21\">[MS. DIGGS:] Five, six.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-22\">THE COURT: What day of the week did this incident occur?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-23\">[MS. DIGGS]: I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-24\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t remember if it was a week day or a weekend?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>[MS. DIGGS]: I know it was a week day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Moments later, the judge inquired into whether Ms. Diggs was \u201ccomfortable\u201d with the information she provided regarding where she left her car keys, what time she got home, and what time she received the phone call that her brother had been arrested, while driving her ear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">THE COURT: Do you remember where you left the keys on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">[MS. DIGGS:] They were on the table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">THE COURT: What time did you go into your house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-9\">[MS. DIGGS:] Around eight, eight-thirty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">THE COURT: What time were you planning to go out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-11\">[MS. DIGGS:] Around nine, nine-thirty, ten o\u2019clock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-12\">THE COURT: What time did you get the call that he had been arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-13\">THE COURT: You are comfortable with that testimony? [MS. DIGGS:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-14\">THE COURT: And you left $1,500. Was the car locked? [MS. DIGGS:] Yeah, the car was locked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-15\">THE COURT: You left the money in the console?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-16\">[MS. DIGGS:] Yes. I did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-17\">The judge\u2019s effort to cross-examine Ms. Diggs about the $1,500 found in the car continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-18\">THE COURT: How many times did he receive money\u2014 how many different times did you see him receive money from other people?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-19\">[MS. DIGGS:] I\u2019m not exactly sure how many times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-20\">THE COURT: Well, was it ten or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-21\">[MS. DIGGS:] I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-22\">THE COURT: You don\u2019t know if it was ten. Do you know if it was twenty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>[MS. DIGGS:] No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">THE COURT: Do you know if it was thirty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">[MS. DIGGS:] No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">THE COURT: So you can\u2019t say any of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">[MS. DIGGS:] No, I can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">THE COURT: Okay. Well, you know it\u2019s more than one or two?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-10\">[MS. DIGGS:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-11\">THE COURT: What did he do with that money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-12\">[MS. DIGGS:] He handed it to me and I put it in a bag. I counted it and put it in a bag.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-13\">THE COURT: You only put one hunk of money in the console, is that your testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-14\">[MS. DIGGS:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-15\">The judge continued to press Ms. Diggs regarding why Ms. Diggs failed to inform the officers, immediately, that the drags and money belonged to her boyfriend, as opposed to her brother:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-16\">THE COURT: Well, you learned that night that he had been arrested, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-17\">[MS. DIGGS:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-18\">THE COURT: And you learned he was arrested I guess for possession of drugs, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-19\">[MS. DIGGS:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-20\">THE COURT: And the money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-21\">[MS. DIGGS:] Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-22\">THE COURT: And you knew that he was innocent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-23\">[MS. DIGGS:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-24\">THE COURT: Did you go to the police right away and tell them this story that you\u2019re telling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-25\">[MS. DIGGS:] I tried to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-26\">THE COURT: What stopped you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-27\">[MS. DIGGS:] I tried to tell them. I tried to tell them that it was [my boyfriend\u2019s], I told [my boyfriend] to tell them that it was his. The police was not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>THE COURT: I didn\u2019t ask you about [your boyfriend]. Did you go to the police or go to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag\">[MS. DIGGS:] We went around there where they was arresting him at and we tried to tell him. I tried to tell the police. The police did not want to hear anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-4\">THE COURT: No, ma\u2019am, did you tell either one of the officers who were here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">[MS. DIGGS:] That\u2019s what I just said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">THE COURT: You didn\u2019t listen to my question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">[MS. DIGGS:] I didn\u2019t tell those two officers, but it was more than those two officers out there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">THE COURT: Did you go to the police and say look this was not my brother\u2019s drugs or money? It belonged to [my boyfriend] with whom I was out collecting drug money that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">[MS. DIGGS:] I didn\u2019t say all of that, but I told them that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AR\">THE COURT: You\u2019re saying that here. And I guess my question is why didn\u2019t you say all of that at the time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj\">[MS. DIGGS:] You\u2019re not letting me finish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-10\">THE COURT: Why did you wait two and a half years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-11\">[MS. DIGGS:] You\u2019re not letting me finish saying what I was trying to say. I told the police that it wasn\u2019t his car. That is wasn\u2019t his drugs. That it wasn\u2019t his money. They were not trying to hear anything I had to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-12\">THE COURT: All right, Madame, I\u2019d like you to answer my question, please. Why didn\u2019t you tell the police that you knew your brother was innocent because you and [your boyfriend] had been out delivering drugs that day? Why did you wait two and a half years to come in here and tell this story now?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">At this point, defense counsel did object to the judge\u2019s inquisitory statement and suggested that the judge\u2019s conduct was inappropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Objection. It hasn\u2019t been two and a half years, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-15\">THE COURT: November\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>[MS. DIGGS:] I told the police\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">THE COURT: A year and a half, a year and a half.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Judge, you\u2019re testifying now. It has not been. She has been telling this story for quite some time now and it hasn\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">THE COURT: Before court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-8\">[MS. DIGGS:] Yes, I told them that night. That\u2019s what I am trying to tell you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-9\">THE COURT: You tell\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] You\u2019re testifying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-11\">THE COURT: Excuse me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] This is inappropriate. You are not supposed to involve yourself in a case this way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-13\">THE COURT: Do you understand my comment? You can say anything that you want at this bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] No, Judge, if you\u2019re going to say in front of the jury that it was two and half years before you mentioned that, then I want them to hear, but this isn\u2019t the first time. We have been doing this case many times before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-15\">THE COURT: [Counsel\u2014]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Judge, you\u2019re giving them false information. It\u2019s not true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-17\">THE COURT: [Counsel\u2014]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-18\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Judge\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-19\">THE COURT: You are on the verge\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-20\">THE COURT: You can say anything you want on the record but I want it at the bench. Do you understand that? Yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-21\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>THE COURT: All right, make sure. You can take exception to anything and everything I do. I have no problem with that, but I want it done at the bench not from counsel table. Do we understand each other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Yes, Judge, and I am objecting to you questioning her any further. You\u2019re badgering her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azf\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not badgering her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Yes, you are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">THE COURT: The woman is clearly\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Don\u2019t you dare say that. You do not know. You were not there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">THE COURT: All right, thank you very much.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Diggs concedes that \u201c[t]his was admittedly the only time the defense objected to the court\u2019s improper questioning of the defense witnesses and its improper insinuation that the defense witnesses were being untruthful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">In the companion case, Damon Ramsey was charged in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City with possession of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana, and possession with an intent to distribute cocaine and heroin, for which he was convicted after a two-day jury trial. Ramsey alleges that he was denied a fair trial as a result of judicial bias that began during a pre-trial suppression hearing, continued during voir dire and examination of witnesses and culminated during the course of instructing the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">Ramsey alleges that the judge\u2019s hostility toward defense counsel began when the judge empanelled the jury before holding the suppression hearing regarding Ramsey\u2019s motion that the drugs were illegally seized. Ramsey\u2019s motion to suppress the seized contraband, filed pursuant to Rule 4-252(a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was heard by the judge after the jury was empanelled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>hereby failing to comply with Rule 4-252(g),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which states that motions \u201cfiled pursuant to this Rule shall be determined before trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Ramsey also argues that the judge badgered his attorney when he accused her of striking jurors based on their race:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A05\">THE COURT: Counsel, approach. Counsel approach, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">(Whereupon, Counsel approached the bench and the following ensued:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">THE COURT: Counsel, according to my notes and looking at the array and the notes I took, it appears that maybe one third of this array is Caucasian. You have exercised five strikes and with the exception of number 699, which is juror number 12, all of them were Caucasian. Some of them, for instance, number 693, Mr. Aquino, didn\u2019t answer a question. The lady you just struck, Ms. Minghetti, didn\u2019t answer a question. What is your basis for striking Ms. Minghetti?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOD\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Your Honor, I would state that in regards to number 693\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">THE COURT: Why don\u2019t you pick 705, the one you just struck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] 705, she is a director with a significant amount of education. I perceived her as to be a\u2014I perceived her as to be a more dominant force in the group, a leader, and there are other jurors who I perceive based upon the defense in the case that I would seat in her preference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>THE COURT: Well, you didn\u2019t strike Mr. Fitzgerald and he has the same degree of education. You didn\u2019t strike Miss Page, I don\u2019t think, 698.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Well, I would say that I had already seated Mr. Fitzgerald and I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">THE COURT: Pm sorry\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] That would go to my not wanting another person to serve\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">THE COURT: Is what you are saying, you don\u2019t want two people who educated but one is okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] No. I said in her position as a director I perceived her as to be\u2014would come forth as a leader in the group.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] She\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-12\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t accept your explanations. I believe that race is entering into it and I find it unacceptable. So let\u2019s continue with the rest of the strikes, then I\u2019ll make a decision. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Your Honor, may I make a record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-14\">THE COURT: Sure. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] I would state that in regards to the defense strike number one, she stated that she was never arrest-[sic] that her fianc\u00e9 was in law enforcement. She was a white female but she said that she would-her fianc\u00e9 as law enforcement never arrested an innocent man, and it was after multiple questioning that she changed her mind as to fairness. In regards to 693, a white male, his body language during voir dire\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-16\">THE COURT: He what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-17\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:]\u2014and at other times I think he was\u2014\u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-18\">THE COURT: He what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-19\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] I\u2019m saying a white male.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-20\">THE COURT: Yeah, that\u2019s not a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] I\u2019m finishing my sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">THE COURT: Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] That when I looked at him and especially during voir dire, he was seated\u2014separated himself from the rest of the group.

The judge, in the first instance, queried the Officer regarding times and locations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-13\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY:] Did there come a time that you saw Mr. Ramsey again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-14\">[OFFICER TORBIT:] Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-15\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY:] And where was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-16\">[OFFICER TORBIT:] In the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-17\">THE COURT: Do we have a time\u2014what time was it saw him the first time, officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-18\">[OFFICER TORBIT:] It was between 7:30 and 8 o\u2019clock</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aci\">THE COURT: In the evening?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-19\">[OFFICER TORBIT:] Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-20\">THE COURT: Okay.

Around the corner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-15\">[OFFICER TORBIT:] Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-16\">At a bench conference during the Officer\u2019s direct testimony, the judge also asked the prosecutor if she intended to elicit identification testimony, but before she had the opportunity to ask the question, the judge interjected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-17\">THE COURT: All right. Now, you have mentioned Mr. Ramsey. Do you see Mr. Ramsey in the courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag7\">[OFFICER TORBIT:] Yes, sir, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-18\">THE COURT: Would you point to him please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-19\">[OFFICER TORBIT:] Right here, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-20\">THE COURT: For the record he\u2019s identified the Defendant seated at the trial table.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-21\">Ramsey also points to another juncture during Officer Torbit\u2019s direct testimony in which, in response to a defense objection to a line of questioning, the judge not only overruled the objection, but pursued the line of questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-22\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY:] And the substance inside, how are you able to recognize what it is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-23\">[OFFICER TORBIT:] It\u2019s a white powder substance.

You have your record....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Ramsey also complains of judicial misconduct, after Dr. Muhammed Majid had testified and had been cross-examined regarding his opinion that a bag found contained cocaine, heroin, and marijuana. Specifically, after the prosecutor declined to engage in redirect, the judge asked Dr. Majid to retake the stand and proceeded to establish the drugs\u2019 chain of custody:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">THE COURT: ... Doctor, let me just\u2014why don\u2019t you retake the stand. Show him that. Let me show you the second page of exhibit 4, are you familiar with that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A15\">[DR.

Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Whether the trial judge\u2019s behavior was so egregious so as to deprive either or both Diggs and Ramsey of their due process rights to a fair and impartial trial is the gravamen of these cases. Diggs argues the trial court\u2019s lack of impartiality, continuous questioning of witnesses beyond the acceptable \u201cclarification\u201d questions and implications to the jury that the witnesses were lying, resulted in fundamental errors, which deprived him of his right to a fair trial. Similarly, Ramsey argues that the trial judge\u2019s pervasive questioning of witnesses reflected bias, and that the judge acted as a \u201csecond prosecutor\u201d by, among other things, eliciting favorable testimony for the prosecution and establishing the elements of the crime. In nearly every instance of alleged judicial misconduct, neither Diggs nor Ramsey objected. Although Diggs\u2019 and Ramsey\u2019s attorney only objected once to the pattern of judicial behavior, both argue, nevertheless, that it would have been futile or unprofessional to continuously object, and that we should reach their arguments in order to serve the ends of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The State conversely argues that Diggs and Ramsey did not object to the judge\u2019s questioning of witnesses and, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>failed to preserve various issues for review pursuant to Rule 8-131(a), which provides that we ordinarily will not address an issue unless \u201cit plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Alternatively, the State argues that even if we reach the issues raised, a trial judge has wide discretion to ask questions to clarify issues, and the judge\u2019s questions were legitimate efforts to sharpen issues and clarify points for the jury. The State argues, finally, that even if the judge erred, that we should find harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Before we reach the merits of the two cases at bar, however, we must address the preservation issue. Those issues to which Diggs and Ramsey objected were clearly preserved.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Diggs, </em>the defense counsel concededly objected only once after an exchange between the judge and Sherienne Diggs, during which the judge questioned her regarding the timing of her informing the police that the drugs and money belonged to her boyfriend rather than her brother: \u201cWhy did you wait two and a half years to come in here and tell this story now?\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Diggs\u2019 attorney objected anil stated it had not been two and a half years, to which the judge replied, \u201ca year and a half, a year and a half.\u201d Defense counsel then opined: \u201cJudge, you\u2019re testifying now\u201d and objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In <em>Ramsey, </em>the defense objected after the judge remarked to the jury that \u201cmost lawyers, good lawyers, talk to their witnesses.\u201d The judge did not rule on the objection, but opined to the jury about how it is \u201cperfectly appropriate for any lawyer to talk to any witness before they put them on the witness stand.... \u201d At the bench, Ramsey\u2019s counsel remonstrated that the judge\u2019s comment was \u201cessentially buttressing the credibility of the prosecutor\u201d and asked the judge to explain sequestration to the jury. The judge denied that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The State argues that our review must end at this juncture because the aforementioned questions and comments were subject to objection and that these, alone, would not constitute reversible error. The State contends that all other issues raised by Diggs and Ramsey regarding inappropriate comments by the judge were not preserved for review, because defense counsel did not object. In contrast, Diggs and Ramsey argue that it would have been futile or unprofessional to continuously object.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">In the past, when addressing the issue of judicial bias, we have inferred that unobjected to behavior can be reviewed by utilizing structural error review. <em>See Harris v. State, </em>406 Md. 115, 130, 956 A.2d 204, 213 (2008); <em>Redman v. State, </em>363 Md. 298, 303 n. 5, 768 A.2d 656, 659 n. 5 (2001) (\u201cIt is because structural error is impossible to quantify that it defies analysis by the harmless error standard.... [T]he Supreme Court has found an error to be structural and subject to automatic reversal in a very limited number of cases.... Such defects include ... a judge who is not impartial, <em>see Tumey v. Ohio, </em>273 U.S. 510, 47 S.Ct. 437, 71 L.Ed. 749 (1927).\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>have reviewed allegations of judicial bias without necessarily articulating our bases or requiring repeated objections; in <em>Jackson v. State, </em>364 Md. 192, 772 A.2d 273 (2001), despite the failure to object during sentencing to comments made by the judge, we reversed the conviction and held that the trial judge\u2019s comments exceeded the outer limit of a judge\u2019s broad discretion and amounted to impermissible sentencing criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">More frequently, however, we have invoked the \u201cplain error\u201d doctrine in support of our review of allegations of unobjected to judicial bias. Plain error is \u201cerror which vitally affects a defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial.\u201d <em>State v. Daughton, </em>321 Md. 206, 211, 582 A.2d 521, 523 (1990), citing <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. 198, 202, 411 A.2d 1035, 1037-38 (1980). We have recognized the boundaries of that error to which we apply our review as that which is \u201ccompelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental to assure the defendant a fair trial.\u201d <em>Abeokuto v.

We observed that the three warnings of contempt, a phone call to another judge in the presence of the witness, the threat of life imprisonment as a sanction for contempt, the threat that the other judge would impose the longest possible penalty for contempt, and the advice on how the witness could testify was \u201cexcessive and improper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352, 859 A.2d at 224. We held that, as a matter of Maryland nonconstitutional criminal procedure, the trial judge\u2019s \u201cimproper use of judicial authority\u201d through admonitions and partial conduct contributed to the defendant\u2019s convictions, thereby denying the defendant his due process right to a fair trial. <em>Id. </em>at 360, 859 A.2d at 229. In reaching our holding, we reviewed our jurisprudence and reiterated that, \u201c[i]t is well settled in Maryland that fundamental to a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial is an impartial and disinterested judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356, 859 A.2d at 227, citing <em>Jackson, </em>364 Md. at 206, 772 A.2d at 281, quoting <em>Jefferson-El v.

We noted that whenever a court \u201ctakes it upon itself to warn a witness or the defendant in a criminal case about the consequences of failing to testify truthfully ... [the court] is swimming in treacherous waters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211, 434 A.2d at 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">In another case similar to the present case, <em>Vandegrift v.

After reviewing all of the testimony, we presumed that the trial judge\u2019s disbelief influenced the jury, \u201cwhose function it was as the triers of the facts to determine the credibility of the witnesses,\u201d and determined that the trial judge\u2019s questions crossed a line and \u201ctaken as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>whole or even individually amounted to a manifestation of disbelief of the witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310, 206 A.2d at 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">These cases differ from the appropriate circumstances in which a judge may ask questions to clarify an answer or comment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <em>Marshall, </em>291 Md. at 213, 434 A.2d at 560, we emphasized that the judge is to maintain neutrality, manage his/her questioning of witnesses, and let the attorneys clarify issues through cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">In sum, while we agree with the court below that a judge presiding over a jury trial has the right to interrogate witnesses in an effort to clarify the issues, we stress that he should exercise this right sparingly. It is a far more prudent practice for the judge to allow counsel to clear up disputed points on cross-examination, unassisted by the court. In this manner, the judge is most likely to preserve his role as an impartial arbiter, because he avoids the appearance of acting as an advocate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">In the cases <em>sub </em>judice,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> however, the judge intervened with inappropriate questions and comments throughout the trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number> In <em>Diggs, </em>the judge rehabilitated the prosecutor\u2019s case by laying the foundation for the distribution charge during questioning of the lead detective, Detective Giganti; rehabilitated Detective Georgiades after he appeared confused; questioned Sherienne Diggs regarding the denominations of bills, where she put her keys, and the timing of her telling the police that the car and drugs belonged to her boyfriend rather than her brother; commented to Ms. Diggs, \u201cYou have a very good memory on everything else,\u201d and questioned her whether she was comfortable with her testimony, all of which bolstered the State\u2019s case while implying a disbelief in the defense and created the aura of partiality in front of the jury. Similarly, in <em>Ramsey, </em>the judge elicited key elements of the State\u2019s case from Officer Torbit including the timing and in-court identification of the defendant; established key aspects of the officer\u2019s testimony regarding the drugs; elicited testimony regarding the elements of intent to distribute after the prosecutor finished questioning the witness; made comments to the jurors to bolster the integrity of the prosecutor that \u201cmost lawyers, good lawyers, talk to their witnesses,\u201d and established the chain of custody of the drugs after the prosecutor failed to do so. In so doing, the judge acted as a co-prosecutor, and his behavior exceeded \u201cmere impatience\u201d and crossed the line of propriety, creating an atmosphere so fundamentally flawed as to prevent Diggs and Ramsey from obtaining fair and impartial trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Neither Diggs\u2019 nor Ramsey\u2019s counsel interjected objections regarding most instances of repeated and egregious behavior. On appeal, Diggs and Ramsey assert, however, that continuous objections would have been futile and unprofessional and would have created more hostility and tension.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>In <em>Johnson v. State, </em>352 Md. 374, 722 A.2d 873 (1999), defense counsel encountered similar judicial behavior and engaged in continuous objections, which provoked the ire of the judge. Negative interactions between the trial judge and defense counsel before the jury throughout the trial in the form of interruptions, insults, and other forms of inappropriate behavior provoking contempt citations, were determined to be inappropriate. We held that \u201c[ujnder the totality of the circumstances, the cumulation of these abrupt and arbitrary comments, unnecessary interrogations, premature rulings from the bench, and the arrest and citations of the defense attorney in the presence of the jury clearly violated petitioner\u2019s right to a fair trial\u201d; we were particularly concerned with defense counsel\u2019s arrest for contempt of court before the jury: this \u201cpainted defense counsel in such a negative light that it deprived petitioner of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 393-94, 722 A.2d at 880, 882. We construed the judge\u2019s behavior as biased and in reversing the conviction stated that judges, unlike other people, have \u201cthe sovereign power to punish, to deprive persons of their liberty and property, and that alone requires that they restrain their irritation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 722 A.2d at 880 (citations and quotations omitted). Therefore, repeated objections can lead to unprofessional conduct on the part of both judge and lawyer and exacerbate tension in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In recognizing that repeated objections in the present cases may have led to the same tense atmosphere, we would remonstrate that ordinarily the failure to object will only be countenanced in those instances in which the judge exhibits repeated and egregious behavior of partiality, reflective of bias. Failure to object in less pervasive situations may not have the same result, nor will we necessarily intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">We deem it crucial to note that prosecutors are responsible for developing their cases, and that defense counsel must object in order to seek correction by the judge and preserve the issue for appeal. Nevertheless, in the instant cases, the judge\u2019s egregious and repeated behavior reflecting partiality and bias during these trials denied Diggs and Ramsey their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>right to fair and impartial trials, to which a harmless error review is unavailing.

In <em>Diggs, </em>for example, the judge asked questions to clarify a response, which may have been unclear to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">[STATE'S ATTORNEY:] ... Were you alone or with any others?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiD\">[DETECTIVE GIGANTE] I was a single unit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJL\">[STATE'S ATTORNEY:] Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-10\">THE COURT: That means alone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-11\">[DETECTIVE GIGANTE] Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">The judge also proffered clarifying questions during Ramsey's trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A66\">[STATE'S ATTORNEY:] And how do you know that those are the narcotics you received on that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>[OFFICER TORBIT:] Because when I take them to ECU, there's a property number given to the---</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALD\">THE COURT: Wait a minute, officer.

Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIT\">THE COURT: What is ECU?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWQ\">[OFFICER TORBIT:] That's the evidence control unit....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b325-5\">MURPHY, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"As6\">Dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Dissenting Opinion by MURPHY, J.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">In my opinion, neither Mr. Diggs nor Mr. Ramsey is entitled to a new trial. From my review of the records, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that, \u201cthe judge\u2019s egregious and repeated behavior reflecting partiality and bias during these trials denied Diggs and Ramsey their right to fair and impartial trials[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\n<em>State v. Diggs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">In this case, the jurors were entitled to know whether Sherienne Diggs had ever provided an agent of the State with the information she provided during her direct examination. I would not grant a new trial on the ground that the Circuit Court asked questions that the prosecutor was clearly entitled to ask. In <em>United States v. Ostendorff, </em>371 F.2d 729 (4th Cir.1967), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-10\">[The trial judge] is not a bump on a log, nor even a referee at a prizefight. He has not only the right, but he has the duty to participate in the examination of witnesses when necessary to bring out matters that have been insufficiently developed by counsel. He is in charge of the trial and may exercise his control to assure that the jury is not mislead by unfair phrasing of questions by counsel. E.g., <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>333 U.S. 46, 54, 68 S.Ct. 391, 92 L.Ed. 468 (1948) [Frankfurter, J., dissenting]; <em>United States v. Godel, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>361 F.2d 21 (4th Cir.1966); <em>Simon v. United States, </em>123 F.2d 80 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 314 U.S. 694, 62 S.Ct. 412, 86 L.Ed. 555 (1941). \u201cA trial judge, who is after all \u2018the only disinterested lawyer connected with the proceeding\u2019, has the duty to help make clear to the jury the facts and circumstances pertinent to the case. \u2018He should not hesitate to ask questions for the purpose of developing the facts; and it is no ground of complaint that the facts so developed may hurt or help one side or the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Godel, supra, </em>361 F.2d at 24 [quoting from <em>Simon v. United States, supra, </em>123 F.2d at 83].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Moreover, the jurors who convicted Mr. Diggs received the following instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">... [A]ny comments that I make about the facts, if I do make any comments about the facts, are not binding upon you and are advisory only. It is your duty to decide the facts and apply the law as I give it to you to those facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">During the trial I may have commented on the evidence or I may comment now, or I may have asked a question of a witness. Do not draw any inference or conclusions from my comments or my questions, either as to the merits of the case or as to my views regarding the witness or my views about the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">In my opinion, the fact that the jury \u201chung\u201d on the \u201cpossession with intent to distribute\u201d charge reinforces the presumption that the jury followed those instructions. I would therefore affirm on the basis of this presumption even if the \u201cpartiality\u201d issue had been preserved for appellate review. I would also reject the argument that we should apply the \u201crepeated and egregious behavior\u201d exception to the rule \u201cthat defense counsel must object in order to seek correction by the judge and preserve the issue for appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">It is clear that Mr. Diggs\u2019 trial counsel did not object to the questions asked by the Circuit Court during (1) Detective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Giganti\u2019s testimony, or (2) Sherienne Diggs\u2019 direct examination. It is anything but clear, however, \u201cthat continuous objections would have been futile and unprofessional and created more hostility and tension.\u201d The record shows that, after an objection was finally interposed during Ms. Diggs\u2019 cross-examination, the Circuit Court did not ask any more questions of that witness. The record also shows that Ms. Diggs, who insisted that she be permitted to \u201cfinish\u201d her answers, was not intimidated in the least by the Circuit Court\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">I disagree with the conclusion that Mr. Diggs\u2019 trial counsel did not \u201cadequately represent\u201d her client. Whatever might be said about defense counsel, the record shows that she was not afraid to request appropriate relief on behalf of her client. In addition to engaging in a sharp exchange with the Circuit Court at the bench conference that occurred during Ms. Diggs\u2019 cross-examination, defense counsel made the following comments during closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">The judge in this particular case was unable to treat those people equally on the witness stand. In other words, when the officers were on the stand even the judge was like, oh, officer, you don\u2019t remember, that was so long ago. Very, you know, smoozey and polite to those particular witnesses, but when [Mr. Diggs and his sister] got on the stand it was .. . almost to the point of bullying. Those groups of people were treated differently and they weren\u2019t supposed to be. Why? Why did that happen? Well, he\u2019s a human being. Something in his past or the way he feels caused him to treat two different people differently. It\u2019s not supposed to be that way. Every person is supposed to be treated the same by the Court with the same dignity and respect. But it\u2019s a perfect example that even though we would like to believe that human beings don\u2019t let their hatred cause them to do wrong things, it does happen. It does happen and you saw it here during this trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">In overruling the prosecutor\u2019s objection to that argument, the Circuit Court exhibited exceptional restraint. I would affirm the judgment of conviction on the ground that defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>counsel\u2019s \u201cfailure to object [to the questions about which Mr. Diggs now complains] was [nothing] more than a matter of trial tactics, which [should] afford no ground for reversal.\u201d <em>Woodell v. State, </em>223 Md. 89, 97, 162 A.2d 468, 473 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\n<em>State v. Ramsey</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Mr. Ramsey, who testified during the suppression hearing but did not testify at trial, conceded at sentencing that he had indeed been in possession of the drugs seized by Officer Torbit, but told the Circuit Court that he was a \u201cuser\u201d who stole them from where they had been \u201cstashed\u201d by a \u201cseller.\u201d During the sentencing proceeding, it is clear that the Circuit Court treated Mr. Ramsey with respect, and expressed sympathy for Mr. Ramsey\u2019s addiction. The majority, however, agrees with Mr. Ramsey\u2019s argument \u201cthat he was denied a fair trial as a result of judicial bias that began during a pre-trial suppression hearing, continued during voir dire and examination of witnesses and culminated during the course of instructing the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Defense counsel\u2019s opening statement covers five pages of the trial transcript, two and one half pages of which were taken up by \u201cthe story of the Emperor\u2019s New Clothes.\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s closing argument covers six and one half pages, during which she argued that (1) Officer Torbit exhibited a \u201cconvenient memory,\u201d and (2) the Officer\u2019s testimony was not corroborated by any \u201cvideo footage\u201d from the police department\u2019s surveillance cameras that recorded activity at the locations where he claimed that he had observed Mr. Ramsey. At no point, however, did defense counsel argue that the State\u2019s evidence was consistent with the statement Mr. Ramsey made at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The record shows that the Circuit Court would not permit Officer Torbit to give nonresponsive answers to defense counsel\u2019s questions. For example, the following transpired during Officer Torbit\u2019s cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">Q. Okay. Then finally you say that Mr. Ramsey had the bag prior to stopping him in the 1800 block of Pennsylvania?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>A. Exact, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">Q, Okay. And there are also cameras in the 1800-block of Pennsylvania, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">A. Cameras don\u2019t cover everything. They just cover certain parts of the block\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">THE COURT: Officer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">THE COURT: . .. Just answer her question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">THE WITNESS: I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-10\">THE COURT: The question was I think are there cameras in the 18\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-11\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-12\">THE COURT: All right. And the answer is yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvG\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The 1800-block of Pennsylvania?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-13\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">Taking action to prohibit a State\u2019s witness from giving non-responsive answers during cross-examination is the antithesis of hostility toward the defendant or defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-15\">Rather than infer \u201chostility toward defense counsel\u201d from the Circuit Court\u2019s decision to impanel the jury before holding the suppression hearing, we should compliment the Circuit Court for its efficiency. The court\u2019s time is a valuable public commodity, and the only reasonable inference that can be drawn in this case is the inference that the Circuit Court wanted to have a jury ready to begin the trial at 9:30 a.m. on the following morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-16\">As to what occurred during jury selection, the Circuit Court did not \u201creseat\u201d the juror whose \u201cstriking\u201d the Circuit Court found to be \u201cracially biased.\u201d From my review of the record, that finding was not clearly erroneous, and the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in raising the <em>Batson </em>issue <em>sna sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Although Mr. Ramsey complains about what occurred during Officer Torbit\u2019s direct examination and Dr. Majid\u2019s redirect examination, the record shows that defense counsel did not object to any of the Court\u2019s questions. Defense counsel did, however, preserve for our review the issue of whether the Circuit Court erred or abused its discretion when it stated to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\">Ladies and gentlemen, most lawyers, good lawyers, talk to their witnesses.... Most lawyers talk to a witness before they put them on the stand.... It\u2019s perfectly appropriate for any lawyer to talk to any witness before they put them on the witness stand, and to review their testimony with them. It\u2019s absolutely appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">In <em>State v. Earp, </em>319 Md. 156, 571 A.2d 1227 (1990), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">Attorneys have not only the right but also the duty to fully investigate the case and to interview persons who may be witnesses. A prudent attorney will, whenever possible, meet with the witnesses he or she intends to call.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 170, 571 A.2d at 1234. In <em>United States v. Rhynes, </em>218 F.3d 310 (4th Cir.2000), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">Thorough preparation demands that an attorney interview and prepare witnesses before they testify. No competent lawyer would call a witness without appropriate and thorough pre-trial interviews and discussion. In fact, more than one lawyer has been punished, found ineffective, or even disbarred for incompetent representation that included failure to prepare or interview witnesses. <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>716 F.2d 576 (9th Cir.1983) (defense counsel ineffective for failing to interview witnesses); <em>McQueen v. Swenson, </em>498 F.2d 207 (8th Cir.1974) (same); <em>In re Warmington, </em>212 Wis.2d 657, 668, 568 N.W.2d 641 (Wis.1997) (lawyer disbarred for, among other things, \u201cfailing to supervise the preparation of an expert witness\u201d); <em>In re Wolfram, </em>174 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Ariz. 49, 847 P.2d 94, 96 (Ariz.1993) (failure to interview witnesses cited among reasons for suspending attorney).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">When the cross-examination of a witness insinuates that the witness\u2019 testimony was impermissibly influenced by the direct examiner, it is appropriate for the trial judge to instruct the jury about the lawyer\u2019s duty to meet with the witnesses who will be called to testify.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From my review of the record, I am persuaded that defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Officer Torbit \u201copened the door\u201d to this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">As to Mr. Ramsey\u2019s complaint about the \u201cadditional language\u201d in the Circuit Court\u2019s \u201ccredibility\u201d instruction, (1) everything added to MPJI Cr 3.10 is a correct statement of the law, and (2) on the basis of defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Officer Torbit, the decision to include the additional language did not constitute an unfairly prejudicial abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">For the reasons stated above, I would hold that Mr. Ramsey is not entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-9\">. <em>See, e.g. 7th Ctr PJI Modern Federal Jury Instructions\u2014Criminal \u00a7 1.07, </em>which recommends that, if there has been testimony regarding prior interviews, the jury be instructed: \"It is proper for an attorney to interview any witness in preparation for trial.\" This type of instruction has been \"interpreted to be an attempt to offset the ancient trick in which an attorney questions a witness as to his interview with opposing counsel, often stated in a way to imply to the witness and jurors that this is an impropriety.\u201d <em>People v.
