We conclude that such injuries are not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">On June 21,1979, the plaintiff, Michael Bushey, was employed by the defendant Iseli Company<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at its establishment on Greystone Road in Terryville. He was scheduled to work the 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. shift. The employees\u2019 parking lot was on the west side of Greystone Road across from the plant. At 4:30 p.m., while Bushey was driving to work on his motorcycle on Greystone Road, he skidded, lost control and thereafter continued to skid approximately one hundred and eighty feet into the employees\u2019 parking lot where he struck another employee\u2019s parked vehicle, suffering the injuries involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">The workers\u2019 compensation commissioner found in favor of the employer, concluding that \u201cthis accidental loss of control did not arise out of or in the course of his employment, nor did the injury resulting therefrom.\u201d The plaintiff appealed to the compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>review division, which affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision. The plaintiff appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the decision of the review division.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s argument is that, although the motorcycle began to skid on the public road, it came to rest in the parking lot and his injuries occurred therein. Thus, he asserts, his injuries occurred on his employer\u2019s premises and are compensable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude, however, that Bushey did not satisfy the test enunciated in <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>176 Conn. 547, 556, 398 A.2d 1161 (1979), which states that \u201c[i]n order to be compensable, an injury must (1) arise out of the employment; and (2) occur in the course of the employment. To occur in the course of the employment, the injury must take place (a) within the period of the employment, (b) at a place where the employee may reasonably be, and (c) while the employee is reasonably fulfilling the duties of the employment or doing something incidental to it.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">While a parking lot maintained for the convenience of employees is an extension of the employment premises; <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>American Brass Co., </em>141 Conn. 231, 234-35, 104 A.2d 896 (1954); this accident occurred on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>a public road which is neither part of the employer\u2019s premises nor a reasonable extension thereof within sub-part (b) of part (2) of the test in <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>supra. Further, Bushey was not fulfilling the duties of his employment or doing anything incidental to them within sub-part (c) of that test.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">An \u201caccidental injury\u201d is defined by General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (8) as an injury \u201cwhich may be definitely located as to the time when <em>and the place where the accident occurred </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) That Bushey eventually came to rest against a car in the parking lot is not relevant in view of the unchallenged finding of the commissioner, as affirmed by the review division,* **<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the accident occurred on the highway.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The decision of the review division can be sustained on the above ground alone. The plaintiff, however, insists that we make an exception to the employer premises rule by adopting the rule enunciated in a New York case, <em>Husted </em>v. <em>Seneca Steel Service, Inc., </em>41 N.Y.2d 140, 359 N.E.2d 673, 391 N.Y.S.2d 78 (1976). There the employee was required to make a left turn into the employee parking lot. While making the turn, he was struck by an oncoming car and was propelled into the lot where he struck another car. The court upheld the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>that the employee\u2019s injuries were compensable, pointing out that \u201c[tjhis turn was made to effect an entry upon employer\u2019s premises for work purposes and was thus an incident of the employment.\u201d Id., 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">We do not reach the question of whether a case similar to <em>Husted </em>would entitle an employee to benefits in this state. It may be plausibly argued that when the claimant, as in <em>Husted, </em>was required to make a left turn into the employer\u2019s parking lot and was struck by another car, this was a risk incident to the employment, which justified a narrowly drawn exception to the employer\u2019s premises rule and an award of workers\u2019 compensation. That, however, is a far cry from the facts of this case. It defies both logic and common sense to conclude that the out-of-control skid involved here can reasonably be considered a risk incident to the employment. It was <em>necessary </em>for the claimant in <em>Husted </em>to make the particular turn on the highway in order to enter the employee parking lot. By no stretch of the imagination was it necessary for Bushey to make the spectacular entrance on to the company\u2019s property that he did. We decline to stretch so unreasonably the concept of risk incident to the employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-10\"> Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, the employer\u2019s insurer, is the other defendant in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\"> This appeal was originally filed in the Appellate Session of the Superior Court. General Statutes \u00a7 51-197a (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\"> It should be noted that counsel conceded, at oral argument, that this is not a \u201cgoing and coming\u201d case. Rather, it is a case where the plaintiff claims to have been injured on the employer\u2019s premises. See <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>176 Conn. 547, 553, 398 A.2d 1161 (1979). Thus, Bushey\u2019s reliance upon three Connecticut cases; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>M. A. Gammino Construction Co., </em>127 Conn. 528, 18 A.2d 400 (1941); <em>Stakonis </em>v. <em>United Advertising Corporation, </em>110 Conn. 384, 148 A. 334 (1930); <em>and McDonald </em>v. <em>Gulf Refining Co., </em>98 Conn. 286, 119 A. 222 (1922); is misplaced since all of those cases involved injuries occuring off of the employee\u2019s premises but in the course of the employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b388-9\"> The review division\u2019s decision concerned itself, primarily, with the \u201cin the course of the employment\u201d aspect of this test. Our decision affirming the review division\u2019s decision on that aspect of the test necessarily results in the same conclusion as to the review division\u2019s similar decision that the \u201cout of the employment\u201d aspect of the test was not met.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b389-7\"> In fact, the review division went further than the commission by finding that \u201c[t]he June 21,1979 accidental injury ... did not occur on the employment premises and is not an injury arising out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b389-11\"> Even if this finding were challenged by the plaintiff, this court\u2019s limited review would prevent our consideration of that challenge. General Statutes \u00a7 31-301b provides: \u201cAny party aggrieved by the decision of the compensation review division upon any question or questions <em>of law </em>arising in the proceedings may appeal the decision of the compensation review division to the appellate court.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cSo far as it discloses facts, [the commissioner\u2019s] finding cannot be changed unless the record discloses that the finding includes facts found without evidence or fails to include material facts which are admitted or undisputed.\u201d <em>Wheat </em>v. <em>Red Star Express Lines, </em>156 Conn. 245, 248, 240 A.2d 859 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
