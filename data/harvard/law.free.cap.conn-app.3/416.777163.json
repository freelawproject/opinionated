In the decision of February 9,1982, the DPUC named the plaintiff and the division of consumer counsel<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (DCC) as parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">In appealing from the DPUC\u2019s final decision, the plaintiff served copies of its complaint upon the company and the DPUC within thirty days after the mailing of the notice of that decision, as required by General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 4-183 (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff did not cite in or serve a copy of its complaint upon the DCC. Both the company and the DPUC moved to dismiss the appeal because the DCC had not been served. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>The plaintiff thereafter amended its complaint to cite in the DCC and served a copy of the complaint on the DCC on August 17,1983, ninety-one days after the supplemental DPUC decision was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The company renewed its motion to dismiss, alleging that the plaintiff failed to comply with \u00a7 4-183 (b) because it did not serve the DCC within the thirty day period set forth in that statute. The trial court found that the appeal was fatally defective because it did not comply with the service provisions of \u00a7 4-183 (b) and granted the motion to dismiss. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The plaintiff argues that the DCC\u2019s status as a party was not clearly apparent on the face of the trial court record. It contends that in the absence of affidavits setting forth facts outside of the record, the court improperly dismissed the action. The \u201crecord\u201d which was before the trial court when the motion to dismiss was argued consisted of each paper filed with the clerk of the Superior Court. Practice Book \u00a7 250. The DPUC\u2019s decision of February 9,1982, which designated the DCC as a party, was annexed to the memoranda of law accompanying the original motions to dismiss filed by the company and the DPUC. The decision naming the DCC as a party was thus before the trial court and consequently a part of the record. See <em>In re Application of Dodd, </em>131 Conn. 702, 703, 42 A.2d 36 (1945); Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 314. No facts outside of the record needed to be set forth by affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The plaintiff also claims that because the DPUC\u2019s supplemental decision of May 19,1982, made no reference to the DCC, the DCC did not have party status. As we have noted, the May 19, 1982 decision served the purpose of setting forth the DPUC\u2019s findings as to a revised schedule of rates submitted by the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>pany. The supplemental decision did not upset the DPUC\u2019s original denomination of the DCC as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The plaintiff additionally argues that because the DCC is neither an adverse nor a necessary party, it did not need to be cited as a party. Section 4-183 (b) requires that \u201call parties of record\u201d be served with a copy of the petition. Section 4-166 (5) defines \u201cparty\u201d as \u201ceach person or agency named or admitted as a party, or properly seeking and entitled as of right to be admitted as a party.\u201d Nothing in that definition supports the argument that a \u201cparty\u201d must be either necessary or have an interest which is adverse to others who could be parties to the appeal. Since the DCC was a party to the administrative proceedings, it was a party of record within the scope of \u00a7 4-183 (b) and should have been cited as a party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The right to appeal from the decision of an administrative agency exists only under statutory authority. This right may be taken advantage of only by strict compliance with the statutory provisions by which it is created. <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>177 Conn. 584, 587, 418 A.2d 939 (1979). \u201cThe failure to include a party defendant in the citation is not a defect curable by amendment and renders the appeal subject to dismissal for want of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 712, 717, 461 A.2d 997 (1983); see <em>Daniels v. New Haven Police Department, </em>3 Conn. App. 97, 485 A.2d 579 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-8\"> This appeal, originally filed in the Supreme Court, was transferred to the Appellate Session of the Superior Court, and was thereafter transferred to this court.
