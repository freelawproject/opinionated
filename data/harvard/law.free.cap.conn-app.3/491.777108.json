The plaintiffs brought an action to quiet title to a parcel of land in the town of Cromwell. The defendants counterclaimed, claiming title by adverse possession as to a portion of the parcel. The trial court quieted title in the plaintiffs except as to a portion of the parcel which the court found belonged to the defendants by way of adverse possession. In its memorandum of decision dated January 13, 1982, the trial court stated: \u201c[T]he court concludes that the land in dispute claimed by the plaintiffs is that included in the lines delineated in red and drawn by the Court on [the] map, Exhibit Z. This constitutes approximately eight acres.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">A judgment file was prepared and signed by the clerk. Although it mentioned the red line, it did not refer to \u201capproximately eight acres.\u201d No appeal from this judgment was taken by either party. In the summer of 1982, the parties jointly hired a surveyor to establish formal boundary lines in accordance with the trial court\u2019s decision. The surveyor informed the parties that he could not complete his task as ordered because the memorandum of decision described the parcel as consisting of \u201capproximately eight acres\u201d while the parcel designated by the trial court\u2019s diagram on the plaintiffs\u2019 exhibit Z consisted of only five acres. Upon learning of this supposed discrepancy, the defendants on September 23,1983, filed a motion to correct clerical error in judgment. The thrust of the defendants\u2019 argument in support of their motion was that, on the basis of the pleadings and the evidence, the trial court made a mistake in drawing the line on exhibit Z, which only encom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>passed five acres, and should correct itself and redraw the line to give title to the defendants to a larger portion of the disputed land. The trial court denied the motion and the defendants appeal therefrom, claiming an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In a decision dated October 24,1983, the court stated that it had based its original decision on the \u201cuse of a given piece of land <em>within </em>the disputed area.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In addition, the court stated: \u201cThis motion claimed to be a motion to correct a clerical error and required in reality a complete retrial of the case.\u201d It is clear that the trial court intentionally located the line \u201cwithin\u201d the disputed area and did not intend otherwise. It was the intention of the court to have the red line control the area in question rather than the phrase \u201capproximately eight acres\u201d contained in the memorandum of decision. The word \u201cthis\u201d in the language previously quoted from the original decision could refer either to the land in dispute which consisted of eight acres or to the line drawn by the court on the map. The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision denying the defendants\u2019 motion to correct establishes that it intended \u201cthis\u201d to refer to the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">A clerical error is a mistake or omission in a judgment which is not the result of the judicial function. Such a claimed error does not challenge the court\u2019s ability to reach the conclusion that it did reach, but involves the failure to preserve or correctly represent in the record the actual decision of the court. 46 Am. Jur. 2d, Judgments \u00a7 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In the present case, the judgment reflects the decision of the trial court. This is manifested by the trial court's memorandum of decision dated October 24, 1983. No valid claim can be made that there was an error in recordation of the actual decision of the court. Therefore, even though the defendants have sought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>characterize the alleged error as \u201cclerical,\u201d the thrust of the defendants\u2019 argument is that the trial court could not have reached the conclusion that it did reach on the basis of the pleadings and record. Therefore, the claimed error is one of substance and thus should have been raised by an appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
