Todd, operated a dog kennel business on her property in Beacon Falls. Her home was on the same parcel of land, approximately two hundred feet from the kennel. It was her custom to hire a part-time summer employee to work approximately twenty hours or less per week in the kennel.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">In June of 1975, the defendant George Linardos, an insurance agent employed by the defendants Gerald Malafronte and Thomas Keegan,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when discussing with the plaintiff her insurance needs, advised her that she did not need to purchase workers\u2019 compensation insurance for her part-time summer employee and sold her other insurance. Prior to the plaintiff\u2019s renewal of that insurance in 1976 and 1977, the defendant Karen Voos, another insurance agent employed by Malafronte and Keegan, also represented to the plaintiff that workers\u2019 compensation insurance was not necessary. In 1977, a part-time summer employee was injured on the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>tiff\u2019s property and filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim. The claim was ultimately settled by stipulation under which the plaintiff paid the employee $2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The plaintiff instituted the present suit to recover that amount as well as $3000 in attorney\u2019s fees which she incurred in defending the claim. The complaint alleges that the representations by the defendants that the plaintiff did not need workers\u2019 compensation insurance were inaccurate and false, and that, in reliance on those representations, the plaintiff did not purchase workers\u2019 compensation coverage. Although the complaint sounds in misrepresentation, the case was tried and decided on the theory of negligence. We therefore review this case on the basis on which it was tried and decided. See <em>Beckenstein </em>v. <em>Potter &amp; Carrier, Inc., </em>191 Conn. 120, 132, 464 A.2d 6 (1983); <em>Hallmark of Farmington </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>1 Conn. App. 278, 280, 471 A.2d 651 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">After a jury trial, a general verdict was returned in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $5318. Thereafter, the trial court denied the defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the verdict. This appeal followed. The defendants claim (1) that the trial court erred in failing to set aside the verdict because neither a standard of care nor a breach of that standard of care were proved by the defendants, (2) that the trial court erred in refusing to set aside the verdict because the plaintiff did not require workers\u2019 compensation coverage, and (3) that the trial court erred in excluding evidence concerning the plaintiff\u2019s recovery under a commercial liability policy for the same loss.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The defendants initially argue that the trial court erred in sustaining the verdict in the absence of expert testimony to establish the existence of a standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>care which applied to them. They contend that, as insurance agents, their conduct must conform to a professional standard. Relying on the fact that insurance agents receive extensive training and must pass a state licensing examination, they argue that questions of professional competence were raised and that expert testimony was necessary to establish the proper standard of care against which to measure their actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">A conclusion of negligence is ordinarily one of mixed law and fact, involving the determination of the standard of care required and its application to the facts of the particular case. <em>Marley </em>v. <em>New England Transportation Co., </em>133 Conn. 586, 591, 53 A.2d 296 (1947). \u201cIn the ordinary action for negligence the jury can apply, unaided by experts, the standard of care of the reasonably prudent person under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Levett </em>v. <em>Etkind, </em>158 Conn. 567, 573, 265 A.2d 70 (1969). This standard does not apply to an action where laymen cannot be expected to know the requirements of proper care in the usual case. Id., 573-74.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Insofar as the sale of insurance requires specialized knowledge, we agree that this case differs from the ordinary negligence action since matters within that specialized body of knowledge are crucial to the determination of the issues raised. Our review of the testimony adduced at trial, however, leads us to conclude that the requirements of proper care applicable to insurance agents were adequately established for the guidance of the jury. The transcript reveals that the defendant Linardos testified that it is the responsibility of the insurance agent to make sure of the fact that the potential insured has the proper coverage. This testimony, while sparse, was sufficient to amount to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>opinion by one with special knowledge of the sale of insurance on the standard of care to which an insurance agent is held. See <em>Nielson </em>v. <em>D\u2019Angelo, </em>1 Conn. App. 239, 246, 471 A.2d 965 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">While the requirements of proper care in a case such as this are a matter of specialized knowledge, the determination of the facts concerning the conduct under consideration is, as always, for the jury. See <em>Levett </em>v. <em>Etkind, </em>supra, 575; <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Pantaleo, </em>143 Conn. 290, 295, 122 A.2d 21 (1956). Here, the plaintiffs evidence was not so lacking in testimony on the standards applicable to insurance sales as to defeat her recovery. See <em>Slimak </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>106 Conn. 366, 370, 138 A. 153 (1927). Linardos himself provided evidence sufficient to support a verdict. <em>Puro </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>188 Conn. 301, 308, 449 A.2d 176 (1982); <em>Console </em>v. <em>Nickou, </em>156 Conn. 268, 274, 240 A.2d 895 (1968); <em>Slimak </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">To address the defendants\u2019 next argument that no evidence was presented to show that they breached this standard of care, we must also consider their claim that the plaintiff did not require workers\u2019 compensation coverage. The defendants contend that no coverage was necessary because the plaintiff\u2019s part-time worker was not an employee as that term is defined in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. General Statutes \u00a7 31-275. That statute provides in part: \u201c(5) \u2018Employee\u2019 means any person who has entered into or works under any contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer . . . but said term shall not be construed to include . . . (D) any person engaged in any type of service in or about a private dwelling provided he is not regularly employed by the owner or occupier over twenty-six hours per week . . . .\u201d The defendants argue that the plaintiffs employee, who worked twenty hours or less per week, came within the exception set forth in subsection (5) (D) of General Statutes \u00a7 31-275. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The fact that the plaintiff operated a commercial dog kennel on her property was not in dispute. It was established that, while the business was located on the same property as the plaintiffs home, the business and the dwelling were separated by at least two hundred feet, that the plaintiff purchased homeowners' insurance for the house and a separate policy of liability insurance for the dog kennels, that the part-time employee\u2019s duties consisted of cleaning the kennels, grooming the animals and answering the telephone, and that the part-time employee was paid by checks from the business, rather than by the plaintiff\u2019s personal checks. The defendants furthermore admitted in their answer that the plaintiff hired part-time summer employees to clean the kennels.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u201cIn the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). \u201cWhere the language used by the legislature is plain and unambiguous, there is no room for construction by the courts and the statute will be applied as its words direct.\u201d <em>Muha </em>v. <em>United Oil Co., </em>180 Conn. 720, 730, 433 A.2d 1009 (1980), quoted in <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Leslie-Elliott Constructors, Inc., </em>194 Conn. 129, 135, 479 A.2d 231 (1984). We conclude that the individual whom the plaintiff employed to clean the kennels, groom the animals and answer the telephone had not been engaged to work \u201cin or about a private dwelling\u201d as required by subsection (5) (D) and thus fell within the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 31-275. The clear mandate of General Statutes \u00a7 31-284, which requires that employers secure workers\u2019 compensation for their employees,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Linardos\u2019 testimony that it is the agent\u2019s responsibility to make sure that the potential insured has proper coverage constituted sufficient evidence to show that the defendants breached the standard of care to which they were held. There was no need for a specific expression of opinion that the conduct of the defendants was negligent. See <em>Slimak </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The care which an insurance <em>broker </em>must exercise in ensuring that the buyer has proper coverage was described in <em>Ursini </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>118 Conn. 554, 173 A. 789 (1934), as the \u201cexercise [of] <em>reasonable </em>skill, care, and diligence in effecting the insurance, and any negligence or other breach of duty on [the insurance broker\u2019s] part which defeats the insurance which he undertakes to secure will render him liable to his principal for the resulting loss. . . . Where he undertakes to procure a policy affording protection against a designated risk, the law imposes upon him an obligation to perform with <em>reasonable </em>care the duty he has assumed, and he may be held liable for loss properly attributable to his default.\u201d Id., 559. (Citation omitted. Emphasis added.) We believe that this standard applies as well to insurance agents.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>\u201cOur review of a trial court\u2019s refusal to set aside a jury verdict is limited. Tf, on the evidence, the jury could reasonably have decided as they did, we will not find error in the trial court\u2019s acceptance of the verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Frankovitch </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>185 Conn. 14, 15, 440 A.2d 254 (1981). Applying the principle that the evidence must be given the most favorable construction to which it is reasonably entitled in support of the verdict; <em>Herb </em>v. <em>Kerr, </em>190 Conn. 136, 140, 459 A.2d 521 (1983); we find that the court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The defendants\u2019 final claim of error is that the court improperly excluded testimony that the plaintiff received payment in connection with the incident under a commercial liability policy covering her business. We see no merit in this attack on the collateral source rule, \u201cwhich provides that benefits received by a plaintiff from a source wholly collateral to and independent of the tortfeasor will not diminish the damages otherwise recoverable. 22 Am. Jur. 2d, Damages, \u00a7 206.\u201d <em>Gorham </em>v. <em>Farmington Motor Inn, Inc., </em>159 Conn. 576, 579, 271 A.2d 94 (1970); see also <em>Apuzzo </em>v. <em>Seneco, </em>178 Conn. 230, 233, 423, A.2d 866 (1979); <em>Healy </em>v. <em>White, </em>173 Conn. 438, 448, 378 A.2d 540 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b33-9\"> The defendants Malafronte and Keegan comprised a partnership doing business as New Haven County Real Estate and Insurance Company and Fairfield County Real Estate and Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">The defendant Gerald Malafronte was substituted for Geraldine Malafronte.
