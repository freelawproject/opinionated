The particular facts found by the trial court, that the defendant was a high school gradu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>ate and a construction worker, were not crucial to the judgment. The court based its financial awards upon the defendant\u2019s net earnings, regardless of his occupation or education. A review of the record makes it clear that the monetary award to the plaintiff and the assignment of property to her were neither arbitrary nor an abuse of discretion. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>191 Conn. 46, 57, 463 A.2d 578 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
