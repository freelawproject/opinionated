The case stems from a conveyance by warranty deed of a hotel and its grounds in Maine. The issue on appeal revolves around a Maine statute, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., tit. 14, \u00a7 151,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which the Maine courts themselves have not construed. It would be of no practical use to describe the facts of the case more fully, or to explicate this Maine statute without guidance from the Maine courts. Suffice it to say that we find error because the trial court impermissibly shifted the burden of proving the affirmative defense embodied in \u00a7 151 from the defendants to the plaintiffs. See Me. R. Civ. P., rule 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The basis of the court\u2019s decision was that a defect found in the title to the property<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> rendered the title unmarketable; 8A Thompson, Real Property (1963 <em>&amp; </em>Sup. 1981) \u00a7 4484; 77 Am. Jur. 2d, Vendor and Purchaser \u00a7 131; 92 C.J.S., Vendor and Purchaser \u00a7\u00a7 191, 195; and breached the covenant in the deed warranting a good and marketable title. 8A Thompson, Real Property \u00a7 4487; 92 C.J.S., Vendor and Purchaser \u00a7 575. This breach of warranty constituted a failure of consideration. 11 Am. Jur. 2d, Bills and Notes \u00a7 248; see <em>Judkins </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>121 Me. 230, 232, 116 A.2d 582 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">The court, however, impermissibly shifted the burden of proving whether this was a partial or total failure of consideration from the defendants to the plaintiffs, once it determined there was a failure of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>sideration. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., tit. 14, \u00a7 151; Me. R. Civ. P., rule 8; see <em>Getchell </em>v. <em>Kirkby, </em>113 Me. 91, 92 A. 1007 (1915). Our review of the evidence indicates that there was not a total failure of consideration, which occurs when \u201cnothing valuable passes by the . . . conveyance.\u201d <em>Jenness </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>24 Me. 289, 296 (1844). Rather, the undisputed facts show something of value was conveyed: The hotel was used to accommodate a convention for a month; the defendants lived on the property for a period of time; and the property was the subject of an $80,000 purchase money mortgage which was prior in right to the plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The burden rested on the defendants to prove the reduction in value or damages sustained due to the defect. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., tit. 14, \u00a7 151; Me. R. Civ. P., rule 8; see <em>Getchell </em>v. <em>Kirkby, </em>supra; 8A Thompson, Real Property \u00a7 4487; 92 C.J.S., Vendor and Purchaser \u00a7\u00a7 264, 575. Such a showing could offset what was owed on the note but, without a showing that the depreciation or damages equaled the total amount of the note, the defendants could not properly be excused from their liability on the note.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A new trial is required to determine the amount of depreciation or damages sustained by the defendants due to the defect in the title and to ascertain the extent of their liability. <em>Getchell </em>v. <em>Kirkby, </em>supra; see 8A Thompson, Real Property \u00a7 4487; 11 Am. Jur. 2d, Bills and Notes \u00a7 658; 92 C.J.S., Vendor and Purchaser \u00a7 575; see also <em>Hathorn </em>v. <em>Wheelwright, </em>99 Me. 351, 59 A. 517 (1904); <em>Crummett </em>v. <em>Littlefield, </em>98 Me. 317, 56 A. 1053 (1903).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-9\"> This appeal, originally filed in the Supreme Court, was transferred to this court.
