The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit, signed by David Houle, vice president and controller of the Hebrew Home, merely stated an unitemized total amount due.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Although we would not normally condone an unitemized bill where the need to prove the claimant\u2019s damages would require supporting facts, the defendant did not object, either in the trial court or on appeal, to the skeletal nature of the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">If the defendant was unable to oppose the motion for summary judgment because of a lack of knowledge of the composition of the total bill, he should have filed an affidavit to that effect pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 382.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At that time, the court would have taken the appropriate action required under the circumstances. We deem, therefore, that the defendant waived any objection to any deficiencies in the form of the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>The defendant\u2019s own affidavit did not comply with Practice Book \u00a7 381.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s affidavit, therefore, did not raise a genuine issue of material fact. Thus, summary judgment was appropriate. Practice Book \u00a7 384; <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Hartford Hospital, </em>192 Conn. 451, 455, 472 A.2d 1257 (1984); <em>Batick </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>186 Conn. 632, 647, 443 A.2d 471 (1982); <em>United Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Urban Redevelopment Commission, </em>158 Conn. 364, 372, 260 A.2d 596 (1969); <em>DiUlio </em>v. <em>Goulet, </em>2 Conn. App. 701, 703, 483 A.2d 1099 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-8\"> Although this action was originally brought against both Joseph Neiman and Walter Neiman, the latter has been dropped as a party and is not involved in this appeal. We therefore refer to Joseph Neiman as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b68-9\"> The appeal was originally filed in the Appellate Session of the Superior Court. Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June, 1983, No. 83-29, \u00a7 3 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b68-10\"> Practice Book \u00a7 382 reads as follows: \u201cShould it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that he cannot, for reasons stated, present facts essential to justify his opposition, the court may deny the motion for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b69-14\"> Practice Book \u00a7 381 requires supporting and opposing affidavits to include \u201csuch facts as would be admissible in evidence.\u201d The defendant\u2019s affidavit stated only that \u201cthis guaranty was not intended to be a blank check; it was intended to cover actual and necessary care given to Anna Neiman. . . . This file will show that an Offer of Judgment in the amount of five thousand (5,000) dollars was made by the undersigned. Said offer .... is deemed to be the amount actually due.\u201d Such a conclusory statement cannot be said to include admissible evidentiary facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
