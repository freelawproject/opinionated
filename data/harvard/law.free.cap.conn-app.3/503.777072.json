In applying this test, the evidence presented at trial is to be given a construction most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict. Id.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>3 Conn. App. 359, 488 A.2d 837 (1985).

If there is any way that the jury might have reconciled the conflicting testimony presented to them, we will not disturb their verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>193 Conn. 457, 473, 479 A.2d 199 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">We have examined the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict and conclude that there is no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
