In the discretion of the trial court, pleadings may be amended before, during and after trial to conform to the proof. Only upon a clear showing of abuse of discretion will the trial court\u2019s ruling in that regard be disturbed. <em>Wilburn </em>v. <em>Mount Sinai Medical Center, </em>3 Conn. App. 284, 287, 487 A.2d 568 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-13\">As to the remaining claims of error raised by the defendants, we once again find ourselves confronted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>with an attack on the trial court\u2019s conclusions of fact. Notwithstanding the terms in which these claims have been couched, it is apparent that the defendants would like us to retry this case. So well established is the principle that we will not overturn the factual findings of the trial court that we do not find it necessary to cite any cases in support of that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-14\"> This appeal, originally filed in the Supreme Court, was transferred to this court.
