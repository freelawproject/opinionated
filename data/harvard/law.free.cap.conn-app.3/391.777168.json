They also had alleged that Menghi violated General Statutes \u00a7 14-243 (a), which prohibits moving a vehicle from a parked position until such movement can be made in reasonable safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">During the trial, the plaintiffs offered, as an admission, a written statement that Menghi had given to the investigating police officer. The statement indicated that she was indeed rolling at the time of the accident. The court sustained the defendants\u2019 objection to the admission of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>The court erred in failing to admit into evidence, as an admission of a party-opponent, Menghi\u2019s statement to the investigating police officer. <em>Bonner </em>v. <em>Winter, </em>175 Conn. 41, 44, 392 A.2d 436 (1978); Holden &amp; Daly, Connecticut Evidence (1966 &amp; Sup. 1983) \u00a7 101. \u201cThis admission had a direct and vital bearing on the decisive issue in the case.\u201d <em>Bonner </em>v. <em>Winter, </em>supra, 44-45. Therefore, the court\u2019s erroneous ruling was harmful and the plaintiffs are entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-14\"> The owner of the car, Mary Epolito, is a defendant as well as Natalie Menghi, the named defendant, who was the operator.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
