The plaintiff claims three grounds for appeal: (1) That the court erred in denying the plaintiff\u2019s claim for foreclosure on the defendant\u2019s property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>because of a failure of consideration; (2) that the court erred in admitting parol evidence to find that there had been an agreement between the parties that a demand note could be paid according to a periodic payment schedule; and (3) that the relief ordered by the court was inequitable and excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">On November 1,1978, Florence Bowers executed a demand note for $50,000 in favor of the plaintiff. Bowers then reduced the sum due to $40,000 and, on April 23, 1980, she executed a replacement demand note for the reduced amount. This renewal note was secured by a mortgage on her property. Approximately eight days later, the plaintiff demanded full payment of the note and, in September, 1980, instituted this action for foreclosure of its mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The plaintiff alleged that the demand was made because it had discovered that its mortgage was the third on the property rather than the second as it had been led to believe. Bowers responded that no such misrepresentation had been made but that, in fact, the demand was made to bring pressure to bear on her husband in unrelated business dealings he had with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The trial court found that the plaintiff had initiated the note renewal negotiations, that it had no security for its original note and that the mortgage it took in connection with the renewal was accepted without any title search on its part. The court further found that there was no misrepresentation by Bowers and that, \u201cas part of the complete transaction, the parties also agreed that the plaintiff would not make demand for payment as permitted by the note so long as the defendant complied with the plaintiff\u2019s repayment schedule.\u201d That schedule was never prepared as the bank made demand almost immediately. Thus, the court held that \u201cthere was a failure of consideration on the part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>plaintiff as to the complete transaction, and that the plaintiff has not proved a legal basis for its complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">With regard to the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, the court ruled \u201cupon the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, the judgment of the court is that defendant\u2019s mortgage to the plaintiff is hereby cancelled and declared to be null and void.\u201d The plaintiff filed its appeal from the judgment of the trial court for the defendant on both the complaint and the counterclaim, raising the three issues referred to above.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">We note at the outset that the plaintiff\u2019s second claim of error, relating to the court\u2019s admission of parol evidence, is not properly before this court. Practice Book \u00a7 3060F (c) (3) requires that where error is claimed in a ruling such as is involved here, \u201cthe brief shall include, where appropriate: the pertinent motion or pleading, if it does not appear in the printed record; the question or offer of exhibit; the objection and the ground on which it was based; the ground on which the evidence was claimed to be admissible; the answer, if any; the ruling; and any exception.\u201d Nowhere in the plaintiff\u2019s brief is this rule complied with. In fact, the brief does not even assert that any objection was made to the introduction of parol evidence and a review of the transcript demonstrates that no such objection was made. We, therefore, decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">As to the first of the plaintiff\u2019s remaining claims of error, that the court erred in finding a \u201cfailure of consideration,\u201d we conclude that the decision was, more accurately, that the plaintiff did not fulfill its side of the agreement. The court stated that \u201c[t]he plaintiff failed to carry out its part of this agreement\u201d and immediately thereafter found \u201ca failure of consideration on the part of the plaintiff . . . .\u201d Although the parties\u2019 briefs treat the court\u2019s decision as meaning that there was a <em>lack </em>of consideration, \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>inappropriate choice of words does not amount to reversible error.\u201d <em>Coe-Park Donuts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Robertshaw Controls Co., </em>1 Conn. App. 84, 88, 468 A.2d 292 (1983). We construe the court\u2019s language to mean simply that the plaintiff failed to provide its promised consideration for the note and mortgage provided by Bowers. That consideration was to provide a repayment schedule and to refrain from making full demand as long as that schedule was followed by Bowers.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Having concluded that the plaintiff failed to fulfill its part of the agreement, the trial court was within its discretion in not granting foreclosure of the mortgage for the defendant\u2019s failure to pay the balance of the note on demand. <em>Hamm </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>180 Conn. 491, 497, 429 A.2d 946 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s final claim of error is that the court\u2019s judgment cancelling the mortgage was \u201cinequitable and/or excessive.\u201d This claim appears to be based on the mistaken assumption that the trial court \u201cvoidfed] the Renewal Note and mortgage on the erroneous ground of failure of consideration.\u201d This is not an accurate assessment of what the court did. The memorandum of decision clearly states that \u201cupon the <em>defendants\u2019 counterclaim, </em>the judgment of the court is that the defendant\u2019s mortgage to the plaintiff is hereby cancelled and declared to be null and void.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Since the plaintiff did not live up to its end of the bargain, it was not unreasonable for the trial court to cancel the mortgage. Although in the present case the trial court\u2019s award was unusual, it cannot be said that it was an abuse of discretion. We, therefore, conclude that the court did not err in its award on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">There was no dispute, however, as to the validity of the note in the principal amount of $40,000 due by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>defendant thereunder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, the court erred in failing to render judgment for the plaintiff on the note in that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">There is error in part; the judgment on the plaintiffs complaint is set aside and the case is remanded to the trial court with directions to render judgment for the plaintiff as to the principal amount due on the note and for further proceedings as to any interest and costs, including attorney\u2019s fees, also due thereupon.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-11\"> Aside from Florence Bowers, several other parties were originally named as defendants to this action, including Florence Bowers\u2019 husband. He, however, was discharged from this debt in bankruptcy proceedings and the remaining defendants either admitted having no defense or were merely garnishees. Hence, only Florence Bowers is defending this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b673-12\"> The defendant\u2019s counterclaim was amended, with the permission of the court, subsequent to the trial so as to conform to the proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b677-12\"> Testimony was elicited at trial that the interest due on the note as of that date, February 10,1983, was $17,869.45. No finding was made to that effect, however, so the amount of interest due from the date the note was signed must be found on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
