After a jury trial, a verdict was returned for the plaintiffs. The defendants have appealed from the judgment rendered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">The sole issue before us is whether the trial court erred in denying the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict and motion to set aside the verdict. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs failed to offer any evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer a causal relationship between the defendants\u2019 alleged negligence and the minor child\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Our review of the denial of both a motion for a directed verdict and a motion to set aside a verdict is limited. As to each, the evidence will be given the construction most favorable to support the verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>171 Conn. 264, 275, 368 A.2d 222 (1976) (denial of motion for a directed verdict); <em>Kalleher </em>v. <em>Orr, </em>183 Conn. 125, 126-27, 438 A.2d 843 (1981) (denial of motion to set aside a verdict). The trial court\u2019s ruling is entitled to great weight because of its familiarity with the facts and circumstances of the case. <em>Neilson </em>v. <em>D\u2019Angelo, </em>1 Conn. App. 239, 244, 471 A.2d 965, cert. dismissed, 193 Conn. 801, 474 A.2d 1259 (1984). In this case, our examination of the evidence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> leads us to conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 case was sufficient to be presented to the jury; <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Lovallo, </em>2 Conn. App. 579, 584, 481 A.2d 1286 (1984); and that the jury could reasonably have decided as it did. <em>Kalleher </em>v. <em>Orr, </em>supra; <em>LaFaive </em>v. <em>DiLoreto, </em>2 Conn.
