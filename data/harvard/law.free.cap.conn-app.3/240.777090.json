The other car involved in the accident was a 1974 Mercury operated by Leonard Wildes, who had leased it from Bianchi Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation. At the time of the accident, the defendants were insured under a policy issued by the plaintiff. Under that policy, the plaintiff paid the defendants $2326.38 as basic reparations benefits, pursuant to its obligations under Connecticut\u2019s No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38-319 through 38-351.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The defendants subsequently brought suit against Wildes, as a third party tortfeasor, and in settlement of that claim received $26,000 from Wildes\u2019 insurance company. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38-325 (b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the plaintiff requested that the defendants reimburse it for the $2326.38 in basic reparations benefits. The defendants refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The plaintiff brought this action against the defendants to recover the $2326.38. After a trial to the court, judgment in that amount was rendered for the plaintiff. The defendants now appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from that judgment. On appeal, they claim that the court erred in concluding that they were required to reimburse the plaintiff under General Statutes \u00a7 38-325 (b). The defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>contend that the tortfeasor\u2019s vehicle, because it was leased, was not a private passenger vehicle but was, instead, a vehicle in livery service. They thus claim that they are exempt from the reimbursement requirement. The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the leased vehicle driven by Wildes was a private passenger motor vehicle under General Statutes \u00a7 38-325 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 38-325 (b) states in pertinent part: \u201cWhenever a person who receives basic reparations benefits for an injury recovers damages from the owner, registrant, operator or occupant of a private passenger motor vehicle . . . the insurer is entitled to reimbursement . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 38-319 (g) defines \u201cprivate passenger motor vehicle\u201d in part as \u201ca private passenger, station wagon or camper type automobile other than a motorcycle, not used as a public or livery conveyance . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 16-324 (now \u00a7 13b-101) provides in pertinent part that \u201c \u2018motor vehicle in livery service' means and includes every motor vehicle used for the transportation of passengers for hire . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">In construing the meaning of these terms, we look to both the legislative intent of \u00a7 38-325 (b) and to the commonly approved usage of the words themselves. General Statutes \u00a7 <em>1-1; Flanagan Ambulance Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>161 Conn. 215, 217, 286 A.2d 315 (1971). We must be certain to read the statutory definition of \u201cprivate passenger motor vehicle\u201d in light of the general purpose expressed throughout the No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act. See <em>Flanagan Ambulance Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">\u201cSection 38-325 of the General Statutes is part of the no-fault motor vehicle insurance act. . . . The statutory scheme . . . creates a system of disincentives and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>incentives to sue.\u201d <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Holder, </em>37 Conn. Sup. 723, 731-32, 436 A.2d 308 (1981). Essentially, the act provides a disincentive for the insured to sue in cases of minor injury, which will mostly involve private passenger motor vehicles, and an incentive to sue in cases where private passenger motor vehicles are not involved. Id., 732. The insured is thus encouraged to sue \u201cthe owners and operators of motorcycles, large trucks and public or livery vehicles.\u201d Id. The classification bears a reasonable relationship to the legitimate purpose of increased highway safety since, in the case of large trucks and public or livery vehicles, encouraging tort liability against their owners \u201ccould encourage them to take steps, such as driver training, driver reassignment and other mechanisms, which would deter careless operation, resulting in greater highway safety.\u201d Id., 733. The reimbursement provision of \u00a7 38-325 (b) is central to this scheme by requiring an insured who recovers from an insured owner, registrant, operator or occupant of a private passenger motor vehicle to repay, to his insurer, any basic reparations benefits which he receives.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In light of the scheme of incentives created by the no-fault motor vehicle insurance act, an individual who leases a private car for his own use cannot reasonably be expected to take the steps which the owner of a public or livery vehicle might take to keep insurance premiums down.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">As to the commonly approved meaning of the words in question, we adopt the analysis set forth in <em>Greyhound Rent-A-Car, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carbon, </em>327 So. 2d 792 (Fla. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Dist. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 336 So. 2d 1182 (Fla. 1976), which considered whether a rented car was a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d or a \u201cpublic livery conveyance for passengers\u201d in the context of Florida\u2019s automobile insurance law. In that case, the Carbons sued Greyhound Rent-A-Car, Inc. (hereinafter Greyhound), for personal injury protection benefits for injuries sustained in an accident which occurred while they were driving a car rented from Greyhound. Greyhound raised the defense that the rental vehicle was not a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as defined by the Florida Automobile Reparations Reform Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but a \u201cpublic livery conveyance for passengers.\u201d The Florida court looked to the common usage of the words when it stated: \u201cLivery conveyance is defined in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, Revised Fourth Addition, 1968, at page 1084, as \u2018[a] vehicle used indiscriminately in conveying the public, without limitation to certain persons or particular occasions or without being governed by special terms.\u2019 In Couch on Insurance, 2d, \u00a7 1040, it is stated that, \u2018[t]o be a public conveyance requires the indiscriminate use of the vehicle conveying the public and a holding out of the vehicle to the general public for the carrying of passengers for hire. . . . [T]he vehicle is not a public conveyance where its use with respect to others is limited to particular persons and particular times and is governed by special terms.\u2019 \u201d Id., 793. The court then reasoned that the rented car driven by the Carbons was not a public or livery conveyance because it was \u201cnot subject to indiscriminate use by the general public without limitation to particular persons, particular times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>or special terms.\u201d Id. Since the vehicle was rented to an individual and the rental was governed by the special terms of a rental agreement, the court held that the rented vehicle was a \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">We likewise conclude that the motor vehicle driven by Wildes was not a public or livery conveyance or a \u201cmotor vehicle in livery service\u201d under General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 16-324 and hold that the trial court did not err in finding that the defendants failed to prove that the leased vehicle was anything other than a conventional passenger vehicle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In view of the purpose of our no-fault insurance law and the commonly approved usage of the words in question, the leased vehicle driven by the tortfeasor was a \u201cprivate passenger motor vehicle\u201d within General Statutes s 38-325 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 38-325 provides in pertinent part as follows: \u201c(b) Whenever a person who receives basic reparations benefits for an injury recovers damages from the owner, registrant, operator or occupant of a private passenger motor vehicle with respect to which security has been provided under this chapter or from a person or organization legally responsible for his acts or omissions, the insurer is entitled to reimbursement from the claimant to the extent that said basic reparations benefits have been paid and the insurer shall have a lien on the claimant\u2019s recovery to such extent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b257-8\"> This appeal was originally filed in the Appellate Session of the Superior Court. General Statutes \u00a7 51-197a (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b259-6\"> On the other hand, under General Statutes \u00a7 38-325 (c), \u201cif an insured recovers from an operator of a motor vehicle which is not an insured private passenger motor vehicle, he need not make direct and full reimbursement to his insurer; the insurer has no direct lien on the recovery but is merely subrogated to the insured\u2019s recovery rights to the extent of the benefits paid.\u201d <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Holder, </em>37 Conn. Sup. 723, 728, 436 A.2d 308 (1981); <em>see Amica Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>1 Conn. App. 569, 474 A.2d 104 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b260-5\"> The Florida Automobile Reparations Reform Act was the predecessor of the Florida Motor Vehicle No-Fault Law, Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 627.730 et seq. Florida Statutes \u00a7 627.732 (1973), which was in effect at the time of the accident, provided in pertinent part as follows: \u201c(1) \u2018Motor vehicle\u2019 means a sedan, station wagon, or jeep type vehicle not used as a public livery conveyance for passengers and includes any other four-wheel motor vehicle used as a utility automobile and a pickup or panel truck which is not used primarily in the occupation, profession, or business of the insured.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b261-8\"> Where an exception to a statute forms an integral part of a right created by that statute, the plaintiff bears the burden of showing that he comes within the limited class for whose benefit the right was created. <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Giovenelli, </em>117 Conn. 103, 107, 167 A. 87 (1933). If it is assumed that the reimbursement provision of subsection (b) of General Statutes \u00a7 38-325 is such an exception, the plaintiff would have to prove that it fell within that exception. In view of the general purpose of the No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, however, we do not view subsection (b) as such an exception. Further, the claim that the vehicle was not a private passenger motor vehicle was raised by the defendants as a special defense. Generally, in any affirmative or special defense, the burden of proof rests with the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>181 Conn. 426, 430, 435 A.2d 967 (1980). The defendants consequently bore the burden of proving the claim which they affirmatively raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
