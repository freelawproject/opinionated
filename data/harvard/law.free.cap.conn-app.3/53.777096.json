The underlying facts are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">The district is a specially chartered municipal corporation which owns 6628 acres of land in the town. The land consists of a reservoir and associated watershed area used to meet the needs of member towns and nonmember customers of the district. In a dispute over the tax assessment on its land, the district argued that the per acre value of its land was $118.65; the town claimed that the land value was $1900 per acre. The district appeals from the judgment of the trial court valuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>its land at $1800 per acre, claiming error in the court\u2019s application of the property tax assessment provision of the special act which created it.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The district was created in 1929 by a special act of the Connecticut General Assembly. 20 Spec. Acts 1204, No. 511.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The charter, as amended by 21 Spec. Acts 655, No. 505, provides as a method of real estate tax assessment that land shall be \u201cassessed for taxation at the average assessed valuation per acre of the improved farming land in such town.\u201d See Part I, infra.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">On October 1,1979, the town\u2019s tax assessor assessed the district\u2019s property at $1900 per acre. The district appealed this assessment to the board of tax review of the town. Upon the board\u2019s refusal to change the assessment, the district appealed to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The court determined that the true and actual value of the property was $11,930,400, representing an $1800 per acre valuation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court rejected the district\u2019s claim that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a through 12-107c<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> applied to its land in the town. The court found that the land had never been classified under those sections and that the legislature never intended those sections to be used in determining the value of water company property.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The court did not further consider the question of the possible existence of improved farmland<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in the town or its average assessed value per acre. It proceeded, without explaining the reasons for not applying the charter assessment provision, to determine the assessment value of the district\u2019s property on the basis of testimony by the town\u2019s appraiser, James Oles, and common knowledge of increasing farmland values. The court reduced the assessment per acre to $1800, which it labeled a \u201cconservative figure,\u201d agreed to by the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The tax assessor of the town testified that $118.65 was the average assessment per acre of the farmland in the town. A document posted at the town hall showed various farmland classifications and a schedule of recommended use values pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a through 12-107e.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Tillable land is classified, in descending order of quality from best to worst, as \u201cTillable A,\u201d \u201cTillable B,\u201d \u201cTillable Cl\u201d and \u201cTillable C2.\u201d \u201cPermanent Pasture Land\u201d is defined as \u201cUntillable Land.\u201d The term \u201cimproved farmland\u201d is not used in the document. The entire assessment of farmland consists of 254.6 acres classified as \u201cTillable C2\u201d and 427.9 acres classified as \u201cPermanent Pasture.\u201d For the years 1979,1980 and 1981, \u201cTillable C2\u201d farmland was assessed by the town at $150 per acre and \u201cPermanent Pasture Land\u201d at $100 per acre. These values were based on the list of statewide and river valley recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>mended use values per acre provided to towns by the state tax commissioner. The resulting calculation is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"221\"

width=\"1088\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Thus, $118.65 per acre, computed as $80,980 for 682.5 acres, is the average assessed valuation per acre of farmland in the town. This $118.65 per acre valuation reflects the fact that the owners of all farmland in Barkhamsted have applied for and received classification of their land as farmland under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a through 12-107c.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">The district proffered only two witnesses. The first of these was the town assessor, Mary Ringuette. She testified as follows: There is no improved farmland in the town; her definition of such land is \u201cland along the river valley or along some flat land that is not slopey, not rocky, so it\u2019s able to have a tractor go through and plant crops\u201d such as lettuce or tobacco, as distinguished from hay; tillable C2 land is not improved farmland; she stated that her opinion is consistent with those of the other assessors at the Hartford County and Litchfield County assessors\u2019 meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">The other witness was Leon C. Kirk, a senior engineer with the real estate department of the district. He examined assessment cards in the assessor\u2019s office for land classified as farmland, being all of the tillable C2 land and pasture land. These cards show that if all of the town\u2019s farmland were assessed without the preferential statutory reduction, the average assessment per acre would be $963.54, or $874.14 if farmland located in a business zone were excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Kirk testified that in his opinion \u201ctillable C2 and pasture land do come within the definition of improved farmland.\u201d The trial court specifically found that the district tried the case without a competent appraiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">James C. Oles, an expert appraiser with twenty-six years of experience, testified for the town. He prepared a report for trial estimating the fair market value, in a sale, of improved farmland from a willing seller to a willing buyer. He did not consider any farmland within the town despite the fact that there are four working dairy farms in the town and despite the land classified as farmland by the assessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Oles testified that the reason he did not consider existing farms in Barkhamsted in determining the value of the district\u2019s land is that the only \u201cimproved farming land\u201d in the town is now under water as the \u201creservoir was built by the Metropolitan District on the best land that existed in the Town of Barkhamsted.\u201d He defined \u201cimproved farming land\u201d as \u201cprime crop land cleared, the absolute best farmland there is.\u201d He used farmland values from other towns in Litchfield County with similar market conditions for farming.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The district briefed three major issues: (1) that the court erred in interpreting the property tax assessment provisions of the charter; (2) that the court erred in its interpretation of the relationship of the charter to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-63, 12-76 and 12-107a through 12-107c; and (3) that the court erred in setting the assessment at $1800 per acre.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">The appellee also briefed, as an alternate ground upon which the judgment may be affirmed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 3012 (a), whether General Statutes \u00a7 12-76, as amended in 1963, repealed by implication the assessment provision of the district\u2019s charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Statutory History</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In <em>West Hartford </em>v. <em>Board of Water </em>Commissioners, 44 Conn. 360 (1877), the Supreme Court held that a reservoir owned by a municipal corporation in another town was not liable to taxation in the latter town. This case prompted adoption of the original predecessor of General Statutes \u00a7 12-76, which stated: \u201cLand owned or taken by any municipal corporation for the purpose of creating or furnishing a supply of water for its use or benefit, shall be liable to taxation, and shall be set in the list in the town where such land is situated, to the corporation owning or controlling such water supply, <em>at a valuation which would be fair for said land if used for agricultural purposes: </em>provided, however, that no such land shall be liable to taxation, or set in any list as aforesaid, wherever the inhabitants of the town in which the said land is situated have the right to the use of such water supply upon the same terms and conditions as the inhabitants of such municipal corporation, and when such town actually uses the same.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Public Acts 1879, No. 79. Thereafter, the legislature altered the language \u201cfor agricultural purposes\u201d as follows: \u201cland shall be liable to taxation and shall be assessed <em>... at the average assessed valuation per acre of the improved farming land in town. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Public Acts 1913, No. 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">In 1929, the district was created by 20 Spec. Acts 1204, No. 511. This act contained no section specifically on taxation of its water supply property until, in 1931 for the East Branch of the Farmington River and again in 1949 for the West Branch, the Charter borrowed the identical language of the 1913 Public Act: \u201c[A]ll land taken for any of said purposes shall be set in the list <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>for taxation in the town in which said land is situated, to the Metropolitan District, and assessed for taxation at the <em>average assessed valuation per acre of the improved farming land in such town. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 21 Spec.

This is a pure issue of law briefed by the district. The issue is also in the preliminary statement of issues of both parties.

The town claims that this amendment repealed the assessment provision of the charter by implication and was applicable to the 1979, 1980 and 1981 assessment lists. In the same legislative session, General Statutes \u00a7 12-63 was amended to provide preferential tax treatment for farm land as follows: \u201crule of valuation. The present true and actual value of <em>land classified as farm land pursuant to section 12-107c, as forest land pursuant to section 12-107d, or as open space land pursuant to section 12-107e shall be based upon its current use without regard to neighborhood land use of a more intensive nature, provided in no event shall the present true and actual value of open space land be less than it would be if such open space land comprised a part of a tract or tracts of land classified as farm land pursuant to section 12-107c.

The 1929 General Assembly had also enacted two general statutes about airports consistent with the special act. In 1946, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the General Assembly adopted the predecessor of General Statutes \u00a7 15-79. This statute did not expressly repeal the 1929 special act, but did so by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The Supreme Court stated: \u201cThis section, known as \u00a7 15-79 of the General Statutes, in effect at the time of trial, was a drastic change in legislative policy from [allowing airports in another town without the town\u2019s approval]. It prohibited municipalities from purchasing or taking land in any other municipality for the establishment, expansion or improvement of an airport without the approval of that municipality. The state itself was prohibited from establishing, expanding or improving any airport without the approval of the municipality or municipalities concerned. This was a patent shift of policy from one permitting extension of municipal airports into other municipalities with no power in the towns so invaded to prohibit it to one prohibiting not only all municipalities from so doing but the soverign as well, unless the permission of the municipality concerned was first obtained.\u201d <em>East Haven </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 466-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">It then summarized the law on repeal by implication as follows: \u201c[T]he general rule is that \u2018[a] special and local statute, providing for a particular case or class of cases, is not affected by a statute general in its terms, broad enough to include cases embraced in the special law, unless the intent to repeal or alter is manifest.\u2019 <em>State ex rel. Wallen </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>82 Conn. 122, 124, 72, A. 575 [1909]. \u2018But whenever it is made to appear that the legislature intended to repeal a special act by any general legislation, then the special act falls, although not named. And such intention may be made to appear by the words of the general act, by the subject-matter with which the general act is concerned, by other legislation on the same matter, by the surrounding circumstances, by the purpose to be accomplished, or by anything else to which reference may properly be had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>for the purpose of discovering the legislative intent.\u2019 <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Hartford Theological Seminary, </em>66 Conn. 475, 484, 34 A. 483 [1895].</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u201c \u2018When a subsequent enactment covering a field of operation coterminous with a prior statute cannot by any reasonable construction be given effect while the prior law remains in operative existence because of irreconcilable conflict between the two acts, the latest legislative expression prevails, and the prior law yields to the extent of the conflict.\u2019 1 Sutherland, Statutory Construction (3d Ed.) \u00a7 2012, p. 463. \u2018There is no rule which prohibits the repeal by implication of a special or specific act by a general or broad one. The question is always one of legislative intention, and the special or specific act must yield to the later general or broad act, where there is a manifest legislative intent that the general act shall be of universal application notwithstanding the prior special or specific act.\u2019 50 Am. Jur. 565, Statutes, \u00a7 564.\u201d <em>East Haven </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 467-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In upholding the trial court\u2019s enjoining New Haven from expanding its airport into any portion of East Haven unless permission was first obtained from East Haven, the court stated: \u201cWe conclude that the subject matter of \u00a7 15-79 covers the whole field of the establishment, expansion and improvement of airports in the state. This later statute is exclusive, and its provisions are manifestly repugnant to the 1929 special act.\u201d Id., 471-72. Repeal by implication is not favored. <em>Hirschfeld </em>v. <em>Commission on Claims, </em>172 Conn. 603, 606, 376 A.2d 71 (1977); <em>Knights of Columbus Council </em>v. <em>Mulcahy, </em>154 Conn. 583, 591, 227 A.2d 413 (1967). \u201cIf courts can by any fair interpretation find a reasonable field of operation for both statutes without destroying or perverting their evident meaning and intent, it is the duty of the courts to do so, thus reconciling them and according to them concurrent effect. <em>Leete </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number><em>Griswold Post, </em>114 Conn. 400, 405, 158 A. 919 [1932]; <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>113 Conn. 377, 385, 155 A. 417 [1931], and cases cited; 1 Sutherland, Statutory Construction (3d Ed.) \u00a7 2014.\u201d <em>Shanley </em>v. <em>Jankura, </em>144 Conn. 694, 702, 137 A.2d 536 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Each party cites <em>Rocky Hill Convalescent Hospital, Inc. </em>v. <em>Metropolitan District, </em>160 Conn. 446, 280 A.2d 344 (1971) and <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Eighth Utilities District, </em>179 Conn. 589, 427 A.2d 425 (1980), as authority for its position. The district claims these two cases as authority for the generally accepted proposition of <em>East Haven </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, that the intent to repeal or alter must be manifest before an earlier special act is repealed by implication by a later general statute. The town points out that in each case the subsequent public act specifically stated that all prior charters and special acts were to continue in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Such arguments essentially beg the question, for each situation is unique. In <em>East Haven </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, there was an essential repugnancy, for the special act involved required no approval for location of an airport in any town while the later general statute required such approval. These provisions are diametrically opposed. The Supreme Court, in finding repeal by implication, specifically noted the comprehensive nature of the later general statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">We find nothing in the legislative history of the charter and General Statutes \u00a7 12-76 to display a manifest intent that the charter provision is repealed by the later general statute. Rather than an essential repugnancy, the two methods of assessment can live together compatibly as two different but related methods of achieving the same objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">\u201c[T]he legislature is presumed to be aware and to have knowledge of all existing statutes and the effect which its own action or nonaction may have on them.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number><em>Miller </em>v. <em>Eighth Utilities District, </em>supra, 594, citing <em>Mack </em>v. <em>Saars, </em>150 Conn. 290, 298, 188 A.2d 863 (1963); Holden &amp; Daly, Connecticut Evidence, \u00a7 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">We conclude that the charter provision for assessment of the district\u2019s land in the town was not repealed by implication by the provision of General Statutes \u00a7 12-76, adopted as \u00a7 10 of No. 490 of the 1963 Public Acts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The Application of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a through 12-107c to Assessment of Improved Farmland Under the Charter</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">In 1963, the General Assembly enacted No. 490 of the Public Acts, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning the Taxation and Preservation of Farm, Forest, and Open Space Land\u201d in order to revise the tax structure, thus enabling owners of such land to continue its environmentally sound use free from the pressure to sell caused by tax rates based on increasing market value created by encroaching residential and commercial development. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-107a.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">General Statutes \u00a7 12-107c permits owners of land to apply to the tax assessor to have their land classified as farmland. General Statutes \u00a7 12-107c (a) provides that \u201cin determining whether such land is farm land, such assessor shall take into account, among other things, the acreage of such land, the portion thereof in actual use for farming or agricultural operations, the productivity of such land, the gross income derived therefrom, the nature and value of the equipment used in connection therewith, and the extent to which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>tracts comprising such land are contiguous.\u201d If the land is classified as farmland, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-63 its valuation is based on its current use as farmland without regard to more intensive neighborhood land use, in contrast to property which is to be valued at its fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The district\u2019s land has never been classified as farmland under General Statutes \u00a7 12-107c (a). The district, however, claims that the trial court erred in not giving it the benefit of General Statutes \u00a7 12-107c in determining the assessment of its land.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">This claim is disposed of by <em>Meriden </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>161 Conn. 396, 288 A.2d 435 (1971), in which the Supreme Court held that Meriden could not have its water supply land, located in the town of Berlin, classified as forest land under General Statutes \u00a7 12-76. The state forester had granted Meriden forest land classification but the Berlin tax assessor refused to recognize that classification. On appeal the trial court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s appeal and reclassified the property in question from \u201cimproved farmland\u201d valued at $214,560 to \u201cforest land\u201d valued at $22,350. In finding error, the Supreme Court stated: \u201cThe legislative history of \u00a7 12-76 and the plain, unambiguous language of the statute make it clear that it was the intention of the legislature to exempt from taxation land owned or taken for water-supply purposes by a municipality in the town where the land is situated, provided that town\u2019s inhabitants are given the use, and actually use, the water supply, on the same terms as the inhabitants of the town which owns the land. Since the inhabitants of Berlin did not share in this use, it was the intent of the legislature that the town of Berlin should not lose the tax on the land so used. It was the purpose of the statute to restore this exempted land to the assessment list of the town of Berlin and that it should be assessed at its fair market value as improved farmland. <em>Norwalk </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>v. <em>New Canaan, </em>85 Conn. 119, 126, 81 A. 1027 [1911]. <em>There is nothing in either of these statutes to support a claim that the provisions of </em>\u00a7 <em>12-107d repealed by implication or in any way amended or modified the method of assessment required by </em>\u00a7 <em>12-76.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The district attempts to distinguish <em>Meriden </em>because a special act provision is involved in this case. We conclude that the distinction is immaterial and adopt the rationale of Meriden.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Three factors buttress the conclusion that the General Assembly did not intend that the district\u2019s water supply land in the town be favorably assessed by permitting it to sneak under the tent of a farmland classification under General Statutes \u00a7 12-107c.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">First, General Statutes \u00a7 12-107b (a) defines \u201cfarm land\u201d as \u201cany tract or tracts of land, including woodland and wasteland, constituting a farm unit.\u201d There is no such claim here. Second, the statutory factors for determining what is farmland under General Statutes \u00a7 12-107c (a) are clearly inapplicable to the district\u2019s land in Barkhamsted. Third, as the Supreme Court observed in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>160 Conn. 71, 73, 273 A.2d 706 (1970): \u201cIt is thus clear that \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a [through] e, as derived from Public Act 490, are as much conservation statutes as they are tax relief measures. The declaration of policy in \u00a7 12-107a recites, inter alia, that it is in the public interest \u2018to conserve the state\u2019s natural resources.\u2019 Indeed, it would appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>that the purpose of the tax relief is to aid the conservation effort. . . .\u201d Since the district\u2019s water supply-land is subject to restrictions on its sale, the conservation purpose of General Statutes \u00a7 12-107c would not be enhanced in any way by giving the benefit of the favorable farmland assessment to the district\u2019s land. 20 Spec. Acts 1204, No. 511, \u00a7 53; see also General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 16-50c, 22a-355, 25-37a through 25-37g.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">We conclude that General Statutes \u00a7 12-107c is inapplicable to the assessment of the district\u2019s land in Barkhamsted.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The Standard of \u201cImproved Farmland\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">The trial court did not define the phrase \u201cimproved farmland.\u201d The memorandum of decision merely cites the charter provision concerning assessment of improved farmland. The town argues that by basing its decision on the fair market value of other farmland in Litchfield County the court impliedly found that there was no improved farmland in the town. We do not reach the question of whether, in the absence of any improved farmland in the town, the court would have been justified in considering the factors that it did consider. In the absence of an appropriate definition employed by the trial court, there was no proper standard by which to weigh the facts presented by this record. Thus, the fundamental issue in the case was never considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">The assessor spoke in assessor\u2019s language, defining \u201cimproved farmland\u201d as land \u201cable to have a tractor go through and plant crops.\u201d She acknowledged that she classified approximately 255 acres of Barkhamsted land as tillable C2, suitable for crop land. She relied on a \u201cRecommended Use Values/Acre\u201d notice from the state tax department which was concerned with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>values of land seeking the benefits of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a through 12-107c. She concluded that there was no improved farmland in the town despite her knowledge of four working dairy farms on the list of farmland, assessed under No. 490 of the 1963 Public Acts, which she prepared for Kirk.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The appraiser, stipulated to be an expert land appraiser, spoke in appraiser\u2019s language. He defined \u201cimproved farming land\u201d as \u201cprime crop land cleared, the absolute best farmland there is.\u201d He applied the standard of fair market value. By his definition, he could find no improved farmland in the town except the land under the reservoir.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The district\u2019s project engineer used both tillable C2 and pasture land in his computations since this was all of the assessed farmland available in the town. He testified that in his opinion these two categories of farmland \u201cdo come within the definition of \u2018improved farmland.\u2019 \u201d He did not specifically give his definition of \u201cimproved farmland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">None of the definitions used at the trial is directly relevant to the statutory standard of <em>improved </em>farmland. Both the assessor and the appraiser considered farmland from the standpoint of its potential use. This is a practical everyday standard for the municipal assessor. Requiring assessments to change with various changed improvements on farmland would be a much more onerous task.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The fundamental problem here, however, is that \u201cimproved farmland\u201d is a statutory term never before defined in Connecticut, and that all of the witnesses were marching to their own particular drummer.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">The charter provides that water supply land of the district \u201cshall\u201d be assessed in the manner provided in the charter. \u201c[T]he word \u2018shall\u2019 must be assumed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>have been used with full awareness of its ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Zimmerman, </em>181 Conn. 367, 371, 435 A.2d 996 (1980). \u201cShall\u201d is a word ordinarily creating a mandatory duty. <em>Skulman </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>154 Conn. 426, 428-29, 226 A.2d 380 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u201c[W]here the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous the courts cannot, by construction, read into statutes provisions which are not clearly stated.\u201d <em>Point O\u2019Woods Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>178 Conn. 364, 366, 423 A.2d 90 (1979); Holden &amp; Daly, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">There is a dearth of authority on the definition of \u201cimproved farmland.\u201d In <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>193 Conn. 342, 350, 477 A.2d 115 (1984), the Supreme Court referred to the statutory phrase found in General Statutes \u00a7 12-76 but did not define it. In <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Remington, </em>102 Conn. 401, 407, 128 A. 710 (1925), the testator\u2019s will provided that \u201cat Dexter Remington\u2019s decease the avails arising from the improvement of the farm\u201d were to be equally divided between certain parties. The Supreme Court stated that \u201c[i]n creating the life estates in <em>Dexter, </em>the testator obviously uses the word improve in its familiar sense of a beneficial use.\u201d The court further stated: \u201cWe think the gift in question must be construed as a gift of the proceeds arising from the use or working of the farm.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Remington, </em>supra, 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Frederick, </em>163 Ala. 455, 50 So. 910 (1909), \u00a7 12-47 of the Alabama code provided that partition fences between \u201cimproved lands\u201d shall be erected at the joint expense of the occupants. The plaintiff sued the defendant to compel her to pay a portion of the expense of erecting a partition fence. The evidence was that the plaintiff had enclosed her lands with a wire fence, consisting of posts with four stands of wire attached thereto, and was and had been using her said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>lands as a pasture for her cows and horses. In confirming the trial court\u2019s award to the plaintiff, the court stated: \u201cThe history of this legislation, as to the building of partition fences between lands of adjoining owners under certain conditions, and requiring the adjoining owners to pay for the same, seems to have had its origin in the colony of Massachusetts. There, and in other states of the Union where this legislation has been enacted, the term \u2018improved lands\u2019 has been held to mean lands appropriated by the owner and devoted to a particular use\u2014used or employed to good purpose, or turned to profitable account. <em>Wiggin </em>v. <em>Baptist Society, </em>43 N. H. 260, 261 [1861]. We therefore hold that appellant, having fenced her land in and devoted it to the use of pasturage for her cows and horses, and thereby turned it to profitable account, made it improved land within the contemplation of section 4247 of the Code.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Frederick, </em>supra, 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The leading case in Connecticut involving the definition of \u201cfarmland\u201d gives cogent guidelines for our task of interpretation in this case. In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>160 Conn. 71, 273 A.2d 706 (1970), the defendant board had sustained the assessor\u2019s refusal to classify the plaintiffs\u2019 land as \u201cfarmland.\u201d The land was fully cultivated as a nursery. The trial court sustained the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, concluding that the land should have received preferential tax treatment under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a through 12-107c as \u201cfarmland.\u201d Although General Statutes \u00a7 12-107b is devoid of any specific definition of farmland, the court resorted to the general statutory definitions and common word usage to determine that cultivated nursery land constitutes \u201cfarmland\u201d within the purview of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a through 12-107c.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>\u201cWhere a statute or regulation does not define a term, it is appropriate to focus upon its common understanding as expressed in the law and upon its dictionary meaning. <em>The Hearst Corporation </em>v. <em>State Department of Assessments &amp; Taxation, </em>269 Md. 625, 308 A.2d 679 (1973).\u201d <em>Ziperstein </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>178 Conn. 493, 500, 423 A.2d 129 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Webster, Third New International Dictionary, defines the word \u201cimprove,\u201d in part, as follows: \u201c[T]o increase the value of (land or property) by bringing under cultivation, reclaiming for agriculture or stock raising, erecting buildings or other structures, laying out streets, or installing utilities as sewers <em>(improved </em>farmland).\u201d The same dictionary defines \u201creclaim\u201d in part as follows: \u201c[T]o rescue from a wild or uncultivated state: make fit for cultivation or use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The International Association of Assessing Officers defines the term \u201cimprovement\u201d as \u201c[ajnything done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>to raw land with the intention of increasing its value. Thus, a structure erected on the property constitutes one very common type of improvement, although other actions, such as those taken to improve drainage, are also improvements. Although such cases are rarely intentional, \u2018improvements\u2019 can conceivably diminish the value of the land; note, however, that easements restricting the use and value of land are not considered improvements.\u201d International Association of Assessing Officers, Improving Real Property Assessment, A Reference Manual, p. 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Applying Webster\u2019s definition of \u201cimprove\u201d to the definition of \u201cfarmland\u201d derived from General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (q), the essence of the test is that the land has been altered, changed or developed from its natural state, in a not inconsequential manner, in order to enhance or promote its use as farmland. Under this definition, the most virgin and rich Connecticut Valley farmland is not \u201cimproved farmland\u201d if it has not been improved in some way. On the other hand, land of substantially less quality for farming may be \u201cimproved farmland\u201d if a sufficient change from its natural state has occurred for farming purposes. Whether a particular parcel of land is \u201cimproved farmland\u201d is, therefore, a question of fact for the trial court, to be determined by reference to this definition. The court must consider, under the totality of the circumstances, whether sufficient improvements in type, quantity or both have been made to all or part of a tract of land to justify such a classification. This case must therefore be remanded to determine the value of the district\u2019s property in terms of the value of improved farmland.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-8\"> The special act, as amended, is also known as and will be referred to as the charter of the district.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b71-9\"> By amendment dated June 28,1983, the district added the assessment years beginning on October 1, 1980, and October 1, 1981, to its original application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b71-10\"> From this figure the value of the land is reduced, for tax purposes, by 30 percent as is done for all land. General Statutes \u00a7 12-62a (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b71-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a through 12-107c provide a procedure for reduced assessments for farmland if certain criteria are met. A detailed discussion of these statutes is found in Part II B, infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b72-6\"> While the charter used the term \u201cfarming land,\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-76 has used the term \u201cfarm land\u201d since 1963. We consider these two terms to be synonymous. For simplicity, this opinion will refer throughout to \u201cfarmland\u201d except where the term is used in quoted textual material.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b72-7\"> The relevant provisions of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a through 12-107e were added as part of Public Acts 1963, No. 490. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-107d and 12-107e provide mechanisms for obtaining \u201cforest land\u201d or \u201copen space land\u201d classifications, respectively. Those sections are, therefore, not involved in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b76-12\"><em> </em>Genera] Statutes \u00a7 12-76 was amended in an immaterial respect in 1978 and in 1982 the district charter was made explicitly subject to \u00a7 12-76. Public Acts 1982, No. 82-452, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b81-10\"> Although the district\u2019s statement of issues claimed that the trial court misinterpreted the application of General Statutes \u00a7 12-63 to this case, the district concedes, in its brief, that General Statutes \u00a7 12-63 is inapplicable to this ease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b83-8\"> In <em>Torrington Water Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>168 Conn. 319, 362 A.2d 866 (1975), the Supreme Court upheld the trial court\u2019s direction that the plaintiff\u2019s land should be classified as forest land under General Statutes \u00a7 12-107d. The Supreme Court distinguished <em>Meriden </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>161 Conn. 396, 288 A.2d 435 (1971), since General Statutes \u00a7 12-76, as adopted in \u00a7 10 of No. 490 of the 1963 Public Acts, applied only to water supply land owned by municipalities. Since that case involved a private water company it is not germane to the issues in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b87-6\"> The statutory definition of \u201cfarming\u201d provided by General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (q) leaves no doubt that \u201cfarmland\u201d includes land used for a broad range of purposes: \u201cExcept as otherwise specifically defined, the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>\u2018agriculture\u2019 and \u2018farming\u2019 shall include cultivation of the soil, dairying, forestry, raising or harvesting any agricultural or horticultural commodity, including the raising, shearing, feeding, caring for, training and management of livestock, including horses, bees, poultry, fur-bearing animals and wildlife, and the raising or harvesting of oysters, clams, mussels, and other molluscan shellfish; the operation, management, conservation, improvement or maintenance of a farm and its buildings, tools and equipment, or salvaging timber or cleared land of brush or other debris left by a storm, as an incident to such farming operations; the production or harvesting of maple syrup or maple sugar, or any agricultural commodity, including lumber, as an incident to ordinary farming operations or the harvesting of mushrooms, the hatching of poultry, or the construction, operation or maintenance of ditches, canals, reservoirs or waterways used exclusively for farming purposes; handling, planting, drying, packing, packaging, processing, freezing, grading, storing or delivering to storage or to market, or to a carrier for transportation to market, or for direct sale any agricultural or horticultural commodity as an incident to ordinary farming operations, or, in the case of fruits and vegetables, as an incident to the preparation of such fruits or vegetables for market or for direct sale.
