The trial court held that \u201cagency\u201d as used in General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> refers to the hearing officer rather than to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>the commission and that since the plaintiff had served the commission, its action was abatable.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b) requires that service be made upon the agency. General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (l)* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defines \u201cagency\u201d as each state board, commission, department or officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-82 through 46a-86 establish the statutory procedural framework for the commission concerning alleged discriminatory practices. The commission investigates complaints, attempts to resolve them by conciliation, and, if unsuccessful, its chairman appoints a hearing officer to conduct a hearing to resolve the matter and to issue findings of fact and an order. The hearing officer may be either a member of the commission or one of twenty-five hearing examiners appointed by the governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Prior to 1977, appeals from a final order of a hearing officer were not expressly subject to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b). Public Acts 1977, No. 77-603, \u00a7 124, amended what is now General Statutes \u00a7 46a-95 (j) to provide for an appeal pursuant to General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>\u00a7 4-183. The latter statute was subsequently amended by Public Acts 1979, No. 79-163, to provide that service upon an agency may be made by mailing a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the office of the commissioner of the agency or to the office of the attorney general in Hartford. By 1979, \u201ccommissioner,\u201d within the context of the statutes relating to the CHRO, had already been defined as a member of the commission.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The definition remains unchanged in General Statutes \u00a7 46a-51 (4). A member of the commission is not definitionally equated with a hearing examiner. See General Statutes \u00a7 46a-54 (8); General Statutes \u00a7 46a-57 (c) (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b) provides in pertinent part: \u201cCopies of the petition shall be served upon the agency and all parties of record within thirty days after mailing of such notice or, if a rehearing is requested, within thirty days after mailing of the notice of the decision thereon, except that service upon an agency may be made by the appellant mailing a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, without the use of a sheriff or other officer, to the office of the commissioner of the agency or to the office of the attorney general in Hartford.\u201d To construe the word \u201cagency,\u201d as used in the first part of that sentence to be the hearing officer who heard the case would require either that the definition of agency change in the latter part of the sentence or that the phrase \u201coffice of the commissioner of the agency\u201d be rendered superfluous when a hearing examiner conducts the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The main objective of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, of which General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b) is a part, is to obtain a uniform procedure. <em>Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation </em>v. <em>DPUC, </em>1 Conn. App. 1, 4, 467 A.2d 679 (1983). The choice by the chairman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>of the commission to appoint a hearing examiner as a hearing officer rather than a commission member should not dictate the manner in which service is to be made. To exalt this choice to that level would be to defeat rather than to promote the objective of uniformity. A hearing examiner is the commission\u2019s examiner. <em>Wroblewski </em>v. <em>Lexington Gardens, Inc., </em>188 Conn. 44, 49, 448 A.2d 801 (1982). A hearing examiner is an instrumentality of the commission. See <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Department of Education, </em>39 Conn. Sup. 443, 449, 466 A.2d 343 (1983). The hearing examiner, after appointment by the chairman of the commission, as a hearing officer, does not gain status independent of the commission. His determinations have validity only because of the authority vested in him by the chairman of the commission. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-57 (d), 46a-84 (a), 46a-86, and 46a-95 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The construction of \u201cagency\u201d as used in General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (b) to mean \u201chearing officer\u201d would contravene General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (1) which defines an agency as a state commission or an officer authorized by law to determine contested cases. The use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d in that statutory section makes it clear that, at the very least, service upon the commission by the plaintiff was sufficient to withstand the jurisdictional attack which the defendant made. Further, \u201cagency\u201d within the meaning of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act is a body in which the legislature has reposed general powers of administration of a particular state program in connection with which it has been given statutory authority to act for the state in the implementation of that program. See <em>Rybinski </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019Retirement Commission, </em>173 Conn. 462, 468, 378 A.2d 547 (1977). That power has been reposed in the commission rather than in the hearing officer. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-52, 46a-54 and 4-38f (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>\u201cFinal decision\u201d as used in General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a) refers to the decision of the agency, here the CHRO. The particular instrumentality of that decision, here the hearing officer, need not have been served with the plaintiff\u2019s petition in order for the plaintiff to obtain a decision on its Superior Court appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to deny the motion to dismiss and to proceed according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-14\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(b) Proceedings for such appeal shall be instituted by filing a petition in superior court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain or for the judicial district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>wherein the aggrieved person resides or if such person is not a resident of this state to the court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain within forty-five days after mailing of the notice of the final decision of the agency or, if a rehearing is requested, within forty-five days after mailing of the notice of the decision thereon. Copies of the petition shall be served upon the agency and all parties of record within thirty days after mailing of such notice or, if a rehearing is requested, within thirty days after mailing of the notice of the decision thereon, except that service upon an agency may be made by the appellant mailing a copy of the petition by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, without the use of a sheriff or other officer, to the office of the commissioner of the agency or to the office of the attorney general in Hartford.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(1) \u2018Agency\u2019 means each state board, commission, department or officer, other than the legislature, courts, judicial review council, council on probate judicial conduct, governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general or town or regional boards of education, authorized by law to make regulations or to determine contested cases . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b482-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 31-122 (i).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
