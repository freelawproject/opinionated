From the trial court\u2019s dismissal of that appeal, the plaintiff has appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-15\">The trial court found the following factual situation: The plaintiff is a certified teacher who was employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>by the defendant for the school years 1971-72 through 1973-74. She resigned her teaching position in July, 1974, after having been granted a maternity leave in March, 1974. The plaintiff thereafter returned to work for the defendant in October, 1974, under the federally funded Title I program. This program is designed to assist the culturally disadvantaged. From October, 1974, until the 1980-81 school year, the plaintiff worked part time at an hourly wage rate without a written contract. No teaching certificate was required under the terms of her employment through the Title I program. The plaintiff was employed under a teaching contract for the 1980-81 and 1981-82 school years. She was notified in January, 1982, that her contract would not be renewed, and this was confirmed after a February, 1982 hearing. After the trial court dismissed the plaintiffs appeal to it, this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The issue is whether the plaintiff was a tenured teacher under General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 10-151 (b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> so that she had standing to appeal from the defendant\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that appeals to the courts from the decisions of administrative boards may be taken only under statutory authority and absent such authority courts are without jurisdiction to entertain those appeals. . . . When considering and acting to terminate a teacher\u2019s employment contract, a board of education is an administrative agency although it acts in a quasi-judicial capacity.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>166 Conn. 189, 191, 348 A.2d 584 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 10-151 (f) provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAny teacher aggrieved by the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>sion of a board of education . . . after a hearing as provided in subsection (b) of this section may appeal therefrom . . . . \u201d The right of appeal is granted by this statute only to tenured teachers. <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>167 Conn. 444, 447, 356 A.2d 100 (1975); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">\u201cAlthough the word tenure does not appear in the statute, \u00a7 10-151, it has a generally accepted meaning. In Webster, Third New International Dictionary, it is defined as \u2018a status granted . . . [usually] after a probationary period to one holding a position . . . [especially] as a teacher and protecting him from dismissal except for serious misconduct or incompetence determined by formal hearings or trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cipu </em>v. <em>North Haven Board of Education, </em>32 Conn. Sup. 264, 267, 351 A.2d 76 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">\u201cA teacher renewed for a fourth year of continuous employment is said to have tenure because his contract must be renewed.\u201d <em>Devlin </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>26 Conn. Sup. 102, 107, 213 A.2d 725 (1965). A teacher\u2019s contract is required to be in writing pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 10-151, which provides in part: \u201cThe contract of employment of a teacher shall be in writing .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Whether the plaintiff had achieved tenure is a question of fact. There was conflicting evidence before the court on this issue. \u201cThe weight given the evidence before it is within the sole province of the trial court.\u201d <em>Timm </em>v. <em>Timm, </em>195 Conn. 202, 210, 487 A.2d 191 (1985); see Holden &amp; Daly, Connecticut Evidence (1966 &amp; Sup. 1983) \u00a7 125 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Since the plaintiff was found to have been hired as a teacher under a written contract for only two years, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>the trial court could reasonably have concluded that the plaintiff lacked tenure and hence had no right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b647-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 10-151 (b) provides in part: \u201cBeginning with and subsequent to the fourth year of continuous employment of a teacher by a board of education . . . the contract of employment of a teacher shall be renewed from year to year . . . . \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
