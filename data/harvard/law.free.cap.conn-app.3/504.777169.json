Preiss claims that the trial court erred (1) in finding that he personally guaranteed the debt of the corporation in writing, and (2) in admitting parol evidence on the issue of whether he signed the guarantee as president of the corporation or in his personal capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">On July 11,1978, Preiss completed an application to purchase goods on credit from the plaintiff for the benefit of Solar. The relevant provision of the credit application provides as follows: \u201cIf the business is now or should in the future become a corporation, I still agree to be personally responsible at all times for any bill due to you.\u201d Beneath the provision appears the signature \u201cGordon W. Preiss President.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The corporate defendant, Solar, stipulated that it owed the debt in the amount of $4005.83 and judgment was rendered against it in that amount. The trial court, after a trial, found that the defendant Preiss was a personal guarantor of the corporations\u2019s debt under the credit application, and rendered judgment against him. Whether Preiss signed the application in a representative capacity was a question of fact determined by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the trial court. The reviewing court on appeal does not retry the facts or pass upon the credibility of the witnesses. See <em>Hobby </em>v. <em>Feldman, </em>2 Conn. App. 696, 482 A.2d 1226 (1984). The introduction of the testimony of Preiss regarding his intention as to the written guarantee was admitted at his own insistence. He cannot claim error in the admission of testimony which he introduced. See <em>Bansak </em>v. <em>Pawelczyk, </em>173 Conn. 520, 523, 378 A.2d 569 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
