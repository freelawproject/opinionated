He was notified of that denial by letter dated April 15, 1982. The administrator found that he had voluntarily left other, part-time employment. A referee affirmed that decision on May 27,1982, concluding that Oslund did not have <em>\u201ca </em>compelling personal reason for terminating this position and it, therefore, follows that he is subject to disqualification in consequence of this quit . . . .\u201d Oslund did not appeal that decision within the twenty-one days required by General Statutes \u00a7 31-248.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In the notice of the referee\u2019s decision, Oslund was told that the amount of overpayment to be reimbursed by him would be determined later. A hearing was held on that issue and, on August 24,1982, Oslund was notified that those arrearages amounted to $2117, which could be offset against future benefits. From this decision, Oslund appealed to the employment security board of review and, upon their affirmation, to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The trial court concluded that it had jurisdiction to hear the entire case, and that Oslund \u201cwas still entitled to receive benefits and he did not receive them \u2018through error.\u2019 \u201d On this basis, the court found the administrator\u2019s finding of an overpayment to be \u201carbitrary and illegal\u201d and sustained Oslund\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Although the trial court had jurisdiction over the appeal from the determination of the amount and method of overpayment received by Oslund, that determination was a separate and distinct proceeding from the determination of his ineligibility for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Oslund expressly admitted in his brief that \u201c[t]he decision as to eligibility was not appealed within twenty-one days and so it became final.\u201d Since an appeal from a decision of the referee must be made within twenty-one days,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellate review of the referee\u2019s decision on that point was outside of the trial court\u2019s limited power to review only claims where all of the statutory requirements have been met. <em>Mazur </em>v. <em>Blum, </em>184 Conn. 116, 119, 441 A.2d 65 (1981). The court could not, because of its jurisdiction over Oslund\u2019s appeal concerning the amount and form of repayment, thereby resuscitate a long dead appeal from the underlying decision of the administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Since the trial court erroneously found jurisdiction on the disqualification issue and reversed the administrator\u2019s decision of disqualification, it did not reach the plaintiff\u2019s claim on appeal over which it did have jurisdiction. That claim is that the administrator\u2019s finding of an overpayment, together with an order for repayment thereof, was arbitrary, illegal or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">There is error, the judgment of the trial court is set aside and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings to consider only the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the board\u2019s decision concerning arrearages and repayment thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-248 provides: \u201cAny decision of a referee in the absence of an appeal therefrom, as herein provided, shall become final on the twenty-second day after the date on which a copy of the decision is mailed to the party. Any decision may be reopened, vacated, set aside or modified, before the twenty-second day after that date on the motion of a party to the proceeding, or on the referee\u2019s own motion, on grounds of new evidence, or if the ends of justice so require upon good cause shown. The appeal period shall run from the mailing of a copy of the decision entered after such reopening or modification. Judicial review of any decision shall be permitted only after a party aggrieved thereby has exhausted his remedy before the board, as provided in this chapter. The administrator shall be deemed to be a party to any judicial proceeding involving any such decision and shall be represented in such proceeding by the attorney general.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-9\"> See footnote 1, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
