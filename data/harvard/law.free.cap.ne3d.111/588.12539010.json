(\"appellants\"), are appealing the jury verdict of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas awarding damages to appellee, S.T., a minor, by and through her mother and next friend, R.T. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND CASE HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This case arises from the treatment of then six year old S.T. by Dr. Knobeloch, a pediatrician, in the summer of 2012. S.T. was presenting significant behavioral issues in kindergarten which led to a consultation with Dr. Knobeloch. On June 4, 2012, Dr. Knobeloch referred S.T. for counseling with Karen Cowie, LSW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On July 31, 2012, S.T. and her mother met with Dr. Knobeloch for a behavioral consultation. Dr. Knobeloch gave a diagnosis of anxiety and panic disorder but did not rule out pediatric bipolar disorder. S.T. was prescribed 10 mg of Prozac. While the Prozac did seem to make some improvement in S.T.'s behavior, new behavior problems arose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On August 21, 2012, R.T. and Dr. Knobeloch discussed S.T.'s behavior. Dr. Knobeloch spoke with Ms. Cowie who indicated it was her impression that there were instances of mania being exhibited. Dr. Knobeloch, with this new information, now determined a different diagnosis of bipolar disorder though there was a question of whether Dr. Knobeloch told R.T. this new diagnosis. Dr. Knobeloch instructed R.T. to immediately stop giving the Prozac to S.T. and begin administering Lamictal with a one-time daily dose of 25 mg. Lamictal is an anti-epileptic drug that has been used off-label to treat pediatric bipolar disorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On September 4, 2012, Dr. Knobeloch increased the dosage of Lamictal to 50 mg per day after his nurse spoke to R.T. about S.T.'s behavior. On September 5, 2012, S.T. was seen by Dr. Knobeloch's partner, Brad Pfau, M.D. S.T. had what Dr. Pfau called bug bites and some sort of eye infection that blurred her vision and produced swollen dry eyes. S.T. was prescribed antibiotics as treatment. R.T. expressed her concern that the problems with S.T.'s eyes were related to the Lamictal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On September 7, 2012, S.T. was seen by Dr. Knobeloch. S.T. had redness and swelling around her eyes with a greenish discharge, had oral ulcers, and was covered in a target rash, which appeared as little bullseyes. R.T. also stated that S.T. had developed a high fever. Dr. Knobeloch diagnosed S.T. with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (\"SJS\"), a serious rash that develops painful sores and in which the skin sloughs off. SJS exhibits a targeted rash and the involvement of two mucus membranes, the eyes and mouth in this case. S.T. was taken directly to Nationwide Children's Hospital where she remained from September 7, to October 1, 2012. S.T. had to be placed in a medically induced coma to combat the pain of her skin sloughing off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On May 6, 2014, appellees filed suit against Dr. Knobeloch, American Health Network, Inc., and CVS pharmacy, claiming among others, medical malpractice, negligence, and a lack of informed consent. The claims centered on Dr. Knobeloch's improper prescription of Lamictal which allegedly proximately caused SJS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On August 15, 2016, a jury trial began and, over two weeks later, the jury returned a verdict. It found that Dr. Knobeloch had been negligent and there was a lack of informed consent while finding no liability as to CVS. The total verdict was $1,578,539.51. A remittitur reduced the verdict to $1,028,539.51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On October 31, 2016, the verdict was journalized creating a final appealable order. Appellants timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellants bring seven assignments of error for our consideration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   I. The trial court gave two improper jury instructions and failed to give a third instruction, which is prejudicial error.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   II. The court's repeated, leading, invasive interrogation of, and instructions to four of Plaintiffs' experts violated Evid.R. 614(B) and destroyed Defendants' right to receive a fair, impartial trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   III. The improper exclusion of liability expert, David Franz, M.D., denied Defendants a fair trial, prejudiced the defense before the jury and prohibited presentation of new, material evidence as represented in opening statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   IV. The court committed prejudicial error by submitting the unsupported informed consent claim to the jury and by overruling Defendants' repeated motions for directed verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   V. The jury had no competent evidence to find that Dr. Knobeloch's negligence caused harm by \"doubling the patient's dose of Lamictal without seeing the patient.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   VI. The court erred by admitting prejudicial, scientifically unreliable, misleading testimony that the dosage of Lamictal proximately caused this patient's SJS and by denying our repeated motions for a directed verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   VII. The court erred by admitting testimony of Drs. Kaye and Arrendondo, as their legal competency was never established pursuant to Evid.R. 601(D).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III. THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN GIVING THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 11} We will address the assignments of error in logical groupings. In the first assignment of error, appellants argue the trial court improperly gave jury instructions on the lack of informed consent and instructions on the Federal Drug Administration's (\"FDA\") \"Black Box\" warning. Appellants also argue the trial court erred in failing to give a failure to mitigate damages instruction to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 12} A trial court has discretion in deciding whether to give or refuse a particular instruction, and an appellate court will not disturb that decision absent an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Clark v.

From R.T.'s testimony, the jury could conclude that a reasonable person in R.T.'s position would have decided against using Lamictal had any risks and dangers been disclosed prior to the therapy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   {\u00b6 27} There exists in the record sufficient evidence that reasonable minds might reach the conclusion that there was a lack of informed consent.

Appellants claim that this instruction is improper and allows jurors to accept a standard of causation less than 51 percent by allowing the FDA warning to be considered in determining proximate cause. This argument is not well-taken. The jury instruction does not allow a lesser standard than a preponderance of evidence to be applied. It merely states that evidence of the warning may be considered on the issue of causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Further, the immediately preceding jury instruction specifically states that \"[y]ou will not reach the issue of proximate cause if you do not find by a preponderance of the evidence that [Appellants] were negligent.\" (Aug. 31, 2016 Jury Instructions at 11.)

When asked to a reasonable degree of medical certainty whether S.T. required any current psychiatric treatment, Dr. Prince answered that \"from the records that I had to review and look\n   at, I believe [S.T.] would benefit from some treatment.\" (Tr. 1576.) Then, when asked whether treatment would improve S.T.'s situation as opposed to no treatment at all, Dr. Prince responded only if someone wants to get help. \"The difficulty is, if someone doesn't want to get help, just showing up and trying to do counseling is not going to be helpful. It's a collaborative interactive process. It's not passive like surgery or things like that.\" (Tr. at 1576.) The testimony bears no relevance to the issue of whether psychiatric treatment would mitigate the effect of SJS.

Dr. Kaye earned his doctorate in pharmacology and teaches medicine specializing in anesthesia and pain. Dr. Kaye is also on an advisory board for anesthesia, analgesics, and addiction products for the FDA which reviews new drugs, and whether there should be black box warnings or guidelines. Dr. Kaye is also board certified in anesthesia and pain management. Dr. Kaye has extensive training in pharmacology and is the author of journals and textbooks. Dr. Kaye was qualified as an expert and his medical opinions do not rely only on the FDA \"black box\" warning as he has a career's worth of experience in pharmacology. Moreover, Dr. Kaye need not have prescribed or researched a specific drug in order to assist the jury in understanding the evidence and he need not be the best witness on the subject.\n   <em>\n    Alexander v. Mt. Carmel Med. Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6698556\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/56/155/#p159\">\n    56 Ohio St.2d 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 159,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=383%20N.E.2d%20564\">\n    383 N.E.2d 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Appellants argue SJS is not predictable and that a causal relationship between SJS and Lamictal is unproven. Based on his education, experience, and training, Dr. Kaye explained that the FDA warned of a rash that would cause the skin to slough off. When 10 percent of the skin sloughs off it is called Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. S.T. had in excess of 30 percent of her skin sloughing off which would classify as toxic epidermal necrolysis. The FDA warning had four aspects, the first one being unrelated to this case. The other three aspects (exceeding the recommended initial dose of Lamictal, exceeding the recommended dose escalation, and at the first sign of a rash to immediately discontinue Lamictal ) all occurred in this case. Dr. Kaye explained that in a study of children ages 2 to 16, approximately 8 out of 1,000 showed risk of SJS with an increased dose of Lamictal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   {\u00b6 47} There was abundant evidence that the improper prescription of Lamictal caused SJS. Dr. Kaye explained that the dosage prescribed was three to four times the recommended dosage. The higher amounts of Lamictal in a child's body increases the possibility there would be toxicity. If too much Lamictal is given initially, it quickly increases the risk of toxicity. In S.T.'s situation, the amount given was so high that it had a toxic effect, and the doubling of the dose further compounded this toxic effect. Dr. Kaye also opined that failure to stop the drug at the first sign of a rash also increased the likelihood of SJS. There was evidence presented that there is a causal relationship between SJS and Lamictal. The FDA warning and the study referenced show there is a connection. The actions of Dr. Knobeloch in prescribing too high of an initial dose, then increasing that dose above recommended levels, and failing to stop prescribing Lamictal at the initial appearance of a rash, all increased the risk of SJS developing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Dr. Kaye was qualified to give expert testimony of the causal connection between Lamictal and SJS. He then proceeded to give evidence of such a connection and that the actions of Dr. Knobeloch increased the risk of SJS at multiple points during the treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   {\u00b6 49} The sixth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE JURY'S VERDICT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   {\u00b6 50} In the fifth assignment of error, appellants argue there was no evidence presented that Dr. Knobeloch's failure\n   to see S.T. before doubling the dose of Lamictal proximately caused injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Appellants aver there is no competent evidence that failing to see S.T. on September 4, 2012 before increasing the dosage of Lamictal to 50 mg a day was a proximate cause of her injuries, sufficient to support the jury's affirmative answer to Jury Interrogatory No. 2. The second jury interrogatory read: \"If you found by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant, William Knobeloch, M.D., fell below the standard of care, do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that any such deviation proximately caused injury to Plaintiff, [S.T.]?\" (Aug. 31, 2016 Jury Interrogatory No. 2.)

Here, the court was clarifying under what circumstances Dr. Kaye was permitted to express his medical opinion. The court reminded Dr. Kaye that he was limited to opinions supported by a reasonable degree of medical certainty and probability. This clarification can be interpreted as beneficial to appellants as well as the appellees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   {\u00b6 61} Appellants take issue with the court reminding appellees' counsel of the limitations of their witnesses' testimony and sustaining the appellants' objections:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   Q.

The court is again clarifying the boundaries of what the witness can testify to. This is not a compelling example of bias. This exchange may be a situation in which appellees' counsel made a mistake, appellants objected, and the court sided with appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   {\u00b6 62} Appellants further argue that another instance of the court clarifying the limitation of a witness testimony is a compelling example of bias:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-207\">\n   MR.

This is not a compelling example of bias. The court is clarifying an ambiguity and controlling the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Appellants also argue that it was improper for the court to allow a witness, Helen Woodard, to recalculate damages so as not to confuse the jury. It is reasonable for the trial court to want the jury to hear a final dollar value of damages the life care planner was testifying to. The delay in the proceeding to allow for the recalculation was not evidence of bias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   {\u00b6 64} Appellants separately argue that the court improperly interrupted the cross-examination of one of appellees' witnesses. Appellants argue that the court changed a question about probability of developing SJS on a properly titrated dose of Lamictal into a question about possibility of developing SJS. This argument is without merit. The court gave appellants' counsel ample opportunity to clarify the line of questioning and to have the witnesses answer appellants' questions to counsel's satisfaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   {\u00b6 65} We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when interrogating various witnesses during the trial.

Dr. Prince, a pediatric psychiatrist, said that he was familiar with the pharmacological effects of Lamictal.

Dr. Kaye testified that he is a professor of anesthesia and pharmacology at Tulane University; an editor on a journal; edits many medical books; and serves on committees including an advisory board for the FDA. (Tr. at 537-39.) The trial court declared Dr. Kaye an expert witness and allowed him to express his opinions regarding pharmacology and drugs. However, before Dr. Kaye testified, the court reminded the parties outside the presence of the jury that a pair of rulings on appellees' motions had already been issued on this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   {\u00b6 79} The April 22, 2016 ruling prevented Dr. Kaye from testifying about Dr. Knobeloch's diagnosis of S.T. with bipolar disorder. Dr. Kaye is not a psychiatrist or pediatrician. The court found on the given state of the record that he did not have the expertise required to render an opinion on the diagnosis of bipolar disorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   {\u00b6 80} The court agreed with appellants that Dr. Kaye could not opine or give an opinion about whether or not Dr. Knobeloch breached the standard of pediatric care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   {\u00b6 81} The trial court did indicate that Dr. Kaye had the expertise to give an opinion about whether Dr. Knobeloch should have advised appellants of the black box warning, whether he prescribed incorrect dosages, whether S.T. suffered an adverse drug reaction and whether or not Dr. Knobeloch failed to diagnose and provide proper treatment for the alleged drug reaction. This testimony was within the realm of Dr. Kaye's expertise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   {\u00b6 82} The trial court overruled appellants' May 11, 2016 motion and stated that Dr. Kaye could testify as to the dosage and whether the over dosage caused the onset of SJS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   {\u00b6 83} During Dr. Kaye's testimony, at one point, he offered his opinion on the standard of care in diagnosing bipolar disorder. This was objected to and the trial court sustained the objection and told the jury to disregard the opinion.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-236\">\n   A. [Dr. Kaye].

The trial court was very careful to make sure that Dr. Kaye's testimony stayed within the limits of its prior rulings. Appellants argue that it was improper for Dr. Kaye to opine what Dr. Knobeloch's obligation to counsel the patient's family should be. However, that opinion related to the risks and benefits of a drug with a black box warning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   {\u00b6 84} The trial court reviewed Dr. Kaye's deposition testimony, credentials, qualifications, all other related evidence, the applicable law, and the parties arguments in rendering its opinion on Dr. Kaye's qualifications as an expert. It prohibited his testimony as to the standard of care in diagnosing bipolar disorder. When Dr. Kaye did offer his opinion on the standard of care, the trial court sustained the objection, told the jury to disregard the opinion, and pointed out to the jury that Dr. Kaye was not a pediatrician and could not testify about the diagnosis of patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   {\u00b6 85} Dr. Kaye is a professor at Tulane University but he is not a pediatrician or psychiatrist. This court has thoroughly reviewed this issue, and the record reveals that he is a professor.

The trial court did not abuse its discretion in outlining and enforcing the parameters of Dr. Kaye's testimony, or in finding that he was qualified to testify within certain limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   {\u00b6 86} Appellants also argue that Dr. Arredondo failed to qualify as an expert under Evid.R. 601(D). Dr. Arredondo stated his qualifications: he is board certified in psychiatry and neurology, he has been in continuous clinical practice since his residency with some in child and adolescent psychiatry. Dr. Arredondo is the medical director at a non-profit that provides mental health services for adolescents where there is an education component to his work. He also maintains a private practice where, among other services, he assesses youth who have been seen by other people, but it is not clear what the diagnosis might be or what the right treatment is. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in qualifying Dr. Arredondo as an expert and qualified to testify as to Dr. Knobeloch's liability under Evid.R. 601(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   {\u00b6 87} The seventh assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   <strong>\n    X. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   {\u00b6 88} Having overruled appellant's seven assignments of error, we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   KLATT and BRUNNER, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
