In support of their motion for a preliminary injunction, the Homeowners alleged that the City enforced the PMC in a manner that violated (1) Indiana Code Chapter 36-7-9, also known as the Indiana Unsafe Building Law (\"UBL\"), (2) the PMC itself, (3) the United States Constitution's Equal Protection Clause, and (4) the Indiana Constitution's Privileges and Immunities Clause. As to the first claim, the trial court found that the City is not required to follow either the UBL or the PMC exclusively. Because the trial court found that the City\n   is not required to follow the UBL, the trial court concluded that the Homeowners are unlikely to succeed on their claim that the City's manner of enforcing the PMC violates the UBL. However, the trial court also concluded that the Homeowners are likely to succeed on their remaining claims. Accordingly, the trial court issued findings of fact and conclusions thereon (\"the Appealed Order\") and a separate order granting the preliminary injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [2] The City appeals, arguing that the trial court clearly erred in concluding that the Homeowners are likely to succeed on their claims that the City's manner of enforcing the PMC violates the PMC, the Equal Protection Clause, and the Privileges and Immunities Clause. The Homeowners cross-appeal, arguing that the trial court clearly erred in concluding that they are unlikely to succeed on their claim that the City's manner of enforcing the PMC violates the UBL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [3] The issue raised in the Homeowners' cross-appeal is dispositive at this stage of the proceedings. As to that issue, we conclude that the trial court clearly erred in finding that the City is not required to follow the UBL. Specifically, we conclude that because the City has adopted the UBL, the City is required to act in accordance with its provisions. That does not mean that the PMC is without legal force, but rather that the City is precluded from enforcing the PMC in a manner that is inconsistent with the UBL. Because the trial court found that the City was not required to follow the UBL, the trial court did not address how the UBL impacts the City's enforcement of the PMC. Some of the provisions in the UBL are permissive, others are mandatory. Some provisions of the PMC may conflict with the UBL, some PMC provisions will be compatible with the UBL, and many PMC provisions will address subject matter not covered by the UBL. Therefore, we remand for the trial court to consider how the UBL and the PMC work together in light of our conclusion that the PMC must work within the confines and strictures of the UBL, and to reconsider the Homeowners' claim that the City's enforcement of the PMC violates the UBL. Further, because the trial court decided the Homeowners' remaining three claims based on the erroneous premise that the City was not required to follow the UBL, those claims, if the Homeowners choose to pursue them, will need to be reexamined. Accordingly, we reverse the Appealed Order and the order granting the preliminary injunction and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [4] The undisputed facts show that Pleasant Ridge is a neighborhood within the City of Charlestown.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appealed Order at 3 (finding # 8).

The UBL defines an \"unsafe building\" in relevant part as one that is \"dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of a statute or ordinance concerning building condition or maintenance.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-7-9-4\">\n    Ind.

The UBL provides procedural protections for property owners who receive an order to repair or rehabilitate an unsafe building, such as requirements as to the information to be included in an order, a \"sufficient time\" of ten to sixty days to make repairs before a fine may be imposed, a ten-day period to appeal the order, and limits on the civil penalty for noncompliance with an order to $2500 and on the accrual of such a civil penalty to not more than $1000 every ninety days.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-7-9-5\">\n    Ind.

Vol. 4 at 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the PMC contains provisions to enforce its safety requirements and standards, many of which address the same subject matter as the enforcement provisions in the UBL, such as provisions which govern orders and notice, the imposition of penalties, and the appeals process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-7-9-5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-7-9-5\">\n    at 8-9, 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Appealed Order at 5 (# 22). In August 2016, the City began inspecting Pleasant Ridge rental properties for PMC violations and issuing citations. The citations imposed a separate\n   fine for each violation, the fines were imposed as of the date the violation was discovered, and the fines began accumulating daily.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-7-9-5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-7-9-5\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (# 42).

In February 2017, the Homeowners moved for a preliminary injunction, asking the trial court to enjoin the City from continuing its practice of \"imposing ruinous fines that can be waived only by selling to the developer or tearing down one's own home\" to force Pleasant Ridge property owners to sell to the developer so that the developer can demolish every home and build a new subdivision. Appellants' App. Vol. 2 at 127-28. The motion for preliminary injunction was based on four of the eleven counts in the complaint; namely, that the City's manner of enforcing the PMC violated (1) the UBL, (2) the PMC itself, (3) the Equal Protection Clause, and (4) the Privileges and Immunities Clause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-7-9-16\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-7-9-16\">\n    at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [9] In September 2017, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing on the Homeowners' motion for preliminary injunction. In December 2017, the trial court issued the Appealed Order granting a preliminary injunction. As to the Homeowners' claim that the City's manner of enforcing the PMC violates the UBL, the trial court concluded that they are unlikely to prevail on that claim because the City is not required to follow the UBL. In relevant part, the trial court found that based on the plain language of the UBL and Indiana Code Chapter 36-1-3, also known as the Home Rule Act, the City was not required to exclusively follow the UBL. Appealed Order at 18-20 (# 83-92). The trial court also found that the citations are \"confusing as to what provisions of the UBL and/or the PMC it is that the City intends to operate under, but the court cannot find that they are REQUIRED to do one or the other exclusively.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-7-9-16\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-7-9-16\">\n    at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (# 92). The trial court declined the Homeowners' request to make specific findings regarding the City's violations of the UBL, although it found that the City \"made no effort to argue that it ha[d] complied with the procedural requirements\" of the UBL, and that \"if the UBL were mandatory, the City is not in compliance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-7-9-16\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-7-9-16\">\n    at 18, 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (# 82, 93).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [10] In contrast to its conclusion regarding the Homeowners' UBL claim, the trial court concluded that the Homeowners are likely to prevail on their claims that the City's manner of enforcing the PMC violated the PMC, the Equal Protection Clause, and the Privileges and Immunities Clause. The trial court concluded that because the Homeowners are likely to succeed on the merits of a claim that the government is violating the law, a preliminary injunction should issue under\n   Indiana's per se rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City now brings this interlocutory appeal.

Code \u00a7 36-7-9-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Significant to this case is that an unsafe building is one that is \"dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of [an] ordinance concerning building condition or maintenance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-7-9-4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The UBL itself does not contain any specific building safety standards, but it clearly anticipates that municipalities have or will adopt ordinances with such safety standards.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [17] The UBL provides local governments with procedures to enforce compliance with local building ordinances. Section 36-7-9-5(a) provides,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The enforcement authority\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   issue an order requiring action relative to any\n   <em>\n    unsafe premises\n   </em>\n   , including ... repair or rehabilitation of an unsafe building\n   <em>\n    to bring it into compliance with standards\n   </em>\n   for building condition or maintenance required for human habitation, occupancy, or use by a statute, a rule adopted under IC 4-22-2, or\n   <em>\n    an ordinance\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (Emphases added.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   By its plain terms, Section 36-7-9-5(a) governs orders that apply to \"unsafe premises,\" which is a term specifically defined in Section 36-7-9-4. Therefore, the orders governed by Section 36-7-9-5(a) apply to buildings that are dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of an ordinance concerning building condition or maintenance.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-7-9-4\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 36-7-9-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We note that because Section 36-7-9-5 provides that the \"enforcement authority\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   issue an order,\" the enforcement authority is not required to issue an order. Although part of Section 36-7-9-5(a) is permissive, it also contains mandatory provisions: \"Notice of the order\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be given under section 25 of this chapter. The ordered action\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be reasonably related to the condition of the unsafe premises and the nature and use of nearby properties.\" (Emphases added.) Accordingly, by their plain terms, these provisions of the UBL apply whenever the enforcement authority does choose to issue an order relative to any buildings that are dangerous to a person or property because of a violation of an ordinance concerning building condition or maintenance. Local governments that have adopted the UBL are required to comply with these and other such mandatory provisions. As previously mentioned, the UBL provides procedural protections for property owners who receive an order to repair or rehabilitate an unsafe building, such as requirements as to the information to be included in an order, a \"sufficient time\" of ten to sixty days to make repairs before a fine may be imposed, a ten-day period to appeal the order, and limits on the civil penalty for noncompliance with an order to $2500 and on the accrual of such a civil penalty to not more than $1000 every ninety days.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-7-9-5\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7\u00a7 36-7-9-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) - (c), -7(a), -7.5(b)-(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [18] In 2008, the City adopted the PMC, which sets forth specific building and property standards to insure public health, safety and welfare. Pursuant to the UBL's plain terms, a violation of the PMC safety standards that renders a building dangerous to a person or property is an unsafe building to which the UBL applies.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-7-9-4\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 36-7-9-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5). As discussed, the UBL does not provide specific building safety standards, so in this respect, the PMC is complementary to the UBL. However, the PMC contains its own enforcement provisions, such as those which govern notice of violations, the imposition of penalties, and the appeals process, which overlap with but differ from the UBL enforcement provisions. Ex. Vol. 4 at 8-9, 11. The City argues that pursuant to the Home Rule Act, it is not required to follow the enforcement provisions of the UBL but rather is empowered to choose whether to operate under the UBL or the PMC. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   [19] It is true, as the City asserts, that the Home Rule Act implements the \"policy of the state ... to grant units all the powers that they need for the effective operation of government as to local affairs.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-1-3-2\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 36-1-3-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the Home Rule Act provides that \"a unit has: all powers granted it by statute; and all other powers necessary or desirable in the conduct of its affairs, even though not\n   granted by statute.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-1-3-4\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 36-1-3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). However, the Home Rule Act also provides that \"[i]f there is a constitutional or statutory provision requiring a specific manner for exercising a power, a unit wanting to exercise the power must do so in that manner.\" Ind. Code. \u00a7 36-1-3-6. Given that the City has adopted the UBL, the Home Rule Act, by its plain terms, requires the City to obey the UBL.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the PMC explicitly provides, \"This ordinance does not supersede Federal or State laws, statutes or regulations, except as allowed.\" Ex. Vol. 4 at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   [20] Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the City is required to comply with the UBL and that the City must enforce the PMC within the confines and strictures of the UBL. Accordingly, the trial court clearly erred in finding that the City is not required to follow the UBL. Because the trial court found that the UBL was not mandatory, the trial court did not address how the UBL impacts the City's enforcement of the PMC. Some of the provisions in the UBL are permissive, others are mandatory. Some provisions of the PMC may conflict with the UBL, some provisions will be compatible with the UBL, and many provisions will address subject matter not covered by the UBL. Therefore, we remand for the trial court to consider how the UBL and the PMC work together in light of our conclusion that the City is bound to enforce the PMC in accordance with the UBL, and to reconsider the Homeowners' claim that the City's manner of enforcing the PMC violates the UBL. Further, because the trial court based its conclusions regarding the Homeowners' remaining claims on the erroneous premise that the City is not required to follow the UBL, those claims, if the Homeowners choose to pursue them, will need to be reexamined. As such, we need not address the issues raised by the City. We reverse the Appealed Order and the order granting the preliminary injunction and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   [21] Reversed and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Bailey, J., and Brown, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Because the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions thereon set forth the terms of the preliminary injunction, thereby duplicating the trial court's separate order granting the preliminary injunction, for simplicity's sake, we generally refer to the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions thereon as the Appealed Order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    In its appellants' brief, the City states that it contests many of the facts found in the Appealed Order, but they do not challenge the facts presented here.

It is true that the UBL does not contain specific safety regulations. As discussed, the UBL anticipates that municipalities have or will adopt specific safety regulations. In addition, the UBL does not prohibit local units from choosing their own means of enforcement. However, the City chose to adopt the UBL, and therefore it is bound by the enforcement provisions of the UBL.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
