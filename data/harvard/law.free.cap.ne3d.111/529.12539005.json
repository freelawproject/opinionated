Defendant-appellant Mercy St. Vincent Medical Center appeals the August 17, 2017 judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, which granted the plaintiffs' motion to compel, in part, and ordered Mercy St. Vincent to produce \"any documents responsive to plaintiffs' request for production Nos. 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25.\" For the following reasons, we reverse the trial court's order, in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On March 3, 2014, plaintiffs-appellees Kelsie Cousino, a minor, by and through her mother and next friend Jackie Cousino, and Kelsie's parents, Andy and Jackie Cousino, filed an action against Mercy St. Vincent, Dr. Fouad Butto, M.D., Catholic Health Partners, ProMedica Health System, Inc., ProMedica Physician Group, Inc., ProMedica Central Physicians LLC, and Toledo Children's Heart Center, alleging that defendants were liable for injuries sustained by Kelsie Cousino when Dr. Butto, a pediatric cardiologist, performed a cardiac catheterization on her at Mercy St. Vincent on November 15, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Cousinos eventually settled their medical malpractice claim against Dr. Butto, and dismissed the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} A few months later, on August 15, 2016, the Cousinos refiled their action against a single defendant, Mercy St. Vincent, alleging that it negligently credentialed Dr. Butto (first count), that its actions constituted gross negligence and/or willful or wanton misconduct (second count), and that Andy and Jackie Cousino suffered loss of consortium due to their daughter Kelsie's injuries (third count).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The Cousinos served a first set of requests for production of documents with their complaint. In its written response, Mercy St. Vincent objected to many of the requests on several grounds, including that the requests seek information that is protected by Ohio's peer review privilege ( R.C. 2305.252 and 2305.253 ), the attorney-client privilege, and work product doctrine. On November 7, 2016, plaintiffs filed a motion to compel and for sanctions. Mercy St. Vincent opposed plaintiffs' motion on December 7, 2016, and filed two separate affidavits in support of its privilege claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Mercy St. Vincent submitted an affidavit from Charla Ulrich, Director of Quality and Infection Control at Mercy St. Vincent, in which she provided the following testimony relevant to this appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   6. MSVMC\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   has a peer review process which involves several committees that conduct, among other things, credentialing, quality assurance and performance improvement activities for MSVMC. Their activities are confidential.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   7. MSVMC has a medical staff peer review committee that consists of actively practicing physicians and their staff which conducts quality assurance and performance improvement activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   8. MSVMC has a separate credentialing committee and a Medical Executive Committee which conducts credentialing activities of providers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   9. Documents generated by a peer review committee or the credentials committee are placed in each physician's file, kept at the hospital.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   10. The credentialing file of Fouad Butto, M.D. consists entirely of documents generated by and created solely for use by the credentials committee, the Medical Executive Committee, and the Board of Directors in their review of his professional qualifications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   11. Depending upon the severity of the injury or potential injury to a patient from care he or she received while at MSVMC, one or more of the committees in MSVMC's peer review process will view any resulting incident report: (a) individually for quality assurance and performance improvement purposes; and/or (b) collectively with other reports prepared over a period of time for purposes of identifying quality and performance trends and issues.* * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Mercy St. Vincent also submitted an affidavit from Denise Fowler, its Risk Manager, in which she testified that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1. Incident reports and 'liability prevention activities'\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   are part of the hospital's peer review and quality process improvement and any related records\n   are created for the purpose of quality improvement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   2. Activities and documents related to claims reviews and risk management are undertaken or prepared in anticipation of litigation under the direction of risk management, legal counsel and/or general counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On August 16, 2017, the trial court entered judgment on plaintiffs' motion to compel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court found that Mercy St. Vincent established the existence of a committee that meets the statutory definition of \"peer review committee\" under R.C. 2305.25(E) and that \"any responsive documents within these requests that are created exclusively by and/or for the use of the peer review committees are privileged * * *.\" The trial court went on to conclude, however, that \"defendant may also have responsive documents that originally were either created or used by the hospital for other purposes.\" That is, while the trial court recognized that Mercy St. Vincent \"provided evidence that Dr. Butto's credentialing file consists exclusively of documents created by and solely for the use of the credentials committee, the Medical Executive Committee, and the board of directors, defendant has not presented any evidence that there is not a personnel file or other responsive documents outside of the credentialing file.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Ultimately, the trial court denied the Cousinos' motion to compel with respect to requests for production Nos. 2, 3, 6, 9, 15, 17, and 18, but granted the motion with respect to requests for production Nos. 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25, finding that Mercy St. Vincent \"has not established that the list of documents responsive to these requests contain only documents created exclusively for the use of the peer review committees and not for other purposes within the hospital.\" The trial court also found that with respect to requests for production Nos. 23 and 24, Mercy St. Vincent failed to meet its burden of showing that the requested information is protected by either the attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The court then ordered Mercy St. Vincent to produce \"any documents responsive to\" the following requests within 14 days:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1. The entire personnel file for Fouad Butto, M.D. from Defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   4.

It assigns a single assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO COMPEL AND ORDERING MERCY ST. VINCENT MEDICAL CENTER TO PRODUCE CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED DOCUMENTS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Mercy St. Vincent argues that the trial court erred when it ordered Mercy St. Vincent to produce \"any documents\" responsive to requests for production Nos. 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25 because at least some responsive documents are confidential and privileged under (1) Ohio's peer review privilege, R.C. 2305.252 and 2305.253, and (2) the attorney-client privilege. And although not specifically assigned as error, Mercy St. Vincent also argues that the trial court erred by ordering the production of responsive documents beyond the date of injury, November 12, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 12} As a preliminary matter, Article IV, Section 3(B)(2) of the Ohio Constitution limits this court's jurisdiction to the review of \"judgments or final orders of the [trial] courts.\" A trial court's discovery orders are generally interlocutory and, therefore, not immediately appealable.\n   <em>\n    Mezatasta v.

A judgment that compels the production of documents or information that is alleged to be protected by the peer review privilege is, however, a final order and therefore immediately appealable. R.C. 2305.252 (\"An order by a court to produce for discovery or for use at trial the proceedings or records described in this section is a final order.\"). Similarly, the Supreme Court of Ohio has recognized that a \"[a]n order compelling the production of materials alleged to be protected by the attorney-client privilege is a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02(B)(4).\"\n   <em>\n    Burnham v.

But by enacting this law, the Ohio Legislature made a policy decision that it is more important to protect the absolute confidentiality of a credentialing committee's proceedings and records to ensure that its participants are free to engage in a meaningful and honest review of its providers, which should lead to the overall improvement of health care services as a whole. Given that public policy is the province of the legislature, not the court, we are bound to enforce the law as written.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 34} And although it is difficult to prove a negligent credentialing claim, it is not impossible.

And although the work product doctrine extends beyond confidential communications and protects any document \"prepared in anticipation of litigation\" by a party or a party's representative under Civ.R. 26(B)(6)(a), Mercy St. Vincent does not argue on appeal that it is withholding any documents on the basis of work product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Under Civ.R. 26(B)(6)(a), when a party withholds information or documents under a claim of privilege, \"the claim shall be made expressly and shall be supported by a description of the nature of the documents, communications, or things\n   not produced that is sufficient to enable the demanding party to contest the claim.\" Generally speaking, \"[w]ithout identification of the documents by the party seeking protection, the party seeking the information is unable to challenge the soundness of its claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Owens v.

Mercy St. Vincent has met its burden of demonstrating that the entire credentialing file is unconditionally privileged and immune from discovery under R.C. 2305.252. Mercy St. Vincent must, however, produce any documents that are responsive to these requests\n   <em>\n    and that are not contained in Dr. Butto's credentialing file\n   </em>\n   within 14 days of this decision. To the extent that Mercy St. Vincent believes that any responsive documents outside the credentialing file are privileged under R.C. 2305.252 or 2305.253, it must establish the privilege as to each specific document, via affidavit testimony, and submit the disputed documents under seal to the trial court within 14 days of this decision for an in-camera review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 50} We also reverse the trial court's order to the extent that its order compelling the production of \"any documents\" responsive to requests Nos. 23 and 24 would have required the production of documents protected by the attorney-client privilege. We order Mercy St. Vincent to construct a privilege log pursuant to Civ.R. 26(B)(6)(a) on remand and to submit the privilege log along with the identified documents under seal to the trial court, within 14 days of this decision, for an in-camera review. Mercy St. Vincent's privilege log should also list any documents located\n   <em>\n    outside\n   </em>\n   the credentialing file that it claims are protected by the peer review privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 51} To be clear, Mercy St. Vincent need not identify or submit any documents\n   that are found exclusively within Dr. Butto's credentialing file, which is absolutely privileged and immune from discovery under R.C. 2305.252.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Mercy St. Vincent's assignment of error is found well-taken.
