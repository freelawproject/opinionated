We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Lee was found guilty of two counts of aggravated robbery, a first-degree felony, in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1) ; four counts of robbery, a second-degree felony, in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(1) and (2) ; two counts of robbery, a third-degree felony, in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(3) ; one count of kidnapping, a first-degree felony, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(2) ; and two counts of petty theft, a first-degree misdemeanor, in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1). Each count, with the exception of the two petty theft counts, contained a one-and three-year firearm specification. The trial court merged the aggravated robbery and robbery counts, and the state elected to have Lee sentenced on just the aggravated robbery counts. The trial court sentenced Lee to a total of 14-years imprisonment and advised Lee that he would be placed on postrelease control for five years following his prison term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Voir Dire\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Lee exercised his right to a jury trial. During voir dire, the state excused one of the African-American jurors. Lee's counsel challenged the state's request and stated, \"[s]o, judge, before I get to mine, I'll just make a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge in the sense that there's two African-American jurors out of 22, and number 12 is African-American.\" (Tr. 485.) The trial court replied, \"[a]ll right. Does the State of Ohio wish to place neutral reasons for excusing juror number 12?\" (Tr. 486.) The state answered the trial court by stating,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Yes. It's not his race. It's the fact that as a pastor he's been involved with the criminal justice system before. He's been here for sentencings. He is involved. He's involved at the juvenile detention center. He's an advocate for victims, both victims or defendants. And the fact that he's assisted family members that were accused of crimes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Tr. 486.) To which the trial court replied, \"Okay. So for those neutral reasons I'll deny the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   Challenge.\" (Tr. 486.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On May 14, 2016, Liam McDonald (\"McDonald\"), a pizza delivery driver for Marco's Pizza, testified that he went to deliver a pizza to a Cleveland Heights address. After parking his car and exiting the vehicle, he approached the residence and was confronted by Lee. McDonald asked if Lee ordered a pizza, but Lee did not respond and instead pointed a small gun at McDonald. Two other men approached McDonald and surrounded him. Lee demanded that McDonald get on the ground and hand over his keys and wallet. As McDonald hesitated, Lee pressed the gun to McDonald's head and stated, \"someone is going to get popped.\" (Tr. 532.) McDonald threw his keys, the pizza, and his cell phone on the ground. Lee took the pizza and McDonald's keys and drove away in McDonald's vehicle. No one took his cell phone so McDonald called his boss Gregory Garbaloff (\"Garbaloff\") to report the incident. Garbaloff called 911. Police officers from the Cleveland Heights Police Department arrived and took McDonald's statement. During a photo array conducted by a blind administrator, McDonald identified one man with 50 percent certainty and Lee with 60 percent certainty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On May 18, 2016, Mark Churchill (\"Churchill\"), a pizza delivery driver for Pizza Hut, testified that he went to deliver\n   a pizza to another Cleveland Heights address. As Churchill approached the residence, Lee confronted him with a gun and told Churchill to \"drop everything.\" (Tr. 793.) Churchill quickly dropped everything in his hands, including the pizza and his car keys. He then ran down the street. Lee pursued Churchill, but stopped after another car turned onto the street. Churchill was able to flag down a police cruiser and explain what happened. The police officer went back to the crime scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Lee's codefendant Bernie Burkhalter III (\"Burkhalter\") testified at trial that he and Lee planned and executed both robberies. Burkhalter stated that he, Lee, and another man decided to rob a pizza deliveryman. On May 14, 2016, from his cell phone, Lee called the order and then proceeded down the street to wait for the pizzas to arrive. Once McDonald arrived, Lee confronted him with a small, black gun, pointed it at McDonald, and threatened to shoot him. Burkhalter picked up the pizzas and ran back to the house where Lee eventually arrived. Burkhalter testified that on May 18, 2016, he and Lee planned another robbery of a Pizza Hut delivery driver. Lee placed the order on his phone. Lee and Burkhalter approach Churchill, and Lee pointed a gun and told Churchill to drop everything. The deliveryman ran away, and Lee started chasing him. Burkhalter again picked up the pizzas and ran back to the house where he met Lee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The three officers that responded to the May 14, 2016 robbery testified. Officer Antoine Danford testified that he located McDonald's stolen, unoccupied vehicle around the corner from the robbery. The keys were still in the ignition, and the vehicles were searched prior to being towed. Officer Trevor Harris testified that he collected fingerprints, DNA swabs, and other evidence from the vehicle. Sergeant Michael D'Amico testified that the fingerprints lifted from the stolen vehicle that belonged to Rashad Patterson, a friend of Lee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Officer Jemond Riffe (\"Officer Riffe\"), the police officer who responded to the May 18, 2016 robbery, testified that he spoke to Churchill, who recounted how he was robbed at gunpoint. Officer Riffe went back to the crime scene and located a receipt for a Pizza Hut delivery order. There was a phone number on the receipt, and Officer Riffe called the number. He heard a voicemail message saying, \"This is Earron's phone.\" (Tr. 747.) Also Detective Michael Reese (\"Detective Reese\") investigated the phone number and discovered that it was associated with Lee. Detective Reese located Lee's residence, which was in close proximity to both robberies. A search was conducted of Lee's residence, and a fresh Pizza Hut box was located in the basement. A search was conducted at Burkhalter's residence. The police located a pizza warmer bag. Burkhalter's mother voluntarily gave the police two BB guns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Lee testified that Burkhalter used Lee's cell phone to order the pizzas, and that he was not involved in the robberies. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found Lee guilty and he was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment. As a result, he filed this appeal assigning five errors for our review.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   I.

It was determined from the record that it was counsel's trial strategy to have a combined trial of the indictments. Therefore, there would not have been an objection. Also, Lee has not directed us to anything in the record that would show that, but for the error, the outcome of the trial would have been different. We find no manifest miscarriage of justice.
