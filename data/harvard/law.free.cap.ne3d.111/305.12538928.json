On appeal, he claims (1) G. L. c. 209A is unconstitutional and (2) the abuse prevention order issued against him should be vacated, asserting there was insufficient evidence to support it.

Assuming the matter is properly before us, see G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 8, the defendant makes a facial claim that G. L. c. 209A violates the due process rights of defendants. We disagree. \"Whether a defendant's constitutional rights have been violated will depend on the fairness of a particular proceeding.\"\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Frizado\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Frizado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"826154\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/420/592/#p598\">\n    420 Mass. 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 598 (1995). Due process fundamentally requires a defendant an opportunity to be heard, a right to present evidence, and a general right to cross-examine witnesses.

This case illustrates the due process protections that are available under the statute. On April 21, 2017, an evidentiary hearing was held for a judge to determine whether the abuse prevention order against the defendant should be extended. During that hearing, the defendant was present in the courtroom, was represented by counsel, and was provided an opportunity to be heard. He was permitted to testify on his own behalf and his attorney cross-examined the plaintiff. The defendant was also able to present evidence including a police report from an earlier incident. He received all the process he was due.\n   <footnotemark xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The order in this case\n   </em>\n   . An abuse prevention order may be extended if it is demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the order is necessary to protect the party from \"abuse\" as defined in G.
