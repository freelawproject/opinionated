(\"Wilke Global\") and Michael Wilke (\"Wilke\") (collectively \"appellees\"). For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Wilke is the CEO and President of Wilke Global, a company that develops and sells software systems. In 2007, Wilke hired appellant to work as a salesperson for Wilke Global. Appellant was hired to sell Wilke Global's main product, the consumer response system (\"CRS\") to new customers. Appellant's job duties also included managing existing accounts and selling additional products or modules to existing customers. When appellant was hired she was given the existing customer accounts located to the west of the Mississippi River from Leo Corrigan, the only other person on the sales team. Appellant received compensation both in the form of salary and commissions from new sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In January 2010, Jason Dichter was hired by Wilke Global for its sales\n   team. At the time of hiring, Dichter received compensation in the form of salary, which was $36,000 higher than appellant's salary at the time of her hiring, and a guaranteed monthly commission rate. After his initial year, Dichter received compensation only in the form of salary because he and Wilke Global could not agree on a commission plan. Initially, Dichter's responsibilities included only new sales, as he was not given any existing accounts to manage. However, when Dichter made a sale to a new customer, he received that account to manage. When Corrigan retired, Dichter received most of Corrigan's existing accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In 2013, Wilke informed appellant she was not bringing enough value to the company. In September 2013, Tim Nichols, the chief strategy officer for Wilke Global, began working with appellant to develop a new compensation plan with the goal of incentivizing appellant to make more new sales. Appellant prepared several drafts of compensation plans in conjunction with Nichols. On November 17, 2013, Wilke rejected the compensation plan as proposed by appellant and Nichols.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In 2014, Arthur Rohde was hired by Wilke Global for its sales team. Initially, Rohde was hired to make sales to large accounts, and he was not given any existing accounts to manage at the time of his hiring. However, Rohde's responsibilities eventually transitioned to a mix of account management and sales. Rohde received compensation in the form of salary, which was equal to Dichter's at the time of hiring, and commissions based on a percentage of the revenue generated by sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On September 30, 2014, Wilke sent appellant a draft of a new compensation plan that lowered appellant's base salary and restructured her commission plan. Wilke planned to implement appellant's compensation plan on December 1, 2014, but did not implement the plan until January 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On January 26, 2015, appellant called Diane Moore, Wilke Global's office manager and bookkeeper, and left a voicemail expressing her dissatisfaction with the new compensation plan. On January 27, 2015, Moore sent appellant an e-mail responding to the voicemail. On the same day, appellant replied to Moore's e-mail. When Moore received appellant's e-mail response, she forwarded the e-mail to Wilke, left the office, and did not return to work until February 2, 2015. On January 27, 2015, appellant, after sending her e-mail to Moore, sent an e-mail to Wilke regarding the changes to her compensation plan, to which Wilke responded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On February 2, 2015, Wilke and Moore spoke about Moore's reaction to appellant's communications. On February 5, 2015, Wilke sent appellant an e-mail terminating appellant's employment effective the same day. At the time of her termination, appellant was one of three members on the sales team, including Dichter and Rohde. On February 8, 2016, Wilke Global hired Kyle Spittler, a 28-year-old male, to work for the sales team.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On October 16, 2015, appellant filed a complaint in the trial court asserting claims of gender discrimination, age discrimination, retaliation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. On December 17, 2015, appellees filed an answer and motion to dismiss. On January 5, 2016, appellant filed a memorandum in opposition to appellees' motion to dismiss and a motion for leave to amend the complaint. On January 12, 2016, appellees filed a memorandum contra appellant's motion for leave to amend the complaint. On the same date, appellees filed a reply in support of their motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On August 19, 2016, appellees filed a motion for summary judgment. On\n   October 3, 2016, appellant filed a memorandum in opposition to appellees' motion for summary judgment. On October 13, 2016, appellees filed a reply in support of their motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On December 14, 2016, the trial court filed a decision and entry granting in part and denying in part appellees' December 17, 2015 motion to dismiss and granting in part and denying in part appellant's January 5, 2016 motion to amend her complaint. On December 19, 2016, appellant filed her first amended complaint. On December 28, 2016, appellees filed an answer to appellant's first amended complaint. On May 25, 2017, appellant filed a notice of dismissal of her claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. On May 26, 2017, the trial court filed a decision and entry granting appellees' August 19, 2016 motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellant appeals and assigns the following four assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   I. The Trial Court Committed Reversible Error By Finding That Appellant Was Not Replaced By A Similarly Situated, Male Employee For The Purposes Of Establishing Gender Discrimination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   II. The Trial Court Committed Reversible Error By Not Finding That Appellant Was Replaced By A Younger Employee For The Purposes Of Establishing Age Discrimination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   III. The Trial Court Committed Reversible Error By Not Finding That Appellant Established Pretext Regarding Her Retaliatory Discharge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   IV. The Trial Court Committed Reversible Error By Finding That Appellant Was Not Able To Establish Pretext Regarding Appellees' Proffered Reason For the Reduction In Her Salary For The Purposes of Establishing Gender And/Or Age Discrimination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Because some of appellant's assignments of error are interrelated, we shall address them together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

In her amended complaint, appellant asserted a claim of discrimination on the basis of gender with regard to an alleged reduction in her salary. Appellant also asserted claims of discrimination on the basis of gender and age with regard to the termination of her employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 25} With regard to the reduction in her salary, appellees contended appellant was unable to establish the second and\n   fourth elements of her prima facie case, namely that she suffered an adverse employment action and a similarly situated non-protected person was treated more favorably. The trial court found a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the change in salary constituted an adverse employment action. The trial court then, assuming without deciding that appellant could establish that a similarly situated non-protected person was treated more favorably, proceeded to analyze appellees' asserted legitimate non-discriminatory reason for the reduction in salary. Finding that appellees met their burden, the court found appellant failed to offer any evidence rebutting appellees' asserted legitimate non-discriminatory reason. As a result, the court found appellant failed to demonstrate that appellees' reason was pretext for unlawful discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Next, the trial court considered appellant's claims of gender and age discrimination as related to the termination of her employment. The trial court concluded appellant failed to establish the fourth prong of the prima facie case, namely that she was replaced. The court also found under a reduction-in-force analysis that appellant failed to present additional evidence that she was singled out for impermissible reasons. As a result, the trial court concluded appellant could not establish a prima facie case of gender or age discrimination arising from the termination of her employment. The trial court made no findings regarding appellees' asserted legitimate non-discriminatory reason for her termination or appellant's argument that appellees' asserted reason was pretext for unlawful discrimination. Having briefly summarized appellant's claims and the trial court's findings, we now turn to appellant's assertion in her first, second, and fourth assignments of error that the trial court erred in finding she failed to establish a prima facie case of gender and age discrimination with regard to the termination of her employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In response, appellant asserted that she was replaced by Spittler, or, alternatively, was eliminated due to a reduction in force. The trial court found that Spittler did not replace appellant because \"[s]imply noting that Mr. Spittler is a member of Wilke Global's sales force is not evidence that Mr. Spittler replaced [appellant].\" (May 26, 2017 Decision at 5.) Next, the court found appellant failed to demonstrate she was terminated due to a reduction in force because\n   she failed to \"produce additional evidence that [appellees] discriminated against her on the basis of her gender.\" (May 26, 2017 Decision at 5.) In her first and second assignments of error, appellant argues the trial court erred in making these determinations and in thus finding appellant had not established a prima facie case with regard to the age and gender discrimination claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Appellees offer several reasons to rebut appellant's claim that she was replaced by Spittler. First, appellees assert that \"there is no evidence [that Spittler] was hired to perform [appellant's] duties,\" but rather that appellant's \"duties were absorbed by other Wilke Global employees.\" (Reply Brief in Support of Sum. Jgmt. at 5; Motion for Sum. Jgmt. at 12.) In support of this, appellant cites to Spittler's deposition testimony in which he stated it was his understanding that he was \"in a new role at [Wilke Global].\" (Spittler Depo. at 18.) Appellees assert that Spittler's duties were \"100%\" selling add-ons to existing customers, whereas appellant's duties included, in addition to selling add-ons to existing customers, selling CRS systems to new customers and account management. (Reply Brief in Support of Sum.

Dichter, Spittler, and Wilke all stated that, following appellant's termination, the sales team consisted of Dichter, Rohde, and Spittler. Wilke agreed \"[t]o a certain degree\" that \"although the distribution may be different, all of the people on the sales force had the basic responsibilities of sales and account management.\" (Wilke Depo. at 151.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Appellant stated her responsibilities included an equal share of new sales and current account management. Appellant stated that her account management responsibilities included selling \"new features or modules\" to existing clients. (Housden Depo. at 142.) When Rohde was hired, Wilke sent an e-mail stating that appellant would be focusing on \"new smaller accounts and existing accounts.\" (Wilke Depo., Ex. 40.) Appellant testified she received a base salary in addition to commission on sales to new customers. Spittler stated his duties included \"maintain[ing] relationships with our existing clients and attempt[ing] to sell new products and features within that client base.\" (Spittler Depo. at 15.) In addition to his base salary, Spittler received a commission based on expected first year annualized revenue from a new sale. Spittler testified that, although his role was primarily with existing customers, he had \"brought in a new customer, but they were [in a] different market of an existing customer.\" (Spittler Depo. at 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Dichter testified that following appellant's termination, there was a discussion regarding hiring another person to perform some of appellant's duties. Specifically, Dichter stated that \"it made sense for us to hire an inexperienced account manager after [appellant] had gone, and the goal of them was to sell those ancillary products and modules to existing CRS clients.\" (Dichter Depo. at 53.) Further, Dichter stated that \"we thought it might make sense to hire somebody who was junior, not in age but junior in career, longevity, to manage various accounts that we needed to be managed.\" (Dichter Depo. at 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Appellees contend that \"[a]n employee is replaced only where 'another employee is hired or reassigned to perform the plaintiff's duties.' \" (Appellees' Brief at 27, quoting\n   <em>\n    Grosjean v.

However, a person is not replaced when another employee is assigned to perform the plaintiff's duties in addition to other duties, or when the work is redistributed among other existing employees already performing related work.

Indeed, appellees specifically state that appellant \"was not terminated due to a reduction in force.\" (Appellees' Brief at 29.) Furthermore, no evidence in the record supports the conclusion that appellees \"consolidated jobs in order to eliminate excess worker capacity.\"\n   <em>\n    Wise\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10, quoting\n   <em>\n    Woods v.

Thus, we are not bound to follow the dictates of\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   and related cases which analyzed replacement in the context of an alleged workforce reduction. Furthermore, we find no error with the trial court's determination that appellant failed to demonstrate she was terminated due to a reduction in force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Instead, we find Dichter's statements evince that Spittler was hired in response to appellant's termination to perform at least some of the same duties that appellant had performed. This is supported by Wilke's testimony that although the exact distribution of sales to existing customers and sales to new customers differed among the members of the sales team, the basic responsibilities of sales and account management were the same. As it is undisputed that both appellant and Spittler were considered to be members of the sales team, the record reflects they shared, at a minimum, some similar duties and responsibilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Appellees contend Spittler did not replace appellant because he was hired with a different title and substantially lower compensation. During her time at Wilke Global, appellant's title changed from senior account manager or senior account executive to director of sales to vice president of business development. Appellant stated none of her job responsibilities changed when her title changed. Spittler agreed that although his title was account executive, the primary goal of his position was sales. Wilke stated the titles for the members of the sales force \"had no indication as far as what their duties were on a day-to-day basis.\" (Wilke Depo. at 151.) Based on this, we cannot find that the\n   differences in title between appellant and Spittler to be dispositive of the question of replacement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 38} With regard to Spittler's lower compensation, we recognize that some courts have held that differing amounts of compensation can be relevant in determining whether a person served as a replacement. However, we also recognize that employers attempt to justify the replacement of older, more experienced employees with younger, less experienced employees on the basis of cost savings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Metz v. Transit Mix, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747827\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/828/1202/#p1208\">\n    828 F.2d 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1208 (7th Cir.1987) ;\n   <em>\n    James v.

Furthermore, courts have stated that the fourth requirement of the prima facie case does not require that \"a plaintiff and her replacement must be similarly qualified,\" but instead \"requires a plaintiff to show only that she 'was replaced by a person outside the protected class.' \"\n   <em>\n    Vincent v.

As a result, we find the difference in salary between appellant and Spittler to be relevant, but not determinative of the question of replacement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Finally, appellees contend Spittler did not replace appellant because there was an interval of approximately one year between appellant's termination and the beginning of Spittler's employment. Courts have held that an interval of time between the termination of an employee and the hiring of another is not necessarily relevant to the question of replacement.\n   <em>\n    Blizzard v. Marion Technical College\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3628651\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/698/275/#p284\">\n    698 F.3d 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 284 (6th Cir.2012) (finding plaintiff was replaced over one year after termination and stating that \"[t]his conclusion is not undermined by the fact that there was a lapse in time between [the plaintiff's] termination date and [the replacement's] hiring date\").\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simpson v. Midland-Ross Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1736462\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/823/937/#p941\">\n    823 F.2d 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 941 (6th Cir.1987). Here, the record reveals some reasons for the length of time between appellant's termination and the beginning of Spittler's employment. Dichter testified that Wilke Global attempted to hire another employee following appellant's termination, but negotiations with the candidate were unsuccessful. Based on the facts of this case, we cannot find that the interval of time between appellant's termination and Spittler's hiring is dispositive of the question of replacement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Considering the foregoing, it is a close case as to whether sufficient evidence supports a finding that Spittler replaced appellant. However, construing the evidence in a light most favorable to the appellant and bearing in mind that \"[t]he burden of establishing a prima facie case of disparate treatment is not onerous,\" we find that, for purposes of summary judgment, appellant established a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of age and gender with regard to her termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Accordingly, we sustain appellant's first and second assignments of error as it relates to her termination claims. This conclusion does not, however, end our discussion nor reverse the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Legitimate Non-Discriminatory Reason\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 42} In their motion for summary judgment, appellees contended appellant was terminated \"because of her unacceptable behavior toward [Moore].\" (Mot. for Sum. Jgmt. at 17.) Although the trial court found appellees met their burden of offering a legitimate non-discriminatory reason with regard to the reduction in salary claims, the trial court did not make any finding with regard to the termination claims. As explained below in our discussion of pretext, it is not necessary for us to make such a determination. We assume without deciding that appellees' proffered\n   reason for termination was a legitimate non-discriminatory reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Pretext\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 43} In her fourth assignment of error, appellant asserts the trial court erred by finding she was not able to establish pretext with regard to her claim of gender and age discrimination on the basis of an alleged reduction in her salary. Despite this assertion of error, appellant makes no arguments related to the reduction in salary claims. Instead, appellant argues: (1) appellees' reason for terminating her employment was not legitimate and non-discriminatory, and (2) if the court believes the reason to be legitimate and non-discriminatory, the reason is pretext to hide unlawful discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 44} In\n   <em>\n    St. Mary's Honor\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court clarified the court's role at the pretext stage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   [Once] [t]he defendant's \"production\" (whatever its persuasive effect) [has] been made, the trier of fact proceeds to decide the ultimate question: whether plaintiff has proved \"that the defendant intentionally discriminated against [him]\" because of his [age], [\n   <em>\n    Burdine\n   </em>\n   at 253,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184064\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/248/#p254\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ]. The factfinder's disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of the prima facie case, suffice to show intentional discrimination. Thus, rejection of the defendant's proffered reasons will\n   <em>\n    permit\n   </em>\n   the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination, and * * * upon such rejection, \"no additional proof of discrimination is\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   ,\" * * * (emphasis added). But the Court of Appeals' holding that rejection of the defendant's proffered reasons\n   <em>\n    compels\n   </em>\n   judgment for the plaintiff disregards the fundamental principle of Rule 301 that a presumption does not shift the burden of proof, and ignores our repeated admonition that the Title VII plaintiff at all times bears the \"ultimate burden of persuasion.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   But a reason cannot be proved to be \"a pretext\n   <em>\n    for discrimination\n   </em>\n   \" unless it is shown\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   that the reason was false,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that discrimination was the real reason.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   (Emphasis sic.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 511, 515,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355912\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/502/#p509\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 45} In\n   <em>\n    Manzer\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   To make a submissible case on the credibility of his employer's explanation, the plaintiff is \"required to show by a preponderance of the evidence either (1) that the proffered reasons had no basis\n   <em>\n    in fact\n   </em>\n   , (2) that the proffered reasons did not\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   motivate his discharge, or (3) that they were\n   <em>\n    insufficient\n   </em>\n   to motivate discharge.\"\n   <em>\n    McNabola v.

The first type of showing is easily recognizable and consists of evidence that the proffered bases for the plaintiff's discharge never happened,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that they are \"factually false.\" [\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

These two types of rebuttals are direct attacks on the credibility of the employee's [sic] proffered motivation for firing plaintiff and, if shown, provide an evidentiary basis for what the Supreme Court has termed \"a suspicion of mendacity.\" [\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    St. Mary's\n   </em>\n   at 2749,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355912\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/502/#p509\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ].

There, the plaintiff admits the factual basis underlying the employer's proffered explanation and further admits that such conduct\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   motivate dismissal. The plaintiff's attack on the credibility of the proffered explanation is, instead, an indirect one. In such cases, the plaintiff attempts to indict the credibility of his employer's explanation by showing circumstances which tend to prove that an illegal motivation was\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   likely than that offered by the defendant.

First, Moore stated that in 2013, prior to the salary reduction, appellant sent her a \"nasty e-mail\" after appellant moved her residence and noticed a discrepancy in her pay related to differing local taxes.

What was [sic] the contents of this voicemail?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   [Wilke]: Another example of [appellant] complaining about, you know, unprofessional or changing pay role without her, you know, agreement. I don't remember the exact words, though.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-198\">\n   [Appellant's Counsel]: Was it offensive?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   [Wilke]: Offensive? Help me. What's offensive? Did she swear, you know? Black and blue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   [Appellant's Counsel]: Sure. Did she swear?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n   [Wilke]: No, I don't think so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-202\">\n   [Appellant's Counsel]: Did she threaten - -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-203\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-204\">\n   [Wilke]: Threaten? I don't think she threatened. You mean violence? Workplace violence? No, I don't think that she threatened anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-205\">\n   [Appellant's Counsel]: Did she call anyone names?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-206\">\n   [Wilke]: Certainly, whether it's unprofessional or low or immoral or illegal or asshole, possibly. So certainly asshole you might say is a name. You know, immoral, illegal, unprofessional, I guess those probably aren't names, but I don't know. What's a name?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-207\">\n   [Appellant's Counsel]: When she was calling someone an asshole, who was she referring to?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-208\">\n   [Wilke]: Me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n   [Appellant's Counsel]: Okay.

Is that true?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-212\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-213\">\n   [Wilke]: The voicemails and a series of e-mails that they had.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-214\">\n   [Appellant's Counsel]: How many e-mails were there?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-215\">\n   [Wilke]: I don't know the exact number.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n   [Appellant's Counsel]: Did you ultimately receive all of those e-mails?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n   [Wilke]: I believe I have certainly seen all of those now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-218\">\n   [Appellant's Counsel]: Do you [have] any of those e-mails - - are any of those e-mails offensive in nature?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-219\">\n   [Wilke]: Offense is probably in the eye of the receiver.

I've dealt with customers. I've dealt with employees for 35 years. You can't have too thin a skin when you are running a business and dealing with quite a variety of people.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-223\">\n   [Appellant's Counsel]: So you personally weren't offended by the contents of these e-mails.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n   [Wilke]: Offensive, I don't know how far that goes. Disappointed, upset again, bothered, absolutely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-225\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-226\">\n   [Appellant's Counsel]: Is this why she was fired?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-227\">\n   [Wilke]: It is why she was fired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-228\">\n   [Appellant's Counsel]: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-229\">\n   [Wilke]: There's no question. Now, was it a voicemail or e-mail? It was a negative impact on another person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   (Wilke Depo. at 114-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Appellant claims that appellees' legitimate non-discriminatory reason is undermined in part because \"Moore did not believe [appellant] should be terminated.\" (Appellant's Brief at 19.) This is not an entirely accurate reflection of the record. Regarding what actions she thought needed to be taken to resolve the problems between her and appellant, Moore stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-232\">\n   [Appellant's Counsel]: You said in the one text message that you sent it says things need to change. I will not ever be back in. What did you mean by that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-233\">\n   [Moore]: I thought [appellant] needed to be addressed in the way she talked to me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-234\">\n   [Appellant's Counsel]: Did you mean she needed to be terminated?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-235\">\n   [Moore]: Not necessarily.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   (Moore Depo. at 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Next, appellant asserts that \"Moore admits that the voicemail did not upset her.\" (Appellant's Brief at 18.) Appellant therefore concludes her e-mail to Moore was the lone offensive communication. Again, this mischaracterizes Moore's deposition testimony. Moore did not specifically recall what appellant said in the voicemail, but she stated that she was \"taken back\" by the voicemail and stated that her response to appellant's communications was based on a \"combination of both\" the voicemail and the e-mail. (Moore Depo. at 24; 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Finally, appellant asserts appellees' legitimate non-discriminatory reason is pretext because \"Wilke admits that he read the email, and didn't find it offensive, yet he claims to have terminated [appellant] over sending it.\" (Appellant's Brief at 19.) While Wilke himself did not find the communications to be necessarily offensive, he definitively stated that appellant was fired as a result of her communications with Moore. Moore stated in her deposition that she found appellant's e-mail to be extremely offensive. Based on his conversations with Moore, Wilke perceived that Moore \"took great offense at them.\" (Wilke Depo. at 116.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Thus, appellant's arguments for claiming that appellees' proffered reason was insufficient to motivate her termination lack support in the record. Importantly, appellant does not provide evidence that a similarly situated comparator was treated more favorably for engaging in similar conduct. Although appellant claims the e-mail was \"non-offensive\" and characterizes Moore's response as \"very emotional,\" appellant has failed to support with evidence in the record her argument that her conduct was insufficient to motivate discharge. Therefore, we find for purposes of her claim of wrongful termination that appellant has failed to demonstrate pretext. Accordingly, we overrule appellant's fourth assignment of error as it relates to her claims of wrongful termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Reduction in Salary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Prima Facie Case\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   {\u00b6 54} As noted previously, the trial court found a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the reduction in salary constituted an adverse employment action. Furthermore, the court assumed without deciding that appellant could establish she is similarly situated to Dichter\n   and Rohde. Neither appellant nor appellees challenge these findings on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Legitimate Non-Discriminatory Reason\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   {\u00b6 55} The trial court found appellees met their burden of offering a legitimate non-discriminatory reason with regard to the reduction in salary: \"[appellees] altered [appellant's] compensation, by reducing her base salary and increasing her opportunity to earn commissions, to incentivize her to make more sales due to her performance. Moreover, [appellees] contend that each employee's compensation was different due to their different sales roles, and that [appellees] did not need to incentivize Mr. Dichter and Mr. Rohbe [sic] based upon their performance.\" (May 26, 2017 Decision at 6.) Appellant did not challenge this finding as it related to her reduction in salary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Pretext\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   {\u00b6 56} In her fourth assignment of error, appellant asserts the trial court erred by finding she was not able to establish pretext with regard to her claim of gender and age discrimination on the basis of an alleged reduction in her salary. Despite this assertion of error, appellant makes no arguments related to the reduction in salary claims. Instead, as noted in our discussion regarding pretext and termination, appellant argues: (1) appellees' reason for terminating her employment was not legitimate and non-discriminatory, and (2) if the court believes the reason to be legitimate and non-discriminatory, the reason is pretext to hide unlawful discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   {\u00b6 57} With regard to the reduction in salary, the trial court found appellant's \"memorandum contra does not make any argument to refute [appellees'] proffered reason for reducing her pay,\" and, thus, she \"failed to carry her Civ.R. 56 burden to establish pretext.\" (May 26, 2017 Decision at 6.) We have reviewed the memorandum contra and confirmed the same and further note that appellant has not supported her claimed fourth assignment of error as it relates to the reduction in salary with arguments or references to the record in her appellate brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   {\u00b6 58} \"The burden of affirmatively demonstrating error on appeal rests with the party asserting error.\"\n   <em>\n    Lundeen v.

If the employer satisfies this burden, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the proffered reason was not the real reason for the employment decision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Burdine\n   </em>\n   at 256,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184064\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/248/#p254\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   {\u00b6 64} In their motion for summary judgment, appellees argued appellant could not satisfy the first, second, and fourth prongs of the prima facie test. The trial court found, without further explanation, that \"[a]s to the first two prongs, when examining the evidence in a light most favorable to [appellant], the Court finds that genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether [appellant] made reports of discrimination to [appellees] and whether [appellees] knew that [appellant] engaged in this activity.\" (May 26, 2017 Decision at 8.) Appellees have not challenged this finding on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   {\u00b6 65} As to the fourth prong, appellant argued in the trial court that the close temporal proximity between her complaint of discrimination and her termination was sufficient to establish a causal connection. The trial court found appellant's voicemail and e-mail to Moore was \"evidence of an intervening workplace issue\" such that \"temporal proximity alone is not enough to establish a causal connection.\" (May 26, 2017 Decision at 9.) Further, the court found that \"[b]ecause [appellant] does not direct the Court to any other indicia of retaliation, she has failed to establish the fourth prong of the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case for retaliation.\" (May 26, 2017 Decision at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   {\u00b6 66} On review, we conclude it is not necessary to address appellant's arguments regarding the prima facie case because we find she has failed to demonstrate\n   pretext. In her brief on appeal, appellant merely reiterates the arguments she made regarding pretext for her wrongful termination claims. As we have previously found appellant's argument regarding pretext for her termination to be without merit, we conclude appellant has failed to demonstrate pretext with regard to her claim for retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   {\u00b6 67} Accordingly, we overrule appellant's third assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   {\u00b6 68} Having sustained appellant's first and second assignments of error, but ultimately having overruled appellant's third and fourth assignments of error which are dispositive, we hereby affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   HORTON, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   BRUNNER, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   {\u00b6 69} I would sustain appellant's third and fourth assignments of error relating to the pretext element of both retaliatory discharge and gender and/or age discrimination. The evidence offered by appellees of a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating appellant does not without further interpretation suffice as such. It also leaves open the mirror-image question of whether appellant has adequately discredited such a proffered reason as a pretext. This issue is highly material to the summary disposition of the matter as raised in the third and fourth assignments of error, and it should go to a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   {\u00b6 70} Appellee Michael Wilke stated that appellant's communications, some of which the recipient could not remember what was said, were not necessarily offensive to Wilke but that, since the recipient of them took great offense to them, he fired appellant. \"Pretext may be proved either by direct evidence that [unlawful] animus motivated the discharge or by discrediting the employer's rebuttal evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters Joint Apprenticeship Commt. v.

The evidence offered in support of a legitimate non-discriminatory reason may be discredited with opposing evidence or with argument. The majority limits this to evidence only.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Decision at \u00b6 52. If this is the law, an employer may offer any manner of reason for termination, withhold, or engage in foot-dragging in discovery, and deprive the employee of evidence, even when the proffered reason may be susceptible of more than one interpretation and discredited by its character. When we require that pretext be established by evidence in all cases, even though in some cases argument alone is enough because of the weak evidentiary quality of the proffered reason, we deny a fair remedy to an aggrieved employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   {\u00b6 71} The majority recognizes that appellant offers deposition evidence and an interpretative argument: \" 'Wilke admits that he read the email, and didn't find it offensive, yet he claims to have terminated [appellant] over sending it.' (Appellant's Brief at 19.).\" (Majority Decision at \u00b6 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   {\u00b6 72} This evidence, adduced from appellee Wilke's deposition, calls for interpretation and judgment concerning whether it is a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for appellant's termination. Only a factfinder may interpret its truth and import for the purposes of determining whether appellees have offered a legitimate non-discriminatory reason and whether appellant has discredited that evidence as pretext. Without this evidentiary\n   determination, some of which necessarily involves appellee Wilke's credibility, appellees did not actually clear the hurdle they needed to avoid a jury trial by avoiding a question of material fact. And it should be emphasized that the trial court was required under Civ.R. 56(C) to interpret the evidence in a light most favorable to the appellant, as the nonmoving party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   {\u00b6 73} The majority recognizes that the question of pretext may call for a jury determination, quoting\n   <em>\n    Reeves v.
