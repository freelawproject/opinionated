Rittenhouse appeals the September 6, 2017 judgment entry of the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On April 28, 2006, Defendant-Appellee Jeffery (Jeffrey) M. Rittenhouse executed an Adjustable Rate Note in favor of Sunset Mortgage Company, LP in the original principal sum of $414,000.00. The Note was secured by a Mortgage to the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. as nominee for Sunset Mortgage Company, LP on property located in Galena, Ohio. The Mortgage was assigned to Defendant-Appellee Waterfall Victoria Master Fund 2008-1 Grantor Trust, Series B. The Note was endorsed in blank and transferred to Waterfall Victoria Master Fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Rittenhouse failed to make payments pursuant to the terms of the Note and Mortgage. On November 12, 2014, Waterfall Victoria Master Fund filed a complaint in foreclosure against Rittenhouse and other defendants in the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas. On January 26, 2015, Rittenhouse filed an answer, counterclaim, and third party complaint. Rittenhouse voluntarily dismissed his third party complaint. The trial court dismissed Rittenhouse's counterclaims on September 22, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On November 9, 2015, Waterfall Victoria Master Fund filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion on December 30, 2015. The trial court granted the Decree in Foreclosure on December 30, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Rittenhouse filed an appeal of the Decree in Foreclosure with the Fifth District\n   Court of Appeals, Case No. 16 CAE 01 0004. On March 23, 2016, Rittenhouse filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Stay. The court stayed the appeal during the pendency of the bankruptcy action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The Bankruptcy Court dismissed Rittenhouse's bankruptcy petition on February 2, 2017. On February 8, 2017, Waterfall Victoria Master Fund filed a motion to reinstate the appeal. We granted the motion on February 28, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} We dismissed Rittenhouse's appeal on April 24, 2017 for want of prosecution pursuant to App.R. 18(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On July 12, 2017, Rittenhouse filed a motion to vacate the December 30, 2015 judgment entry granting the motion for summary judgment and Decree in Foreclosure. Rittenhouse argued the judgment entry should be vacated pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B)(3) and 60(B)(5) because Waterfall Victoria Master Fund was not the real party in interest when the trial court granted the Decree in Foreclosure. Rittenhouse stated that on September 23, 2015, Waterfall Victoria Master Fund 2008-1 Grantor Trust, Series B assigned the Mortgage to Waterfall Victoria Depositor II, LLC. The assignment of Mortgage was recorded on December 3, 2015. On September 24, 2015, Waterfall Victoria Depositor II, LLC assigned the Mortgage to Waterfall Victoria Grantor Trust II, Series G. The assignment of the Mortgage was recorded on December 3, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Waterfall Victoria Master Fund responded to the motion and argued it was permitted to proceed in the case pursuant to Civ.R. 25(C). It further argued Rittenhouse's motion was not filed in a reasonable time and failed to raise a meritorious defense to foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On September 6, 2017, the trial court denied Rittenhouse's motion to vacate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} It is from this decision Rittenhouse now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Rittenhouse raises one Assignment of Error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY DENYING APPELLANT'S MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO CIV.R. 60(B)(3) AND/OR CIV.R. 60(B)(5).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Rittenhouse contends the trial court erred in denying his Civ.R. 60(B) motion for relief from judgment.

The appellants argued they were entitled to relief from judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B)(3) because the mortgagee lacked standing at the time it filed its action in foreclosure. Prosecuting the foreclosure without standing, the appellants argued, was a fraudulent act entitling the appellants to relief from the foreclosure judgment. The Court examined whether Civ.R. 60(B)(3) applied to the appellants' claims. It stated that, \"fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct contemplated by Civ.R. 60(B)(3) refers to deceit or other unconscionable conduct committed by a party to obtain a judgment and does not refer to conduct that would have been a defense to or claim in the case itself.\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.
