Plaintiff-appellee, James W. Slater, administrator for the estate of Michael Ferrara, Jr. (\"the Estate\"), cross appeals from the same judgment. For the following reasons, we reverse the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} While Michael Ferrara, Jr. was imprisoned at the Ross Correctional Institution, another inmate, Logan Murphy, attacked and killed him. Michael Ferrara, Jr.'s parents, Michael Ferrara, Sr. and Louise Ferrara, hired Grubb to open an estate for Michael Ferrara, Jr. and to pursue a wrongful death action against the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (\"ODRC\"). On January 19, 2013, the Ferraras entered into a contingency retainer agreement with Grubb. According to that agreement, Grubb would collect a contingency fee of 35 to 40 percent of any amount the Ferraras recovered from ODRC. If the Ferraras recovered nothing, then they would \"not be indebted to [Grubb] for either costs or legal fees.\" (Intervenor's Ex. A at 2.) The agreement also provided, \"Client grants attorney a lien on all claims in which attorney represents client under this agreement. The lien shall cover any sums due and owing to attorney at the termination of attorney's services and will attach to any money or property recovered by client.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} After Grubb secured the Ferraras as clients, a paralegal drafted and submitted a public records request to ODRC seeking records related to Michael Ferrara, Jr. and Murphy, as well as prison policies and personnel. Grubb employees reviewed the records received from ODRC and forwarded a copy of those records to the Ferraras. Additionally, a Grubb associate attorney talked with a prosecutor regarding the criminal case against Murphy. That associate also emailed with a local reporter about articles the reporter wrote about the death of Michael Ferrara, Jr. Grubb employees passed along information and documents uncovered through these communications to the Ferraras. Finally, Grubb engaged a litigation consultant to \"evaluate case strengthes [sic]/weaknesses; advise of who to depose, etc.\" (Intervenor's Ex. H at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In September 2014, the Ferraras terminated their attorney-client relationship with Grubb and hired Edward L. Gilbert Co., LPA (\"Gilbert\") instead. Soon thereafter, Gilbert opened an estate for Michael Ferrara, Jr. and, as attorney for the Estate, filed a wrongful death action against ODRC in the Court of Claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Six months after commencement of the action, Grubb moved to intervene in order to pursue a charging lien. Representing itself as former counsel for the Estate, Grubb asserted \"an attorney's charging lien for fees earned and costs in [its] representation of Plaintiff in this case.\" (Notice of Attorney's Charging Lien and Mot. to Intervene for Limited Purpose of Pursuing the Attorney's Charging Lien at 1.) By virtue of the charging lien, Grubb sought payment of $6,713.43 in fees and costs, plus 1.5 percent interest, from any judgment or settlement proceeds due to the Estate. The Court of Claims denied Grubb's motion, holding that Grubb had no interest in the action unless and until a judgment or settlement created a fund from which Grubb could collect its fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} After extensive discovery, a trial on the wrongful death action began in September 2016. During trial, the parties reached a settlement. Grubb then filed a renewed motion to intervene in order to assert a charging lien. In the motion, Grubb again represented itself as former counsel for the Estate and asserted a charging lien for fees and costs accrued during its representation of the Estate in the wrongful death action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In response to Grubb's motion, the Estate pointed out that Grubb had represented the Ferraras, not the Estate. Thus, Grubb had not done any legal work for the Estate and, consequently, could not seek payment from settlement proceeds to be paid to the Estate. The Estate also contended that no enforceable charging lien existed because Grubb had not helped to create the settlement reached between the Estate and ODRC. Grubb did not participate in opening an estate for Michael Ferrara, Jr., nor in initiating or prosecuting the litigation against ODRC. Moreover, in accomplishing those tasks, Gilbert neither relied upon the material and information Grubb had generated during its representation of the Ferraras nor used the litigation consultant Grubb had hired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} While Grubb's motion to intervene was pending, the Estate and ODRC submitted an executed settlement agreement to the Court of Claims. The parties also submitted a copy of the Cuyahoga County Probate Court's entry approving the settlement and setting the distribution of the settlement funds. In that entry, the probate court ordered payment of $60,000 in attorney fees for the legal services that Slater &amp; Zurz, LLP (\"Slater\") and Gilbert rendered with respect to the wrongful death action. The probate court also addressed the question of Grubb's charging lien. The \"Settlement Distribution Compilation\" attached to the entry stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Attorney Natalie Grubb of Grubb &amp; Associates has filed an attorney's charging lien for \"$6,713.43, plus 1.5% interest per month, per retainer, from September, 2014, totaling $9,520.08\" in the Estate's wrongful death litigation in the Ohio Court of Claims. From its attorney fees awarded herein, Slater &amp; Zurz, LLP and Edward L. Gilbert Co., LPA will indemnify and hold the Estate harmless from and pay any fees, costs and expenses finally determined to be owed by the Estate for said charging lien.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The entry reiterated that \"Slater &amp; Zurz, LLP and Edward L. Gilbert Co., LPA will indemnify and hold the Estate harmless from and pay any fees, costs and expenses finally determined to be owed by the Estate to Grubb &amp; Associates, LPA.\" (Entry Approving Settlement and Distribution of Wrongful Death and Survival Claims at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The Court of Claims noted the filing of the settlement agreement and scheduled a hearing on the issue of the charging lien in an entry dated December 16, 2016. Approximately one month later, the Court of Claims issued an entry approving and confirming the settlement agreement and dismissing the wrongful death action. The entry also ordered that the settlement warrant of $150,000, made payable to the Estate, be sent to Gilbert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} At the February 22, 2017 hearing regarding the charging lien, Natalie Grubb testified and introduced documentary evidence. After considering the evidence, the trial court determined that the benefit that Grubb's work conferred upon the settlement outcome did not support its demand for $6,713.43, plus interest. The trial court found, instead, that Grubb was entitled to recover on the basis of quantum meruit the amount of $3,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Grubb now appeals the trial court's judgment, and it assigns the following errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [1.] The Trial Court Erred and Abused Its Discretion in Awarding to Intervenor-Appellant Less Than The Fees Owed, As Secured By Its Attorney Charging Lien.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [2.] The Trial Court Erred in Using a\n   <em>\n    Quantum Meruit\n   </em>\n   Analysis to Determine Reasonable Attorney's Fees Owed to Intervenor-Appellant When There Is An Enforceable Attorney Charging Lien Supported By An Express Contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The Estate cross appeals, and it assigns the following errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [1.] The Trial Court Did Not Have Subject-Matter Jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [2.] The Trial Court erred when it Granted Grubb's Motion to Intervene.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [3.] The Trial Court erred when it found that Grubb is entitled to recover on the basis of quantum meruit in the amount of $3,000.00 from the settlement proceeds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 12} We will begin our review with the Estate's cross appeal. By its first assignment of error, the Estate argues that the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to determine whether Grubb had an enforceable charging lien and, if so, the amount due to Grubb. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 13} \" 'Subject-matter jurisdiction of a court connotes the power to hear and decide a case upon its merits' and 'defines the competency of a court to render a valid judgment in a particular action.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cheap Escape Co. v.

Exercising its broad authority to accomplish that distribution, the probate court awarded $60,000 in attorney fees to Slater and Gilbert, and required Slater and Gilbert to pay Grubb for the fees and costs owed it under the charging lien. Although the probate court did not determine the validity of Grubb's charging lien or the amount owed to it, the court did not need to do so to completely distribute the settlement proceeds. The probate court relieved itself of the obligation to decide the issues surrounding Grubb's alleged charging lien by lifting the burden of satisfying the charging lien from the Estate and imposing it, instead, on Slater and Gilbert. This shift in responsibility enabled the probate court to allocate every penny of the settlement funds and negate Grubb's claim to direct payment from those funds. Thus, the probate court fully adjudicated the matter before it, even though it did not resolve the issues related to Grubb's alleged charging lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 20} With the probate court's exercise of jurisdiction completed, the Court of Claims had the necessary jurisdiction to address whether Grubb could collect from Slater and Gilbert the fees and costs it sought via a charging lien.

Thus, if an attorney lacks an attorney-client relationship with a party awarded a judgment or other monies, an attorney has no basis on which to assert a charging lien on the judgment or monies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Here, Grubb sought to impose a charging lien on a settlement fund awarded to the Estate, which Grubb never represented, despite its representations to the contrary. Consequently, at least superficially, Grubb did not have grounds to claim a charging lien on the settlement fund. Grubb, however, contends that it could assert a charging lien on the settlement fund because the Ferraras, its clients, were statutory beneficiaries and ultimately entitled to the settlement proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Under Ohio law, the proceeds from a settlement of the wrongful death action are the property of the statutory beneficiaries.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Goldberg v. Mahoning Cty. Probate Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"248694\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/93/160/#p164\">\n    93 Ohio St.3d 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 164,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=753%20N.E.2d%20192\">\n    753 N.E.2d 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) (stating that proceeds from a wrongful death action are \"the actual property of the statutory beneficiaries\" and are part of the decedent's estate \"in a limited or qualified sense only\"). Here, therefore, the four statutory beneficiaries-the Ferraras and Michael Ferrara, Jr.'s two brothers-owned the settlement proceeds. Because Grubb had only represented two of the four statutory beneficiaries, it could not assert a charging lien on the entirety of the settlement fund. Such a charging lien cannot exist because it would wrongfully require two non-clients to contribute to the payment of Grubb's fees and costs. Absent an attorney-client relationship with all four statutory beneficiaries or the Estate, Grubb could not recover its fees and costs through a charging lien on the whole settlement fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Grubb's charging lien also fails due to the negligible impact of the legal work it provided. As we explained above, an attorney's right to collect fees and costs through a charging lien \"rests on the equity of such attorney to be paid out\n   of the judgment by him obtained, and is upheld on the theory that his services and skill created the fund.\"\n   <em>\n    Cohen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"973584\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st/109/22/\">\n    109 Ohio St. 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=141%20N.E.%20656\">\n    141 N.E. 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at paragraph one of the syllabus.

Neither Grubb nor the litigation consultant it hired participated in the actual litigation of the wrongful death action. According to Gilbert, nothing Grubb accomplished contributed to the prosecution of the wrongful death action or the negotiation of the settlement. Given the inconsequential nature of Grubb's involvement, we cannot conclude that Grubb created the settlement fund. Therefore, equity does not support allowing Grubb to recover from the settlement fund through the asserted charging lien. Accordingly, we sustain the Estate's third assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 40} By Grubb's two assignments of error, it complains about the amount of attorney fees and costs awarded to it. In sustaining the Estate's third assignment of error, we have determined that the trial court erred in granting Grubb any payment out of the settlement fund. Thus, our ruling on the Estate's third assignment of error renders moot Grubb's assignments of error, and we will not rule upon them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 41} For the foregoing reasons, we overrule the Estate's first and second assignments of error, and we sustain the Estate's third assignment of error.
