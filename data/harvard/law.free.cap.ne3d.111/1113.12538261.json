Hernandez, of operating a motor vehicle after suspension of his license, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 23.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, he contends that (1) admission of Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV) records violated the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution; (2) the notice of license suspension printed only in the English language violates his due process and equal protection guarantees under the Federal and State Constitutions because he speaks only Spanish; (3) the notice violates\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2042.104\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) ; and (4) the Commonwealth presented insufficient evidence to support his conviction. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    RMV records and the confrontation clause\n   </em>\n   . The defendant raises confrontation clause challenges to the admission of the following documents: (1) an \"RMV Certificate,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (to which he also raises a separate hearsay challenge); (2) the suspension notices; (3) the \"USPS Confirmations,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (4) a \"Non-Reinstatement Certificate,\" stating that the defendant's license was not reinstated. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The confrontation clause only bars \"testimonial\" hearsay -- \"statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p52\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 52 (2004). It is in this legal context that we address the defendant's challenges to the documentary proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The RMV certificate, which is \"a clerk's affidavit authenticating an official record[,] is not testimonial for purposes of the confrontation clause,\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McMullin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3835770\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/76/904/#p904\">\n    76 Mass. App. Ct. 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 904 (2010), and properly was admitted. Likewise, the suspension notices, which are prepared pursuant to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 22, to apprise operators of the RMV's actions and the operator's rights following a suspension, are not testimonial. The USPS confirmations were properly admitted business records, see\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ellis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841886\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/79/330/#p335\">\n    79 Mass. App. Ct. 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 335 (2011), produced for internal use contemporaneously with the suspension notices, and have only an ancillary purpose of possible use at a future trial.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McEvoy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12532859\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/100/767/#p316\">\n    93 Mass. App. Ct. 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 316 (2018). Therefore, their admission also did not violate the confrontation clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Finally, the admission of the nonreinstatement certificate, which the Commonwealth concedes is testimonial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Ellis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841886\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/79/330/#p335\">\n    79 Mass. App. Ct. at 334-335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the Commonwealth presented sufficient additional evidence of the defendant's license suspension beyond the nonreinstatement certificate. The RMV records showed that the defendant's license was suspended at the time of his arrest, as did the certified copy of the criminal docket sheet of his conviction of operating while under the influence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In further support of an inference of license suspension, the defendant admitted to the arresting officer that he did not have a license.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841886\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/79/330/#p335\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841886\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/79/330/#p335\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Due process\n   </em>\n   . We find similarly unavailing the defendant's claim that the RMV's use of an English language suspension notice violates due process. An English language notice is constitutionally sufficient for non-English language speakers when:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"(1) it would put a reasonable person on notice that inquiry is required, (2) further inquiry would reveal the facts necessary to understand the nature of the proceeding and the opportunity to be heard, and (3) the party's disability does not render him incapable of understanding the need for such inquiry.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Olivo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"309645\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/369/62/#p69\">\n    369 Mass. 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 69 (1975).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The suspension notice employed here provided such inquiry notice.

It was official correspondence from the RMV, and would alert any reasonable person to the need for further inquiry.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"309703\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/369/92/#p98\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"309703\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/369/92/#p98\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Equal protection\n   </em>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Olivo\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Judicial Court made clear that the use of English notices, even with those who do not read English, does not violate either the State or Federal guarantee of equal protection.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"309645\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/369/62/#p69\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"309645\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/369/62/#p69\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2042.104\">\n     28 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.104\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2017)\n   </em>\n   . The defendant contends for the first time on appeal, and without any documentary support, that the use of English language notices violates\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2042.104\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), which prohibits any discrimination based on \"race, color, or national origin\" in Federally funded programs. The defendant did not raise this argument in the trial court and offers no support for it here. Therefore, we deem it waived.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Obi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457224\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/475/541/#p549\">\n    475 Mass. 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 549 (2016). In any event, we are not aware of any authority suggesting that the RMV violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2042.104\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), or that a violation must result in the reversal of a criminal conviction.

The elements of a \u00a7 23 violation are (1) the defendant operated a motor vehicle, (2) while his or her license was suspended, and (3) that the defendant received notice that his or her license had been suspended or revoked.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Royal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456661\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/89/168/#p170\">\n    89 Mass. App. Ct. 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 170 (2016). Here, the defendant challenges the sufficiency of proof as to the third element on three grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   First, the defendant claims that he never received the notice. This argument fails. The Commonwealth need not prove actual receipt but, rather, pursuant to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 22 (\n   <em>\n    d\n   </em>\n   ), the Commonwealth need only show \"that the registry properly mailed the notice of suspension or revocation, which constitutes 'prima facie evidence of receipt by the addressee.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Parenteau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272520\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/460/1/#p6\">\n    460 Mass. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 6 (2011), quoting\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Koney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"861566\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/421/295/#p303\">\n    421 Mass. 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 303-304 (1995). The Commonwealth submitted numerous RMV documents indicating both that the defendant's license was suspended and that the RMV had mailed notices of the suspension to his address. This evidence was sufficient.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"861566\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/421/295/#p303\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"861566\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/421/295/#p303\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Second, the defendant asserts that because the RMV documents were inadmissible, the Commonwealth failed to prove that he received notice. This claim also fails because, in addition to already concluding that these documents were properly admitted, we consider, \"[i]n determining the sufficiency of the evidence ... 'the evidence in its entirety, including, not excluding, that admitted [at] trial but found inadmissible on appeal.' \"\n   <em>\n    Mauricio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DiBenedetto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3903884\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/414/37/#p46\">\n    414 Mass. 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 46 (1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Third, the defendant claims that, even if he received the notice, it was insufficient because he only reads Spanish.
