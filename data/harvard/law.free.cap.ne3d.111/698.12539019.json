JONES, SR., J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Relator, Home Savings Bank, successor by merger to The Home Savings and Loan Company of Youngstown, Ohio (\"HSB\"), seeks a writ of prohibition to prevent respondent, Judge Kelly Ann Gallagher, and respondent court, the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, from paying administrative expenses of a receivership while a direct appeal is pending with this court. After careful review of the issues raised, this court grants summary judgment in favor of respondents and denies the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural and Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The litigation in the underlying civil case was spawned by a Ponzi scheme perpetrated by Joanne and Alan Schneider. As the scheme came to light, plans for a large commercial development in Parma Heights, Ohio collapsed. This led to litigation involving numerous parties, including the city of Parma Heights (\"Parma Heights\"), Cleveland Construction Inc. (\"Cleveland Construction\"), and HSB. The litigation that ensued has lasted the better part of two decades. The claims of these three creditors were disposed of by the trial court in separate orders and cases, and ultimately directed Matthew L. Fornshell, the receiver appointed to oversee the assets mainly generated from the sale of real estate, to disburse funds to HSB and other parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The trial court determined that Parma Heights and Cleveland Construction did not have valid liens on the funds held by the receiver. Both parties appealed the trial court's orders. After those appeals were filed, at the request of Parma Heights, the trial court issued a stay order on March 9, 2016. It stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [d]efendant Parma Heights' 3/4/2016 motion for stay of execution pending appeal is granted. The receiver is ordered to stay distribution of all funds pending appeal. The receiver shall continue to perform all other duties under the receivership order. The stay of distribution shall not prohibit further administration of the receivership, including the payment of ongoing fees and expenses of the receiver. Based upon the court's ruling above, defendant Cleveland Construction Inc.'s 3/8/2016 motion to stay distribution of all funds is moot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Two days later, HSB filed its notice of appeal. All three cases were separately assigned case numbers but ultimately consolidated in this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The receiver filed four applications for the payment of administrative claims during the pendency of the appeal: April 6, 2016, October 17, 2016, December 8, 2016, and April 6, 2017. These were all granted by the trial court. HSB contested only one application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} While these appeals were still pending, on November 3, 2017, HSB filed the instant action seeking a writ of prohibition to prevent the court from making further distributions from assets under receivership for administrative claims, and seeking to void the previous four payments made to the receiver. HSB's complaint for writ of prohibition alleges that the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to grant any of the receiver's fee applications during the pendency of the appeals because the orders directly interfered with the appellate court's jurisdiction \"to review, affirm, reverse, or modify\" the underlying judgments. According to HSB, \"all monies traceable to the Cornerstone Properties sale proceeds\"-including the Secured Creditor Allocation Account-are directly at issue in the companion appeals, and therefore, the trial court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to approve any application for administrative fees (which includes the receiver's fees) that arise from this account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} This court granted an alternative writ and set a briefing schedule on November 6, 2017. Respondent judge and the receiver filed answers. Respondent, the receiver, and HSB filed motions for summary judgment on December 15, 2017. This court issued a decision resolving all three appeals on December 21, 2017. The parties subsequently filed their briefs in opposition to the motions for summary judgment on January 18, 2018. Aside from arguing that HSB was not entitled to a writ of prohibition because there is no showing that the trial court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction, respondents and receiver argue that the action is now moot because this court decided the appeals, approving the Secured Creditor Allocation and holding that the trial court \"did not abuse its discretion by approving the receiver's payments of various administrative fees and costs from the Secured Creditor Allocation.\" HSB moved for reconsideration, which this court ultimately granted, but reached the same result as the earlier issued opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

In the underlying appeal, HSB argued, among other things, that the trial court could not make the secured creditor's account and could not pay the receiver from that account. The trial court's action in paying the expenses of the receivership from this account does not interfere with this court's jurisdiction to affirm, modify, or reverse the lower court's decision. If this court were to have ruled that the trial court's allocation of ten percent of the secured creditor account be set aside for the payment of administrative expenses was invalid, the trial court would have been required to reallocate certain funds in the\n   receivership estate. It does not mean that the trial court cannot pay expenses of the receiver. Indeed, if a trial court did not have jurisdiction to pay costs of the receivership, the corpus of a receivership may be put into jeopardy while an appeal is pending. Moreover, it is clear from the trial court's stay order that the trial court expressly retained authority to act on the receiver's fee and expense applications while the appeals were pending-an order that HSB never successfully obtained a stay from.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} We find HSB's reliance on the Sixth District's decision in\n   <em>\n    Horvath v. Packo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-56\">\n    2013-Ohio-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=985%20N.E.2d%20966\">\n    985 N.E.2d 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Dist.), for the proposition that the trial court lacked jurisdiction in this case to be misplaced. In\n   <em>\n    Horvath\n   </em>\n   , the parties to an appeal were challenging the propriety of a court order that authorized a court-appointed receiver to sell business assets to one of three potential buyers that had submitted offers. A defendant filed an appeal of that order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. While the appeal was pending, the trial court directed the receiver to consummate the sale and distribute the assets to one of the potential buyers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. The Sixth District found that the order directing the receiver to consummate the sale was void for want of jurisdiction because the issue of who to sell the business assets to was an issue pending in the underlying appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The facts of\n   <em>\n    Horvath\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable from the instant case. In\n   <em>\n    Horvath\n   </em>\n   , a party was appealing a sale conducted by a receiver and the issue raised in the appeal was the propriety of the sale and to whom specific property should be sold. In the underlying appeals here, HSB, Parma Heights, and Cleveland Construction were not contesting the propriety of the sale. Each appeal asserted an error in the validity or priority of an interest in the proceeds. And as stated above, even if this court had found merit to HSB's attack of the trial court's creation of the secured creditor's account and the payment of the receiver from this account, the court could reallocate funds from the receivership without disturbing this court's ability to affirm, modify, or reverse. As a result, the filing of an appeal in this case did not strip the trial court of all jurisdiction to manage the receivership and to pay the expenses that arise therefrom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Finally, this court having already decided on appeal that \"the trial court did not abuse its discretion by approving the receiver's payments of various administrative fees and costs from the Secured Creditor Allocation,\" we decline to grant a writ of prohibition when doing so would be a vain act and the circumstances no longer require it.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.
