McNamara (husband) and Christine G. McNamara (wife). The husband challenges the portion of a judgment (modification judgment) of the Probate and Family Court dated September 30, 2016, requiring him to pay monthly child support of $5,000 to the wife. The wife, in turn, challenges the omission of a retroactive child support award in the modification judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the award of child support and attorney's fees in the judgment, but remand for further findings as to whether retroactive child support is appropriate, and if found appropriate, the amount of retroactive child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . After almost twenty-two years of marriage, the parties divorced in May of 2012, pursuant to a judgment of divorce (divorce judgment) incorporating their separation agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The separation agreement required the husband to pay alimony of $6,000 per month, along with one hundred percent of the college-related expenses for the parties' three children (aged seventeen, fifteen, and eleven at the time of divorce).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The separation agreement further provided that \"[i]f alimony terminates while the children are not emancipated then [the husband] shall pay child support to [the wife] in accordance with the ... child support guidelines.\" At the time of the divorce, the wife was not earning any income, and the husband reported earnings from his role as owner and manager of a corporation (corporation).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The husband's support obligations under the separation agreement were based on an annual income of $225,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In April of 2015, the wife filed a complaint for modification seeking to establish a child support order on the basis that the husband's income had increased since the divorce. A two-day trial was held before a judge of the Probate and Family Court, commencing in March of 2016 and concluding in June of 2016. The central disputed issue at the trial was the amount of the husband's 2015 income. The husband alleged that he had earned a total of $551,633, comprised primarily of his salary and shareholder distributions from the corporation. However, the wife contended that the husband had received over $500,000 in additional income from the corporation through what the husband called \"the 5500 account\" that he used to pay for various personal expenses. The husband claimed the 5500 account was not income; rather, it was a loan from the corporation that he was required to repay with one percent interest. At the conclusion of the trial, the wife requested, among other things, monthly child support of $10,000 to commence retroactively as of May 1, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   A modification judgment entered, dated September 30, 2016, requiring the husband to pay child support to the wife in the amount of $5,000 per month. The judge rejected the husband's claim that the 5500 account (having a total balance of $551,972) was a loan, instead treating it as income and finding the husband's total 2015 compensation from the corporation to be $1,001,360. The judge concluded that the significant increase in the husband's income since the divorce (from $2,885 per week in 2012, to $19,257 per week in 2015) had resulted in \"a substantial discrepancy between the lifestyles of the parties\" warranting child support. The judge did not address the wife's request for retroactive child support in the modification judgment. The present cross appeals followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . \"In reviewing a modification judgment, we examine whether the factual and legal bases for the decision are in error, or whether the judge otherwise abused his discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Flor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Flor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20360\">\n    92 Mass.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The judge found that the husband has \"very significant control\" over the corporation as its \"sole officer\" and \"[ninety percent] shareholder.\" The judge also found that the husband routinely used the 5500 account to pay for personal expenses. Although the husband claims that he either had to repay those expenses with interest or take a reduction in his capital interest in the corporation, the judge found that the husband lacked credibility regarding the alleged loan -- a finding that is supported by the record\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"is close to immune from reversal on appeal except on the most compelling of showings.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnston\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Johnston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4022431\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/38/531/#p536\">\n    38 Mass.
