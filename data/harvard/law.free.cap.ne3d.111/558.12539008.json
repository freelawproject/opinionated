Plaintiff-Appellee is the State of Ohio. The relevant facts leading to this appeal are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On the late morning of March 4, 2016, paramedics from the Canton Fire Department were dispatched to a residence on Dewalt Ave. NW in response to a report of an adult woman needing medical assistance. Appellant lived there with Hailey Miku, his young daughter, and his girlfriend Jessica Bender (who is not the child's mother). The paramedics instead discovered the body of three-year-old Hailey on a mattress in the living room. Paramedic John Huff later testified that appellant appeared \"frantic\" at the scene. Appellant then stated that Hailey had tripped over a cat and had fallen down a flight of carpeted stairs the previous week. Trial Tr. at 254, 256. Appellant told Huff that he had brought Hailey downstairs after discovering her in an unresponsive state.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Sergeant Robert Smith and Officer Dave Wolgamott of the Canton Police Department were also dispatched to the scene. According to Sgt. Smith, when he made contact with appellant, his response was: \"I'm going to jail, ain't I?\" Tr. at 267.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Harry Campbell, the chief investigator for the Stark County Coroner, also came to the scene. He observed that rigor mortis had set in, and he observed\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   \"numerous injuries * * * across [Hailey's] scalp, the forehead, the bridge of the nose, and the right cheek.\" Tr. at 293. Campbell also noted additional injuries, including abrasions and bruises, about the girl's head and body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellant was interviewed by Detective Joseph Mongold at Canton Police headquarters, after signing a written waiver of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. Tr. at 455. Appellant told him that the girl's mother, Justina Longwell, had asked him around Thanksgiving of 2015 to watch Hailey for a few days, but that she thereafter avoided resuming physical custody. Tr. at 460-461. Appellant initially maintained his claim that Hailey had fallen down the stairs. As Mongold continued the questioning, he pointed out that the girl's numerous injuries were not consistent with a single fall down the carpeted stairs. Appellant at some point in the process added that she had also fallen off the toilet. Appellant further suggested that the girl may have had a reaction to Tylenol or Ibuprofen. Tr. at 464. At some point, appellant began to concede that he had \"severe anger issues,\" that he usually took his frustration out on Hailey, and that he had a hard time controlling\n   himself when he acted violently. Tr. at 465. He then admitted that he had hit her in the face with an open hand, causing her ear to bleed, and that he had beat her with a curtain rod. Tr. at 467. Ultimately, appellant confessed to the detective that he had gone too far and killed her. Tr. at 468. When asked about Jessica Bender's role in the abuse of Hailey, appellant stated Bender \"didn't have a hard bone in her body and wouldn't hurt a fly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Appellant also asked Det. Mongold to tell some of the neighbors that he knew what he had done was wrong. Tr. at 470.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On July 26, 2016, the Stark County Grand Jury indicted appellant on one count of murder ( R.C. 2903.02(B) ), specifically for knowingly causing the death of another as a proximate result of committing the second-degree felony of child endangering. Appellant was also indicted on one count of child endangering ( R.C. 2919.22(B)(1) and (E)(2)(d) ), specifically for recklessly abusing a child that resulted in serious physical harm to the child, or (under R.C. 2919.22(B)(2) and (E)(3) ), for recklessly torturing or cruelly abusing the child that resulted in serious physical harm to the child. The State's theory of the case was that appellant beat the child over a three-month period without seeking medical attention for her, resulting in her death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant subsequently pled not guilty to the above charges. On November 21, 2016, appellant filed a motion to suppress the statements he made to Detective Mongold during the recorded interview at the Canton Police Department. He argued in his motion that his waiver of his constitutional rights and agreement to speak was induced by improper promises made by the detective. Following a hearing on December 1, 2016, the trial court overruled the motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The case proceeded to a trial by jury commencing on February 6, 2017. During the trial, Dr. Renee Robinson, forensic pathologist at the Stark County Coroner's Office, testified that she performed the autopsy of Hailey Miku, as further detailed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . Tr. at 514-515. Dr. Robinson testified that she determined that homicide was the manner of death concerning Hailey. Tr. at 559. However, upon cross-examination, Dr. Robinson could not point to a specific single injury that caused the death of Hailey. Tr. at 566.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Later during the trial proceedings, appellant moved the court to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter. The trial court overruled the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The jury ultimately found appellant guilty of the charged offenses, and the court sentenced him to an aggregate prison term of 23 years-to-life in prison (15 years-to-life for murder and a consecutive eight-year prison term for child endangering).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On April 3, 2017, appellant filed a notice of appeal. He herein raises the following seven assignments of Error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 11} \"I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT OVERRULED APPELANT'S [SIC] MOTON [SIC] TO SUPPRESS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 12} \"II.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 19} There are three methods of challenging on appeal a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress. First, an appellant may challenge the trial court's finding of fact. Second, an appellant may argue the trial court failed to apply the appropriate test or correct law to the findings of fact. Finally, an appellant may argue the trial court has incorrectly decided the ultimate or final issue raised in the motion to suppress. When reviewing this third type of claim, an appellate court must independently determine, without deference to the trial court's conclusion, whether the facts meet the appropriate legal standard in the given case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We also note that under R.C. 2929.12(D) and (E), one of the factors for consideration of the likelihood of recidivism is whether or not an offender shows \"genuine remorse for the offense.\" Upon review, we find Detective Mongold's unspecific statement that appellant's sentence \"depends on how honest you are with us\" did not constitute a misstatement of the law rendering appellant's statements involuntary and inadmissible under\n   <em>\n    Arrington\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 24} In regard to the detective's assurances that appellant could talk to his girlfriend, Jessica, we find appellant divorces this question from its context. The record indicates that after appellant presented his initial exculpatory version of events, Det. Mongold confronted him with information that had been obtained from other sources, including Jessica. Supp. Tr. at 44. Appellant then persisted in his request to see and talk with her. Likely seeking to prevent appellant from finding out what Jessica had reported and thereby allowing appellant the opportunity to line up his story with her report, Mongold understandably replied that he would see about allowing appellant to talk with Jessica after the interrogation was complete, and not before.

Among other things, she noted that Hailey weighed 27.2 pounds, which, according to her medical records, was down from her October 2015 weight of just under 28.4 pounds. Tr. at 523. According to Dr. Robinson, Hailey was in just the 5\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   percentile for weight and body mass index for a child of her age. Tr. at 524.

One of her eyes was swollen, and there was \"evidence that this eye [had] been bruised previously.\" Tr. at 526. Dr. Robinson also noted a tear in the skin behind her one ear, which the presence of a significant amount of dead skin on that part of the scalp. Hailey's hair was missing from his area, and some of her other hair easily came out in Dr. Robinson's hands during the autopsy. There was also some scabbing on her scalp, and skin had been taken off areas of the girl's face. Dr. Robinson concluded that none of these injuries were caused by a fall, but\n   were instead the result of blunt trauma.

On her body, in general, there were \"multiple medical bruises\" and \"multiple areas of abraded skin.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=574%20N.E.2d%20492\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Hailey's torso also had perimortem abrasions, which is indicative that these injuries were caused while she was dying. There was also an abrasion to the girl's labia. After examining Hailey's front side, Dr. Robinson noted bruising all along the girl's back area. Along with bruising, scabbing, and healing lesions on her buttocks, there were bruises up and down Hailey's spine, corresponding with the protrusions of her spine. According to Dr. Robinson, such injuries are often seen who have been bed-ridden for some time, producing \"bed sores,\" which could also have been caused by standing against a wall for a long time. Tr. At 542. Dr. Robinson also testified that although most children do not lose any teeth until the age of six, when permanent teeth start coming in, Hailey at age three was already missing teeth and one front tooth was merely sitting in its socket. Dr. Robinson also noted bruising and contusions on the girl's legs, which again, were not the results of a fall according to the doctor, but were instead the result of blunt trauma. Tr. at 534-546.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Dr. Robinson also opined that the foam found around Hailey's mouth at the time of her demise would indicate a \"slower death.\" Blood and other bodily fluids were leaking inside Hailey's body, collecting in her lungs and then being expelled through her mouth. An examination of Hailey's internal organs showed the presence of \"bacterial overgrowth\" in her heart, brain, eyes, and kidneys, related to bacteria in the girl's bloodstream. These organs also indicated longstanding inflammation. In addition, the small intestine showed evidence of ongoing bleeding, which results when the body's clotting agents are consumed in dealing with bleeding and inflammation in other parts of the body. In addition, the presence of bone marrow emboli in Hailey's lungs indicated the girl's bones had suffered trauma. Based on the status of her internal organs, Hailey would have needed hospitalization. Tr. at 546-557.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Dr. Robinson's conclusion was that Hailey's manner of death was a homicide. As to cause of death, the doctor testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   * * * My final anatomic diagnosis reads that she sustained inflicted trauma of varying ages of her head, face and scalp, of her torso, which is your trunk, and the extremities. There was evidence of neglect, both of general care and of medical care. There was sequelae of trauma and neglect which is things that can happen as a result of the trauma and neglect, and everything I talked about, the chronic inflammation and the things that I found in the organs are sequelae of that. With the final diagnosis coming under the heading of all these things, being the result of combined effects of acute and chronic inflicted trauma and neglect. Acute means short-term, chronic means long-term. * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Tr. at 558-559.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 35} The State also called Jessica Bender, who lived with appellant during the pertinent times in this case.

Tr. at 388-415. Hailey was \"always hungry\" and would quickly drink any beverages Jessica gave her. Tr. at 394. Jessica said she last saw Hailey alive the night before she died. The next morning, appellant came downstairs about 8:30 AM, telling her that he had given the girl some Tylenol and that she wanted to go back to bed. According to Jessica, appellant left the house to get some cigarettes at about 9:00 or 10:00 AM, and after returning, he went upstairs and found her lifeless body at about 11:00 AM. After screaming out \"she won't wake up,\" appellant called 911 and brought Hailey down to the mattress in the living room. Tr. at 419.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 36} As noted in our recitation of facts, appellant made significant confessions to Det.

In determining the offenses were not required to merge, the Court first noted that by criminalizing aggravated vehicular assault, the General Assembly had \"emphasized the necessity of a strong punishment for and deterrent against individuals causing serious physical harm while driving under the influence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. In lieu of focusing on a \"separate animus\" analysis, the Court emphasized that aggravated vehicular assault \"has a different import and significance\" than the offense of driving under the influence, because \"aggravated vehicular assault necessarily involves causing serious physical harm to another person.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On the other hand, a misdemeanor OVI offender commits his or her offense \"regardless of any subsequent consequences that occur due to the impaired driver's actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court thus concluded: \"There is a legitimate justification for criminalizing each of these offenses separately, and R.C. 2941.25 permits separate convictions for both * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   {\u00b6 79} In that light, we find that the murder statute at issue in this matter is intended to punish the taking of a human life while engaging in violence against another, while the proscription against child endangering, in principle, is for the separate overall purpose of protecting children against any type of abuse or torture, which, in this instance, resulted in serious physical harm and eventual death. Therefore, even though the two offenses were based on the same course of conduct timeframe (November 26, 2015 through March 4, 2016), we hold the trial court in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   did not err in refusing to merge the two offenses for sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   {\u00b6 80} Appellant's Seventh Assignment of Error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   {\u00b6 81} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Stark County, Ohio, is hereby affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Baldwin, J., and Wise, Earle, J., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
