This Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Late one evening, Officer Max Westfall responded to Akron-Peninsula Road based on a report that a female had jumped from a moving car. Upon his arrival, he found Mr. Martin on the roadside next to the injured female, who had been the only passenger in the car Mr. Martin had been driving. Officer Westfall spoke with Mr. Martin and detected a strong odor of alcohol coming from his person. Because he also detected several other indicia of impairment and Mr. Martin admitted that he had been drinking, he asked Mr. Martin to submit to field sobriety testing and a portable breath test. Mr. Martin, however, refused both tests. Based on the strong odor of alcohol he detected, the other indicia of impairment he observed, Mr. Martin's admission to drinking alcohol, and his refusal to undergo sobriety tests, Officer Westfall then arrested Mr. Martin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} After arresting Mr. Martin, Officer Westfall transported him to the Richfield Police Department so that a breath test could be administered. Mr. Martin initially refused to take that test as well, but agreed after Officer Westfall and another officer explained the consequences that could result from his refusal. It was then determined that Mr. Martin had a blood alcohol level of .172.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Mr. Martin was charged with two counts of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol (\"OVI\"), in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) and 4511.19(A)(1)(h). He filed several motions to suppress, and the court held a hearing on his motions. Following the hearing, the court denied the motions, and Mr. Martin pleaded no contest to the charges. The court sentenced him to 90 days in jail, a year of community control, a fine, and a license suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Mr. Martin now appeals and raises one assignment of error for this Court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED TO THE PREJUDICE OF APPELLANT BY DENYING HIS MOTIONS TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In his sole assignment of error, Mr. Martin argues that the trial court erred by denying his motions to suppress. He argues that his motions had merit because Officer Westfall lacked reasonable suspicion to detain him for field sobriety testing, lacked probable cause to arrest him, and implied coercive tactics when obtaining his consent to submit to a breath test. This Court does not agree that the trial court erred when it denied the motions to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} A motion to suppress evidence presents a mixed question of law and fact.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The accident involved Mr. Martin's passenger, who had apparently jumped from their moving car as Mr. Martin was driving. The court found that, while investigating the accident, Officer Westfall surmised that both Mr. Martin and his injured passenger had recently consumed alcohol. Specifically, the court found that Mr. Martin admitted he had consumed alcohol and \"demonstrated physical indicia of over consumption.\" Because Officer Westfall wished to investigate further, he continued to detain Mr. Martin and asked him to undergo field sobriety testing.

Officer Westfall testified that he responded to Akron-Peninsula Road based on reports that Mr. Martin's passenger had jumped from their moving car. When he arrived on scene, Mr. Martin was with the injured passenger, who was lying on the roadside about fifty feet from their car. He testified that he detected a \"strong odor of alcohol\" in their vicinity and, when paramedics arrived, he and Mr. Martin walked back over to the car Mr. Martin had been driving. While speaking with Mr. Martin, Officer Westfall continued to detect a strong odor of alcohol coming from his person, so he asked Mr. Martin how much he had to drink. Mr. Martin then replied that he had \"had three within the last two hours.\" Officer Westfall noted that Mr. Martin had red and watery eyes and was swaying back and forth during their conversation.
