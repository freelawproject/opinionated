Tharp, Lucas County Sheriff. Relator, Nathaniel Livingston, Jr., has filed a memorandum in opposition to respondents' motion. For the reasons that follow, we find respondents' motion well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Nathaniel Livingston, Jr. is the author of The Toledo Black Blog and The Cincinnati Black Blog. He describes himself as a \"Black man and a trained paralegal\" who has \"parlayed his paraprofessional\n   skills into his work as a civil rights advocate,\" and has become \"a published advocacy journalist and leader in the civil rights movement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Livingston filed an original action for writ of prohibition and mandamus in this court on June 18, 2018. In his sworn complaint, he alleges that in late August 2016, while he was observing the criminal trial of a former Toledo police lieutenant in the courtroom of Judge Gene Zmuda, Judge Zmuda ordered his \"courtroom overseer\" to notify Livingston that he was not permitted to \"freely enter or exit the courtroom\" without Judge Zmuda's permission. Livingston was told that his movement in the courtroom was distracting to the court and to the jurors. Apparently believing that Judge Zmuda's actions were on account of his race, Livingston wrote a letter to Judge Zmuda on September 1, 2016, accusing him of treating him like a \"Black slave,\" and urging him to comply with the Ohio Judicial Code of Conduct and to refrain from engaging in \"racial discrimination, bias, prejudice, or harassment.\" Livingston also claimed in that letter that Judge Zmuda failed to similarly admonish another courtroom spectator, an older white male, who had been moving around the courtroom and who failed to stand when Judge Zmuda and the jurors entered and exited the courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Livingston maintains that in retaliation for complaining about his discriminatory conduct, Judge Zmuda \"and his buddy Judge Bates\" instructed Roger Kerner, the court deputies director, to harass him and other members of the public who wished to observe court proceedings. Livingston claims that Kerner and his employees followed him around the courthouse and \"interfere[d] with his ability to interview and talk freely with members of the public, [his] colleagues in the press, and court employees.\" He insists that every Lucas County Common Pleas judge knows of this harassment and has done nothing to stop it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Livingston also alleges that on June 14, 2018, courtroom deputies physically prevented him from entering Judge Bates' courtroom, purportedly because Judge Bates does not allow observers in the courtroom once he begins instructing the jury. Livingston went to Patrick's office to request a copy of the court's order or policy to this effect, but Patrick told him that there was no written order or policy-it was simply a long-standing practice in all courtrooms. Later, Livingston claims, Kerner and a deputy again prevented him from entering the courtroom, this time stating that only court employees could enter while the jury was deliberating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Livingston asserts that an unidentified Black woman approached him in the hallway and told him that Judge Bates had systematically kicked Black people out of the courtroom throughout the trial. Livingston also observed that a Black woman employed by a local television station had been allowed in the courtroom when he had been denied access, so he again tried to enter, and Kerner again prevented him from doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Livingston went to complain to Judge Zmuda about Judge Bates' conduct in restricting his access to the courtroom, and while waiting to speak with him, Chris Kilif, Judge Bates' bailiff, told Livingston that per Judge Bates' unwritten policy, no one could authorize Livingston to enter the courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Judge Zmuda met with Kerner and Patrick in his office. After their meeting, Patrick told Livingston that Judge Zmuda said that while he does not enforce such a procedure in his courtroom, he could not or would not prevent Judge Bates from doing so. Livingston attempted\n   to confront Judge Bates but was not permitted to speak with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Livingston professes that now that he knows that select people are being denied access to the courtroom, he wants to (1) make sure that no one-including the judge and his staff-tampers with the jury, (2) monitor Judge Bates, his staff, and those who enter his courtroom, (3) monitor and observe other common pleas court judges and their staff, and (4) gather information to be published in The Toledo Black Blog and elsewhere. He filed this action, seeking a writ of mandamus or prohibition against those he claims are responsible for interfering with his right to attend court proceedings. He claims that respondents have a clear legal duty to allow him to attend court proceedings, and \"to hear evidence and argument and make findings of fact and conclusions of law before restricting access to proceedings in their courtrooms.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Livingston requested that we issue a peremptory or alternative writ of prohibition and mandamus against the respondents prohibiting them from enforcing orders, rules, policies, procedures, or protocols excluding him from observing court proceedings. He also sought costs and attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In a decision dated July 12, 2018, we found that the Lucas County Common Pleas Court is not a proper party to this action, and we dismissed the claims against it. As to the remaining respondents, we issued an alternative writ under R.C. 2731.06 and 2731.07, ordering that respondents, by July 30, 2018, either do the act requested by relator in his petition or show cause why they are not required to do so by filing (1) an answer to relator's petition pursuant to Civ.R. 8(B), or (2) a motion to dismiss relator's petition pursuant to Civ.R. 12. We also issued a scheduling order, permitting the parties to file motions for summary judgment no later than September 14, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On July 25, 2018, respondents filed an answer and a motion for summary judgment. Livingston has opposed respondents' motion. The motion is now decisional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In their motion, respondents deny Livingston's allegations that Judge Bates or Judge Zmuda closed their courtrooms in violation of the U.S. and Ohio Constitutions. Rather, they clarify, Judge Bates (1) prohibits spectators from entering or leaving the courtroom while he is instructing the jury, but allows those already in the courtroom to stay; (2) bars non-staff from entering the courtroom while the jury is deliberating; and (3) limits access to the courtroom when court is not in session. Judge Bates contends that there is no courthouse-wide policy delineating these restrictions; rather it is within the discretion of each judge to determine how best to preserve order and limit distractions during jury trials. Judge Bates maintains that Livingston was barred from the courtroom only to the extent that he sought to enter during jury instructions, while the jury was deliberating, or while court was not in session.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Respondents insist that Judges Bates' practices-and any limitations that Judge Zmuda may place on spectators' ingress and egress from the courtroom to minimize distractions during proceedings-do not violate the U.S. or Ohio Constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} As to Patrick and Kerner, respondents contend that these individuals are non-judges, subject to the direction of the ten common-pleas court judges, and lack the authority to set policy for the judges. Kilif, they claim, is one of two bailiffs employed by Judge Bates, and also lacks authority to set policy. And, they maintain, Tharp had no involvement with Livingston being denied access to any courtroom. Respondents argue that the claims against them must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Finally, respondents maintain that Livingston is not entitled to attorney fees because (1) his claims are meritless, (2) such fees cannot be assessed in original actions unless authorized by statute, and (3) as a pro se litigant, he cannot recover fees under Ohio law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The right of the public to attend criminal proceedings is implicit in the guarantees of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Livingston's complaint alleges that Judge Zmuda also sought to limit movement in the courtroom to minimize distractions to the jury. We conclude that these reasonable limitations on ingress and egress to the courtroom do not violate the right of the public to attend criminal proceedings. Having said this, we recognize-as the Ohio Supreme Court did in\n   <em>\n    Wilks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12540184\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/114/1092/\">\n    2018-Ohio-1562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , --- N.E.3d ----, \u00b6 74 -that while a trial court has discretion to control the proceedings in such a manner, \"it must exercise that discretion carefully and sparingly.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 25} We next turn to Livingston's assertion that he was denied access to Judge Bates' courtroom during jury deliberations.

Moreover, the right to a public trial is not violated where spectators are asked to wait outside the courtroom when court is not in session.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, we conclude that Livingston was not barred from attending any criminal proceeding when he was prevented from entering the courtroom while the jury deliberated. He has cited no case law suggesting that he had a right to be in the courtroom while the jury was deliberating and when court was not in session.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 26} To be entitled to a writ of prohibition, a relator must establish that \"(1) the [respondent] is about to exercise judicial or quasi-judicial power, (2) the exercise of that power is unauthorized by law, and (3) denial of the writ will cause injury for which no other adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law exists.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

We find that Livingston has failed to demonstrate that respondents have exercised or intend to exercise power unauthorized by law, and is therefore not entitled to a writ of prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Moreover, we find that a writ of mandamus may not be employed \"to require a judicial officer to prospectively observe the law, or to remedy the anticipated nonperformance of that duty,\" thus Livingston is also not entitled to a writ of mandamus.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Finally, we conclude that Livingston is not entitled to attorney fees and costs. Accordingly, we find respondents' motion for summary judgment well-taken. We dismiss Livingston's complaint in its entirety as against all respondents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Placing limitations on spectators' ingress and egress to the courtroom in an effort to minimize distractions during jury instructions, closing arguments, and witness testimony, does not violate the public's right to attend criminal proceedings. The public's right to attend criminal proceedings is also not violated when a trial judge restricts access to the courtroom when court is not in session. Accordingly, we find respondents' motion for summary\n   judgment well-taken, and we dismiss Livingston's complaint in its entirety. Costs assessed to relator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Writ denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Mark L. Pietrykowski, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   James D.
