This Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Child was born to Mr. Meier (\"Biological Father\") and Larami Ball, fka Larami McLean, (\"Mother\") in California in 2005. Biological Father and Mother were never married, but Biological Father was listed on Child's birth certificate. According to a 2006 paternity test filed by Biological Father, \"the probability of [his] paternity [of Child] is 99.99%.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Biological Father filed an action in California to establish his parentage. By entry dated May 8, 2006, the court found that Mother and Biological Father are the parents of Child. The court further incorporated into that entry the parents' stipulation and agreement concerning child custody and visitation which specified that \"[t]he parents shall share joint legal custody\" of Child whose \"[p]rimary [r]esidence shall be with [M]other.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Mother subsequently married Christopher Ball (\"Stepfather\"). In 2008, the California court granted Mother permission to move to Ohio. Thereafter, Mother and Biological Father instituted multiple actions concerning Child. Biological Father commenced actions in Wayne County, Ohio and Macon County, Illinois. Mother commenced actions in Summit County, Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} A more complete history of Biological Father's and Mother's various actions can be found in\n   <em>\n    Ball v.

As it relates to the arguments raised by the parties in the current appeal, this Court previously \"conclude[d] that Ohio ha[d] jurisdiction to modify the California orders.\"\n   <em>\n    Ball\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. The Illinois court, on the other hand, found it \"was devoid of jurisdiction\" and recognized this Court's determination \"that Ohio-not Illinois-had jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Meier\n   </em>\n   at *6 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ball\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12-13 (noting that parties could not by agreement confer jurisdiction upon an Illinois court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On September 12, 2016, Stepfather filed a petition to adopt Child in the Summit County Common Pleas Court, Probate Division. The petition alleged that Biological Father's consent was not required because he had \"failed without justifiable cause to provide more than de minimis contact with the minor for a period of at least one year immediately preceding the filing of the adoption petition * * *.\" The petition listed Biological Father's address as 4840 Forest Parkway, Decatur, Illinois 62521.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Counsel for Stepfather filed an affidavit for service by publication. He averred that he had represented Mother in the various Ohio and Illinois court actions involving Biological Father. He represented that the last address any of those courts had for Biological Father was 4840 Forest Parkway, Decatur, Illinois 62521, but mail had been returned in the most recent court action from that address. He continued that an internet search for Biological Father's address also referred to the Decatur, Illinois address. He further averred that neither he, Mother, nor Stepfather knew Biological Father's whereabouts or residence, and that Biological Father's address could not be ascertained with reasonable diligence. Upon review of the affidavit, the court ordered service of notice by publication. Proof of publication was filed with the court stating that the notice was published in the Akron Legal News on September 29, October 6, and October 13, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On September 21, 2016, the court sent a \"Notice of Consent Hearing\" and a \"Notice of Hearing on Petition for Adoption\" to Biological Father at 4840 Forest Parkway, Decatur, Illinois 62521. The notices\n   informed Biological Father that Stepfather had filed a petition to adopt Child and that a hearing was scheduled for October 27, 2016 to determine whether Biological Father's consent was necessary for the adoption. The notices further informed Biological Father that, to contest the adoption, he was required to file an objection \"within fourteen days after proof of service of [the] notice[s]\" and \"[he] must also appear at the hearing.\" (Emphasis deleted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The hearing went forward as scheduled before the magistrate. Biological Father did not appear at the hearing. Mother testified at the hearing. In addition, orders from the California court and the Summit County Common Pleas Court, Domestic Relations Division, were entered into evidence. That same day the magistrate issued a decision concluding that the consent of Biological Father was unnecessary for Stepfather to adopt Child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The magistrate's decision was sent to Biological Father at 4840 Forest Parkway, Decatur, Illinois. On November 10, 2016, Biological Father entered a limited appearance objecting to the court's exercise of subject matter and personal jurisdiction over him. He requested that \"the following service address [be used] from this point forward: Dustin Eugene Johan Meier[,] 752 North Main Street, # 421[,] Mansfield, Texas 76063.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   \" (Emphasis deleted.) Biological Father further requested leave to object stating that he became aware of the present action \"via a telephone call\" on November 4, 2016 informing him that he had received mail from a Summit County, Ohio court at the Decatur, Illinois address. The court granted Biological Father an extension of time to properly request a copy of its records, to have a transcript of the hearing prepared, and to file supplemental objections to the magistrate's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In his supplemental objections, Biological Father contended, inter alia, that California had exclusive subject matter jurisdiction, he had not been properly served the petition for adoption, and that his failure to provide more than de minimis contact with Child for a period of at least one year was justified. The court overruled Biological Father's objections. Biological Father appeals, raising four assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Prior to addressing Biological Father's assignments of error, this Court pauses to note that a probate court's determination that a parent's consent to an adoption is not required is a final appealable order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re adoption of Greer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1732185\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/70/293/#p298\">\n    70 Ohio St.3d 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 298,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=638%20N.E.2d%20999\">\n    638 N.E.2d 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994).

The current appeal is from the Summit County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division. No other Ohio actions are before this Court in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Similarly, Stepfather argues that, because this Court concluded that Ohio had jurisdiction in\n   <em>\n    Ball\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-5864\">\n    2012-Ohio-5864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%206206659\">\n    2012 WL 6206659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Biological Father is barred by the law-of-the-case doctrine from challenging jurisdiction in the current case. The law-of-the-case doctrine, however, does not require a court to follow a superior court's decision in a prior appeal involving one of the parties in the context of a different case.\n   <em>\n    Reid v.

In\n   <em>\n    Ball\n   </em>\n   , Biological Father appealed from a judgment of the Summit County Common Pleas Court, Domestic Relations Division, and this Court addressed \"the subject matter jurisdiction of Ohio courts to resolve custody disputes pertaining to [Child].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-5864\">\n    2012-Ohio-5864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%206206659\">\n    2012 WL 6206659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 1, 6. Although Biological Father was a party to both actions, the law of the case in the domestic relations action does not bar his current arguments concerning the jurisdiction of the probate court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Turning to the merits of the jurisdictional issue, \"[t]here is a distinction between a court that lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over a case and a court that improperly exercises that subject-matter jurisdiction once conferred upon it.\"\n   <em>\n    Pratts v.

In the present matter, Stepfather brought a petition to adopt Child, which is a matter within the probate court's \"original and exclusive jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=853%20N.E.2d%20647\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Hence, Biological Father's challenge concerns not subject-matter jurisdiction itself, but the exercise of that jurisdiction in this particular case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In\n   <em>\n    Pushcar\n   </em>\n   , the Ohio Supreme Court held that, despite having subject-matter jurisdiction, a probate court must refrain from proceeding on an adoption petition when the parentage of that child is pending in another court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9-10. But, the Court also reaffirmed that \" '[a] [p]robate [c]ourt has jurisdiction to hear and determine an adoption proceeding relating to a minor child notwithstanding the fact that the custody of such child is at the time within the continuing jurisdiction of [another] court.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9, quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of Biddle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1726709\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st/168/209/\">\n    168 Ohio St. 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=152%20N.E.2d%20105\">\n    152 N.E.2d 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1958), paragraph two of the syllabus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Consequently, the central issue is whether the pending action in California involved paternity or custody. Biological Father phrases much of his argument in terms of the \"parentage action\" that he asserts \"remains pending\" in California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Yet, in the fact section of his brief, he characterized the California, Wayne County, and Summit County actions as \"simultaneous custody proceedings.\" Regardless of the phrasing chosen by Biological Father, this Court must examine the substance of the matters decided and the matters alleged to be pending in California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 20} At the magistrate's hearing, a number of certified entries from the California court were entered into evidence. These included a May 8, 2006 judgment entry wherein it states: \"THE COURT FINDS Larami McLean [and] Dustin Meier are the parents of [Child].\" (Emphasis sic.) Biological Father attached a copy of this same entry to his supplemental objections. Biological Father also included a number of other items from the California court. He did not provide any evidence that the 2006 paternity finding was ever vacated, or even challenged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The only entry that Biological Father claims was vacated by the California court was a July 21, 2008 entry regarding Mother's relocation to Ohio. Biological Father challenges whether Child's \"primary residence\" was to be with Mother or Biological Father when Mother moved to Ohio. The items that Biological Father contends are pending pertain to custody, visitation, and contempt. Those items do not relate to paternity and, therefore, do not affect the probate court's exercise of its jurisdiction. The facts in the present case are unlike those in\n   <em>\n    Pushcar\n   </em>\n   wherein a juvenile court was awaiting genetic testing to establish paternity when the adoption petition was filed in probate court.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5580474\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/110/332/\">\n    110 Ohio St.3d 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006-Ohio-4572\">\n    2006-Ohio-4572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=853%20N.E.2d%20647\">\n    853 N.E.2d 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 4, 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In his reply brief, Biological Father contends that the May 8, 2006 entry could not be relied upon because it states that it was \" 'pending further order of court on a temporary basis' \" and that \" '[t]his visitation and custody schedule shall be incorporated into any judgment of paternity.' \" Biological Father cannot use his reply brief to raise new issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schmitt v.

Moreover, Biological Father takes these quotes out of context and, in so doing, distorts their meaning. The May 8, 2006 entry consists of two pages and a four page attachment. The court's finding of paternity appears on the first page of the entry. The quotes referenced by Biological Father are contained in the attachment, which concerns \"CHILD CUSTODY AND VISITATION.\" (Emphasis sic.) The attachment begins by stating, \"The parties made the following stipulations in open court on 4/25/2006.\" The court incorporated the April 25, 2006 stipulations regarding custody and visitation into its May 8, 2006 judgment of paternity by referencing and attaching it thereto. As to what remained \"pending further order,\" the complete quote states: \"The parties agree the court order for custody and visitation of [Child] shall be as follows, pending further order of the court on a temporary basis.\" Thus, what remained \"pending\" was not paternity, but custody and visitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Biological Father's first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 2\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY ACCEPTING THE STATEMENTS OF [ ] COUNSEL FOR [STEPFATHER] AS \"TESTIMONY\" FOR THE PURPOSE OF EVIDENCE OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF [BIOLOGICAL FATHER].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 24} In his second assignment of error, Biological Father contends that \"the trial court relied solely on [Stepfather's] counsel's unsworn testimony re[garding]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   establishment of paternity to determine its continued exercise of subject matter jurisdiction.\" This assertion is not supported by the record, which also contains certified copies of the California court's May 8, 2006 entry establishing paternity.
