On July 6, 1992, Bedway transferred 47.737 acres out of the parent parcel to Bruner Land Company (\"Bruner\"). The transfer to Bruner was made as a result of a survey performed by Russel Neitzelt (\"Neitzelt\"). Two days later, on July 8, 1992, Bedway transferred 101.728 acres out of the parent parcel to Martin Yoder (\"Yoder\"). The transfer was made as a result of a survey performed by the same surveyor, Neitzelt. The 101.728 acre tract was divided in half and appellees Michael and Elaine Checovich own 51.536 acres of this tract. The 47.737 tract is now owned by appellant James Cochran.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In the deed, Neitzelt described the property from Bedway to Bruner as being 775.46 feet from a point in the northern property line consisting of 47.73 acres. Two days later, a deed was filed in which Neitzelt described the property from Bedway to Yoder in a manner that reflected an iron pin two hundred feet shorter than the 775.46 feet described in the Bedway to Bruner deed. The two hundred foot discrepancy in the two deed descriptions means that ownership of approximately twelve acres of the real estate is disputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On February 1, 2017, appellees Michael and Elaine Checovich and appellees John and Marcia Fuchs filed a complaint to quiet title against appellant James Cochran. In the complaint, appellees allege the Checovichs' are the owners of the real estate parcel 28-00070-002 acquired via warranty deed on August 15, 2008. Further, that appellees John and Marcia Fuchs are the owners of real estate parcel 28-00316.00 acquired via a general warranty deed on October 4, 2000. The complaint avers appellant James Cochran is the owner of real estate parcel 28-0000079.001 acquired via a quit claim deed on June 15, 2011. The complaint states the properties of the Checovichs', the Fuchs', and Cochran adjoin one another and share various boundaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The complaint further avers that on or about August 29, 2016, Gary D. Saling (\"Saling\") of Spilker Surveying conducted a survey of Cochran's real estate for Cochran. Further, that on January 8, 2017, Thomas Wayne Taylor (\"Taylor\") of East Ohio Surveying conducted a survey of the real estate at issue for appellees. The complaint alleges the surveys are in conflict with regards to a twelve (12) acre area of land located on the eastern border of the Checovich property, the northern border of the Fuchs property, and the western border of the Cochran property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The complaint includes two causes of action, trespass and quiet title. Appellees requested the trial court quiet title of the twelve-acre parcel to them and declare them as the true and rightful owners of the twelve-acre parcel of property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Cochran filed an answer to the complaint on February 15, 2017. Cochran\n   also filed a counterclaim, alleging trespass and quiet title claims against appellees. Cochran requested the twelve-acre parcel be transferred to him via quiet title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On September 14, 2017, Cochran filed a motion for summary judgment. He argued the court should only consider the most senior conveyance from the parent parcel in order to fix the boundary and should not consider an iron pin placed by Neitzelt, as monuments should only be relied upon when deeds have been analyzed and do not resolve the conflict. Cochran urged the court to adopt the \"senior rights theory\" adopted in other states, including Michigan, Kentucky, and Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellees filed their own motion for summary judgment on September 15, 2017. Appellees also filed a memorandum contra to Cochran's motion for summary judgment on September 28, 2017. Appellees argued the Saling survey did not consider all relevant items; the monuments in this case are controlling; and the original Neitzelt survey is consistent with the rest of the surveys and with where all properties subject to this action are encompassed. Appellees also asserted that the Saling survey would place a portion of the Fuchs' home on the property of Cochran and that the Fuchs' have been living there full-time since 2000. Further, that the exhibits show there is an old road that borders the properties that was relocated consistent with the current boundaries. In addition to the Saling and Taylor surveys, attached as an exhibit to appellees' motion for summary judgment is the survey of Jack Hamilton (\"Hamilton\") dated July 24, 1996, that places the twelve (12) acres at issue inside the appellees' property line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On September 28, 2017, Cochran submitted a supplemental affidavit of Saling. In the affidavit, Saling states that while his survey does go through the Fuchs' property, it does not place a portion of the Fuchs home on the property of Cochran; rather, it only places a portion of the Fuchs driveway on the Cochran property. On October 5, 2017, appellees filed a notice of correction of factual statements contained in their motion for summary judgment. The notice of correction states the affidavit of Saling, \"correctly stated that the Saling survey takes a portion of the Fuchs' driveway,\" not a portion of their home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The trial court issued an entry on October 10, 2017. The trial court found that in construing the language and legal description of the two deeds, it was unable to resolve the conflict based upon the deed descriptions themselves. The trial court found, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Kennedy v. Rose\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist. Perry No. 07-CA-00006,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-3929\">\n    2008-Ohio-3929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202972642\">\n    2008 WL 2972642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , when boundary line disputes exist between adjacent property owners and the deed descriptions do not resolve the conflict, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with the minimum standards for boundary surveys. The trial court then reviewed the minimum standards for boundary surveys provided by the Ohio State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Surveyors encompassed in Ohio Administrative Code Chapter 4733-37, including reviewing the physical monuments. The trial court found Neitzelt placed an iron pin at the boundary line and the pin is dispositive of the issues in the case. Further, that in his survey, Saling relied solely on the language provided in the description of the property in the Cochran deed and did not take into account any of the physical monuments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment and denied Cochran's motion for summary judgment. The trial court ordered appellees' attorney to submit a proposed entry within fourteen days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On October 23, 2017, the trial court issued a judgment entry consistent with its October 10, 2017 entry. The trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment and denied Cochran's motion for summary judgment. The trial court declared the disputed twelve acres at issue to be the respective property of the Checovichs' and the Fuchs'. The trial court quieted titled of the twelve acres at issue to appellees and issued a permanent injunction in favor of appellees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellant Cochran appeals the judgment entry of the Guernsey County Court of Common Pleas and assigns the following as error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} \"I.

Appellant urges this Court to adopt the theory of \"senior rights\" as several courts in other states have done. Pursuant to this theory, a later or \"junior\" grant yields to an earlier \"senior\" grant. Thus, based on this principle, the Bruner deed controls in this case. Appellant further argues the deed descriptions at issue do resolve the boundary line dispute and are not in conflict. Appellees contends the trial court correctly applied the well-settled law in Ohio. We agree with appellees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In this case, we deal with a boundary dispute between adjoining landowners. As this Court has previously stated in\n   <em>\n    Kennedy v. Rose\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist. Perry No. 07-CA-00006,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-3929\">\n    2008-Ohio-3929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202972642\">\n    2008 WL 2972642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"when boundary line disputes exist between adjacent property owners and the deed descriptions do not resolve the conflict, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with the minimum standards for boundary surveys.\" The Ohio State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Surveyors has established minimum standards for boundary surveys. See Ohio Adm. Code Chapter 4733-37. Ohio Administrative Code 4733-37-01 indicates the rules adopted by the board \"are intended to be the basis for all surveys relating to the establishment or retracement of property boundaries in the state of Ohio.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Pursuant to Ohio Administrative Code 4733-37-02(A),\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   When the deed description of the subject property and the deed descriptions of adjoining properties do not resolve the unique locations of the corners and lines of the property being surveyed, the surveyor shall consult other sources of information in order to assemble the best possible set of written evidence of every corner and line of the property being surveyed. These sources include, but are not limited to: records of previous surveys, deed descriptions of adjacent properties, records of adjacent highways, railroads and public utility lines; also include subdivision plats, tax maps, topographic maps, aerial photographs, and other sources as may be appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Further, Ohio Administrative Code 4733-37-02(B) states, \"after all necessary written documents have been analyzed, the survey shall be based on a field investigation of the property. The surveyor shall make a thorough search for physical monuments, analyze evidence of occupation and confer with the owner(s) of the property being surveyed. In addition, the surveyor shall, when necessary, confer with the owner(s) of the adjoining property and take statements.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Appellant first contends the deeds at issue are not in conflict and thus we need not look to the minimum standards as set forth in well-settled Ohio law. We disagree. The deeds at issue, filed only two days apart and made as a result of surveys from the same surveyor, described the property in a manner that resulted in a two-hundred foot discrepancy. Further, multiple surveys conducted based upon these deeds came to different conclusions as to the location of the boundary line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Thus, we find the deeds at issue in conflict. Accordingly, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with the minimum standards for boundary surveys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 25} As stated by the Ohio Supreme Court, \"it is well settled that monuments are of prime importance in settling boundary disputes.\"\n   <em>\n    Broadsword v.

Further, \"generally, in determining boundaries, natural and permanent monuments are the most satisfactory evidence and control all other means of description, in the absence of which the following calls are resorted to, and generally in the order stated: first, natural boundaries; second, artificial marks; third, adjacent boundaries; fourth, course and distance * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20N.E.2d%20111\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In\n   <em>\n    Sellman\n   </em>\n   , the Tenth District held that where a survey of a parcel of land has been made by a certified surveyor and a plat is made and duly recorded, the boundary lines determined by original monuments will \"determine the boundaries of the respective lots irrespective of deviation from the course or distance as set forth in the plat.\"\n   <em>\n    Sellman v.

The parties do not dispute the iron pin was placed on the boundary line by Neitzelt or that these boundaries have been followed since Neitzelt's original survey. Thus, the boundary lines determined by the original monument, the iron pin, will determine the boundaries of the respective lots and it is the duty of a re-surveyor to relocate the original lines and corners at the places actually established and not to run independent new lines. Both the Taylor and Hamilton resurveys are in line with Ohio Administrative Code Section 4733-37-02, the well-established Ohio case law in\n   <em>\n    Broadsword\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sellman\n   </em>\n   , and our decision in\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Appellant argues since this Court found it was reasonable for the trial court to utilize the Harkness survey in\n   <em>\n    Kennedy v. Rose\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist. Perry No. 07-CA-00006,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-3929\">\n    2008-Ohio-3929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202972642\">\n    2008 WL 2972642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that the trial court and this Court must utilize the Saling survey in this case because it was the only survey that conforms to the \"senior grant\" contained in the Bruner deed. However, the\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   case was not decided on a \"senior rights\" theory in which a later or junior grant simply yields to an earlier senior grant. Rather, this Court cited to both the\n   <em>\n    Broadsword\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sellman\n   </em>\n   cases and affirmed the decision of the trial court because we found \"the testimony of Charles Harkness established that he conducted his survey in accordance with surveying standards. Harkness researched and utilized other sources of information to determine the intent of the parties in creating the original boundary lines consistent with Ohio Adm. Code 4733-37-02. Furthermore, he relied on feasible monumentation both natural and artificial. Finally, he took into account common property usage in 1949 and the area of the property in question * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 29} In this case, in his survey, Saling relied solely on the language provided in the description of the property in the Cochran deed. There is no evidence Saling took into account any of the other minimum standards for boundary surveys, including the physical monuments such as the iron pin of Neitzelt, the new road that had been established, or evidence of occupation such as the location of the Fuchs' driveway, a portion of which under his survey would be on Cochran's land. The Taylor survey sets the boundary at the iron pin found at the original corner capped by Neitzelt, as does the survey by Hamilton in 1996, and these surveys are consistent with the description of Neitzelt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Additionally, another important fact weighing in favor of appellees is that appellees were in possession of the disputed premises when this controversy arose, when this action was instituted, and they have been in possession of the disputed premises for many years; further, appellees exercised rights of ownership and performed acts of dominion on the disputed premises. The parties do not dispute that the Saling survey would place a portion of the Fuchs' driveway on the Cochran property, or that the Fuchs' have been living there full-time since 2000. Further, there is no dispute there is an old road bordering the properties that was relocated consistent with the boundaries established by the Neitzelt iron pin. See\n   <em>\n    Broadsword v.
