The docket reflects over 600 entries spanning eight years. In this appeal, which is the third addressed by our court, the parties continue to litigate the financial terms of their divorce. The wife appeals from various judgments and orders that dismissed her complaints for modification and found her in contempt of the divorce judgment. The husband cross appeals from a judgment of modification. Discerning no error or other abuse of discretion, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Procedural history of divorce action\n   </em>\n   . On November 9, 2010, during the trial of the husband's divorce complaint, the parties executed a hand-written agreement (agreement) that was read into the record and later memorialized in a writing signed by both parties. Pursuant to paragraph two of the agreement, both parties waived their right to receive periodic alimony payments from the other. In consideration of the husband's alimony waiver, the wife agreed to pay the husband $1 million in two lump sum payments on or before December 1, 2013, and December 1, 2018. In addition, the wife agreed to pay annually to the husband \"an amount for alimony equal to four percent of the outstanding indebtedness\" on any unpaid amounts of the lump sum. The wife asserted that she planned to make these payments using money she earned through her business, Cambridge NanoTech (CNT).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The agreement set forth the parties' respective financial obligations following the divorce. It divided marital assets, provided for health insurance and education expenses for the parties' minor children, and set forth the parties' obligations to maintain life insurance. The parties agreed that the terms of the agreement would survive the judgment of divorce, \"except as to provisions relating to the children.\" Before the agreement was read into the record at trial, the judge advised the parties that its terms were binding and that \"what is read into the record is what is going to be found as part of the judgment\" of divorce. After hearing its terms, the judge concluded that the agreement was \"fair and reasonable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   A bifurcated judgment of divorce nisi entered which did not address custody and visitation of the children. On February 17, 2011, a supplemental judgment entered with respect to custody and visitation. Both parties appealed. Following a remand from this court, a judge of the Probate and Family Court issued findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an amended rationale that was affirmed by a different panel of this court in an unpublished decision issued pursuant to our rule 1:28.\n   <em>\n    Phelps\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Becker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201105\">\n    84 Mass. App. Ct. 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (\n   <em>\n    Phelps I\n   </em>\n   ). Neither party challenged the terms of the agreement in that appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2012, the husband remarried. That same year, CNT was sold and its assets were dispersed to creditors. On August 2, 2012, the wife filed a complaint seeking a declaration that her alimony obligation under the agreement was terminated by law pursuant to the Alimony Reform Act of 2011, G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 49 (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ). On August 22, 2014, this court held that the four per cent interest payments identified in the agreement constitute alimony that is not modifiable under the Alimony Reform Act because the parties agreed that those provisions survived the judgment of divorce.\n   <em>\n    Becker\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Phelps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4238722\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/86/169/#p172\">\n    86 Mass. App. Ct. 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 172 (2014) (\n   <em>\n    Phelps II\n   </em>\n   ). By contrast, the lump sum payments were part of the overall division of marital property and were not modifiable because the judge found the agreement to be \"fair and reasonable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Postdivorce litigation\n   </em>\n   . The parties filed numerous postdivorce actions and motions. Many complaints were filed before other complaints had been resolved. As best we can discern, the following actions are the subject of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    August 13, 2013, complaint for modification\n   </em>\n   . On August 13, 2013, the wife filed a complaint for modification of her child support obligation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 17, 2016, following six days of trial, a second judge of the Probate and Family Court found a material change in circumstances based upon (1) the failure of CNT and the wife's continued unemployment, and (2) the husband's increased income. Insofar as is relevant here, the judge attributed a gross annual income to the wife of $30,000. Although the judge's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and rationale on the wife's complaint for modification entered on October 17, 2016, judgment did not enter until July 3, 2017. On July 6, 2017, the husband filed a notice of appeal from the modification judgment. On August 4, 2017, the wife also filed a notice of appeal from the judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    November 19, 2013, complaint for contempt\n   </em>\n   . On November 19, 2013, the husband filed a complaint for contempt asserting that the wife had received tax refunds from CNT but had not paid the husband his proportionate share as required by the agreement. Following an evidentiary hearing, the judge who had granted the divorce found the wife in contempt and ordered her to pay fifty percent of the tax refunds to the husband, along with his costs and attorney's fees. A subsequent motion by the wife to vacate the contempt order was allowed because there was no finding regarding the wife's present ability to pay. On August 9, 2017, a judgment of not guilty entered on the complaint for contempt. The judgment explicitly did not relieve the wife \"of her obligation to make two lump sum payments in the amount of $500,000 each in lieu of alimony.\" The wife timely appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    August, 2014, actions\n   </em>\n   . On August 12, 2014, the wife filed a \"complaint for modification of alimony due to countervailing equities.\" The wife claimed that she lacked the financial means to make the alimony payments called for in paragraph two of the agreement; specifically, she could not pay the husband $1 million without becoming a public charge. She requested that her obligations under the agreement be terminated and that the husband be ordered to pay her support in the amount of $2,000 per week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 25, 2014, three days after the decision in\n   <em>\n    Phelps II\n   </em>\n   , the wife moved to vacate the agreement and an August 16, 2011, contempt judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   She claimed that the husband had misrepresented his income and the value of his business at the time of the divorce and in postdivorce proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 22, 2014, the wife's motion to vacate the agreement was denied in a margin endorsement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 30, 2014, the husband moved pursuant to Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 12 (b) (6), to dismiss (1) the modification complaint, (2) the motion to vacate the agreement, and (3) the motion to vacate the April 16, 2011, contempt judgment. On January 21, 2015, the husband's motion was allowed. Relying on our decision in\n   <em>\n    Phelps II\n   </em>\n   and the parties' submissions, the judge concluded that the lump sum payments were not modifiable because the lump sum payments do not constitute spousal support.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 23, 2015, judgment entered dismissing the wife's modification complaint, the motion to vacate the agreement, and the motion to vacate the April 16, 2011, contempt judgment. The wife timely appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    May 26, 2015, complaint for modification\n   </em>\n   . On May 26, 2015, the wife filed a complaint for modification alleging that the husband refused to co-parent with her, was drinking heavily, and was scaring the children. The wife sought, among other things: (1) sole custody of the children, (2) an order that the husband pay all expenses incurred on behalf of the children, (3) appointment of a guardian ad litem, and (4) appointment of a parenting coordinator (to be paid for by the husband). The wife further requested that she be relieved of her obligation to make the lump sum payments, that the husband be ordered to pay her alimony, that the husband provide for the children to receive at least fifty percent of his estate upon his death, and that the husband be liable to her for child support in the amount of $965 per week. On September 10, 2015, the wife moved to amend her complaint by adding a claim for authorization to remove the children from the Commonwealth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   That same day, the husband moved to dismiss portions of the complaint pursuant to Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 12 (b) (6). Among other things, the husband asserted that the financial relief sought by the wife was precluded by the principle of res judicata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 22, 2016, a third judge of the Probate and Family Court issued a partial judgment of modification that dismissed those portions of the mother's complaint which sought relief from her financial obligations to the husband. The judge noted that the wife repeatedly had sought to avoid her obligations under the parties' surviving agreement, and held that \"[h]er arguments have already been litigated in this [c]ourt and she should not be allowed to continue to seek the same relief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 21, 2016, the wife filed a motion for entry of separate and final judgment and/or to vacate those portions of the June 22, 2016, partial judgment that (1) dismissed her financial claims, and (2) prohibited her from further filings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also filed a notice of appeal from the June 22, 2016, partial judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Complaint for modification based on countervailing equities\n   </em>\n   .

She claims she has no income or assets except for $40,000 held in escrow for the benefit of the husband and $17,000 in a retirement fund. The marital home is leveraged, she has paid $1.5 million in legal fees since 2008, and she requires spousal support to \"keep the marital home and meet her primary responsibility to continue to take excellent care of the children.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The judge dismissed the wife's modification complaint, reasoning that the countervailing equities doctrine only applies to alimony obligations in a surviving separation agreement and the lump sum payments are not alimony.

Because the countervailing equities doctrine is a basis for modification,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   it does not apply to nonmodifiable property settlements. As there appears to be no genuine dispute that the lump sum payments were part of the property settlement,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   they are not subject to modification and dismissal of the wife's modification complaint was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the lump sum payments could be modified on the basis of countervailing equities, which we do not suggest, dismissal of the wife's modification complaint would still have been proper. To be entitled to relief on this ground, the wife's complaint must support an inference that (1) the wife is or will become a public charge, (2) the husband has not complied with the provisions of the agreement, or (3) there exists some other countervailing equity \"at least as compelling as these two grounds.\"\n   <em>\n    Stansel\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stansel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"900712\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/385/510/#p515\">\n    385 Mass. 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 515-516 (1982).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The wife's complaint does not allege that the husband has failed to comply with the provisions of the agreement. While it does allege that the wife will become a public charge if required to pay the husband $1 million, this conclusory allegation is not borne out by the factual allegations or the wife's March 24, 2014, financial statement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The wife has assets in the form of the marital home, a vehicle, a checking account in her name, $40,000 held in escrow, and $33,854.98 in a retirement account. The judge was not required to accept her assertion that she has no assets.
