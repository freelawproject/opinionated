CR-14-584243-A, CR-14-591390-A and CR-14-591534-C, after he violated community control sanctions. Jung contends that his sentences in all three cases should be vacated because the record does not support the imposition of maximum sentences and the trial court improperly imposed postrelease control for an unclassified felony in CR-14-591390. For the reasons that follow, we vacate the portion of Jung's sentence in CR-14-591390 that imposes postrelease control. We otherwise affirm Jung's sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In September 2016, Jung pled guilty to one count of breaking and entering in violation of R.C. 2911.13 (a fifth-degree felony) and one count of theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1) (a first-degree misdemeanor) in CR-14-584243, one count of open dumping and burning in violation of R.C. 3734.03 (an unclassified felony) in CR-14-591390 and one count of receiving stolen property in violation of R.C. 2913.51(1) (a fifth-degree felony) in CR-14-591534. At the time Jung committed these offenses he was on probation for a theft charge in the Parma Municipal Court. On October 5, 2016, after reviewing the presentence investigation report and hearing from Jung, his counsel and the mother of Jung's children, the trial court sentenced Jung to one-and-a-half years of community control sanctions in each case. The trial court also sentenced Jung to a six-month jail term on the theft charge in CR-14-584243, but suspended the jail term, ordered Jung to perform 100 hours of community service in CR-14-591390, ordered Jung to pay $3,020 in restitution\n   in CR-14-591534 and ordered him to perform community service in lieu of paying costs in all three cases. At the sentencing hearing, the trial court advised Jung that if he violated the community control sanctions, he would receive maximum sentences in each case. The trial judge further indicated that he would order that the sentences be served consecutively. Jung did not appeal the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On October 20, 2016, Jung failed a drug test, testing positive for opiates and heroin. A capias was issued for his arrest. In December 2016, Jung was arrested on the capias.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On December 22, 2016, the trial court held a community control violation hearing based on the failed drug test. Jung admitted the allegations against him and the trial court found Jung to have violated his community control sanctions. After hearing from Jung, his counsel, the probation officer and the state, the trial judge continued community control sanctions in each of the cases, ordering Jung to complete an inpatient treatment program and attend aftercare and twelve-step meetings. The trial judge told Jung, \"If you fail to comply with these orders of probation, you're looking at some serious consequences.\" He once again informed Jung that if he violated the community control sanctions, he would receive maximum sentences in each case and that he would order that the sentences be served consecutively. Jung indicated that he understood. Jung was remanded to the Cuyahoga County jail and ordered to be transported to an inpatient treatment facility when a bed became available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On January 4, 2017, Jung was transported to a residential treatment facility for inpatient drug treatment. That same day, he absconded from the facility. A capias was issued for his arrest. In May 2017, Jung was arrested on the capias and returned to jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On May 22, 2017, the trial court held a second community control violation hearing. Once again, Jung admitted the allegations against him and the trial court found that Jung violated his community control sanctions by absconding from the treatment facility. Prior to sentencing Jung on the community control violation, the trial court heard from Jung, his probation officer and his counsel. The probation officer outlined the allegations against Jung and indicated that a computerized criminal history record check did not reveal any new charges pending against Jung. Jung apologized for his actions and claimed that he left the facility due to a \"family emergency\" and concern regarding the safety of his children. He admitted that after he absconded from the inpatient treatment facility, he had lied and had given his father's name as his own when he was approached by police while collecting donations for his son's flag football team and when he was arrested for the community control violation. He requested a second chance to complete treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} After \"consider[ing] all this information,\" the trial court found that Jung was not amenable to community control sanctions, terminated them and imposed maximum prison sentences in each case. In CR-14-591534, the trial court imposed a 12-month prison sentence, in CR-14-591390, the trial court imposed a prison sentence of two-to-four years and in CR-14-584243, the trial court imposed a 12-month prison sentence on the breaking and entering charge and imposed the previously suspended six-month jail term on the theft charge. The trial court ordered that each of the sentences run concurrently to one another. The trial court also imposed postrelease control for up to three years in each case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Jung appealed his sentences, raising the following two assignments of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I: The trial court's imposition of maximum sentences in CR-14-584243 and CR-14-591534 is not supported by the record in this matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. II: The trial court erred when imposing sentence in CR-14-591390.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Maximum Sentences\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Jung challenges the trial court's imposition of maximum sentences following his violation of community control sanctions in each of the three cases at issue. Jung argues that his sentences in CR-14-584243 and CR-14-591534 should be vacated because (1) the trial court did not consider the principles and purposes of sentencing set forth in R.C. 2929.11 and the sentencing factors set forth in R.C. 2929.12 when sentencing Jung and (2) \"[t]he record as a whole does not support the sentences imposed\" by the trial court in those cases. He also contends that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to consider the overriding purposes of felony sentencing under R.C. 2929.11 when sentencing him to a two-to-four year prison term for violating R.C. 3734.03 in CR-14-591390.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} \"Following a community control violation, the trial court conducts a second sentencing hearing.

The statute further provides that \"[t]o achieve those purposes, the sentencing court shall consider the need for incapacitating the offender, deterring the offender and others from future crime, rehabilitating the offender, and making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or both.\" R.C. 2929.11(A). A court imposing a sentence for a felony \"has discretion to determine the most effective way to comply with the purposes and principles of sentencing set forth in section 2929.11 of the Revised Code.\" R.C. 2929.12(A). However, the sentencing court must consider various seriousness factors set forth in R.C. 2929.12(B) and (C) and recidivism factors set forth in R.C. 2929.12(D) and (E) in determining the most effective way to comply with the purposes of sentencing set forth in R.C. 2929.11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Although the trial court must consider both the principles and purposes of felony sentencing set forth in R.C. 2929.11 and the sentencing factors set forth in R.C. 2929.12 when sentencing a defendant on a felony, the trial court is not required to use particular language or to make specific findings on the record demonstrating its consideration of those purposes, principles and factors.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

He has made no affirmative showing that the trial court did not comply with its obligation to consider the relevant sentencing principles, purposes and factors under R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12.

The trial judge had previously reviewed the PSI and presided at both the original sentencing hearing and the first violation of community control hearing. Both Jung and his counsel addressed the trial court and Jung engaged in a dialogue with the trial court at his second violation of community control hearing. The trial court heard Jung's claims of responsibility for his actions, his remorse regarding how his actions had adversely impacted his family members and his acknowledgment that he had a serious drug problem. However, the trial court noted that he had already given Jung \"multiple chances\" to comply with community control sanctions and turn his life around. Jung had been on probation at the time he committed the offenses at issue. Although no new charges had been filed against Jung, the trial court noted that Jung had lied to police and identified himself as his father in an attempt to escape detection after he absconded from the drug treatment facility.
