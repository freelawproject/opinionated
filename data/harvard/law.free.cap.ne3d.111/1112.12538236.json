The wife filed for divorce in 2015 and a divorce judgment entered in November, 2016. The husband filed two functionally identical motions to vacate the divorce judgment in April and again in May, 2017. A Probate and Family Court judge denied the motion without comment after a May, 2017, hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In seeking to vacate the divorce judgment, the husband charged, in substance, that the wife's earlier Nigerian marriage had not properly been terminated, that the parties therefore never had been legally married, and that the wife allegedly produced in discovery a \"fake\" certified dissolution certificate. The husband did not raise these issues before or during the divorce trial. Had he done so they could have been considered properly and, if necessary, any decision could have been reviewed on an appropriate appellate record. Additionally, the husband made no attempt to explain why he did not earlier bring this matter to the trial judge's attention or was unable earlier to discover the wife's alleged fraud. In short, it appears that the husband \"essentially used [Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P.] ... 60 (b) as a means of appeal when no extraordinary circumstances existed to justify relief under the rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Boykan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274772\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/464/285/#p291\">\n    464 Mass. 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 291-292 (2013).

G. Evid. \u00a7 901(a) (2018) (\"To satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is\"). More specifically, neither letter shows a certification attesting that it is, in fact, an official governmental communication, and both letters appear facially irregular. Neither letter was addressed to the husband or to any other person available to the court for examination. And no witness testified, either by affidavit or otherwise, that either letter was, in fact, what either purports to be. Neither document was admissible. See\n   <em>\n    NationsBanc Mtge.

[the] keeper of the records did not testify concerning this evidence\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this light, the judge was left with nothing before him other than the husband's unsupported postjudgment claim, contrary to his trial concession, that the wife's first marriage had not properly been terminated. The judge did not abuse his discretion.
