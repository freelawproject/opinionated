For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The underlying facts in this case are undisputed. In the late morning of March 15, 2015, appellant arrived at appellees' place of business to pick up a trailer that was stored outside. Pictures taken on the day of the accident revealed that there were patches of snow and ice throughout the lot of the storage facility. Appellant typed in his code to enter the gate to the facility, then drove to where his trailer was parked, and backed his truck up to the trailer. Appellant testified in his deposition that when he stepped out of his truck, he slipped and fell, seriously injuring his knee. Notably, the storage facility was an open, uncovered lot, and there were no trees or shrubs blocking appellant's view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On January 8, 2016, appellant filed his complaint, in which he alleged that he fell on an ice formation that was caused by a clogged drain. Appellant asserted one claim of premises liability in that appellees negligently failed to maintain the premises or warn him of the clogged drain and resulting ice formation, and one claim of negligence per se for violating R.C. 723.011 by failing to maintain the gutters in reasonable repair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Following discovery, appellees moved for summary judgment, arguing that they owed no duty to appellant because the snow and ice were an open and obvious winter condition. Alternatively, they argued that appellant's claims must fail because he was unable to articulate what condition caused him to fall and where it was located, and because appellant's negligence in failing to take proper precautions in winter conditions outweighed any negligence by appellees as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellant responded by arguing that the accumulation of snow and ice was unnatural, and was caused by a deficiently designed, constructed, and maintained gutter and drainage system. With his opposition, appellant submitted an affidavit and report from Richard Zimmerman, a licensed professional architect. Zimmerman opined that the drainage system did not allow the water to flow away freely. Thus, the water backed up and pooled at the location of the drain, and then froze in the cold weather. Alternatively, appellant argued that a genuine issue of material fact existed regarding whether the ice on which he fell was an open and obvious danger, and whether he was negligent as he was stepping out of his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On July 18, 2017, the trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellant has timely appealed the trial court's July 18, 2017 judgment, and now presents five assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1. The trial court erred in finding that there was no question of fact as to whether Defendant-Appellee's inadequate drainage created an unnatural accumulation of snow and ice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   2. The trial court misapplied the \"active negligence\" and notice requirements in a case involving a claimed unnatural accumulation of snow and ice that contributed to the Plaintiff-Appellant's fall at Defendants-Appellees' property,\n   thereby sustaining Defendant-Appellee's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   3. The trial court erred in considering the open and obvious doctrine in a case involving an unnatural accumulation of snow and ice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   4. The trial court erred in finding that the open and obvious doctrine applies as a matter of law under the facts of this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   5. The trial court erred by failing to find that Appellees are liable for failing to keep common areas free of ice and snow.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
