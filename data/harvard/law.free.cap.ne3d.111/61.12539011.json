We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background and Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant was indicted on December 20, 2016, for: kidnapping, a first-degree felony ( R.C. 2905.01(A)(3) ), with a one-year and three-year firearm specification;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   domestic violence, a first-degree misdemeanor ( R.C. 2919.25(A) ); aggravated menacing, a first-degree misdemeanor ( R.C. 2903.21(A) ); endangering children, a first-degree misdemeanor ( R.C. 2919.22(A) ); having weapons while under disability, a third-degree felony ( R.C. 2923.13(A)(2) ; and criminal damaging or endangering, a second-degree misdemeanor ( R.C. 2909.06(A)(1) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The charges arose from a December 8, 2016 altercation between appellant and VW. Appellant had been living with VW for several months, along with VW's son, who was not present the day of the incident, and her five-year-old daughter. There were suspicions of infidelity by both parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On December 7, 2016, VW left the house with the daughter after viewing inappropriate activity on appellant's cell phone, and returned the next morning. VW refused to tell appellant her whereabouts the prior night, the disagreement escalated and appellant was ultimately indicted. Appellant pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Prior to the trial, the state filed a motion to call VW as an adverse witness, explaining that VW had begun to \"recant [her testimony] as to significant details without clear explanation.\" Motion (Mar. 9, 2017), p. 3. The state opined that VW was not cooperating due to her continued intimate relationship with appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The motion summarizes the content of a telephone call, which was initiated by appellant to a third-party who was instructed to add VW to the call. During the call, VW told appellant that she advised the state that she wanted to drop the charges and contacted the parole officer in an attempt to clear things up. Appellant instructed VW to say that he did not have a gun, and that she only said he had one at the time because she was angry and wanted him to go to jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The trial court construed the motion as a request \"for the [c]ourt on its own motion to call [VW] as a [c]ourt's witness.\" (Tr. 130.) The trial court granted the motion over defense objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Trial commenced on March 8, 2017. The testimony established that Cleveland Police Department officers DiFranco and Tessin responded to a 911 call on December 8, 2016, reporting the assault of a female by a male wielding a firearm and wearing a red bubble jacket and gray hat. Officer DiFranco wore a body-cam. The officers observed appellant, who fit the suspect's description, standing in the open doorway of an apartment as they entered the building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellant walked through the doorway and the officers followed. Appellant continued to walk directly into the dining room that was adjacent to the living room door entry way, then immediately returned to the living room where VW and the child were sitting at a table. Appellant was handcuffed, frisked and taken to the police car by the officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Officer DiFranco returned to the apartment to interview VW, who explained that appellant was angry and insisted on knowing where she spent the night. VW pushed appellant into the wall, damaging the plaster, started her car with the remote ignition and left the apartment with her daughter. Appellant walked with them to the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} VW placed the daughter in the back seat, sat in the driver's seat and appellant sat in the passenger's seat, continuing to question her. After VW refused to reveal her whereabouts, appellant removed the key from the ignition, exited\n   the car, punctured the front tire with a knife, and told VW that she was not going anywhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} VW kicked appellant in the groin for puncturing the tire and she, her daughter, and appellant returned to the apartment. Appellant responded by grabbing the hood of her sweatshirt that was pulled up onto her head. In the apartment, appellant threatened to break a small glass end table belonging to VW and looked surprised when he tapped it with a hammer and it shattered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} VW told appellant that he could retrieve a lighter from her car and locked the apartment door when appellant exited. VW took her daughter across the hall to her neighbor's apartment where officers found them. The 911 call was placed by VW's cousin in response to VW's call to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} VW told the officers that appellant had a gun, and then picked up a .380 Bersa from the dining room window seat and handed it to officer DiFranco. Appellant was then\n   <em>\n    Mirandized\n   </em>\n   and charged. The body-cam recording was played for the jury and admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Det. Sudbury was assigned to investigate the incident on behalf of the domestic violence unit. He reviewed the police report and a handwritten misdemeanor complaint statement written by VW that said she did not want to prosecute. A knife, revolver, and hammer were obtained as part of the investigation. The firearm was operable but no forensic tests were done on the evidence to determine whether it had been fired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 16} VW \"was uncooperative\" when contacted by Det. Sudbury. Though stating that he was not certain that his recollection was correct, Det. Sudbury \"believe[d]\" that VW told him that appellant \"shot at me, he cut my car tire, and I don't want to prosecute.\" (Tr. 313.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Sgt. Christopher testified that appellant was recorded advising VW how to respond to the state's questions about the incident during a March 7, 2017 telephone conversation that occurred while appellant was in jail awaiting trial. After the conversation, VW's recollection of the incident no longer corroborated that of the officers and the body-cam evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 18} VW testified as an adverse witness and said that she intentionally lied to officers about the gun so that appellant would be arrested. In spite of the impeachment evidence of prior inconsistent statements, body-cam evidence and the testimony of the officers, VW maintained that many of her initial statements were fabricated to ensure appellant's removal from the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Confronted with photographs of VW's apartment, the car, and other evidence, VW explained that, at a point during the argument, she felt that appellant was standing too close to her. She pushed him into the wall, using both arms, which caused damage to the plaster. Appellant was taller than VW, but appellant weighed less than VW \"by a significant amount.\" (Tr. 396.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 20} VW also testified that appellant got into her car and said, \"talk to me, tell me where you was at or whatever\" when VW attempted to leave. (Tr. 378.) VW refused, appellant removed the key and flattened the tire. Appellant returned the key \"because we was going to go back in the house, talk, whatever.\" (Tr. 380.) VW kicked appellant in the groin as they were walking into the building and he \"yanked at\" her hood that was on her head at the time as though questioning why she kicked him. (Tr. 418.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 21} VW also testified that the knife that she gave to the police was not the knife that was used to cut the tire.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   COUNSEL: How similar would you say this knife is to the knife that was actually used.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   VW: I don't know what the knife looked like. I didn't never find it. They [police] was trying to help me find the knife. I couldn't find it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Tr. 398-399.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Appellant testified and confirmed that he and VW were arguing, he was pushed into the wall by VW, followed her to her car, and punctured the tire. He also confirmed pulling VW's hood to stop her from kicking him in the groin again. Appellant admitted to breaking the table and stated that he told VW that he would pay for it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Appellant denied possessing a gun and said that he walked briefly in the room adjacent to the living room to put the \"weed that he was smoking in his pocket.\" (Tr. 580.) \"How could I get a gun off of me in 10 seconds?\" (Tr. 598.) Appellant also pointed out how much noise the bag that the gun was removed from made on the body-cam recording. \"I couldn't put the gun in a bag or whatever in ten seconds and [the police] don't hear [it]. The door is wide open.\" (Tr. 599.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 24} On March 14, 2017, the jury rendered a verdict of guilty on all counts. Appellant was sentenced to a total of nine years of imprisonment: (1) three years for the firearm specification prior to and consecutive to six years for kidnapping (Count 1), totaling nine years; (2) 180 days concurrent to the Count 1 sentence for Counts 2, 3, 4, and 6; and (3) three years concurrent with Count 1 for having a weapon while under disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Appellant appeals his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Appellant assigns five errors relating to the trial court's conduct of the case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   I. The trial court erred in allowing the state to admit impeachment evidence as substantive evidence of the crimes alleged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   II. The appellant was denied effective assistance of counsel in violation of Amendments VI and XIV, United States Constitution, Amendment I, Article I, Section 10, Ohio Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   III. The state failed to present sufficient evidence of the offenses charged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   IV. Appellant's convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   V. Appellant was denied due process and a fair and impartial trial as guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, and Article I, Section 16, of the Ohio Constitution, based on prosecutorial misconduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Admission of Impeachment Evidence as Substantive Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The first assignment of error challenges the trial court's admission of impeachment evidence. The state's impeachment motion is entitled \"motion to call [VW] as an adverse witness.\" It is based on VW's recantation of prior statements and the recorded telephone call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The state proffered Evid.R. 611(C) in support of the motion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (C) Leading questions. Leading questions should not be used on the direct examination of a witness except as may\n   be necessary to develop the witness' testimony. Ordinarily leading questions should be permitted on cross-examination.\n   <em>\n    When a party calls a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party, interrogation may be by leading questions.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The trial court elected to call VW as the court's witness as permitted by Evid.R. 614 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (A) Calling by court. The court may, on its own motion or at the suggestion of a party, call witnesses, and all parties are entitled to cross-examine witnesses thus called.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (B) Interrogation by court. The court may interrogate witnesses, in an impartial manner, whether called by itself or by a party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (C) Objections. Objections to the calling of witnesses by the court or to interrogation by it may be made at the time or at the next available opportunity when the jury is not present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 30} A trial court has discretion to control the flow of the trial, including questioning witnesses \"in a search for the truth\" under Evid.R. 611 and 614.\n   <em>\n    State v. Redon\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 92611,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-5966\">\n    2009-Ohio-5966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%203765971\">\n    2009 WL 3765971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8. A trial court must tread carefully where a jury is involved to prevent communicating the trial court's opinion on the witness's credibility to the jury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Thus, the trial court was wholly within its discretion to call VW as the court's witness and we will not reverse the trial court's decision absent an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Parma Hts. v.

VW's testimony at trial echoed the telephone discussion with appellant regarding the content of her testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   A witness whose appearance is important to the proper determination of the case, but who appears to be favorable to the other party, is a principal candidate for application of Evid.R. 614(A).\n   <em>\n    State v.

McPherson, as the victim and an eyewitness, was a principal candidate for the application of Evid.R. 614(A) when he would not otherwise cooperate with the party originally planning to call him. Therefore, the trial court's decision to call McPherson as its witness was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

We also observe that VW was held in contempt for failure to appear for trial and a material witness warrant was issued for her arrest, further buttressing the state's position regarding VW's reluctance to cooperate with the state. Once VW became the witness of the court, \"the state was permitted to impeach [her] with [her] prior inconsistent statement.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Pritchard\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

Davis was charged with domestic violence. The victim alleged that Davis \"pulled the victim's hair weave and threw it to the ground.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1. The victim admitted that she grabbed Davis's injured hand and he \" 'ended up breaking my hair [weave] loose and loosening my tracks up.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. Police arrived to find a \" 'wig' \" in the driveway.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 35} The victim initially told police during the 911 call that Davis had a firearm that he placed into her mouth, threatening to kill her, and fired shots at the house. The victim also said she and Davis were trying to come up with exonerating scenarios because she had previously lied and presented false evidence resulting in Davis's incarceration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. The victim's description of events during trial was, to quote the trial court, \"incredible\" and \"questionable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 36} This court reversed the trial court's finding of guilt that focused on the victim's claim regarding the hair extensions and corroboration by the police officer at the scene that the hair was laying in the driveway when he arrived. We held that there was no evidence that Davis removed the extensions. \"There was no competing evidence-the victim's testimony stood alone.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Appellant argues that, like\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , there is no corroborating evidence of what occurred because the body-cam is merely hearsay evidence that was later recanted by the witness. We agree with the state that appellant has failed to direct us to any error by the court in the admission of the evidence.
