The trial court sentenced Steelman to eight years in prison. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Police find Steelman with Stolen Items\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Within hours of the burglary, Deputy Gator Rollins found Steelman unconscious on the side of the road behind a pickup truck driven by Justin Callaway. Steelman had been riding with Callaway when he overdosed, and Callaway had pulled Steelman out of his truck. According to Deputy Rollins, Callaway was \"a nervous wreck,\" and \"excited,\" and said that Steelman had overdosed on heroin. Emergency medical personnel arrived and revived Steelman. Deputy Rollins testified that subsequently, \"in Callaway's excited state of mind,\" Callaway had said, \"There's a lot of stuff in * * * [Callaway's pickup truck] that Steelman stole from Ohio.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Deputy Rollins searched Callaway's truck. He found jewelry, coins, and a bag containing almost $10,000 with Davey Hayes's name and phone number written in it. At trial, Flora Hayes testified that most of these items had been in her basement safe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Investigation: Jailhouse Calls, DNA Evidence, and the Wittich Interview\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Steelman made several jailhouse phone calls that were played for the jury. One of the calls was to the Hayeses' son, who Steelman had known for years. Steelman said to him, \"Tell your dad I'm so fucking sorry.\" Steelman also said that documents taken from the Hayeses' safe were in a burn barrel close to the Hayeses' house. Investigating detective Albert Wittich found the documents where Steelman said they would be. In another call, Steelman detailed the dollar bill denominations of the stolen money. In others, he stated that Callaway wasn't involved, that if the Hayeses pressed charges against him, he would \"be fucked,\" and that the people Steelman believed were involved in the burglary would \"fucking pay.\" Steelman named several of the people he thought had been involved in his alleged set-up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Items police collected from the Hayeses' basement included a Pepsi can. It was noticeably out of place, as neither of\n   the Hayeses drank Pepsi. Later testing found Steelman's DNA on the can.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Wittich interviewed Steelman after some of the jailhouse calls, but before Steelman was arrested for burglary and receiving stolen property. The interview began with Steelman stating that he wanted a lawyer, and that he did not talk to police officers. The detective answered that the interview was an opportunity for Steelman \"to explain himself,\" and say who else had been involved. Steelman repeatedly said he did not want to talk, and that he wished to have counsel. Interspersed with these statements, however, Steelman stated that he had been high the night the burglary took place, remembered only bits of the evening, and believed he had been framed. He also told Wittich that Callaway had not been involved, and that around $10,000 had been stolen from the Hayeses. Steelman refused to answer Wittich's question of who, in particular, had been involved in Steelman's alleged set-up and the burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The State Plays the Interview in its Case-in-Chief\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Steelman waived his right to move to suppress the Wittich interview but nevertheless objected on the basis of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   to the state playing it in its case-in-chief. The objection was overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} After the interview was played, defense counsel asked Wittich on cross-examination, \"When you were talking to Mr. Steelman, you were trying to get him to * * * implicate * * * third parties?\" Wittich answered, \"If that was the truth, yes.\" On redirect, the state asked the detective, \"You specifically asked the defendant, hey, tell me who else was involved, and he didn't tell you anybody, right?\" Wittich answered, \"Correct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Steelman Takes the Stand\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Steelman testified that he had been under the influence of multiple drugs the night the Hayeses, who were his neighbors and family friends, were burglarized. He said he was at a casino until 3 a.m., and then \"continued to party\" at home until he saw police arrive at the Hayeses' home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Steelman said he walked next door to investigate and learned that the Hayeses had been burglarized. Steelman explained that Callaway had told him how much money had been stolen, and its denominations. Steelman also testified that he knew where the stolen documents were because he had inspected the perimeter of the Hayeses' property the morning of the burglary and had seen them before leaving with Callaway. He explained that he didn't immediately come forward with this information because he had a criminal record, and was afraid doing so would falsely implicate himself in the burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Closing Argument\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} During closing argument, the prosecutor referenced Steelman's refusal to answer Wittich's questions concerning third parties. The state also argued that Steelman never would have known that $10,000 had been taken from the Hayeses unless he was guilty, and would have told Wittich that someone else had given him the money had someone else been involved. The assistant prosecuting attorney made several comments calling Steelman such names as a \"yay-hoo\" and a \"junkie,\" and calling into doubt Steelman's truthfulness and the overall strength of his defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The defense's theory of the case was that Steelman had been plied with drugs by the real burglars, taken to the casino while the burglary occurred, and then framed. Defense counsel argued that other people, and not Steelman, knew that the Hayeses had a safe full of valuables in\n   their basement and could have been the culprits. Counsel suggested that the Pepsi can with Steelman's DNA on it had been taken from the garbage close to Steelman's house and planted in the Hayeses' basement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jury Question\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} During deliberations, the jury sent a note to the judge, stating, \"The jury is split on Count 1 [burglary]. * * * [H]ow much longer should we deliberate? We are still evenly split after reviewing all evidence and after multiple votes.\" The court administered the\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   charge. The jury subsequently returned a guilty verdict on both counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignments of Error\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Prearrest Silence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In his first assignment of error, Steelman contends that the state used his prearrest silence in the Wittich interview as substantive evidence of his guilt, in violation of the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination. Steelman is correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 15} We apply a plain error standard of review. Steelman argues that a plain error analysis is not appropriate because counsel objected to the interview. However, counsel objected on the basis of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   and not on self-incrimination grounds. The\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   objection did not alert the trial court or opposing counsel to Steelman's Fifth Amendment argument at a time when the potential error could have been avoided or corrected, which is the very purpose of an objection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, the state presented evidence in its case-in-chief that Steelman asked for an attorney multiple times, refused to answer Wittich's question concerning who else was involved, and told Wittich he \"didn't talk to cops.\" There was no probative value to the evidence of Steelman's silence other than to allow the jury to infer guilt from it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.

Once a defendant chooses to testify, the state may use a defendant's prior silence to impeach his credibility.\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v. Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183056\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/231/#p238\">\n    447 U.S. 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 238,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183056\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/231/#p238\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183056\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/231/#p238\">\n    65 L.Ed.2d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980). A defendant's silence, however, \"cannot possibly be used to impeach his credibility when he has yet to testify.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Shea\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-840806,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1985%20WL%208938\">\n    1985 WL 8938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *3 (July 17, 1985). Here, Steelman had not yet testified when the state played the interview. This error was not cured when Steelman took the stand. It is impossible to say if Steelman's choice to testify was based on pressure to explain his silence, and we therefore find that the state's after-the-fact justification is feckless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Combs\n   </em>\n   at 285. Further, the state used Steelman's silence as evidence of his guilt, not as impeachment evidence, by asking Wittich, \"You specifically asked the defendant, hey, tell me who else was involved, and he didn't tell you anybody, right?\" And did so again during closing argument when the prosecutor stated, \"If someone else had stolen that sack of money he [Steelman] would have told Det. Wittich 'I don't know how much was in there, Larry gave it to me.' \" The prosecutor also used Steelman's silence as evidence of guilt during rebuttal when he argued that Steelman had \"had a chance\" to explain himself to Wittich and to tell him who else had been involved, but did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Next, the state argues that Steelman did not remain silent, despite his statements that he wanted an attorney and would not answer questions, and therefore the Wittich interview was properly played for the jury. Putting aside\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , parts of the interview were clearly admissible-i.e. Steelman's admission that he knew $10,000 had been stolen, his statement that he had been high on the night in question, and his contention that Callaway wasn't involved-but other parts of the interview clearly were not, and those portions should have been redacted.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34 (where a firearm and Hydrocodone pills were found in defendant's car, officer properly testified that defendant admitted that the pills were his, but officer should not have been permitted to testify that, when asked about the firearm, the defendant stated he didn't want to incriminate himself).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 19} We hold that the failure to redact the offending statements was error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Callaway's Statement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 20} In his second assignment of error, Steelman contends that the trial court erred by admitting Callaway's statement, \"There's a lot of stuff in there [Callaway's pickup truck] that Steelman stole from Ohio.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The trial court admitted Callaway's statement under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule.

Callaway's declaration inculpating Steelman and exculpating himself was made after medical personnel had arrived and revived Steelman, was clearly self-serving, and was not the type of \"reactive\" statement contemplated by Evid.R. 803(2). It was therefore admitted in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Steelman next argues that the admission of Callaway's hearsay statement violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him.

And I know for a fact that he is the one that was caught with the property in his possession a mere three or four hours after these offenses occurred\"; (5) \"It's hard to respond to something like that,\" referring to Steelman's closing argument, \"I'll be honest with you. It is so ridiculous. Seriously.\"; (6) defense counsel's implication that a March 2017 date on the Pepsi can found in the Hayeses' basement meant that the can was made in March 2017-and therefore post-dated the burglary and was planted-was \"misleading\"; (7) \"I love\" defense counsel's argument that the Pepsi can came from the garbage and was used to set Steelman up; and (8) \"another beauty\" that \"makes no sense whatsoever\" was the theory that Callaway was trying to dump Steelman's dead body at the side of the road and frame him for the burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Defense counsel objected only to the prosecutor's argument on whether the Pepsi can was from the garbage, but did not object on the ground currently raised. We therefore review for plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Most of the prosecutor's comments that he \"loved\" certain aspects of the case, his \"another beauty\" statement, and his statement that defense counsel's theory of the evidence \"made no sense whatsoever\" were not tantamount to an expression of his personal belief regarding Steelman's guilt. Instead, they can be fairly characterized as the prosecutor arguing\n   that the inferences that could be drawn from the evidence made the defense's theory less believable and undeserving of much weight. These statements were therefore not beyond the bounds of a proper closing argument. One of these comments-that the prosecutor \"loved\" that Steelman could be found guilty of complicity even if he was not the principle offender-carries no suggestion that the prosecutor was arguing that he personally believed Steelman was guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 34} The prosecutor should not have argued that he knew \"for a fact\" that Steelman left the Pepsi can in the Hayeses' basement, and that he knew \"for a fact\" that Steelman was caught with the Hayeses' property shortly after the burglary was reported. These statements placed the prosecutor's personal credibility at issue, and may have suggested to the jury that the prosecutor knew things about the case that the jury did not. They were clearly improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 35} The prosecutor's statements on rebuttal that Steelman's closing argument was \"ridiculous\" and that defense counsel's Pepsi can date insinuation was \"misleading\" was a fair response to defense counsel's closing argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defense counsel objected. The trial court sustained the objection and immediately instructed the jury that Steelman \"is still presumed innocent unless and until you find that the defendant is guilty because the State has proved it beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The prosecutor subsequently admitted to the jury that he had misstated the law. The jury was properly instructed regarding the state's burden of proof before they began deliberations. We presume the jury followed the trial court's instructions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pang v.

The prosecutor stated during rebuttal, \"You don't think Shawn [the Hayeses' grandson] at some point told him [Steelman], hey, my grandparents have a safe full of money in the basement.\" This was a fair response to defense counsel's argument during closing that Steelman didn't know there was a safe in the Hayeses' basement and that others did-a point that defense counsel discussed at length. Hence, the defense opened the door to the state's rebuttal argument. There was no misconduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
