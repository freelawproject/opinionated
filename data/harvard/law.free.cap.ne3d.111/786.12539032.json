In November 2016, after negotiations with the state, Bozso pleaded guilty to one count of sexual battery and one count of attempted abduction. The trial court sentenced him to one year of prison for each count, but suspended the sentences, and ordered him to two years of community control sanctions for each conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In January 2017, Bozso, who is not a citizen of the United States, was detained by the Department of Homeland Security for immigration removal proceedings. In June 2017, he filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. In his motion, Bozso contended that his trial counsel was ineffective because he informed him that he \"would be able to obtain potential relief from immigration or deportation issues and consequences resulting from the plea pursuant to \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. [INA]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In an affidavit in support of his motion, Bozso averred that he had been \"misinformed about the applicability of INA \u00a7 212(c) and that he [would] not be entitled to any potential relief under the statute despite advisements given to him prior to entering a guilty plea in [this case].\" Bozso further averred that he \"would not have pled guilty [in this case] had he known that relief from immigration consequences pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(c) was wholly unavailable to him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} After a hearing on the motion, the trial court denied it. Bozso now appeals, presenting the following assignment of error for our review: \"The trial court erred by denying appellant's motion to withdraw his previously entered guilty plea.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Generally, a Crim.R. 32.1 postsentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea is subject to a manifest injustice standard,\n   <em>\n    State v.

Counsel testified that at the time he was representing Bozso, he was aware that Bozso was not a United States citizen. He was concerned that if Bozso were to plead guilty he would be deported, or if he ever left the United States he would not be permitted to return. Counsel testified that he was not versed in immigration law, so he had Bozso consult with an immigration attorney. Bozso consulted with the attorney, and as a result of their meeting, the immigration attorney sent the following email to defense counsel, which counsel shared with Bozso:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The sex offense conviction will lead to the client being placed into deportation. As an aggravated felony, the client would be subject to mandatory detention while the case proceeds through the immigration court. As a very preliminary conclusion, I would state that if the June date is adhered to rather than the November [date], that the client would\n   have some relief available to him. Specifically, 212(c) relief. This relief is discretionary to the court and by no means should the client believe that it is assured that he would not be ordered * * * deported as a result of a conviction for this offense. I will supply a more comprehensive advisement for you shortly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Defense counsel testified that if there was a further advisement from the immigration attorney it went directly to Bozso; he did not receive any other information from the immigration attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Defense counsel further testified that, at the change of plea hearing, the trial court read the statutorily required advisement for noncitizens \"verbatim,\" and he recalled his belief that the trial court \"actually inquired of Mr. Bozso if he really understood the import of what that statutory language meant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In its judgment denying Bozso's motion to withdraw his plea, the court found that it gave Bozso the \"required [immigration/deportation] advisement as to the consequences of said plea.\" The court further found that the immigration attorney's advisement to Bozso made it \"clear that he should not have relied upon the possibility that he would obtain relief from deportation, and that [Bozso's] doing so appears to have been a case of hope over reality.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The United States Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether counsel must discuss deportation issues with clients in\n   <em>\n    Padilla v.

In\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , defense counsel failed to advise the defendant whatsoever that he may face deportation and, rather, advised the defendant that he would not be deported because of the period of time he had been in the United States. The Court found that counsel's failure to inform the defendant about the possibility of deportation was sufficient to meet the first prong of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim; that is, that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    at 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In regard to the second prong-prejudice: a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the proceeding's result would have been different-the Court held that in order to prove prejudice the defendant must convince the court that under the circumstances it would have been rational to reject the plea agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    at 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The Court recognized that \"[i]mmigration law can be complex, and it is a legal speciality of its own.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the Court stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Some members of the bar who represent clients facing criminal charges, in either state or federal court or both, may not be well versed in it. There will, therefore, undoubtedly be numerous situations in which the deportation consequences of a particular plea are unclear or uncertain.
