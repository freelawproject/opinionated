Approximately eight years later, on September 29, 2016, the defendant filed a motion to vacate plea and for new trial. On December 12, 2016, the motion judge, who also presided at the 2008 plea hearing, conducted a nonevidentiary hearing on the defendant's motion, which she denied on the record. This appeal ensued. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The defendant argues that the judge erred in denying his motion, because his guilty plea was not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made, and because his plea counsel rendered ineffective assistance. In support of his motion, the defendant submitted his own affidavit, which averred, inter alia, that his attorney coerced him to plead guilty, failed to explain the consequences of the guilty plea, failed to explain the elements of the crimes to which he was pleading guilty, and failed to advise him of the legal rights he would waive by pleading guilty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \"A motion to withdraw a guilty plea is treated as a motion for a new trial pursuant to Mass.

First, she stated that the defendant failed to provide any affidavit from plea counsel, much less one supporting the defendant's claim that he was not advised of his legal rights. See\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"299161\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/55/523/#p533\">\n    55 Mass. App. Ct. 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 533 (2002) (\"Conspicuously absent in these circumstances is an affidavit from ... counsel\"). Second, the judge reasoned that \"other than [the defendant's] self-serving statement that he was coerced, I don't have -- there's no evidence before me of that, or that he didn't get properly advised by the Court, or that he didn't get properly advised by his attorney.\" See\n   <em case-ids=\"299161\" https:=\"\" index=\"9\" xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.L&lt;extracted-citation url=\">\n    ibr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\"&gt;id\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"299161\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/55/523/#p533\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defendant's affidavits filed with motion for new trial were \"suspiciously self-serving\" and \"conclusory\");\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1011077\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/52/631/#p637\">\n    52 Mass.

Third, she noted that the trial court docket contradicted various claims made by the defendant, including his claim that he was held in custody following a dangerousness hearing.

App. Ct. 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 297 (1985) (\"Docket entries are prima facie evidence of the facts recorded there\"). Fourth, the judge stated that she does \"a complete colloquy with everybody that I take a plea from, and if I'm not satisfied that the person understands what he or she is doing, I won't accept the plea.\"\n   <footnotemark xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   To this we add that the defendant and his counsel signed the tender of plea form (i.e., the \"green sheet\"), containing the waiver of rights notice to the defendant and certification by plea counsel that he explained the waiver of jury trial and other rights, \"so as to enable the defendant to tender his or her plea of guilty or admission knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In short, the judge determined that the defendant's self-serving claims lacked factual support and credible evidence.
