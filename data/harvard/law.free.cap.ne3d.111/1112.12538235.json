Following a hearing, a Superior Court judge allowed the defendants' motion under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ) (6),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20Mass.%20754\">\n    365 Mass. 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974), to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. On appeal, Evans argues that the judge's dismissal was improper because the Department of Correction (DOC), failed to honor its obligation to safeguard his property. We affirm for the reasons discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . As alleged, Evans owned a religious medallion and associated chain. Evans requested that the DOC hold his jewelry in its property safe. The DOC approved Evans's request, and placed the jewelry in a safe on August 11, 2011. In 2012, prison staff informed Evans that his medallion and chain were missing. The DOC eventually recovered Evans's chain but not the medallion. Evans filed a grievance with the DOC regarding the missing medallion. The DOC allowed Evans's grievance in substantial part and offered to reimburse him fifty dollars. Evans, dissatisfied with the DOC's offer, filed this negligence and civil rights action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . Pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ) (6), the court may dismiss a complaint that fails to \"state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" On appeal, the court considers a 12 (\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ) (6) ruling de novo, and takes all allegations as true, drawing reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor. See\n   <em>\n    Iannacchino\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789079\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/451/623/\">\n    451 Mass. 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 626 n.7 (2008). Accordingly, the court should dismiss a complaint only if there are no provable facts entitling the plaintiff to relief. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789079\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/451/623/\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789079\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/451/623/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In general, a plaintiff may not sue a branch of the Commonwealth unless that branch waives its sovereign immunity, although a plaintiff may sue a State official in his or her individual capacity. See\n   <em>\n    O'Malley\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sheriff of Worcester County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3907272\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/415/132/\">\n    415 Mass. 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 141 n.13 (1993) (\"to avoid a State's sovereign immunity to a damages suit, a plaintiff must sue the State official in his individual and not his official capacity\");\n   <em>\n    Vining\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1582829\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/63/690/#p690\">\n    63 Mass. App. Ct. 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 690-692 (2005) (emphasizing sovereign immunity). Here, Evans argues that the DOC negligently secured his religious chain and medallion in the prison. Evans does not allege that any of the defendants from the DOC acted in anything other than their official capacities. See\n   <em>\n    O'Malley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3907272\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/415/132/\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3907272\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/415/132/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Accordingly, Evans's claim could only proceed, if at all, under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act (Act), G. L. c. 258.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the Act, \"public employers shall be liable for ... loss of property ... caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any public employee ... in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\" G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2. The Act, however, specifically bars claims arising \"out of an intentional tort,\" as well as claims arising out of the \"lawful detention of any goods or merchandise by any law enforcement officer.\" G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   ) - (\n   <em>\n    d\n   </em>\n   ). Courts have interpreted \"law enforcement officer\" broadly to include court officers and correction officers. See\n   <em>\n    Vining\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1582829\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/63/690/#p690\">\n    63 Mass. App. Ct. at 694-695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, when \"property is lost as a result of negligence of [correction] officers, the Commonwealth is immune because any such loss arose in relation to or out of the lawful detention of property by law enforcement officers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1582829\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/63/690/#p690\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1582829\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/63/690/#p690\">\n    . at 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Here, Evans first argues that \"staffs [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] carelessness of leaving the safe open and unattended\" caused the loss of his medallion. Given that the Commonwealth is immune from suits arising from the negligence of correction officers, which would include the staff at MCI-Norfolk, for claims arising out of the lawful detention of any goods, which would include the storage of Evans's medallion, \u00a7 10 of the Act would bar Evans's claim. See G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (\n   <em>\n    d\n   </em>\n   ) ;\n   <em>\n    Vining\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1582829\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/63/690/#p690\">\n    63 Mass. App. at 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Additionally, Evans argues that another inmate \"stole[ ]\" his medallion from a safe in MCI-Norfolk. An intentional theft is an \"intentional tort\" under \u00a7 10 (\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   ) of the Act, therefore this section of the Act would also bar Evans's claim. See G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   If for no other reason, see\n   <em>\n    Vining\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1582829\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/63/690/#p690\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Act \"supersedes any contradictory law\"), Evans's attempt to recast his claim as one for breach of contract is waived, because he did not assert a contract claim either in his complaint, or at the hearing on the motion to dismiss. See\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New England Organ Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784012\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/446/270/#p285\">\n    446 Mass. 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 285 (2006), quoting\n   <em>\n    Century Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

Evans may not assert this breach of contract claim for the first time on appeal. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3882540\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/405/420/\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3882540\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/405/420/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To the extent we have not specifically commented, we have considered and found Evans's remaining arguments to be without merit.
