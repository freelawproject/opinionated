For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background and Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On February 19, 2015, Sharon filed a complaint for legal separation. Following various pretrials and continuances, the court set the matter for a final hearing on February 11, 2016. On February 5, 2016, Todd sought leave to file an amended answer and a counterclaim for divorce. The trial court granted the motion on February 8, 2016, and Todd's amended answer and counterclaim were filed the same day. Sharon did not file an answer to Todd's counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On February 11, 2016, the parties appeared for the final hearing before a magistrate. At the beginning of the hearing, the magistrate noted that the parties had reached a resolution of the case, contingent upon Todd choosing one of two legal outcomes-divorce or legal separation-by April 6, 2016 (the date of the rescheduled final hearing). Sharon's attorney outlined the parties' agreement on the record, which was memorialized in a standard separation agreement pursuant to Supreme Court of Ohio Uniform Domestic Relations Form 16, and was submitted as joint exhibit A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On the record, Sharon's attorney explained the \"changes\" that the parties made to the standard form, which were both typewritten and handwritten. For example, Sharon's attorney explained that the parties included definite terms relating to all of the parties' marital property, including\n   the marital home. Under the agreement, Todd was required to refinance the home within six months. After refinancing, Todd would pay Sharon $30,000 for her interest in the home, at which time Sharon would sign a quit-claim deed transferring the house to him. If Todd could not refinance, the house was to be sold and Todd would pay Sharon $30,000 from the proceeds of the sale for her interest in the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Sharon's attorney also explained a handwritten edit regarding Todd's life insurance policy, which indicated that their three daughters would be listed as equal beneficiaries instead of Sharon, and another handwritten edit regarding spousal support, which stated that \"spousal for tax purposes attributed to Obligee not Obligor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Under section five, \"OTHER,\" joint exhibit A contains the following typewritten provision, which is crossed out with a single handwritten line: \"The Parties shall split equally all Medical Insurance and non-covered medical expenses for each of them equally.\" In the margin, the following term is handwritten in its place: \"H shall pay UAW retiree monthly medical premium, each party responsible for non covered.\" As Sharon's attorney explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The third change, and I think the last change and, again, if it is processed under a legal separation, on Fifth, on Page 5, it will read that the Husband shall pay the UAW Retiree monthly medical premium, and each party will be responsible for non-covered medical expenses. We do that because Sharon would remain on that very good UAW Retiree medical plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Those would be the only changes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Now, if it is determined by April that this is going to be going through as a divorce rather than a legal separation, the only change between what I just read into the record, and we'll be giving to the Court, is if it goes through as a divorce the Fifth on Page 5 will read as it was typed, The parties shall split equally all medical insurance and non-covered medical expenses for each of them equally. So Sharon would be responsible for half of Todd's medical insurance costs, and half of his non-covered medical expenses, and also Todd would be responsible for half of the premium, and half of Sharon's non-covered expenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Todd's attorney then confirmed that \"that is the agreement\" and that \"Plan A and Plan B are described * * * correctly.\" The magistrate then had the following exchange with the parties:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE COURT: All right. Mrs. Wilson, is that your understanding of the options available at this point?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   MS. WILSON: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE COURT: Do you have any questions about that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   MS. WILSON: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. And-so you're asking the Court to, again, whichever option is chosen by Mr. Wilson, to adopt that as your agreement between you and him; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   MS. WILSON: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE COURT: Do you have any questions about that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   MS. WILSON: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   THE COURT: All right. Mr. Wilson, is that your understanding of the options before you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   MR. WILSON: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   THE COURT: Do you have any questions about those options?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   MR. WILSON: Not at this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. You understand then when we come back in April you're\n   going to need to pick one of those two options, and then we'll proceed with as [sic] either a legal separation or a divorce, depending on which option you choose?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   MR. WILSON: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   THE COURT: You understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   MR. WILSON: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   THE COURT: Do you have any questions about that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   MR. WILSON: Nope.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. And you're asking the Court to adopt these two options as the options that are going to be available to you in this divorce and/or legal separation; correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   MR. WILSON: Yeah, I want to ask one-one question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   THE COURT: Do you want to ask your attorney, or-yeah. Any other questions, Mr. Wilson?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   MR. WILSON: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The magistrate adopted the terms read on the record as \"the two options available to the parties.\" The parties did not, however, execute the Separation Agreement that was submitted as joint exhibit A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On June 30, 2016, Todd filed a \"motion to set aside oral agreement,\" in which he argued that he did not intend to come to a final, binding agreement at the February 11 hearing and that the agreement violated the statute of frauds by purporting to transfer an interest in the marital home without a signed writing. Sharon filed a memorandum in opposition on July 19, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On July 22, 2016, the trial court ordered that a \"2-HOUR EVIDENTIARY HEARING\" would be held on September 21, 2016, before the magistrate. The next entry on the trial court's docket, however, is a \"Motion Requesting an Order,\" filed by Todd on September 27, 2016, in which he states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Now comes Mr. Wilson, by and through undersigned counsel, and respectfully requests this Court issue an order approving or denying the Motion to Set Aside Oral Agreement. Counsel was at the hearing on Wednesday September 21, 2016 [sic] when Magistrate Quinn stated they could hold the hearing but the motion would be denied. Pursuant to that, counsel requests it be reduced to writing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On February 17, 2017, Todd filed a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law relating to his motion to set aside oral agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The parties then appeared before the magistrate for a final hearing on February 21, 2017. At the beginning of the hearing, Todd's attorney argued that the parties did not reach a binding settlement agreement on February 11, 2016 because \"there was no meeting of the minds because if [Todd] had to choose between one or the other he hadn't fully agreed to either one of them.\" In response, Sharon's attorney said that the separation agreement was the result of a \"lengthy\" process that involved many meetings and conversations between himself, Todd's former attorney, and the magistrate. Sharon's attorney represented that under the parties' oral agreement, as reached during the February 11, 2016 proceeding before the magistrate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   At that time, we went on the record, a Joint Exhibit A was submitted to the Court, being a comprehensive agreement for termination of the marriage; discussion was had with both parties at that time; and it was agreed that that-the contents of that document would be the final entry-would compose the final entry with the proviso that Mr. Wilson could elect to go forward with a divorce that he had filed as a counterclaim, or\n   we would go forward with the legal separation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The magistrate stated that \"[a]s [he] had indicated to both parties previous to this hearing, the motion to set aside the oral agreement that was filed in this case back on June 30th, 2016, is denied.\" The magistrate then indicated that \"the Court is intent on proceeding today in regards to the original request for the legal separation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The hearing then proceeded with Sharon's attorney eliciting testimony from both parties indicating that they were incompatible, and the magistrate confirmed that they had been living apart for more than one year. The magistrate granted a legal separation and ordered Sharon's attorney to draft a magistrate's decision incorporating the parties' separation agreement, as previously submitted in joint exhibit A. The record, however, does not contain a proposed magistrate's decision from Sharon's attorney. Nor did the magistrate file a written decision with respect to the legal separation, specifically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The day after the hearing, the clerk file stamped and entered a written order that memorialized the magistrate's oral rulings at the beginning of the February 21, 2017 hearing. That is, the written order denied Todd's motion to set aside oral agreement because \"[t]he parties have entered into a definite settlement agreement, 'Joint Exhibit A'.\" The magistrate further ordered that \"Defendant Louis [sic] Todd Wilson shall choose 'Plan A' Legal Separation or 'Plan B' Divorce [sic]. Failing Defendant's choosing between 'Plan A' or 'Plan B', this case shall proceed upon Plaintiff's Complaint For a Legal Separation, alimony only.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Sharon and Todd then filed separate proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law relating to the motion to set aside oral agreement. On May 4, 2017, the magistrate issued his findings of fact and conclusions of law. He found that the parties presented the court with a separation agreement at the final hearing on February 11, 2016. The agreement gave Todd two options that related solely to the allocation of medical insurance costs and out-of-pocket medical expenses. The magistrate also found that, although neither Sharon nor Todd signed the agreement, they jointly submitted it into evidence, the court questioned both of them about it, and neither party had any questions about the agreement. The magistrate then determined that Sharon and Todd had entered into a binding oral settlement agreement, that Todd understood his choices under the agreement, and that Todd was represented by competent counsel \"during the entire process.\" He concluded that the parties' joint exhibit A represented \"a very defined written integrated Settlement Agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On July 12, 2017-68 days after the findings of fact and conclusions of law were filed-Todd filed objections to the magistrate's decision. The trial court overruled Todd's objections because they were filed more than 14 days after the magistrate filed his findings of fact and conclusions of law and thus were untimely under Civ.R. 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On July 25, 2017, the trial court filed a \"final judgment for alimony only\" that adopted the parties' settlement agreement, finding that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The parties have presented the Court with a written Separation Agreement marked \"Joint Exhibit A\" or have read into the record a settlement of all issues, which the Court finds to be a fair and equitable division of property and debts and an appropriate resolution of all issues, knowingly and voluntarily entered into by the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Todd now appeals, raising three assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Assignment of Error No. I. The Court erred in holding an uncontested hearing under protest when there was no agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Assignment of Error No. II. The Court erred in denying the motion to set aside the oral agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Assignment of Error No. III. The Court erred in approving the magistrate's decision when none was ever filed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Motion to Set Aside Oral Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 19} We will address Todd's second assignment of error first. In it, he argues that the trial court abused its discretion by \"not allow[ing] the oral 'agreement' to be set aside and a hearing to be held.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 20} A motion to set aside is the proper way for a party to seek rescission of an in-court settlement agreement.\n   <em>\n    Spicer v.

That is because \"[a]n appellate court need not consider any error which counsel could have, but did not call to the trial court's attention at a time when the error could have been avoided or corrected.\"\n   <em>\n    Monea\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Todd Expressly Waived the Evidentiary Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Here, the docket indicates that a few days after Sharon filed her opposition to Todd's motion to set aside oral agreement, the trial court, sua sponte, scheduled a \"2-HOUR EVIDENTIARY HEARING\" for September 21, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The next docket entry is a \"motion requesting an order,\" filed by Todd on September 27, 2016-six days after the evidentiary hearing was scheduled to occur-which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Now comes Mr. Wilson, by and through undersigned counsel, and respectfully requests this Court issue an order approving or denying the Motion to Set Aside Oral Agreement. Counsel was at the hearing on Wednesday September 21, 2016 [sic] when Magistrate Quinn stated they could hold the hearing but the motion would be denied. Pursuant to that, counsel requests it be reduced to writing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 24} This filing demonstrates that when the parties appeared for the scheduled evidentiary hearing, the magistrate stated that he intended to deny Todd's motion but \"they could hold the hearing\" nonetheless. At that point, Todd could have either insisted that the court proceed\n   with the evidentiary hearing\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   objected to the magistrate's intention to issue a ruling on his motion without a hearing. He did neither. Instead, he filed a motion for a written order from the magistrate \"approving or denying the Motion to Set Aside Oral Agreement\"-which expressly acknowledged,\n   <em>\n    but did not object to\n   </em>\n   , the magistrate's failure to hold an evidentiary hearing on his motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Then, Todd went a step further and\n   <em>\n    expressly waived\n   </em>\n   the evidentiary hearing in a subsequent court filing. On April 3, 2017, Todd filed proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law related to his motion to set aside oral agreement. In that filing, Todd affirmatively stated that although an evidentiary hearing on such a motion is required under\n   <em>\n    Rulli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"278321\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/79/374/\">\n    79 Ohio St.3d 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=683%20N.E.2d%20337\">\n    683 N.E.2d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at syllabus, he believed that \"[t]his is inconsequential herein and\n   <em>\n    no hearing need be held\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In light of Todd's express representations to the trial court that \"no hearing need be held,\" he cannot now complain that the trial court erred by failing to hold a hearing on his motion to set aside oral agreement. Todd expressly waived this error, which precludes appellate review of the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Todd Failed to File Timely Objections to the Magistrate's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Todd argues that the magistrate abused his discretion by denying his motion to set aside oral agreement. As a preliminary matter, at the appellate stage, we do not determine whether the magistrate abused his discretion but, rather, whether the trial court abused its discretion by adopting the magistrate's decision.\n   <em>\n    Berry v.

On March 17, 2017, the magistrate issued an order stating that the parties should submit such proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law by April 3, 2017. Sharon and Todd both filed proposed findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 30} On May 4, 2017, the magistrate issued his findings of fact and conclusions of law, in which he denied Todd's motion to set aside oral agreement and included the following legal analysis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   In this case, a very defined written integrated Separation Agreement was entered into the record by both parties as \"Joint Exhibit A\" with the Defendant to be given leave to decide whether he would choose to proceed in an alimony only action, paying the Plaintiff's U.A.W. retiree insurance premium, and the Plaintiff being responsible for all non-covered expenses, or: \"B\", choosing to proceed on his Counter-Claim for Divorce wherein both parties would split equally the medical insurance premiums and non-covered medical expenses for each. The choice given to the Defendant, although somewhat different, doesn't substantially differ from choices found in many agreed-upon Separation Agreements wherein one party can choose to either refinance a real estate parcel, removing the other person's obligation on the note, or choosing to sell the property with an agreed division of profits or losses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   It was made clear to the Defendant on the record, by both his legal counsel at the time as well as the Court what his two options were.

But, in its \"Final Judgment For Alimony Only\" dated July 25, 2017, the trial court fully adopted and expressly incorporated the parties' separation agreement that was memorialized on February 11, 2016, as joint exhibit A, and independently concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   The parties have presented the Court with a written Separation Agreement marked \"Joint Exhibit A\" or have read into the record a settlement of all issues, which the Court finds to be a fair and equitable division of property and debts and an appropriate resolution of all issues, knowingly and voluntarily entered into by the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 33} We find that this express conclusion was necessarily an adoption of the magistrate's May 4, 2017 decision, in which he found that \"a very defined written integrated Separation Agreement was entered into the record by both parties as 'Joint Exhibit A.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Redmond v.

The Final Hearing Could Proceed Despite Todd's \"Protest\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 39} In his first assignment of error, Todd contends that the magistrate should not have held a final hearing when Todd participated \"under protest\" and objected to the terms of the separation agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Todd's arguments are premised solely on the separation agreement being invalid; he does not cite any case law to\n   support his position that a final hearing in a divorce or legal separation case cannot proceed if one party goes forward \"under protest.\" Given that we have already concluded that any error relating to the trial court's enforcement of the parties' settlement agreement has been waived, and that this is not an exceptional case involving plain error, we find that Todd's first assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Trial Court had the Authority to Adopt the Separation Agreement without a Magistrate's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 41} In his third assignment of error, Todd argues that the trial court abused its discretion \"in approving the magistrate's decision when none was ever filed.\" Although Todd references both the final hearing on February 21, 2017, and the findings of fact and conclusions of law that the magistrate issued on the motion to set aside, it appears that this assignment of error relates only to the trial court issuing a final judgment entry that granted a legal separation without an underlying written decision from the magistrate that recommended granting a legal separation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Todd's argument is misplaced, however, because the trial court did not adopt recommendations from the magistrate that were never memorialized in a magistrate's decision. Rather, as discussed, the trial court implicitly adopted the magistrate's written May 4, 2017 decision-in which the magistrate found that \"a very defined written integrated Separation Agreement was entered into the record by both parties as 'Joint Exhibit A' \"-when the trial court independently concluded that the \"written Separation Agreement marked 'Joint Exhibit A' * * * [was] knowingly and voluntarily entered into by the parties.\" Then, once the validity of the written separation agreement marked joint exhibit A was established, the trial court granted Todd and Sharon a legal separation based on that separation agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 43} When the parties in a divorce or legal separation case reach an in-court settlement, the trial court has the discretion to (1) adopt the agreement in full by incorporating it into a final judgment entry; (2) reject some of the terms in the agreement, make independent rulings on those terms, and incorporate the independent rulings and the remaining terms of the agreement into a final judgment entry; or (3) reject the entire agreement and make independent rulings on all of the issues raised in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Lambert v.
