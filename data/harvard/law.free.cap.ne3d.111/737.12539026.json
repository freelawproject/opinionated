The juvenile court committed Appellant to the Ohio Department of Youth Services for a minimum of two years and six months, maximum of up to Appellant's twenty-first birthday. Pursuant to the SYO specification and R.C. 2152.11(D)(2)(b), the court imposed a suspended adult sentence of life imprisonment with parole eligibility after 15 years on each count of rape, to be served concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Based upon Appellant's conduct while committed to DYS\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , on December 23, 2015, the State moved to invoke the suspended adult sentence under the SYO specification. On October 4, 2016, the trial court conducted a hearing, and imposed an adult term of incarceration of fifteen years to life. The trial court on the same date held a hearing and imposed a juvenile disposition regarding classification. The court classified Appellant a tier III, Public Registry Qualified Juvenile Offender Registrant (PRQJOR), pursuant to R.C. 2152.86. The parties and the trial court acknowledged all juvenile dispositions terminated upon the imposition of an adult sentence, but \"waived any defect to this juvenile dispositional order and...affirmed its intention for this juvenile order to survive\n   the adult sentence.\" (10/5/2016 Judgment Entry) The court also classified Appellant a tier III adult registrant.

The court noted he was represented by counsel at all stages of the bindover process, and counsel advocated against bindover.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52.

In exchange for his plea to the three counts in the complaint, the State agreed not to pursue other charges against Appellant regarding other victims under investigation at the time. At the time of his original sentencing on January 30, 2014, the legal custodian from the agency which had custody of Appellant was present in the courtroom and addressed the court. Tr. (1/30/14) p.10. Further, throughout the initial plea process and sentencing, and in the preliminary hearing regarding invocation of the SYO sentence, Appellant demonstrated maturity by often seeking clarification from the court and from his attorney when he lacked understanding of the proceedings. Tr. (1/17/14) p.10-12; Tr. (1/30/14) p. 14; Tr. (1/19/16) p.7. At the merit hearing on the motion to invoke the SYO specification, Appellant again demonstrated an ability to seek clarification from the court concerning the proceeding and to confer with counsel in order to participate in his defense.

At the SYO invocation hearing, the State presented evidence of three alleged rapes committed by Appellant while in the department of youth services facility. The court found two of the incidents were not proven by clear and convincing evidence. However, the third incident the court found proven by clear and convincing evidence. While Appellant did not admit or deny using force or coercion in this sexual encounter with another resident of the facility, he responded to the police inquiry by stating he would never force himself on anyone unless he was smaller than Appellant, and he stated the other youth in question was short.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The State further presented evidence Appellant's conduct creates a substantial risk to the safety of the community or the victim. Appellant demonstrated lack of interest, participation and progress in sex offender treatment. He admitted to Dr. Jennifer Alpert, his psychologist in the facility, he will reoffend. He admitted to engaging in \"grooming\" activity with others in the facility, and discussed a desire to contact past victims and rekindle the relationships. Appellant expressed in a letter he was unsafe to be out in the community, as he knows what he would do given the opportunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 19} As to sentencing, the trial court initially sentenced Appellant to a term of life imprisonment with parole eligibility in fifteen years on each count of rape, to be served concurrently. However, following the SYO invocation hearing, the trial court modified the adult sentence to fifteen\n   years to life on each count of rape, to be served concurrently.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The record does not demonstrate had Appellant been represented by a guardian ad litem, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Appellant demonstrated an ability throughout the case to interact successfully with the court and counsel to ensure a complete understanding of the proceedings against him. The evidence presented at the hearing clearly supported the court's findings in support of invocation of the adult sentence. The adult portion of Appellant's sentence was modified to a lesser sentence following the SYO invocation hearing. We find appellant has not demonstrated plain error in the court's failure to appoint a guardian ad litem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 22} For the reasons stated in our August 21, 2017 opinion in the instant case, the second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 23} In his third assignment of error, Appellant argues the court erred in classifying him as a public registry qualified juvenile offender registrant (PRQJOR) pursuant to R.C. 2152.86, as the statute has been found unconstitutional by the Ohio Supreme Court.

Pursuant to R.C. 2152.86, juveniles are public-registry-qualified juvenile-offender registrants if they (1) were 14 through 17 years old when the offense was committed, (2) have been adjudicated a delinquent child for committing certain specified sexually-oriented offenses, and (3) have had a court impose on them a serious youthful offender dispositional sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. These offenders are to be classified under tier III.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 85-86.

The court also held R.C. 2152.86 violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it \"imposes automatic, lifelong registration and notification requirements on juvenile sex offenders tried within the juvenile system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at syllabus. The court contrasted R.C. 2152.86 with sex offender classifications made \"through a traditional juvenile disposition,\" which provides the trial court with more discretion in the imposition of the reporting and registration requirements because \"the court holds a hearing to determine [the offender's] tier classification.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re M.C.,\n   </em>\n   10th Dist.

So, it would seem that [D.F.] satisfies the requirements to be registered under this class of juvenile offenders or Public Registry Qualified Juvenile Offender registrant. There has been a Supreme Court case that has found certain aspects of the law unconstitutional. So, what the court's going to do is going to find for the juvenile registration that [D.F.] is a Tier III sex offender, child victim offender registrant.

In its entry, the juvenile court wrote that D.J. \"has been convicted of a sexually-oriented offense\" even though he, instead, had been adjudicated delinquent for committing rape and murder. The court went on, however, to order D.J. \"to be adjudicated a Tier III Sex Offender * * *.\" The definition of a \"Tier III sex offender * * *\" includes \"[a] sex offender who * * * has been adjudicated a delinquent child for committing any sexually oriented offense and who a juvenile court, pursuant to section 2152.82, 2152.83, 2152.84, or 2152.85 * * * classifies a tier III sex offender * * * relative to the offense.\" R.C. 2950.01(G)(3). Although the juvenile court used the word \"adjudicate\" in its entry instead of \"classify,\" the difference between the two words in this context is not significant. In addition, D.J. has not identified any difference in the requirements placed on a Tier III sex offender who receives that designation automatically for being convicted of certain offenses as an adult and juveniles who receive that designation under Section 2950.01(G)(3). Accordingly, upon review of the juvenile court's entry, we conclude that any error in the court's word choice was harmless. D.J.'s fifth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    In re D.J.\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist.
