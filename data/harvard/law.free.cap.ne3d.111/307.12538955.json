In fact,\n   <em>\n    National Treasury\n   </em>\n   is cited once without discussion or elaboration, as part of a \"see generally\" string citation at the end of the court's analysis (\n   <em>\n    Spence v.

In 2013, Mr. Kulzer decided he would like to serve as a local legislator in Lewis County. He submitted an outside activity request to the Department, which approved his request. Mr. Kulzer ran as a Republican, and the voters elected him to a two-year term later that year. When, as the Department annually required, Mr. Kulzer renewed his outside activity request in 2014, the Department denied it \"based upon a conflict of interest and/or an appearance of a conflict of interest pursuant to ... Public Officers Law \u00a7 74.\" On April 6, 2015, the Department revised its Employee Policies Handbook to include a revised \"Political Activities\" policy.

The Department has never suggested that elimination of partisan political influence or the fear of partisan takeover of the Department of Agriculture makes up any part of the Department's motivation for its policy, nor is there any support in the record for such a contention. Indeed, the Department has asserted that partisanship is irrelevant to the concerns motivating its restraints on speech, insisting that its \"concern exists regardless of whether the employee is running for the county legislature, a school board, or any other publicly elected position.\" (Even if the Department were genuinely concerned about a partisan takeover of milk inspection, or New York agriculture more generally, its policy applies to partisan and nonpartisan elections alike, rendering it overbroad.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Here, because of \"the absence of substantial party involvement ... the interests identified by the\n   <em>\n    Letter Carriers\n   </em>\n   Court lose much of their force\" (\n   <em>\n    Magill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"938129\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/560/22/#p27\">\n    560 F.2d 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 29 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    National Treasury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333702\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/454/#p467\">\n    513 U.S. at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333702\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/454/#p467\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"Unlike partisan political activity, however, honoraria hardly appear to threaten employees' morale or liberty\"] ).

Even so, the Department's restrictions are not narrowly tailored to serve that end; numerous less-restrictive alternatives are available. The narrow-tailoring analysis must be different for conflict-of-interest concerns than for the partisan takeover concerns, because a restriction's breadth must depend on the harm to be avoided (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    National Treasury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333702\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/454/#p467\">\n    513 U.S. at 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333702\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/454/#p467\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\"Instead of a concern about the 'cumulative effect' of a widespread practice that Congress deemed to 'menace the integrity and the competency of the service,'\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353818\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/330/75/\">\n    330 U.S. at 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353818\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/330/75/\">\n    67 S.Ct. 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Government relies here on limited evidence of actual or apparent impropriety by legislators and high-level executives,\n   together with the purported administrative costs of avoiding or detecting lower level employees' violations of established policies\"] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Thus, because the Department's stated justification here is based on potential conflicts of interest, such conflicts could be - and routinely are - dealt with by recusal rules, such as those that apply to judges (\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Judiciary%20Law%20%C2%A7%2014\">\n    N.Y.

The policy does not provide a definition of elected office that would restrict the policy's scope, nor does it set out any exceptions or procedures for recusal. Instead, the Department nakedly asserts it could not tailor the rule more narrowly: \"the Department reasonably determined that there was no way to remove the taint of dual office-holding\" as \"[a]ny inspectors who campaigned for elected office would be susceptible to claims that they were soliciting special favors from supporters.\" (Of course, the same would be true for judges or legislators.) The fact that the policy is limited to inspectors does not make the policy sufficiently tailored. The policy must be a reasonable response\n   <em>\n    to the legitimate government interest at stake\n   </em>\n   . In the context of the Hatch Act, the Supreme Court held that the law\n   was constitutional even when applied to a large number of federal employees, because it was based on the \"conviction that the rapidly expanding Government work force should not be employed to build a powerful, invincible, and perhaps corrupt political machine\" (\n   <em>\n    Letter Carriers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11342106\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/413/548/#p564\">\n    413 U.S. at 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11342106\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/413/548/#p564\">\n    93 S.Ct. 2880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

The Court addressed the relief sought, and agreed with the Government that the remedy should be limited to the\n    <em>\n     class\n    </em>\n    of employees before the Court, but disagreed that the Court should sever the legislation and hold it constitutional where a \"nexus\" exists between the speech and the speaker's official duties, i.e., where it might be constitutional (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     National Treasury\n    </em>\n    at 478-479,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333702\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/454/#p467\">\n     115 S.Ct. 1003\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ).
