Appellant claims principles of double jeopardy preclude retrial for felonious assault after a jury found him not guilty of that crime but could not reach a verdict on the inferior offense of aggravated assault. After a thorough review of the record and law, this court reverses and remands for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant, a student at Westlake High School, was involved in a fight with another student in a restroom near the cafeteria of the school. The fight was recorded by at least one other student. The video shows appellant and the student exchanging blows, and then appellant picks up the other student and drops him on his head. This other student suffered significant injuries and spent several days in the hospital. Appellant and the other student involved in the fight were suspended from school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellant was indicted and charged with felonious assault, a second-degree felony violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1) ; and abduction, a third-degree felony violation of R.C. 2905.02(A)(2). A jury trial commenced on December 5, 2016. Near the close of evidence, the state requested a jury instruction for the inferior offense of aggravated assault, which the court gave. At the close of the trial, the jury returned a not-guilty verdict for the felonious assault count. However, the jury could not reach a verdict for the inferior offense of aggravated assault or the abduction count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The court declared a mistrial and scheduled a new trial for the charge of abduction only. In February 2017, the state filed a motion seeking retrial of felonious assault and abduction, and appellant orally moved to dismiss the felonious assault count based on double jeopardy. The issue was then briefed by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On April 10, 2017, the trial court granted the state's motion, finding that principles of double jeopardy did not preclude retrial. The court also found that the jury's findings regarding felonious assault and aggravated assault constituted an inconsistency that could result in retrial for felonious assault. The trial court denied appellant's motion to dismiss. Appellant filed the instant appeal from this order, assigning two errors for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   I. The trial court erred by finding that the appellant could be re-tried on the count of felonious assault as well as on the inferior offense instruction of aggravated assault.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   II. The trial court erred in instructing the jury on the inferior offense of aggravated assault.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Final Appealable Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} As noted above, the jury found appellant not guilty of felonious assault as charged in Count 1 of the indictment. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the inferior offense of aggravated assault or on the abduction offense charged in Count 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellant concedes that the state can retry him on the abduction count. Accordingly, the appeal before this court is an interlocutory appeal. As an initial matter, we address whether the trial court's judgment denying appellant's motion to dismiss the felonious assault count is a final appealable order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Generally, the denial of a motion to dismiss is not a final appealable order.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court continued by instructing the jury that it should only consider the mitigating element-that appellant was under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage, either of which was brought on by serious provocation occasioned by the victim-\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   it found that the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant knowingly caused serious harm to the victim. (Tr. 770-771.) During deliberations, the trial court received the following communication from the jury: \"Question: Can [appellant] be found guilty of aggravated assault without meeting all the criteria (specifically 'knowingly') of the charge of felonious assault[?]\" (Tr. 826.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Thereafter, on December 13, 2016, the jury returned its verdict. The jury found appellant not guilty of felonious assault. (Tr. 844-845.) The jury was unable, however, to reach a verdict on the inferior offense of aggravated assault or the abduction offense charged in Count 2. (Tr. 846.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 15} After reviewing the record, it is evident that either the jury failed to follow the court's instructions regarding the offenses of felonious assault and the inferior offense of aggravated assault, or the jury was confused by the instructions. Although the jury found that the state failed to prove at least one element of felonious assault beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury proceeded to consider, but failed to reach a verdict on the inferior offense of aggravated assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The jury's confusion is evidenced by the question that the jury submitted to the trial court during deliberations. Because the essential elements of felonious assault and aggravated assault are identical, the answer to the jury's question, of course, is no-the jury could\n   not find appellant guilty of aggravated assault without finding that the state proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he knowingly caused serious physical harm to the victim. Had the jury followed the trial court's instructions, they would not have considered the aggravated assault offense after finding appellant not guilty of felonious assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Despite the fact that the jury either failed to follow or was confused by the trial court's jury instructions, the trial court remedied this issue by accepting the jury's verdict of not guilty on the felonious assault charge and declaring a mistrial on only the abduction charge. (Tr. 848.) After excusing the jury, the trial court explained, \"the [inferior offense of aggravated assault] was given by the judge so it's not part of the indictment. So the case will go back as a mistrial only on Count Two, the abduction charge.\" (Tr. 849.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In applying the\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   holding to the facts of this case, we find that jeopardy attached when appellant was acquitted of the felonious assault count. Accordingly, the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the state from retrying appellant on the felonious assault count. The trial court's judgment permitting the state to proceed on the felonious assault count is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply, however, when the jury fails to agree on a verdict. It is well-established that a mistrial as a result of a deadlocked jury does not invoke double jeopardy implications because \"a hung jury is not an event that terminates the original jeopardy to which [the defendant] was subjected.\"\n   <em>\n    Richardson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338223\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/317/\">\n    468 U.S. at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338223\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/317/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338223\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/317/\">\n    82 L.Ed.2d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"In other words, a hung jury is not the equivalent of an acquittal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338223\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/317/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338223\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/317/\">\n    at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338223\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/317/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the state from retrying appellant on the abduction count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Due to the limited nature of this appeal, we are unable to consider appellant's assertion that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the inferior offense of aggravated assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The trial court's judgment is reversed and remanded for a new trial on only the abduction count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   SEAN C.
