Baldwin, J.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   Wise, P.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant Susan R. appeals the decision of the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division, which ruled in favor of Appellee Rebekah B. following a trial on competing guardianship applications regarding the parties' two nieces. The relevant facts leading to this appeal are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The minor children at the center of this matter are A.E.R., born in 2011, and C.S.R., born in 2013. The children's parents are Todd and Rachel R., who both died on December 4, 2016. In their last wills and testaments, executed in 2014, Todd and Rachel each had nominated Appellant Susan R. (Todd's sister) and Appellee Rebekah B. (Rachel's sister), \"in the order named,\" to serve as guardian of A.E.R. and C.S.R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The tragic death of the parents resulted from Todd's fatal shooting of Rachel in front of A.E.R. and C.S.R., and his subsequent suicide at a nearby state park. In the preceding few months, during the autumn of 2016, Todd and Rachel had become estranged, and Todd was spending\n   weekends at the Wheelersburg, Ohio, home of Appellant Susan (his younger sister) and her spouse, Carol. Early on the afternoon of December 4, 2016, Todd had contacted Appellant Susan by text message, referencing a \"note\" he had left in the guest room of appellant's home. Appellant went back to her house and found the note, which included a reminder of the storage location for his and Rachel's wills, and the statement that \"it makes the most sense for you and Carol to primarily care for the girls * * *.\" Appellant thereupon contacted Todd by phone in Columbus. At Todd's behest, appellant and Carol departed southern Ohio and headed to Columbus. Numerous calls and texts were exchanged during the drive. By the time they arrived, Todd had departed the area, but he told them by phone from an undisclosed location that he had \"hurt\" Rachel. At that point, appellant and Carol called 911, and law enforcement officials responded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On January 4, 2017, the probate court appointed appellant as emergency custodian of both children. A hearing on the emergency guardianship applications was conducted on January 6, 2017. After hearing the testimony, the probate court expressly adhered to the language of the parents' wills. The court further continued the emergency guardianship for an additional thirty days, subject to visitation rights and certain limitations. Emergency Hearing Tr. at 180-84.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The court, via a judgment entry, appointed appellant as limited guardian for both girls on February 3, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On March 13, 2017, a four-day guardianship trial commenced. Appellant's witnesses included her spouse, her older sister, fellow faculty members and administrators at the school at which she teaches and coaches, her cousin, other family members, her childhood best friend, her mother and appellant herself. The guardian\n   <em>\n    ad litem\n   </em>\n   and the probate court investigator also testified. Appellee's witnesses were the two ex-wives of the children's deceased father, her brother, her sister, her sister-in-law, a detective from the Delaware County Sheriff's Office, her first cousin, her mother and appellee herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} During the trial, the probate court allowed use of hearsay evidence in regard to the deceased parents, the guardianship applicants, and some of the relatives, over the continuing objection of appellant's counsel. The probate court took the guardianship decision under advisement following the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On May 31, 2017, the probate court issued a 34-page judgment entry naming appellee, the children's maternal aunt, as guardian for both children, despite the nomination in the wills and the guardian ad litem's recommendation that appellant, the children's paternal aunt, be named. The court recognized that Rachel and Todd each had indicated a \"clear desire for an ordered preference\" in their wills, with their first choice being Susan. Entry at 29. The probate court further observed: \"The question, then, is whether the testimony in this matter rises to the level of good cause shown or disqualifies [appellant], such that the Court should move on to the parents' secondary designation of [appellee].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court then answered its question in the affirmative, and ultimately ruled that \"[f]or the reasons outlined in section XI, above, the appointment of [appellant] * * * would not be in the [children's] best interests and good cause has been shown to overcome the primary designation * * *.\" Entry at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On June 21, 2017, appellant filed a notice of appeal. She herein raises the following four Assignments of Error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} \"I. THE PROBATE COURT MISINTERPRETED THE TWO EXCEPTIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   TO R.C. 2111.121(B), WHICH PROVIDE THAT, WHEN APPOINTING THE GUARDIAN OF A MINOR CHILD, THE COURT 'SHALL MAKE ITS APPOINTMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH' A TESTAMENTARY NOMINATION 'EXCEPT FOR GOOD CAUSE SHOWN OR DISQUALIFICATION.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} \"II. THE PROBATE COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY APPOINTING THE SECONDARY NOMINEE AS GUARDIAN ON THE BASIS OF NON-PROBATIVE EVIDENCE AS TO THE SECONDARY NOMINEE AND IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY FINDING AS TO THE PRIMARY NOMINEE THAT THERE IS 'GOOD CAUSE' TO DISREGARD THE PARENTAL ORDER OF PREFERENCE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} \"III. THE PROBATE COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY FINDING 'DISQUALIFICATION' OF THE PRIMARY NOMINEE BASED ON CONSIDERATIONS THAT ARE SUBJECTIVE IN NATURE, DO NOT RENDER HER INELIGIBLE TO SERVE AS GUARDIAN, AND WERE NOT SUPPORTED BY COMPETENT, CREDIBLE EVIDENCE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} \"IV. THE PROBATE COURT IMPROPERLY RELIED ON OTHERWISE INADMISSIBLE HEARSAY EVIDENCE IN A CONTESTED GUARDIANSHIP PROCEEDING.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In her First Assignment of Error, appellant contends the probate court committed reversible error in interpreting R.C. 2111.121(B) as applied to her guardianship application. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} R.C. 2111.121(B) states in pertinent part that \"* * * except for good cause shown or disqualification, the [probate] court shall make its appointment in accordance with the person's most recent nomination [in a writing as described in division (A) ]. * * *.\" (Bracketed language added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} We note the General Assembly, effective March 20, 2014, amended R.C. 2111.121(B), in response to the Uniform Power of Attorney Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2013 Am.Sub. H.B. No. 126. The Ohio Supreme Court has indicated that a model act's official comment sections are instructive for interpreting Ohio law when the language is founded on the model act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heritage Hills, Ltd. v. Deacon,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1422568\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/49/80/#p82\">\n    49 Ohio St.3d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 82,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=551%20N.E.2d%20125\">\n    551 N.E.2d 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990) (interpreting \"consumer transactions\" under R.C. Chap. 1345). Notably, the official comment to the Uniform Power of Attorney Act states that \"[d]eference for the principal's autonomous choice is evident * * * in the directive that the court shall appoint a fiduciary in accordance with the principal's most recent nomination.\" UNIF. POWER OF ATTORNEY ACT \u00a7 108 (UNIF. LAW COMM'N 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Appellant herein properly posits that when parents have established an order of preference for guardianship, the court must determine, under R.C. 2111.121(B), whether there is either \"good cause\" not to appoint the primary nominee or the primary nominee is \"disqualified.\" In the absence of either determination, the court must appoint the primary nominee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     The \"Good Cause\" Consideration\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Appellant initially asserts the probate court mistakenly quoted repealed language from the pre-2014 version of\n   R.C. 2111.121(B), when the court noted that it had a duty to \"examine whether the person nominated is 'competent, suitable, and willing to accept the appointment.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Judgment Entry at 28.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant herein further challenges the probate court's observation that it\n   <em>\n    \"should\n   </em>\n   make a nomination [sic]\" in accordance with a valid writing nominating a guardian.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29 (emphasis added). However, we note the probate court on those same two pages of its judgment entry recited the correct statutory language of \"except for good cause shown or disqualification\" found in modern R.C. 2111.121(B). We also note that toward the end of the trial, while the guardian ad litem was on the stand, the court stated: \"And I think you're aware that the law in Ohio * * * says that the court is to follow the recommendation made in the estate planning documents of the parties unless good cause is shown.\" Tr. at 968. We are therefore unpersuaded that the court's recitations in the entry represent a misinterpretation of the legal standard as urged by appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The remaining focus of appellant's present challenge to the probate court's analysis is that no \"good cause\" findings were made specifically \"as to\" her, either in Section XI or anywhere else in the judgment entry. Appellant asserts the court improperly \"skipped directly\" to consideration of Appellee Rebekah as guardian (Appellant's Brief at 13) and limited its findings as to the \"good cause\" exception to \"whether good cause has been shown that granting guardianship to [appellee] would be in the best interests of the children.\" Judgment Entry at 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 20} In the judgment entry, the court essentially found \"good cause\" in support of Appellee Rebekah for eight reasons, which can be summarized in five categories: (1) Rebekah and her husband have two children and strong parenting techniques; (2) Rachel and Rebekah had similar parenting techniques; (3) Rachel had expressed an interest in moving back to the Waterford, Ohio, area; (4) Rachel's extended family in the Waterford area would provide support; and (5) Rachel had listed her mother and another sister as emergency school contacts. Entry at 29-30. In essence, appellant thus charges that the probate court misapplied R.C. 2111.121(B) by improperly weighing one applicant against another and not following the nominating preference in the parents' wills. In other words, appellant maintains that in the case of consecutive guardianship nominations, where the testators have nominated two persons \"in the order named,\" the protocol set forth in R.C. 2111.121(B) requires the court to focus first on the primary nominee before turning, in the event of \"good cause shown or disqualification,\" to the secondary nominee. Appellant contends the probate court's approach instead constituted an improper \"shortcut.\" Appellant's Reply Brief at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 21} However, we find appellant's insistence on this type of rigid two-step process reads too much into the statute. At the outset, we are mindful that under R.C. 2111.50(A)(1), \"[a]t all times, the probate court is the superior guardian of wards who are subject to its jurisdiction * * *.\" As this Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    In re Myers\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-603\">\n    2017-Ohio-603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20N.E.3d%20217\">\n    85 N.E.3d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in making a determination as to who should\n   serve as guardian, the probate court's primary responsibility is to ensure that the person appointed will act in the best interests of the ward.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43, quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Guardianship of Thomas\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist.,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1065955\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/148/11/\">\n    148 Ohio App.3d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=771%20N.E.2d%20882\">\n    771 N.E.2d 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002), \u00b6 96 (internal quotations omitted). Notably, the Eighth District Court of Appeals has succinctly stated that under R.C. 2111.121(B) a probate court is required to appoint the primary designated nominee as guardian \"unless there [is] a good reason not to, i.e., it would not be in the child's best interest.\"\n   <em>\n    In re I.B.\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102373,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-4181\">\n    2015-Ohio-4181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205883180\">\n    2015 WL 5883180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Accordingly, upon review, while it indeed may have been the better practice for the probate court to have included more discussion of appellant in its \"application of relevant law\" analysis (Section XI of the judgment entry), we find no abuse of discretion in the court's fundamental \"good cause\" analysis in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     The \"Disqualification\" Consideration\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Appellant next contends the trial court failed to properly interpret and apply the disjunctive term \"disqualification\" set forth in R.C. 2111.121(B), as applied to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 24} It is a well-established principle of statutory construction that a statute is to be read, to the extent practicable, to give effect to all its parts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weckbacher v.

Application of Relevant Law.\" We note this section runs from page 28 to page 33 in the judgment entry, even though the court had set forth an extensive recitation of evidence in the prior sections of the entry. As indicated previously, the court specifically found \"good cause\" in support\n   of guardianship to Appellee Rebekah for eight reasons, which can be summarized in five categories: (1) Rebekah and her husband have two children and strong parenting techniques; (2) Rachel and Rebekah had similar parenting techniques; (3) Rachel had expressed an interest in moving back to the Waterford, Ohio, area; (4) Rachel's extended family in the Waterford area would provide support; and (5) Rachel had listed her mother and another sister as emergency school contacts. Entry at 29-30.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Appellant proposes that all but the last of the aforesaid grounds (the listing of her mother and another sister as contacts) would have been known to Rachel when she completed her will in 2014. Appellant further challenges the paucity of testimony and the lack of discussion in the entry regarding appellee's husband, Aaron B., despite the \"ample testimony\" about appellee, her parents, her brother and sister, and her sister's partner. Appellant's Brief at 21. Appellant also questions whether the existence of child-raising responsibilities as to appellee and her husband and the evidence as to similarity of parenting styles by Rachel and appellee should have been relied upon to override the preference set forth in Rachel's will. Appellant further maintains the court, in finding Rachel had expressed a desire to move back to her hometown of Waterford, Ohio, completely ignored Rachel's expressed concerns about the health effects of power plants in that area. Evidence was adduced that Rachel had also wanted AER and CSR to be at the smaller Waterford schools; however, appellee apparently intends to either home school or send the children to a private Christian school. Appellant also suggests that appellee might decide to remain in North Carolina, despite her plans to move to Waterford upon final confirmation that she has become guardian. Finally, appellant maintains the evidence of the emergency contact listing has nothing to do with \"good cause\" for rejecting appellant as guardian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 35} In general terms, in a bench trial, a trial court judge is presumed to know the applicable law and to properly apply it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of J.L.M-L.\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist.

In a guardianship proceeding, the rationale for giving deference to the findings of the probate court is that the court is best able to view the witnesses and observe their demeanor, gestures and voice inflections, and to use these observations in weighing the credibility of the proffered testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Poliksa\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist.

Upon review of the record in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , we find the trial court properly rationalized its conclusions as to \"good cause\" and did not abuse its discretion in naming appellee as the guardian of A.E.R. and C.S.R. in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Appellant's Second Assignment of Error is therefore overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 37} In her Third Assignment of Error, appellant contends the probate court abused its discretion by making a finding of her \"disqualification,\" alleging this finding was based on considerations that are \"subjective in nature,\" do not render her ineligible to serve as guardian, and were not supported by competent, credible evidence. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Appellant presently develops and extends her arguments pertaining to the \"disqualification\" factor as set forth in the First Assignment of Error. She essentially submits that the probate court's concerns about her extended family, particularly her parents (the paternal grandparents of A.E.R. and C.S.R.), were exaggerated and could have been remedied by court orders forbidding unsupervised relative visitation with the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Appellant further takes issue with the probate court's finding of disqualification under R.C. 2111.121(B) based on the court's negative assessment of her reaction to the crisis brought about by Todd R.'s actions on December 4, 2016, which she alleges made her a \"scapegoat for trusting in her own instincts in the way others trusted theirs.\" Appellant's Brief at 25. She notes there was evidence that Todd often turned to her in crisis situations and submits that calling for law enforcement sooner on the tragic day in question might have been counterproductive and put the children at a greater risk. To borrow an observation this Court has previously made in custody matters outside of the realm of probate proceedings, \"we are confident in this case that both appellant and appellee care greatly about the [children's] welfare and both believe they can provide for [their] optimal care.\"\n   <em>\n    In re D.B.E.\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist.
