The victims were the defendant's ex-wife, whom we shall call Jane, and the defendant's daughter with Jane, whom we shall call Mary. In February, 2014, the defendant was the subject of an ongoing investigation into allegations by Mary, who was then six years old, that she and the defendant had touched each other's genitals during an overnight visit at the defendant's residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On February 22, Lisa Desrochers and Livio Gravini\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   saw on Desrochers's Facebook \"news feed\" a post by the defendant which included Mary's defaced image. The photograph was pinned to a wall by a knife. Large x's had been scratched across Mary's face, both eyes had been cut out, and a red circle had been drawn around her face, accompanied by a label reading \"100 p[oin]ts!\" The phrase \"useless little bitch\" framed her face. A \"profile picture\" of the defendant appeared in the feed, and the following caption accompanied Mary's defaced photograph:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   \"HEY BITCH EX-WIFE, IF YOUR [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] SEEING OUR DAUGHTER'S TARGET ...

Gravini, Desrochers, and McQuaid all identified the post as the one they had seen on February 22, 2014, on a Facebook page bearing the defendant's name and image, see\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Nardi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5684526\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/452/379/#p396\">\n    452 Mass. 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 396-397 (2008). Finally, \"[t]he content of the [post] reinforced [its] link to the defendant.\"\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Alden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12536016\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/105/282/#p441\">\n    93 Mass App. Ct. 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 441 (2018). The girl in the defaced photograph was Mary and the threatening caption was addressed to Jane. The message specifically referenced Mary and the ongoing sexual abuse investigation. Simply put, these confirming circumstances sufficiently connected the defendant to the post,\n   <em case-ids=\"12536016\" https:=\"\" index=\"9\" xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.L&lt;extracted-citation url=\">\n    ibr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\"&gt;id\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12536016\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/105/282/#p441\">\n    .,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and we discern no error or abuse of discretion in its admission.\n   <footnotemark xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency\n   </em>\n   . Next, the defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he intended for his threatening post to be communicated to the victims. To establish a violation of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, \"the Commonwealth was required to prove that the defendant wilfully engaged in intimidating conduct, that is, acts or words that would instill fear in a reasonable person, and did so with the intent to impede or influence a potential witness's testimony\" against the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3835436\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/76/530/#p535\">\n    76 Mass. App. Ct. 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 535 (2010). The defendant does not dispute the threatening nature of the Facebook post or the victims' status as potential witnesses against him. The defendant argues that evidence of his intent was insufficient because the posts were \"private posts, never meant to be shared with anybody.\" We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A conviction under G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, does not require that a threat actually be communicated to its target. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Valentin V\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3849589\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/83/202/#p205\">\n    83 Mass. App. Ct. 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 205-206 (2013). Instead, the focus \"is on the defendant's actions and intentions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3849589\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/83/202/#p205\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3849589\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/83/202/#p205\">\n    . at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We have held, see\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3849589\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/83/202/#p205\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3849589\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/83/202/#p205\">\n    .,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   that the witness intimidation statute parallels the threat statute, G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 2, under which the Commonwealth must prove only \"that the defendant intended to communicate the threat to the third party who acts as intermediary.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Troy T\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"987557\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/54/520/#p526\">\n    54 Mass. App. Ct. 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 526 (2002). Thus, as with threats, the crime of witness intimidation is complete \"upon the communication of the threat to the intermediary.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Valentin V\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 204.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Here, the jury apparently found by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant authored the Facebook post, and there is no claim that the post itself was unintentional. The evidence further established that (1) Jane used Facebook, (2) the post addressed Jane in the first person, (3) the post contained an explicit threat to Mary, and (4) the threat was published on the defendant's Facebook page. Considering these facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth,\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Latimore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337417\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/378/671/#p676\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337417\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/378/671/#p676\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   the jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended for his threat to be conveyed to Jane and Mary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The post was visible not just to Gravini and Desrochers, but to all of the defendant's Facebook friends and all of their Facebook friends. Gravini and Desroches together had 5,600 Facebook friends. A rational juror could conclude that by posting Mary's defaced photograph and a threat to Jane that \"I'm coming for you!!!! You better watch your back,\" and sharing it with an unidentified and unlimited audience, the defendant intended for the post to reach Jane and Mary and influence their behavior. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Meier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"626947\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/56/278/#p282\">\n    56 Mass. App. Ct. 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 282 (2002) (act of uttering a threat to a third party who would likely communicate it to the victim constitutes evidence of an intent to communicate the threat to the intended victim). Finally, where the investigation into Mary's allegations was ongoing and the threatening post related to those allegations, the jury could infer that the defendant \"should reasonably have expected that it would be communicated to\" the victims by the police conducting the investigation.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maiden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"511503\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/61/433/#p434\">\n    61 Mass.
