For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant sets forth the following assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. The Common Pleas Court erred to the prejudice of Plaintiffs-Appellant in granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees. (June 7, 2017 Opinion and Judgment Entry, p. 11-12).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On October 5, 2015, appellant filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment to clarify its easement rights. Appellant averred that, despite having an easement appurtenant to do so, appellees placed a barricade to stop appellant from walking or driving along a private road to reach Lake Erie's shoreline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellees answered the complaint on December 14, 2015, claiming to own the private road, and alleging that any easement rights appellant had did not extend to allow access to Lake Erie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The private road at issue is known as \"Dwelle Lane.\" Dating back to the Nineteenth Century, this private road was owned by the Dwelle family. Part of what was then the Dwelle family farm abuts Lake Erie in the village of Kelleys Island.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On September 22, 2016, appellees moved for summary judgment, claiming that res judicata applied to bar appellant's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Appellees further argued, in the alternative, that the easement granted was merely for ingress and egress to appellant's property, and that appellees had the right, as owners, to vacate a portion of Dwelle Lane by way of an amended plat. Appellees amended the plat in 2008. Appellees asserted appellant did not act within the one-year statute of limitation to challenge this amended plat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In further support of its motion for summary judgment, appellees supplied an April 2013 affidavit\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   from a licensed professional surveyor, Peter Segaard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Segaard's April 2013 affidavit was submitted to support appellees' position that Dwelle Lane was and is a private road, that Dwelle Lane was owned by appellees, and that appellant's ingress and egress rights only extended to allow access to its property, but not to Lake Erie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellees also submitted deeds from their chains of record title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Two deeds concerned the parcel of land south of Dwelle Lane, at its eastern point, which is and was owned by Breakers of Kelleys Island, LLC (\"Breakers\") and its predecessors (\"the Stuebers\") dating back to 1964. There is no dispute this land is within what was the original Dwelle farm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Based on its language, Paul and Anne Stueber received the 1964 deed from the Ohio Public Trust Company, trustee of the Elmina Dwelle Lucke estate. The 1964 deed purportedly conveyed a 3.181 acre parcel. The Stuebers' children received interest in the land from their mother's residence trust in a 2002 deed. Two of the children, Cynthia (Herndon) and Fred, subsequently acquired ownership and transferred it to their company, Breakers. The deed references a 1926 case from the Erie Court of Common Pleas in which easement rights were established by stipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} This 1926 case was brought by Charles Dwelle against Ray Gorsuch, Ralph Lucke, Elmina Lucke, the children and heirs of Jacob Lucke, and Milford Hicks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Charles B. Dwelle v. Ray H. Gorsuch\n   </em>\n   , Erie C.P. No. 15989 (Aug. 5, 1926). Charles Dwelle sought to establish easement rights or a right-of-way by arguing he and his predecessors maintained such rights. The parties settled and their stipulations were adopted by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Additional deeds were submitted by appellees in support of summary judgment, which concerned appellees', Jeri and Kyle Yoest, parcel of land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} This parcel of land is north of Dwelle Lane, at the eastern point, and is indisputably part of what was the Dwelle farm. The land was once owned by Ralph (and Esther) Lucke, who then conveyed it to Walter and Jennie Gasieski in 1942. The Gasieskis formed a subdivision and private park, and appellant's right to access the park has been a subject of litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Appellant filed its opposition to summary judgment, arguing there were genuine disputes of material fact as to whether Dwelle Lane historically extended to the shoreline, whether the Dwelle family accessed the shoreline from Dwelle Lane, and whether appellees are rightful owners of Dwelle Lane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Appellant owns the land to the west of Breakers, and appellant's land borders south of Dwelle Lane. This parcel of land is indisputably within what was the original Dwelle farm, and it abuts Dwelle Lane. Appellant can travel west to reach Monaghan Road, and east to reach appellees' erected barrier before reaching the shoreline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Appellant deposed appellee Fred Stueber in October 2016, and offered his testimony, along with other evidence, to withstand judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In particular, appellant argued Stueber's testimony demonstrated that factual disputes exist because it shows that the eastern point of Dwelle Lane was used by the Dwelle family for boating, that Dwelle Lane was historically considered to extend east to the shoreline of Lake Erie, and that Dwelle Lane was not owned by appellees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Further, appellant offered expert testimony and at least three historical maps to support the argument that Dwelle Lane extended east to the shoreline of Lake Erie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Specifically, an October 2016 affidavit from Segaard, the same surveyor who was affiant for appellees in April 2013, averred that based on his expert analysis \"Dwelle Lane was a private road which ran to the shoreline of Lake Erie.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Appellant also submitted an October 2016 affidavit from Michael F. Waiwood, a title insurance agent and attorney who has worked in the industry since 1977, which stated that based on his opinion Dwelle Lane spanned to Lake Erie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Appellant also offered expert testimony to support that Dwelle Lane was not owned by appellees. Waiwood's affidavit reflected his opinion that \"[t]he fee simple title underlying Dwelle [Lane] itself is not conveyed.\" Waiwood continued, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The deed also purports to grant to the grantees, their heirs and assigns, all of the right, title and interest it holds (whatever that is, if any) in Dwelle Lane itself but the deed does not state affirmatively that it does hold any such right, title or interest. The deed contains no Covenant of Seisen nor any warranties of title nor any obligation to defend the title. It only represents that said title is clear, free and unencumbered\n   <em>\n    by any act of the grantor\n   </em>\n   . Effectively it is a quit-claim deed without warranties or covenants and only conveys what it may have owned (unencumbered by it) but does not include the title to any part of Dwelle Lane. In [f]act, Ohio Citizens never owned the fee title to Dwelle Lane.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Segaard's October 2016 affidavit reflected that he shared that opinion, stating as follows: \"[t]he 2006 deeds conveying Lots 1, 2 and 3 of Block 2 of the Gasieski Subdivision (south side of Dwelle Lane), to Frederick Stueber, for which I prepared the legal descriptions, do not include any part of the road known as Dwelle Lane.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Segaard continued with, \"[t]he property line stops at the south edge of Dwelle Lane.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 25} The trial court nevertheless granted summary judgment in favor of appellees, and an entry was journalized June 7, 2017. Appellant now timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 26} When reviewing a trial court's summary judgment decision, the appellate court conducts a de novo review.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

Appellant asserts these issues must be resolved before judgment, as a matter of law, in favor of appellees is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Appellees make five arguments in response to support that no factual issues exist, and that the grant of judgment as a matter of law is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 31} First, appellees argue the 2008 amended plat submitted into the record shows that Dwelle Lane was shortened to eliminate appellant's access to Lake Erie, and that appellant did not challenge the plat within the statute of limitations. Appellant responds, pointing to Segaard's October 2016 and Waiwood's affidavits, which aver that Dwelle Lane was not conveyed to appellees and, therefore, appellees have no right to vacate Dwelle Lane by way of an amended plat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Second, appellees argue appellant never had a right to access the lakeshore from Dwelle Lane and, third, that appellant still has the right to the intended use of Dwelle Lane which was allegedly to allow appellant to leave and return to its property from Monaghan Road. Appellees rely on the language of the deeds and Segaard's April 2013 affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Appellant responds, pointing to Stueber's testimony, Segaard's October 2016 and Waiwood's affidavits, and the imprecise language in appellees' chain of record title, essentially arguing that the evidence in the record places in dispute whether appellant has implied rights that extend to allow access to the shoreline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Fourth and fifth, appellees argue res judicata prevents appellant from relitigating to establish rights and from challenging certain facts. Appellant contends the past litigation involved declaratory judgment and did not involve the same legal and factual issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

With respect to the Yoests' chain of record title, the Gasieskis' 1969 deed states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Meaning to convey all that part of the Charles B. Dwelle farm located north of Dwelle Lane so called with all rights to use of said Dwelle Lane that originally were enjoyed by owners of said Dwelle Farm; said Charles B. Dwelle Farm being the farm conveyed by Charles B. Dwelle, a Bachelor to J.J. Lucke and Milford W. Hicks* * *[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 37} With respect to Breakers' chain of record title, the Stueber 1964 deed specifically states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The grantor of the lands herein described further grants to the grantee, his heirs and assigned, all right, title, and interest it holds in the area hereto for designated as any part of Dwelle Lane, reserving, however, for any property owners of lands within the original Sylvester Dwelle estate (deed volume 11, page 200) their heirs, assigns, servants and guests, the right of use thereof for ingress and egress to their respective properties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Moreover, in the 2002 deed in which \"the Anne K. Stueber Residence Trust\" granted equal shares of the Stueber property to Breakers' owners, it states: \"[B]ut subject to all legal highways and waterways. Together with and/or subject to easements and rights of way of record appurtenant thereto or affecting said premises, particularly as established by decree entered August 5, 1926 in Case Number 15989, Erie County Common Pleas Court.\" We note there is no deed from appellant's chain of title in the record below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Consequently, based on the deed language in appellees' chains of title, and as agreed by the parties, we hold that as a matter of law appellant was granted an express easement to use Dwelle Lane for ingress and egress to its property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kuyoth v.
