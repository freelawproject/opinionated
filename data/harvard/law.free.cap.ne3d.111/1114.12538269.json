We summarize the evidence presented to the grand jury. The defendant, Adam Larsen, is a Plymouth police officer. On April 8, 2016, Larsen arrested an intoxicated woman for disturbing the peace. The woman suffered a fractured skull during an incident that occurred while Larsen was escorting her to a holding cell. The holding cell was monitored by a surveillance camera.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 11, 2016, while investigating the incident, Captain John Rogers reviewed the surveillance video and determined that \"[d]etailed review shows [the woman] backing into the cell when it appears that she was pushed by someone outside the cell which caused her to fall striking her head.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After watching the video, Captain Rogers requested that all the officers on duty that night complete reports \"outlining their knowledge and actions during this incident.\" All of those incident reports were completed by April 14. In his incident report, Larsen stated that \"[the woman] walked into her cell [but] then charged forward as [he] was attempting to close the cell door. [He] placed [his] arm out, in a locked position to stop [her] forward progress from exiting the cell. [The woman] walked into [his] hand and immediately lost her balance. [She] fell backwards and struck the back of her head on the edge of the concrete cell block bed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On April 25 and 28, Captain Rogers conducted interviews with Lieutenant Paul Higgins and Sergeant Christopher Butler -- two officers who were on duty at the time of the incident. On April 29, Captain Rogers interviewed Larsen -- before Larsen had the opportunity to view the video recording. At the interview, Larsen substantially echoed the version of events he laid out in his incident report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Captain Rogers, however, determined that Larsen's account of the incident was inconsistent with what the video showed. Specifically, Rogers described the video as showing that the woman \"backed into the cell and never appear[ed] to try and leave,\" and stated the \"[v]ideo surveillance shows [Larsen's] black latex gloved hand moving through the plane of the door as [the woman] falls back into the cell.\" This description of the video differed from Larsen's account that the woman ran into his locked-out arm. After Rogers conducted follow-up interviews, this indictment was sought. As clarified by the Commonwealth's bill of particulars, Larsen's statements on April 29 formed the basis of the charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . The elements of the offense of misleading a police officer are \"(1) wilfully misleading, directly or indirectly, (2) a police officer (3) with the intent to impede, obstruct, delay, harm, punish, or otherwise interfere thereby with (4) a criminal investigation\" (footnote omitted).\n   <em>\n    Paquette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457241\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/475/793/#p800\">\n    475 Mass. at 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[T]o find the defendant guilty of misleading a police officer with a lie, the jury would need to find not only that the statement was false, but that it reasonably could have led law enforcement officers to pursue a\n   <em>\n    materially different\n   </em>\n   course in their investigation from one they otherwise would have pursued because it sent them in the wrong direction, i.e., a 'wild goose chase.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tejeda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12462715\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/476/817/#p819\">\n    476 Mass. 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 819 (2017), quoting\n   <em>\n    Paquette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457241\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/475/793/#p800\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457241\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/475/793/#p800\">\n    at 800-801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Commonwealth contends that Larsen's statements to the investigating officer were misleading because a grand jury could find probable cause that at the time she was pushed, the woman was backing into the cell and did not charge toward Larsen. For this reason, the Commonwealth asserts, the grand jury heard sufficient evidence to support a finding of probable cause that the defendant intended to mislead Captain Rogers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We agree that the evidence was sufficient to establish probable cause to believe that Larsen's statements were false and intended to mislead. However, the evidence also shows that the statements could not reasonably have caused an investigating officer to be misled in such a way as to affect the course of the police investigation. See\n   <em>\n    Paquette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457241\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/475/793/#p800\">\n    475 Mass. at 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

By that time Captain Rogers had already seen the video and formed the opinion as to what it showed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time he interviewed Larsen, Captain Rogers knew that Larsen's account was at odds with the video footage. Larsen's account of the incident could not reasonably have led Captain Rogers to pursue a materially different course in his investigation.

Following Larsen's April 29 interview, Captain Rogers conducted follow-up interviews, but he did not shift the focus of the investigation. Captain Rogers re-interviewed Larsen, but he was not tempted to pursue a \"wild goose chase.\" \"[I]n the absence of other evidence indicating that the statements reasonably could have affected the police investigation in a material way,\" the indictment was not supported by sufficient evidence to establish probable cause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457241\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/475/793/#p800\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457241\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/475/793/#p800\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Alternatively, the Commonwealth contends that the judge erred as a matter of law in declining to permit the Commonwealth to proceed on a lesser included offense of attempt to mislead a police officer. \"[M]aking a mere 'effort' or 'attempt' is plainly not enough\" under the statute.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fortuna\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3845189\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/80/45/#p54\">\n    80 Mass.
