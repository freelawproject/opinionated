First, the postal inspector who identified and seized the package had a reasonable suspicion that justified seizing the defendant's package and the length of time for the seizure was reasonable. Second, the police officers had probable cause to search the package based on the certified drug-sniffing canine's positive alert that the package contained a controlled substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . We summarize the facts as found by the motion judge, supplemented by uncontroverted facts from the record, and reserve some facts for later discussion.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4271506\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/459/459/#p461\">\n    459 Mass. 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 461 (2011), citing\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Isaiah I.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3855974\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/448/334/#p337\">\n    448 Mass. 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 337 (2007). The package in question originated in Caguas, Puerto Rico, and was addressed to Jose Pagan at 11 Lowell Street, West Springfield. On December 11, 2015, the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) in San Juan, Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico USPIS), informed the USPIS in Springfield (Springfield USPIS), that they could not locate the sender of the package because the address listed was not associated with the name of the purported sender of the package. The package was sent to the Springfield USPIS for further review. The Springfield USPIS's postal inspector, Richard Tracy, attempted to identify Jose Pagan, the intended recipient of the package. Tracy determined that Pagan was not associated with the destination address listed on the package. The destination listed on the package was a place of business, Los Bori's Auto Repair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Tracy seized the package based on: (1) the USPIS's inability to associate both the sender and the recipient of the package with the respective addresses provided, (2) Tracy's personal knowledge from previous investigations that false names are commonly used in the shipment of illegal substances to avoid identification, and (3) Tracy's personal knowledge from previous investigations that cocaine is commonly sent from Puerto Rico to the United States via the United States Postal Service (postal service). On December 12, 2015, USPIS met with police officer Joseph Brewer and his canine, Charon, at the Wilbraham police department.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The package was placed in a vacant officer where Officer Brewer and canine Charon could examine it. Upon approaching the package in the vacant room, canine Charon alerted Officer Brewer that she detected controlled substances in the package.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on canine Charon's positive alert, Tracy applied for a Federal search warrant to search the package. The Federal search warrant was granted on December 15, 2015. The package was thereafter searched and approximately 500 grams of cocaine was recovered. Narcotics Detective Daniel Znoj of the West Springfield police department subsequently applied for a State search warrant to search the intended destination of the package, 11 Lowell Street, West Springfield. This warrant was granted on December 16, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On December 16, 2015, Tracy posed as a mail carrier and delivered the package to the destination address.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Police officers surveilled the area and observed the defendant drive his vehicle out of the parking lot at the destination address and drive into the adjacent parking lot. Tracy drove the mail delivery trick into the parking lot of the destination address. The defendant walked over to Tracy as he exited the mail delivery truck with the package. The defendant asked Tracy if the package was for \"Jose,\" to which Tracy responded in the affirmative. Tracy then asked the defendant to confirm the last name of the recipient, to which the defendant responded \"Jose Pagan. I almost missed you.\" Tracy gave the package to the defendant after the defendant signed for it. The surveilling police officers stopped the defendant in his vehicle as he drove out of the parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant was charged with trafficking cocaine greater than two hundred grams, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ) (4), as being a habitual offender, in violation of G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 25 (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ), and operating a motor vehicle with a suspended or revoked license, in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 23. The defendant filed a motion to suppress the \"evidence from the seizure, canine sniff, opening, and search of a parcel of mail at the United State Post Office in Springfield on the basis that [the] search warrant was insufficient.\" The defendant's motion also sought to suppress \"all evidence and statements, if any, obtained from the resulting search of a residence located at 11 Lowell Street, West Springfield.\" After a nonevidentiary hearing on February 23, 2017, the motion judge allowed the defendant's motion. The Commonwealth filed the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .

Tracy has fourteen years of experience with investigating \"criminal activities involving the use of the mail, including the investigation of items not allowed to be mailed such as controlled substances, which are given over to U.S. Postal Service for delivery.\" Tracy had a legitimate suspicion about the package for several reasons. The package was \"approximately 12 inches by 12 inches, [ ] approximately 6 inches in thickness, and weigh[ed] approximately 5 lbs, 15 oz.\" The postage fee paid was a total of sixty-one dollars and sixty cents.

The Springfield USPIS was alerted by the Puerto Rico USPIS after they were unable to locate the purported sender of the package.

The package was detained for a maximum of four days before the Federal search warrant was issued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   While we understand other cases have proceeded on a faster timeline, we would be hard pressed to find that five days constitutes an unreasonable delay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the suspect never inquired about the location of the package.
