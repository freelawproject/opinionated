GALLAGHER, J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant Anthony Grant appeals the sentence imposed in three underlying cases, Cuyahoga C.P. Nos. CR-15-598262-A, CR-15-598310-A, and CR-15-599943-A, as well as the imposition of court costs. Upon review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant was indicted and charged on multiple counts in each of the three underlying cases. He ultimately entered\n   a plea agreement with the state and pleaded guilty to the following charges: in CR-15-598262-A, involuntary manslaughter in violation of R.C. 2903.03 with a three-year firearm specification; in CR-15-598310-A, attempted aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.01 with a one-year firearm specification; and in CR-15-599943-A, to the indictment as charged, which included two counts of having weapons while under disability and one count of carrying a concealed weapon, each with a forfeiture of weapon specification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} With regard to the first two cases, CR-15-598262-A and CR-15-598310-A, there was an agreement to a sentencing range for the two offenses in the aggregate to a term of between 6 and 20 years, which is down from the maximum of up to 26 years. There was no agreement to a sentence in CR-15-599943-A, which was to be in addition to the other two cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} At sentencing, the trial court indicated it had reviewed the presentence investigation report and appellant's sentencing memorandum. The trial court heard from defense counsel, appellant, persons on appellant's behalf, members of the victims' families, and the assistant prosecutor. The trial court indicated it had considered all the information presented, all the principles and purposes of felony sentencing, and the appropriate recidivism and seriousness factors. The trial court reviewed appellant's criminal history, including his juvenile record. Further, the trial court considered the plea agreement and made the requisite findings for consecutive sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The trial court sentenced appellant as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In CR-15-598262-A, to eight years in prison for involuntary manslaughter, plus three years on the firearm specification to run prior to and consecutive with the eight-year sentence, for a total of 11 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In CR-15-598310-A, to eight years in prison for attempted aggravated robbery, plus one year on the firearm specification to run prior to and consecutive with the eight-year sentence, for a total of nine years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In CR-15-599943-A, to 18 months in prison on each of the three counts, to run concurrent to each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The trial court ordered the sentences in CR-15-598262-A and CR-15-598310-A to run consecutive to each other for an aggregate sentence of 20 years. The cases were also run consecutive with CR-15-599943-A, for a total of 21 and one-half years. The court imposed postrelease control and also found appellant responsible for court costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellant timely filed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    R.C. 2953.08(D)(1) Reviewability-CR-15-598262-A and CR-15-598310-A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Before reaching the assignments of error, we must first determine the reviewability of the sentence imposed in two of the underlying cases, CR-15-598262-A and CR-15-598310-A. In these two cases, there was an agreement to an aggregate sentence of 6 to 20 years, which is below the statutory maximum of 26 years. The trial court imposed an aggregate sentence of 20 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} R.C. 2953.08(D)(1) limits our ability to review an agreed sentence. R.C. 2953.08(D)(1) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A sentence imposed upon a defendant is not subject to review under this section if the sentence is authorized by law, has been recommended jointly by the defendant and the prosecution in the case, and is imposed by a sentencing judge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The initial question we must answer is whether an agreement to a sentencing range, as opposed to a specific term of incarceration, is a jointly recommended sentence for purposes of R.C. 2953.08(D)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Jointly Recommended Sentencing Range\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Examining some basic realities from our current criminal justice system helps resolve the above question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} As the number of trials has reduced over the past decade, criminal practitioners on both sides have increasingly turned their focus to sentencing proceedings. The uncertainty over what sentence a particular offender might receive has created a negotiation process involving sentencing that now rivals the efforts put into securing a plea. This effort is made for good reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In cases involving serious crimes where guilt is found or admitted, consecutive sentencing is often in play. Defendants may wish to limit their potential exposure. Conversely, the state seeks to ensure the sentence will satisfy the victim or the prosecutor's sense of justice for the community as a whole. Sentences can vary widely. A mutual agreement on sentencing can be beneficial to both sides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Nevertheless, even where an agreement on sentencing can be reached between the parties, trial judges are sometimes reluctant to be bound by a specific number on a specific sentence agreed to by the parties at the time of the plea. Judges may have concerns about what a presentence investigation report may reveal or what may later be said during a sentencing hearing that may sway the judge's decision. Judges often prefer to retain sentencing discretion, and curbing or limiting their discretion is not something easily accomplished. For this reason, judges may reject agreed sentences involving a specific term. This has given way to the rise of agreed sentencing ranges, which create the needed flexibility for the parties to negotiate a resolution but allow the judge to retain discretion to impose a fair and just sentence within acceptable and agreed to parameters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Range agreements are no different than specific term agreements; they are both negotiated agreements based on a quid pro quo arrangement where each side gives up something in exchange for being bound by the terms of the agreement. Under either scenario, the defendant can \"cap\" or limit his exposure. When an agreed range is involved, the state is ensured the sentence will fall within the agreed range and the defendant is ensured the sentence will not exceed it. We cannot permit a defendant to agree to a term of imprisonment, whether expressed specifically or within a range, in exchange for lesser charges or having some charges dismissed, only to turn around and challenge that very agreement on appeal. Such practice would only serve to undermine the state's incentive to enter plea agreements in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Thus, whether the joint recommendation is to a range or a specific term, the sentence is not reviewable. Other districts agree. So long as the sentence imposed within a jointly recommended sentencing range is authorized by law, the sentence is not reviewable on appeal.

The reason the sentence within the acceptable range in\n   <em>\n    Underwood\n   </em>\n   was deemed not \"authorized by law\" was because the state previously conceded the counts at issue were allied offenses of similar import, yet the trial court failed to merge the sentences and sentenced on those counts individually.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30. The court recognized that the decision to impose consecutive sentences is a discretionary decision that does not involve a mandatory sentencing provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. As the court indicated in\n   <em>\n    Underwood\n   </em>\n   , \"Our holding does not prevent R.C. 2953.08(D)(1) from barring appeals that would otherwise challenge the court's discretion in imposing a sentence, such as * * * whether consecutive * * * sentences were appropriate under certain circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.

CR-15-598262-A and CR-15-598310-A. Appellant agreed that any sentence within that range is appropriate, and therefore, the trial court was permitted to impose nonmandatory consecutive sentences within the agreed sentencing range. As the trial court recognized, \"that range would anticipate that there will be some consideration of consecutive sentences.\" At sentencing, the state requested that \"in light of the consideration that the state gave in the range, we do ask for the maximum consecutive under the plea agreement.\" The trial court indicated it had considered the information presented, all the principles and purposes of felony sentencing, all appropriate recidivism and seriousness factors, and whether consecutive sentences were appropriate.

Significantly, the dissent has not answered or responded to the preliminary question of whether a sentencing range agreement amounts to a jointly recommended sentence under R.C. 2953.08(D)(1). Under the dissent's view, even where the only way to cover the sentences within a recommended range requires the imposition of consecutive sentences, this agreement is somehow invalid unless the defendant expressly agrees to be sentenced consecutively.

The inherent understanding in some agreed ranges is that they are inclusive of consecutive sentences that may be imposed.

Because the 20-year aggregate sentence imposed in CR-15-598262-A and CR-15-598310-A was an agreed or jointly recommended sentence that was authorized by law, it is not reviewable on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 35} In light of the above determination, we shall consider the assignments of error only as they relate to the 18-month sentence in CR-15-599943-A.

More specifically, those judges concurred with the lead opinion's analysis as set forth in Section I of the opinion, but specifically \"disagree[d]\" with the analysis set forth in Section II of the opinion, wherein the lead opinion held that all appellate review of Akins-Daniels's sentence was precluded under R.C. 2953.08(D) because the imposed sentence was the product of a negotiated plea deal in which Akins-Daniels had agreed to a sentencing range.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. In their separate opinion, the two judges noted that Akins-Daniels had agreed only to a sentencing floor, not to a sentencing range, and accordingly, had not agreed to any and all sentences in the range specified in the lead opinion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. Nevertheless, the two judges found that the lead opinion correctly determined,\n   <em>\n    as set forth in Section I of the opinion\n   </em>\n   , that Akins-Daniels's appeal lacked merit because he had not clearly and convincingly demonstrated that his sentence was contrary to law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9, 21. Accordingly, the two judges concurred in judgment only with the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 53} The proposition stated in\n   <em>\n    Akins-Daniels\n   </em>\n   -that \"[i]f the state and defendant jointly recommend a sentencing range, the defendant implicitly agrees to all definite sentencing possibilities within that range\"-comes directly from Section II of the\n   <em>\n    Akins-Daniels\n   </em>\n   opinion, with which two judges specifically disagreed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.

The majority tries to hide its reliance on\n   <em>\n    Akins-Daniels\n   </em>\n   by citing\n   <em>\n    Ramsey\n   </em>\n   , which relies on\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   , which relies on\n   <em>\n    Akins-Daniels\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 55} The majority attempts another end run around\n   <em>\n    Akins-Daniels\n   </em>\n   by citing paragraph nine of\n   <em>\n    State v.

It is apparent that the majority view can be traced directly to the nonbinding dicta in\n   <em>\n    Akins-Daniels\n   </em>\n   . But to \"apply the proposition being discussed\" in\n   <em>\n    Akins-Daniels\n   </em>\n   to this case, as the majority admits it is doing, that proposition should be based on precedent-not merely \"unbinding dicta.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 56} In addition to relying on a case with no precedential value to resolve the reviewability question, the majority misstates the holding in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The majority opines that \"[i]n\n   <em>\n    Sergent\n   </em>\n   , the Ohio Supreme Court determined that a jointly recommended sentence that includes nonmandatory consecutive sentences is 'authorized by law' and not appealable even if consecutive-sentencing findings have not been made.\" The actual holding, however, was that when nonmandatory consecutive sentences are jointly recommended by the parties, the consecutive-sentence findings required by\n   R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) are not required; and thus, when a trial judge imposes nonmandatory consecutive sentences without making the required findings, the sentence is nevertheless authorized by law and unreviewable on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43-44. Indeed, the question addressed by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Sergent\n   </em>\n   was \"when\n   <em>\n    jointly recommended consecutive sentences\n   </em>\n   are imposed and the trial judge fails to make the findings required in R.C. 2929.14(C), is the sentence 'authorized by law'?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 57} In analyzing the question, the Supreme Court first noted its holding in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Supreme Court acknowledged that such a sentence is \"authorized by law\" pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State v. Underwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4104470\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/124/365/\">\n    124 Ohio St.3d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-1\">\n    2010-Ohio-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=922%20N.E.2d%20923\">\n    922 N.E.2d 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , even though it involves a discretionary decision to impose consecutive sentences, rather than a mandatory sentencing provision. Therefore, noting that \"\n   <em>\n    Porterfield\n   </em>\n   controls,\" the Supreme Court held that \"[i]f a jointly recommended sentence includes nonmandatory consecutive sentences and the trial judge fails to make the consecutive-sentence findings set out in R.C. 2929.14(C)(4), the sentence is nevertheless 'authorized by law,' and therefore is not appealable pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(D)(1).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 58} Despite\n   <em>\n    Sergent's\n   </em>\n   instruction that \"\n   <em>\n    a joint recommendation to impose consecutive sentences\n   </em>\n   eliminates the need for a trial judge to make the consecutive-sentence findings set out in R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) and that such a sentence, once imposed, is not subject to review under R.C. 2953.08(D),\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22, several districts have concluded that where a defendant has agreed to a sentencing range, even where he or she did not expressly agree to the imposition of consecutive sentences, no findings are required because such a sentence is authorized by law. The majority cites these cases with approval to support its resolution of the reviewability question. Notably, however, one of these cases-\n   <em>\n    Ramsey\n   </em>\n   -cites\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Akins-Daniels\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that \"if the state and defendant jointly recommend a sentencing range, the defendant implicitly agrees to all definite sentencing possibilities within that range\"-a proposition that, as discussed above, is unsupported by legal authority and comes from a case with no precedential value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 59} Furthermore, these cases are inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Sergent\n   </em>\n   , which held that consecutive-sentence findings were not required only where the defendant and the state specifically agreed to them, thus making their imposition authorized by law and unreviewable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30. It is significant that in paragraph 31 of the\n   <em>\n    Sergent\n   </em>\n   opinion, the Supreme Court cited nine Ohio cases that had \"reached the same result\" as in\n   <em>\n    Sergent\n   </em>\n   . In all nine cases, the defendant's sentence was held unreviewable because the defendant and the state had jointly agreed to the imposition of consecutive sentences or to the sentence that was imposed.\n   <em>\n    None of the cases involved an agreement only to a sentencing range.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 60} The majority opines that the rationale expressed by the Supreme Court of Ohio in\n   <em>\n    Porterfield\n   </em>\n   resolves the reviewability question: \"The General Assembly intended a jointly agreed-upon sentence to be protected from review precisely because\n   the parties agreed that the sentence is appropriate. Once a defendant stipulates that a particular sentence is justified, the sentencing judge no longer needs to independently justify the sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    Porterfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1257844\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/106/5/\">\n    106 Ohio St.3d 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005-Ohio-3095\">\n    2005-Ohio-3095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=829%20N.E.2d%20690\">\n    829 N.E.2d 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 61} But that is precisely the point. Where a defendant does not agree to the imposition of nonmandatory consecutive sentences, even where the defendant has agreed to a sentencing range, the sentence is not an agreed-upon sentence. The rationale expressed in\n   <em>\n    Porterfield\n   </em>\n   was apt because, as the court noted, the defendant \"agreed to the precise sentence imposed,\" which included consecutive sentences.\n   <em>\n    Porterfield\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25. He also stipulated to the consecutive-sentence findings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2. Thus, the sentence imposed was indeed a \"jointly recommended sentence that was authorized by law\" and not subject to review.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26. The\n   <em>\n    Porterfield\n   </em>\n   rationale does not apply, however, where there is no agreement to nonmandatory consecutive sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 62} The disturbing but logical extension of the majority's view is that any sentence imposed when a defendant pleads guilty to a felony is unreviewable, because any time a defendant pleads guilty to a felony, he agrees to be sentenced to the range appropriate for that felony. The majority's view, apparently, is that such sentences are never reviewable because they involve a range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Accordingly, I dissent from the majority's conclusion that a sentence imposed within a jointly recommended sentencing range that is authorized by law is not subject to appellate review, even where the defendant did not expressly agree to the imposition of nonmandatory consecutive sentences. Thus, because Grant did not agree to consecutive sentences, I would find that the first and second assignments of error, which challenge the imposition of consecutive sentences in CR-15-598310-A and CR-15-598262 are reviewable. Nevertheless, the first and second assignments of error lack merit because the trial court made the required findings to impose consecutive sentences and properly considered Grant's juvenile history when imposing sentence. Therefore, I concur in judgment only with the majority on its disposition of these assignments of error. I concur with the majority's resolution of the third and fourth assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Akins-Daniels\n    </em>\n    , it was stated by this writer in a separate opinion that \"[i]f the state and defendant jointly recommend a sentencing range, the defendant implicitly agrees to all definite sentencing possibilities within that range.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 12 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.
