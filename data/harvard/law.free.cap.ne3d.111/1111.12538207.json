Absent a plaintiff with interests \"distinct from those of the general public,\" the Attorney General possesses \"exclusive\" standing in cases involving \"the efficient and lawful operation of charitable corporations.\"\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Medford Community Ctr., Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"934249\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/384/163/#p167\">\n    384 Mass. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 167 (1981). The plaintiffs have failed to show how the harm to them by the sale of the subject paintings is distinct from that of the general public. We reject the plaintiffs' suggestion that the representation in the museum's Web site that membership includes \"opportunities to provide feedback\" provides them with a distinct interest or injury. Their opportunity to give feedback does not provide them a right to participate in management decisions. Therefore, in this case only the Attorney General has standing to sue for any possible breach of such a contract occasioned by the deaccession of the museum art.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"934249\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/384/163/#p167\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"934249\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/384/163/#p167\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Protecting rights as members\n   </em>\n   .

L. c. 180, \u00a7 3, second par., which is not a right included in the plaintiffs' memberships. The museum's bylaws exclusively vest corporate membership rights in the trustees and differentiate between corporate membership, which the trustees have, and mere dues-paying membership, which the plaintiffs have.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Suing derivatively\n   </em>\n   .
