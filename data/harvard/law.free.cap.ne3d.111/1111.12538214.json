Miller.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   The defendant, Michael N. Miller, appeals from an order dismissing his underlying appeal. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   As alleged, Kinaeda Corp. (Kinaeda) took out a $2 million loan; the note later was assigned to Heritage Hill Finance Company, Inc. (Heritage). Miller guaranteed Kinaeda's loan. Kinaeda was current on the note until late 2010 but made no payments thereafter, leaving a balance then due of about $580,000. Heritage commenced this action in 2013 for, relevant here, breach of Miller's guarantee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Following a jury-waived trial, judgment in the total amount of about $402,188.28, with interest, entered in Heritage's favor. Miller noticed a timely appeal and took initial steps to have a trial transcript produced but, in February, 2016, was notified that the electronic trial recording could not be located and no trial transcript could be produced. Miller took no further steps to perfect his appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In January, 2017, Heritage moved to dismiss Miller's appeal. In substance, Heritage argued that as Miller had neither filed and served a statement of evidence and proceedings, see Mass. R. A. P. 8 (c), as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=378%20Mass.%20932\">\n    378 Mass. 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor made any attempt to have an agreed statement of the case on appeal approved, see Mass. R. A. P. 8 (d), as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=378%20Mass.%20932\">\n    378 Mass. 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Miller had not prosecuted his appeal with the diligence required by Mass. R. A. P. 9 (c), as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=437%20Mass.%201602\">\n    437 Mass. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). Miller made no attempt to recreate the record after Heritage moved to dismiss but, instead, moved for an enlargement of time and opposed Heritage's motion, suggesting, in his multiple affidavits, that his underlying appeal had merit and that the missing trial recording \"made my job of perfecting the appeal very hard.\" Following an April, 2017, hearing, the same judge who presided at the trial dismissed Miller's appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Rule 10 (c) of the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure provides that an appeal may be dismissed upon a finding that the appellant's dilatory, uncured conduct was due to \"inexcusable neglect.\" Mass. R. A. P. 10(c), as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=417%20Mass.%201602\">\n    417 Mass. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). While \"inexcusable neglect\" is a somewhat amorphous concept, it \"does not embrace [a] flat mistake ... about the meaning of a ... rule\" or other \"garden-variety oversights.\"\n   <em>\n    Neuwirth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Neuwirth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229079\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/85/248/#p257\">\n    85 Mass.

We review an order dismissing an appeal for abuse of discretion, remaining \"mindful ... that the burden was on [Miller], as appellant, to pursue his appeal, and to provide an adequate record for his appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Scheuer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mahoney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3843763\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/80/704/#p708\">\n    80 Mass. App. Ct. 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 708 (2011), quoting\n   <em>\n    Spivey\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Neitlich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1508567\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/59/742/#p744\">\n    59 Mass. App. Ct. 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 744 (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Rule 8 of the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure specifically contemplates that electronic trial recordings may be unavailable, providing specific procedures to be employed in that event. See notes 2 &amp; 3,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , and accompanying text. As the record reflects here, Miller failed to utilize the procedures delineated in rule 8. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Flint\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899697\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/81/794/#p800\">\n    81 Mass. App. Ct. 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 800-804 (2012) (delineating steps to reconstruct record on appeal when transcript is unavailable). Miller does not claim ignorance of his duties under rules 8 and 9 of the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure ; nor does he claim any circumstances beyond his control (other than that the electronic recording was not available), mistake, misunderstanding, or even simple oversight. Instead, Miller contends, in substance, that opposing counsel allegedly, on a single occasion, did not return Miller's telephone call -- an allegation counsel disputes -- and that the missing recording made it difficult to prepare his appeal. In this light Miller's conduct properly may be characterized as \"inexcusable.\" Compare\n   <em>\n    Neuwirth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229079\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/85/248/#p257\">\n    85 Mass. App. Ct. at 257-258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Nor did the judge erroneously deny Miller's request for an enlargement. We note that Miller made no effort to take advantage of the cure provisions provided by Mass. R. A. P. 10 (c) even though more than three months passed between the date Miller received Heritage's motion and hearing on that motion. Nor, as noted, did Miller adequately explain what efforts, if any, he took to reconstruct the record during the previous year. In the meantime, as Miller's delays accrued and the parties' and trial judge's recollections faded, Heritage remained unable to execute on its judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We appreciate that Miller's counsel withdrew shortly after judgment entered and that Miller now is unrepresented. While \"some leniency\" may therefore be appropriate when reviewing Miller's appellate efforts, he nonetheless remains, \"as all other litigants\" are, bound by the rules of procedure.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chicopee Fire Fighters Ass'n., Local 1710, IAFF\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3891698\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/408/1003/\">\n    408 Mass. 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1004 n.4 (1990). In this case Miller's failure to take steps to recreate the record has both prejudiced Heritage and rendered us unable, from \"both a legal and a practical\" perspective, to conduct any meaningful review.\n   <em>\n    Kellogg\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Registration in Med.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272449\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/461/1001/#p1003\">\n    461 Mass. 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1003 (2011). We are thus unable to say that the judge committed \" 'a clear error of judgment in weighing' the factors relevant to the decision ... such that the decision falls outside the range of reasonable alternatives.\"\n   <em>\n    L.L.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144900\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/169/\">\n    470 Mass. 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 185 n.27 (2014), quoting\n   <em>\n    Picciotto\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Continental Cas.

Miller thus waived the claim.
