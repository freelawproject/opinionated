For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} From July 2002 to June 2014, the Division employed Hassey as a police officer. In September 2013, Hassey's ex-girlfriend, Elde Shepherd, filed a citizen's complaint with the Division's Internal Affairs Bureau (\"IAB\") regarding Hassey. Shepherd alleged that Hassey engaged in various misconduct, including regularly smoking marijuana. David M. Barrowman, a sergeant with IAB, initiated an investigation into Shepherd's allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On the morning of September 26, 2013, Barrowman notified Hassey of IAB's investigation and ordered Hassey to report for an IAB interview the next morning. That evening, Hassey called his supervisor and said that he planned to admit to using marijuana during his IAB interview. The Division immediately relieved Hassey from his regular assignment and ordered Hassey to contact the employee assistance program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Barrowman interviewed Hassey the next day. During that interview, Hassey stated that he had smoked marijuana approximately three to four times a month for the previous three to five years. Hassey admitted to last smoking marijuana two days before his interview. Hassey's sister periodically gave Hassey small amounts of marijuana. Hassey claimed that he only smoked one or two puffs at a time, and that it took him a week to two weeks to finish a joint. Occasionally, Hassey shared the marijuana he received from his sister with Shepherd.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Barrowman asked Hassey if he would volunteer to take a drug test. Hassey declined on the advice of his attorney. However, Hassey conceded that if he took the test, the results would be positive for marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Based on Hassey's admissions, the Division charged Hassey with violation of Rules of Conduct 1.36 and 1.42(C). Rule 1.36, entitled \"Unbecoming Conduct,\" provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Division personnel shall conduct themselves at all times, both on and off duty, in such a manner as to reflect favorably on the Division. Unbecoming conduct is behavior that implicitly or explicitly dishonors the Division and/or its members, reflects discredit upon the individual as a member of the Division, or impairs the operation or efficiency of the Division or the individual. This includes, but is not limited to, derogatory, discriminatory, or harassing comments, gestures, or insinuations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Hassey Ex. 12 at 8.) Rule 1.42(C) states that \"Division personnel shall not consume, possess, or purchase illicit/illegal drugs except as required in the line of duty.\" (Hassey Ex. 12 at 9.) The Division asserted that Hassey violated Rules 1.36 and 1.42(C) by\n   possessing and using marijuana, as well as supplying marijuana to Shepherd for her use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On March 20, 2014, the chief of police conducted a disciplinary conference regarding the charges against Hassey. During the conference, Hassey acknowledged that he had violated the Rules of Conduct as charged. Hassey, however, submitted evidence showing that he had undergone an addiction assessment and completed the three educational classes recommended as a result of the assessment. Hassey also assured the chief that he no longer used marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Hassey's union representative asked the chief to follow Section 17.9 of the collective bargaining agreement between the city of Columbus and the Fraternal Order of Police, Capital City Lodge No. 9, when disciplining Hassey.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   That section states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The City will not discharge a member who tests positive a first time (unless the member tests positive for use of a controlled substance, the use or possession of which in any amount would constitute a felony), provided the member fulfills the obligations set forth in (A) through (F) below. * * * A member * * * who tests positive for any other prohibited substance [other than alcohol] for the first time and who cooperates in fulfilling the obligations set forth in (A) through (F) below may be suspended. The length of such suspension shall be determined on a case-by-case basis, but shall not exceed twenty-four (24) duty hours. This limitation on discipline shall not limit the City in imposing discipline up to and including termination, for gross misconduct that may be coincident with a member's improper drug or alcohol use. A member who tests positive the first time * * * must do the following in order to take advantage of the foregoing limitations on discipline:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (A) Cooperate in an evaluation for chemical dependency by an individual qualified under 49 C.F.R. Part 382 to be a Substance Abuse Professional and provide the City with a copy of the evaluation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (B) Successfully complete all counseling, treatment or after-care (of up to 12 months) recommended by the Substance Abuse Professional;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (C) Discontinue (and not resume) the use of illegal drugs and misuse of alcohol;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (D) Agree to authorize all persons involved in evaluating, counseling, diagnosing and treating the member, to disclose to the personnel specified in Section 17.13, the member's evaluation, progress, cooperation, drug and alcohol use and successful completion or non-completion of counseling and treatment, and any threat to property or safety involved in the member performing job duties or returning to active duty;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (E) Agree to a return to duty test (which must be negative before the member will be released to return to his/her regular assignment) and submit to follow-up testing, at times determined by the City, up to seven (7) times in a twenty-four (24) month period for violations involving illegal drugs * * * ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (F) Agree that during or after this follow-up testing period in (E) above, if the member tests positive again or otherwise violates this Article, the member may properly be terminated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Hassey Ex. 1 at 64-65.) Hassey's representative told the chief that Hassey had\n   complied with the (A) through (F) requirements within his control, and he was willing perform the remainder of the requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Hassey's union representative conceded that Section 17.9 was not directly applicable because Hassey had not tested positive for marijuana. However, the representative asserted that Hassey's admission to marijuana use was analogous to testing positive and, consequently, the discipline imposed for Hassey's misconduct should not exceed a 24-hour suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 10} After the disciplinary conference, the chief of police found that the facts uncovered during the IAB investigation and the statements Hassey made during the conference sustained the violations of Rules 1.36 and 1.42(C). The chief recommended that the director of public safety suspend Hassey for 240 working hours or 30 working days and terminate Hassey's employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Hassey next appeared at a hearing before the director of public safety. Again, Hassey admitted to the charges against him. Hassey acknowledged that his behavior warranted discipline, but he asked that the director not discharge him. After considering Hassey's testimony and the evidence revealed by the IAB investigation, the director of public safety upheld the chief of police's decision to sustain the charges against Hassey and the recommendation to terminate Hassey's employment. Hassey's termination became effective on June 11, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Hassey appealed the director's decision to the Columbus Civil Service Commission (\"Commission\"). At the hearing before the Commission, Hassey presented evidence regarding the discipline imposed on four other police officers after each had engaged in drug- or alcohol-related misconduct. Each of the four officers received a suspension, rather than termination. Hassey argued that, in light of the lesser discipline received by the four other officers, the director of public safety had punished him too harshly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Hassey also asserted that the director of public safety was required to treat him the same as an officer who tested positive for illegal drugs for the first time. Therefore, according to Hassey, the director of public safety could only suspend him for up to 24 hours as provided in Section 17.9 of the CBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The Commission rejected both of Hassey's arguments. In an order issued February 23, 2015, the Commission affirmed the termination of Hassey's employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Hassey then appealed the Commission's order to the trial court. Hassey raised before the trial court the same arguments he had made to the Commission. In a judgment dated September 12, 2017, the trial court affirmed the Commission's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Hassey now appeals the September 12, 2017 judgment to this court, and he assigns the following errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   1. The Trial Court erred in finding Appellant's exclusive remedy was to file a grievance pursuant to the grievance Section 17.9 of the CBA by the procedure set forth in Article 12 of the CBA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   2. The Trial Court erred in finding Appellant's conduct was not comparable with four other police officers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   3. The Trial Court failed to find that the Appellant was treated unequally, and thus denied Appellant Constitutional Equal Protection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   4. The Court erred when it found it was without jurisdiction to provide Appellant with a remedy because Appellant's sole remedy was under Section 17.9 of the CBA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Hassey appealed the Commission's decision affirming the termination of\n   his employment to the trial court pursuant to R.C. 2506.01. In such an appeal, the trial court must determine whether the appealed order \"is unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the whole record.\" R.C. 2506.04. The trial court may then \"affirm, reverse, vacate, or modify the order * * * or remand the cause\" to the Commission \"with instructions to enter an order * * * consistent with the findings or opinion\" of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The court of appeals' standard of review under R.C. 2506.04 is more limited than the standard the trial court applies.\n   <em>\n    Independence v.

It permits reversal only when the common pleas court errs in its application or interpretation of the law or its decision is unsupported by a preponderance of the evidence as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Cleveland Clinic Found.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 19} We will address Hassey's first and fourth assignments of error together as they raise the same error. By his first and fourth assignments of error, Hassey argues that the trial court erred in concluding that it did not have jurisdiction to apply Section 17.9 of the CBA to Hassey. We agree that the trial court erred in its analysis of the jurisdictional issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The trial court exercised jurisdiction over this appeal under R.C. 2506.01(A), which authorizes courts of common pleas to review \"every final order, adjudication, or decision of any officer, tribunal, authority, board, bureau, commission, department, or other division of any political subdivision of the state.\" This appeal came to the trial court after the Commission affirmed the director of public safety's decision to terminate Hassey's employment. The Commission reviewed Hassey's discharge pursuant to Sections 109 and 149-1 of the Columbus City Charter, which confer jurisdiction on the Commission to hear appeals from police officers who are terminated from employment with the Division.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Columbus City Charter, Section 109 (\"Any person in the division of police * * * under the exclusive control of the chief thereof, who is suspended, reduced in rank or dismissed from the department by the director of public safety may appeal from the decision of such officer to the civil service commission * * *.\"); Columbus City Charter, Section 149-1 (\"Except as otherwise provided in this charter any employee of the City of Columbus in the classified service, who is suspended, reduced in rank or compensation or discharged * * * may appeal from such decision or order therefor, to the civil service commission * * *.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Based on Sections 109 and 149-1 of the Columbus City Charter and R.C. 2506.01(A), it would seem that the Commission and trial court properly exercised jurisdiction over Hassey's appeal. However, R.C. Chapter 4117, the Public Employees' Collective Bargaining Act, complicates the jurisdictional question. The provisions of R.C. Chapter 4117 prevail over home-rule charters.\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati v. Ohio Council 8, Am. Fedn. of State, Cty. &amp; Mun. Emps., AFL-CIO\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1708839\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/61/658/#p662\">\n    61 Ohio St.3d 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 662,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=576%20N.E.2d%20745\">\n    576 N.E.2d 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). Therefore, where a city employee is subject to a collective bargaining agreement, R.C. Chapter 4117-and specifically R.C. 4117.10(A) -tempers the\n   employee's ability to appeal a discharge under the Columbus City Charter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 22} According to R.C. 4117.10(A), a collective bargaining agreement between a public employer and a bargaining unit \"governs the wages, hours, and terms and conditions of public employment covered by the agreement.\" Moreover, R.C. 4117.10(A) states that \"[i]f the agreement provides for a final and binding arbitration of grievances, public employers, employees, and employee organizations are subject solely to that grievance procedure.\" Therefore, pursuant to R.C. 4117.10(A), a collective bargaining agreement controls all matters related to the terms and conditions of employment.\n   <em>\n    Fischer v.

(Hassey Ex. 1 at Section 10.1.) The CBA also incorporates a grievance procedure that concludes with final and binding arbitration. (City Ex. 1 at Section 12.5(E)(3), Brief of Appellee, City of Columbus, Department of Public Safety, Division of Police on the Applicability of Section 17.9 of the CBA). If we confined our review to those two contractual provisions, we would conclude that Hassey could only contest his discharge through the grievance procedure, and neither the Commission nor the trial court had jurisdiction to consider Hassey's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 25} However, the CBA also states that \"[n]othing in this Grievance Procedure shall deny members any rights available at law to achieve redress of their legal rights, including the right to appeal to another forum.\" (City Ex. 1 at Section 12.3, Brief of Appellee, City of Columbus, Department of Public Safety, Division of Police on the Applicability of Section 17.9 of the CBA). As we explained above, Sections 109 and 149-1 of the Columbus City Charter give police officers the right to appeal certain employment decisions, including discharge, to the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Consequently, in Section 12.3, the CBA permits a member to pursue an appeal of the termination of his employment under Sections 109 and 149-1 of the Columbus City Charter, despite the existence of final and binding arbitration. The CBA thus contravenes the part of R.C. 4117.10(A) that limits redress of employment decisions to the grievance procedure if that procedure includes final and binding arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 26} The question then arises, \"Can a term in a collective bargaining agreement override the law?\" For the most part, the answer is \"yes.\" R.C. 4117.10(A), which restricts the remedies available for contesting employment decisions, also sets out the relationship between provisions of a collective bargaining agreement and state or local laws.\n   <em>\n    Streetsboro Edn.

The officer then appealed to the court of common pleas. The police officer argued that the city could not discipline him because it had violated the collective bargaining agreement when it failed to institute disciplinary proceedings against him within the time period specified in the agreement. The trial court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the timing provision in the collective bargaining agreement, and it affirmed the civil service commission's decision. On appeal, the court of appeals held that, where an employee pursues an administrative appeal instead of a grievance, \" R.C. 4117.10(A) d[oes] not prohibit [a civil service commission's] jurisdiction to interpret the labor contract in the context of the disciplinary action under consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Civil Serv.

Thus, by its plain language, Section 17.9 only restricts the city's disciplinary options to a 24-hour or shorter suspension when a police officer tests positive for a prohibited substance for the first time. Hassey did not test positive; he instead admitted to long-term marijuana use. Section 17.9, therefore, does not apply to Hassey and he is not entitled to its protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Indeed, on appeal, Hassey concedes that he has no remedy under Section 17.9 because he never tested positive.

In his trial court briefing, Hassey advocated the more extreme position that he was \"entitled to the protection of the CBA at Section 17.9,\" and the trial court had an obligation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   to identify with clarity that Columbus [p]olice officers who make admissions to first[-]time use of [prohibited] substances * * * and who otherwise meet the criteria of Section 17.9 need not have undergone testing to be afforded the protection and treatment intended by that section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   (June 8, 2015 Brief of Appellant at 62, 63.) Under the plain language of Section 17.9, that argument fails. Accordingly, we sustain Hassey's first and fourth assignments of error, but we conclude that our ruling on those assignments does not justify reversal of the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 38} By Hassey's second assignment of error, he argues that the trial court erred in finding his misconduct distinguishable from the misconduct of four other officers. Hassey contends that, given the similarity of the misconduct at issue, discharge was too harsh a punishment when compared to the lesser discipline received by the four other officers. We agree with the trial court that the significant differences between Hassey's and the other officers' misconduct preclude any comparison between the discipline meted out to the other officers and the discipline Hassey received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Before the Commission, Hassey presented evidence regarding four other officers: Nicole Prysock, Ralph Taylor, Andrew Radich, and Joshua Wagner. Prysock was disciplined with a 160-hour suspension because she returned to a high school student a substance believed to be marijuana that she had seized earlier in the day. Taylor received a 64-hour suspension for purchasing and smoking marijuana while off duty. Radich was disciplined with a 56-hour suspension for driving under the influence of alcohol with a loaded handgun in his automobile. The chief of police recommended that Wagner receive a 120-hour suspension for driving under the influence of alcohol with a loaded handgun in his automobile. Wagner, however, retired before the imposition of that discipline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 40} After reviewing each of the four officers' misconduct, the trial court concluded that none of the four officers engaged in misconduct similar to Hassey's misconduct. We agree. As the trial court pointed out, each officer violated the Rules of Conduct on one occasion. No evidence established that any of the officers repeatedly violated the Rules of Conduct over a course of years like Hassey. Even\n   more fundamentally, none of the officers did anything like what Hassey did, i.e., none used an illegal substance for years and shared that illegal substance with another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 41} On appeal, Hassey argues that, in many respects, his misconduct is less serious than that engaged in by the four other officers. However, this argument only emphasizes the difference between the officers and Hassey and, thus, actually refutes the assertion in the assignment of error that Hassey's misconduct is comparable to the misconduct of the other officers. Hassey also argues that, like him, the other officers exposed the Division to potential negative publicity. While this is true, it does not make the nature of the officers' misconduct the same as Hassey's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 42} In sum, we reject Hassey's contention that the trial court erred when it concluded that Hassey was not treated differently from other, similarly situated officers. Accordingly, we overrule Hassey's second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 43} By Hassey's third assignment of error, he argues that the termination of his employment violated his equal protection rights because he was disciplined more harshly than police officers disciplined pursuant to Section 17.9 of the CBA. Hassey bases this alleged equal protection violation on the \"class-of-one\" theory. Under that theory, a person may establish an equal protection violation when the state intentionally treats the person differently than those similarly situated without a rational basis for the difference in treatment.\n   <em>\n    Engquist v.
