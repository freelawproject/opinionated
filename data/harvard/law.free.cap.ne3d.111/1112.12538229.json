L. c. 209A. The plaintiff, P.P., obtained a fourteen-day ex parte order on June 6, 2017. Following an evidentiary hearing, a judge in the District Court extended the order for one year. S.P. appeals from that order claiming, inter alia, that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that P.P. possessed a legitimate fear of imminent serious physical harm. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . P.P. and S.P. were married with one child when the relationship finally and fully disintegrated in 2017. While S.P. was away at annual National Guard training, P.P. moved out of the marital home with their three year old son and obtained a \"stay away\" order. The affidavit filed in support of the temporary order alleges that S.P. sometimes carries a firearm and verbally abuses P.P. While seeking the extension that is the subject of this appeal, P.P. testified that S.P. once threw eggs at her and nearly hit her with a child's car seat, and is experienced with and in possession of firearms. The judge determined that P.P.'s characterization of the relationship and demeanor at the hearing, coupled with S.P.'s alleged access to firearms, participation in the military, and alleged violation of the initial order, warranted extension of the original order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . We review the extension of an abuse prevention order for an abuse of discretion or error of law.\n   <em>\n    Crenshaw\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Macklin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1157413\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/430/633/#p636\">\n    430 Mass. 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 636 (2000). An appellate court will only set aside the extension if, after reviewing all of the evidence, it \"is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hartigan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275178\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/464/400/#p414\">\n    464 Mass. 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414 (2013), quoting\n   <em>\n    New England Canteen Serv., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ashley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4030359\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/372/671/#p675\">\n    372 Mass. 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 675 (1977). An applicant for an abuse prevention order must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that an order, or the extension of an order, is necessary to prevent the types of abuse described in c. 209A.

L. c. 209A, \u00a7 1. A fear of imminent serious physical harm requires more than \"[g]eneralized apprehension, nervousness, [or] feeling aggravated or hassled.\"\n   <em>\n    Wooldridge\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hickey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1707082\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/45/637/#p639\">\n    45 Mass. App. Ct. 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 639 (1998). The fear must be reasonable and the threat imminent.

Although credibility determinations are rarely disturbed, a likelihood of the types of abuse defined in c. 209A must be proved by the applicant before an abuse prevention order may be issued or extended.

She testified that she is afraid of S.P. because of \"his knowledge\" of firearms, specifically because he was trained in the military and \"is far more comprehensive in his knowledge of firearms than I am.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ownership of firearms and experience with weapons as a member of the military, however, are not reasons to issue an abuse prevention order when that experience and capacity is not coupled with actual or implicit threats.

Although P.P. testified to past instances of hostility, those instances do not amount to a pattern of abuse or imminent threat sufficient for the extension of a c. 209A order. S.P. threw eggs at P.P. approximately five years before the order was sought, and more recently was demeaning and almost hit her with a child's car seat while transferring it from his truck to her vehicle.

Even crediting P.P.'s affidavit and testimony in their entirety, P.P.'s fear was \"subjective and unspecified\" and insufficient to justify the extension of the original ex parte order.\n   <em>\n    Carroll\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"626934\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/56/83/#p86\">\n    56 Mass.
