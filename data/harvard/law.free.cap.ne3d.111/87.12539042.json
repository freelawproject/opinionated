Rinker and her family sought a temporary care provider for Mrs. Rinker while Mrs. Rinker's usual caretaker was unavailable. It was decided that Mrs. Rinker should stay at The Landing of Canton for a short-term period from July 8, 2010 to July 15, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Defendant-Appellee The Landing of Canton is a licensed residential care facility which provides assisted living, memory care, and respite/short-term stay care. Defendant-Appellee Emeritus of Canton operates The Landing of Canton. For ease of discussion, The Landing of Canton and Emeritus of Canton will be referred to as \"Emeritus.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On July 8, 2010, Mrs. Rinker and a family member signed a Respite/Short Term Stay Addendum to Resident Agreement with Emeritus. The Respite/Short Term Stay Addendum stated in Paragraph 4, \"[p]rovided that we agree and have space available at the Community, you may extend this Respite Period by executing a new Respite Addendum or you may convert to a regular residency by executing a standard Resident Agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The same day, at the request of Emeritus, Mrs. Rinker's personal physician, Dr. Thomas, completed a health assessment of Mrs. Rinker. The health assessment form asked for Mrs. Rinker's health history and physical. As to \"Ambulatory Status,\" Dr. Thomas wrote in \"re-evaluate.\" Dr. Thomas checked the box for \"Assist with transfer: One person.\" The health assessment form also asked for the \"Type of Care or Services Resident Requires.\" Dr. Thomas wrote in \"Nursing Home\" for \"Type.\" He also wrote, \"Duration: Indefinite.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Mrs. Rinker's original respite stay agreement terminated on July 15, 2010, but Mrs. Rinker's family determined they needed more time. On July 14, 2010, Plaintiff-Appellant Wanda L. McFarren signed a Resident Agreement with Emeritus to convert Mrs. Rinker's short-term stay to a regular residency. Mrs. Rinker's term of residency was month-to-month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On July 15, 2010 at approximately 6:40 p.m., a Resident Assistant found Mrs. Rinker in her room, lying on the floor beside her bed. The Resident Assistant notified Shawn Meek, the LPN on duty. A portable x-ray company was called and it was determined at 11:45 p.m. that Mrs. Rinker fractured her left hip. Mrs. Rinker was transported to Mercy Medical Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Mrs. Rinker stayed at Mercy Medical Center until July 21, 2010. She was\n   then transferred to the Canton Regency. That evening, Mrs. Rinker passed away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The death certificate certified by the Stark County Coroner stated the immediate cause of death was complications of a left hip fracture. The coroner listed the condition leading to the immediate cause of death as, \"Fall.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On July 13, 2012, Plaintiff-Appellant Wanda L. McFarren, Individually and as Administratrix for the Estate of Angeline B. Rinker, Deceased, filed a complaint in the Stark County Court of Common Pleas. In the complaint, she named Emeritus of Canton, Emeritus Corporation, The Landing of Canton, and others who are no longer parties to this matter, as defendants. McFarren filed an amended complaint on March 10, 2014 asserting six causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In Count One, McFarren set forth a claim for negligence. McFarren alleged the defendants were negligent in admitting and retaining Mrs. Rinker as a resident based upon the argument that Mrs. Rinker required a higher level of care than the defendants could provide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In Count Two, McFarren claimed the defendants violated the Ohio Patients' Bill of Rights under R.C. 3721.13(A)(30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In Counts Three and Four, McFarren argued the defendants breached the terms of the Resident Agreement and the Care Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In Count Five, McFarren claimed the defendants caused the wrongful death of Mrs. Rinker by their failure to meet the standard of care in failing to properly supervise, attend, and assist Mrs. Rinker and failing to implement fall risk interventions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In Count Six, McFarren set forth a claim for punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On October 27, 2014, Appellees Emeritus filed a motion for summary judgment. On the same date, McFarren filed a motion for summary judgment as to cause of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On March 3, 2015, the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment of Emeritus. The court further determined the claims raised by McFarren were medical claims, and therefore time-barred by the one-year statute of limitations under R.C. 2305.113. As to McFarren's wrongful death claim, the trial court found that McFarren failed to establish through expert testimony that there were genuine issues of material fact demonstrating Emeritus deviated from the standard of care and that deviation proximately caused Mrs. Rinker's fall on July 15, 2010. The court thus further found an issue challenging the cause of Mrs. Rinker's death as set forth on the certificate certified by the Stark County Coroner was moot. Finally, the trial court also denied McFarren's claim for punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 19} McFarren appealed to this court raising five assignments of error, specifically: 1) that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to causation because McFarren had introduced evidence to demonstrate Emeritus breached the standard of care; 2) McFarren's claims of negligence, violation of Ohio's Patient Bill of Rights, and breach of contract for personal injury were not medical claims when the negligence actors did not provide any professional skill; 3) The trial court erred in grating summary judgment on punitive damages claim when the evidence demonstrated Emeritus had knowledge Mrs. Rinker required a higher level of care than Emeritus could provide, and despite that knowledge admitted and retained Mrs. Rinker; 4) The trial court erred in finding an affidavit executed by Mrs. Rinker's grandson was hearsay because it rebutted testimony of Emeritus employees and Emeritus's expert's testimony; and 5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   McFarren's motion for summary judgment on causation should have been granted as there is no genuine dispute that Mrs. Rinker's fall caused her death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 20} We affirmed in part, and reversed and remanded in part. Specifically, we found McFarren's breach of contract claims were not medical claims, and therefore were not brought outside the statute of limitations as previously found by the trial court. We thus remanded the breach of contract claims, counts three and four of McFarren's first amended complaint, for consideration on the merits. We further remanded the matter of cause of death for the trial court's decision. We found McFarren's remaining arguments without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 21} McFarren attempted an appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio. On October 26, 2016, the Court declined jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    State v. McFarren\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=147%20Ohio%20St.%203d%201413\">\n    147 Ohio St.3d 1413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-7455\">\n    2016-Ohio-7455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20N.E.3d%20185\">\n    62 N.E.3d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 22} On remand, Emeritus filed a motion for summary judgment as to the remaining contract claims and McFarren filed a brief in opposition. After considering McFarren's breach of contract complaint on the merits, the trial court found McFarren had failed to produce any evidence to show Emeritus had violated any terms of the Resident Agreement or the Care Agreement. On the issue of the cause of Mrs. Rinker's death, the trial court found no evidence had been presented to rebut the presumption contained in the Coroner's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 23} McFarren subsequently filed this appeal, raising three assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 24} \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON MCFARREN'S BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIMS WHERE THIS COURT PREVIOUSLY REMANDED MCFARREN'S BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIMS TO THE TRIAL COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS DESPITE THIS COURT'S RULINGS WITH RESPECT TO MCFARREN'S NEGLIGENCE AND WRONGFUL DEATH CLAIMS PREMISED ON THE SAME UNDERLYING FACTS.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 25} \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON MCFARREN'S BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIMS WHERE THE TRIAL COURT APPLIED THE STANDARD FOR BREACH UNDER COMMON LAW NEGLIGENCE RATHER THAN THE STANDARDS SET FORTH IN THE CONTRACT, FAILED TO CONSIDER RELEVANT LANGUAGE AND PROVISIONS IN THE CONTRACT, EXCUSED EMERITUS' BREACH DUE TO ITS ALLEGED ALTRUISTIC MOTIVE, AND BLAMED MRS.

McFarren's argument is based on a misreading of\n   <em>\n    McFarren\n   </em>\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 28} In\n   <em>\n    McFarren\n   </em>\n   I, the trial court had not addressed McFarren's breach of contract claims at all because it found them to be medical claims which were raised outside the statute of limitations. We reversed, finding the claims were not medical claims and remanded for further proceedings based on that opinion.\n   <em>\n    McFarren v. Canton\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist.

The trial court proceeded properly on remand by considering the breach of contract claims on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   II, III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 30} In her second and third assignments of error, McFarren argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Emeritus on her breach of contract claims. Specifically McFarren argues that on remand, the trial court applied the wrong standard in evaluating her breach of contract claims, failed to consider relevant language and provisions in the contract, excused Emeritus' breach for alleged altruistic motive, and blamed Mrs. Rinker's family for executing the agreement to readmit her. Additionally, McFarren argues the trial court improperly applied our findings in\n   <em>\n    McFarren\n   </em>\n   I, with regard to the standard of care for negligence, to McFarren's breach of contract claims. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Summary Judgment motions are to be resolved in light of the dictates of Civ.R. 56.

The Evaluation is titled, \"Emeritus Resident Baseline &amp; Data Set.\" Based on the Emeritus Resident Baseline &amp; Data Set, Emeritus ranks the resident's needs by different levels of care. The Resident Evaluation of Mrs. Rinker was completed by Emeritus on July 9, 2010. Relevant to this appeal, the Emeritus Resident Baseline &amp; Data Set describes Mrs. Rinker's level of care:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   1c.

McFarren interprets the two-word recommendation of \"nursing home\" to mean that Emeritus was an inappropriate placement for Mrs. Rinker, and argues Emeritus' decision to admit, and then readmit Mrs. Rinker against Dr. Thomas's recommendation for a higher level of care was a breach of the Resident Agreement and the direct and proximate cause of her fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 41} In\n   <em>\n    McFarren\n   </em>\n   I at \u00b6 59-61 we addressed this argument as it pertained to the duty of care for McFarren's negligence claim and found the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   McFarren argues that Emeritus breached the standard of care when it admitted and retained Mrs. Rinker against the direction of Mrs. Rinker's personal physician, Dr. Thomas. On July 8, 2010, Mrs. Rinker's personal physician, Dr. Thomas, completed a health assessment of Mrs. Rinker. The health assessment was done at the request of Emeritus.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   The health assessment form asked for Mrs. Rinker's health history and physical. As to \"Ambulatory Status,\" Dr. Thomas wrote in \"re-evaluate.\" Dr. Thomas checked the box for \"Assist with transfer: One person.\" The health assessment form also asked for the \"Type of Care or Services Resident Requires.\" Dr. Thomas wrote in \"Nursing Home\" for \"Type.\" He also wrote, \"Duration: Indefinite.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   McFarren argues Dr. Thomas stated that Mrs. Rinker should be placed in a nursing home for the type of care or services the resident required. Emeritus knew this, but admitted and retained Mrs. Rinker. The evidence in this case is that it was the decision of Mrs. Rinker and her family to reside at Emeritus. There is no Civ.R. 56 evidence that Mrs. Rinker or her family consulted with Dr. Thomas before her admission or after her admission. Further, McFarren did not provide the deposition or affidavit of Dr. Thomas to discern what he meant by \"nursing home.\" The term \"nursing home\" has a statutory definition, but it can be generally used to describe different levels of care. Emeritus is a residential facility that provides assisted living. An assisted living facility is not the same as a skilled nursing facility. A memory care unit is not the same as an assisted living facility or a skilled nursing facility. McFarren heavily relies upon the \"nursing home\" statement by Dr. Thomas on the health assessment form, but without a deposition or affidavit from Dr. Thomas as to his statement as to the level of care he felt Mrs. Rinker needed, [McFarren's] expert's interpretation of Dr. Thomas's statement is pure speculation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 42} In rejecting McFarren's negligence argument, we found reasonable minds could conclude there was no breach of the standard of care to admit and retain Mrs. Rinker at Emeritus based on the assessment of Dr. Thomas.\n   <em>\n    McFarren\n   </em>\n   I \u00b6 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Likewise here, on the same record, we cannot say, absent an affidavit or deposition from Dr. Thomas, that this two-word assessment was a prescription for a\n   higher level of care. Contrary to McFarren's argument, Dr. Thomas' assessment did not unequivocally determine Mrs. Rinker's needs could not be met at Emeritus as there is no evidence on this record as to what the doctor meant by term \"nursing home.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Further, there is evidence on the record that Emeritus was capable of meeting Mrs. Rinker's needs and that a skilled nursing facility, or \"nursing home\" was not necessary to meet Mrs. Rinker's needs. Vomacka deposition December 17, 2012, 150, Fifield deposition, January 22, 2013 38-39. But even if Mrs. Rinker had required skilled nursing, as the trial court found, in Ohio, a residential care facility may admit or retain individuals who require skilled nursing care for up to 120 days. O.A.C 3701-17-59.1\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a residential care facility may admit or retain individuals who require skilled nursing care beyond the supervision of special diets, application of dressings, or administration of medication, only if the care will be provided on a part-time, intermittent basis for not more than a total of one hundred twenty days in any twelve-month period. In accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, the director of health shall adopt rules specifying what constitutes the need for skilled nursing care on a part-time, intermittent basis. The director shall adopt rules that are consistent with rules pertaining to home health care adopted by the medicaid director for the medicaid program. Skilled nursing care provided pursuant to this division may be provided by a home health agency certified for participation in the medicare program, a hospice care program licensed under Chapter 3712. of the Revised Code, or a member of the staff of a residential care facility who is qualified to perform skilled nursing care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Mrs. Rinker was a resident of Emeritus for less than 120 days. She resided there first as a respite care case when her usual caretaker was unavailable, and then was readmitted when her family needed more time.\n   <em>\n    McFarren\n   </em>\n   I, \u00b6 61, Vomacka deposition, December 17, 2012, 67-68, 120, 152-153, 171-172, Fifield deposition, January 22, 2013, 46-47, Willis deposition December 21, 2012, 53. Mrs. Rinker's placement and retention thus met \"applicable legal requirements.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Further, the Transfer to More Appropriate Care provision does not indicate that a transfer hinges upon a physician's recommendation, nor that Emeritus is required to share a physician's recommendation with the family. Rather, it indicates this is a determination made after \"consultation with you, your family\n   <em>\n    and/or\n   </em>\n   your physician.\" [Emphasis added.] Nothing in this section, or any other section of the contract indicates Emeritus was obligated to transfer Mrs. Rinker based on Dr. Thomas's assessment alone. Even if Emeritus \"should\" have shared this information with Mrs. Rinker's family as McFarren argues, it was not contractually bound to do so. The evidence in the record is that placement is ultimately the decision of the family. Rinker's family did not want to place her in a \"nursing home,\" and it was the decision of Mrs. Rinker's family that she reside at Emeritus. Vomacka deposition, December 17, 2012, 120.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 47} As for McFarren's allegation that Emeritus breached the Care Agreement, as noted by the trial court, McFarren produced no evidence to show Emeritus failed\n   to provide any services it promised to deliver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Next, although McFarren argues here that the trial court improperly excused Emeritus' conduct based on altruistic motive, i.e., \"to help Mrs. Rinker's family,\" it appears McFarren acknowledged that Mrs. Rinker's readmission was indeed to help the family as they needed more time. Plaintiff's Opposition Brief, November 13, 2014, at 1, incorporated to the Opposition Brief filed March 13, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Although McFarren strenuously argues that other sections of the Resident Agreement indicate Emeritus had a contractual obligation to regularly and accurately evaluate Mrs. Rinker to determine if her needs could be met at the facility, and did not do so, the record indicates otherwise. The resident agreement gives no indication whatsoever as to what intervals reevaluations should occur. Depositions however, indicate that evaluations take place upon admission, and then once a month thereafter. Vomacka deposition, December 17, 2012 at 134, Fifield deposition, January 22, 2013 at 105. Mrs. Rinker was a resident at Emeritus for only 7 days and was evaluated upon admission. Meek deposition, November 29, 2012, 31-50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Even if McFarren had demonstrated a breach of either the Resident Agreement or the Care agreement, she still has failed to establish a nexus between any breach and Mrs. Rinker's fall. As we found in\n   <em>\n    McFarren\n   </em>\n   I at \u00b6 82 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   * * *There is no evidence in the record to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to how Mrs. Rinker fell. The Civ.R. 56 evidence shows that no one on staff at Emeritus recalls Mrs. Rinker in her room before the fall. There is no evidence whether Mrs. Rinker was in her bed or in her wheelchair before she was discovered on the floor of her room at 6:40 p.m. There is no Civ.R. 56 evidence whether Mrs. Rinker wore an emergency pendant to alert someone if she fell or even if she was wearing the pendant, or that Mrs. Rinker knew to use the device. McFarren's expert opines different fall preventions that Emeritus should have had in place to prevent Mrs. Rinker's fall, but in this case, there is no knowledge as to how Mrs. Rinker fell. As the trial court determined, it is speculation on part of McFarren's expert to state that if Emeritus had more precautions been in place, Mrs. Rinker would not have fallen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 51} The evidence here remains the same. We therefore find McFarren has not provided Civ.R. 56 evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact to show Emeritus breached any portion of the Resident Agreement or the Care Agreement, nor a nexus between any breach and injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Finally, McFarren also argues the trial court failed to consider the Resident Agreement as a whole, analyzing only those provisions set forth in McFarren's First Amended Complaint. Although the trial court did not specifically discuss the additional contract provisions raised in McFarren's response to Emeritus' Motion for Summary Judgement, it did find no breach as set forth in counts three and four of McFarren's First Amended Complaint which pled breach of specific \"and other provisions\" of the contract. We cannot say, therefore that the trial court failed to consider the entire contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 53} The second and third assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 54} The judgment of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Wise, John, P.J., and Baldwin, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Repealed March 1, 2018.
