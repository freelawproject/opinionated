L. c. 265, \u00a7 23. On appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court held that defense counsel should have been allowed to review records of the psychologist who treated the victim.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Labroad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223812,4223799\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/466/1037/\">\n    466 Mass. 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1039-1040 (2014). After reviewing those records, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial based on one statement in a progress note. After an evidentiary hearing at which the psychologist testified, a Superior Court judge denied the motion. Concluding that the progress note does not cast real doubt on the justice of the conviction because it is inadmissible hearsay, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Standard of review\n   </em>\n   . \"[W]e review the denial of a motion for a new trial for 'a significant error of law or other abuse of discretion.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Duart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451933\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/630/#p634\">\n    477 Mass. 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 634 (2017), quoting\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Forte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308988\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/469/469/#p488\">\n    469 Mass. 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 488 (2014).

The motion judge, who was also the trial judge, correctly determined that the progress note does not qualify as a prior inconsistent statement because the statement in it is not attributable to the victim.

If the defendant is unable \"to show with sufficient certainty that the words ... were reflective of a statement to that effect by the victim as contrasted with a conclusion by the\" medical professional, the statement is not admissible as a prior inconsistent statement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3996337\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/25/983/#p984\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3996337\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/25/983/#p984\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Here, the record supports the motion judge's finding that the statement at issue is a conclusion of the psychologist. The relevant portion of the progress note reads, \"I also made this offer for [the victim's] friend ..., who is feeling stressed herself by this and her role as the only person who knew shortly after the abuse occurred.\" This statement details the psychologist's offer to counsel the victim's friend. In explaining this notation, the psychologist testified that the time frame, \"shortly after,\" was his \"best professional estimate\" or his \"surmise.\" The motion judge was entitled to credit this testimony and find that the progress note reflected the psychologist's belief and was not a statement by the victim.

The statement at issue, documenting the psychologist's offer to counsel the victim's friend, has no apparent relationship to the victim's medical treatment or history at all. Moreover, the defendant seeks to admit the statement only to contradict the victim's testimony that she told her friend about the abuse years later, not \"shortly after\" the abuse occurred. The defendant has not shown that he intends to use the progress note to show the psychologist's diagnosis, prognosis, or opinion as to the cause of any condition diagnosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \" Section 79G, like \u00a7 79, is intended to relieve physicians, nurses, dentists, and the other listed professionals of the hardship of attending court as witnesses, depriving patients of their care, where they are unlikely to remember specific patient interactions and their testimony 'would ordinarily add little or nothing to the information furnished by the record alone.' \"\n   <em>\n    Palacios\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461256\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/90/722/#p724\">\n    90 Mass.
