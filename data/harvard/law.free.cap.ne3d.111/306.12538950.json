L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ), and being an armed career criminal, in violation of the armed career criminal act (ACCA), G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G (\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   ). The defendant was convicted of the firearms charge in 2009, and a second jury found the defendant guilty of the subsequent offender allegations in 2011. Pursuant to the ACCA, the defendant was sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of not less than fifteen years and not more than fifteen years and one day. In an earlier appeal, we affirmed his convictions and orders denying several posttrial motions. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ahart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201114\">\n    88 Mass.

He contends that two of the three predicate convictions that render him an armed career criminal under \u00a7 10G (\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   ) were not \"the results of separate, sequential prosecutions\" as the ACCA requirement has been interpreted by\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Resende\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173471\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/474/455/#p469\">\n    474 Mass. 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 469 (2016).

The defendant's three predicate offenses are as follows. (1) In April, 2002, the defendant was convicted of assault by means of a dangerous weapon. He was placed on straight probation, but his probation was revoked, and he served an eight-month period of incarceration. That sentence was later converted to a term of straight probation, and he was released. However, on May 16, 2003, the defendant was arraigned on a charge of distributing a class B substance. On the same day he was detained for violating his probation on the 2002 offense. Five days later, on May 21, 2003, he stipulated to a violation of probation, his probation was revoked, and he was sentenced to eighteen months in the house of correction, less time served. (2) The defendant was convicted of the drug offense in June, 2003. He was sentenced to two years' confinement with ten months to serve, concurrent with the 2002 conviction. (3) In July, 2004, the defendant was convicted of assault by means of a dangerous weapon. He was sentenced to six months in the house of correction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The defendant contends that the first and second convictions were not the product of \"legally separate and sequential prosecutions,\" since he ultimately was reprobated and received a term of straight probation for the 2002 conviction. The defendant further maintains that he was not sentenced to a term of incarceration until he violated his probation when charged with the 2003 offense, that the 2002 and 2003 offenses therefore are not sequential, and that the offenses were not separate or sequential because his jail sentences ran concurrently with one another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The ACCA states as follows in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"Whoever, having been previously convicted of three violent crimes or three serious drug offenses, or any combination thereof totaling three,\n   <em>\n    arising from separate incidences\n   </em>\n   , ... shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not less than 15 years nor more than 20 years\" (emphasis supplied).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   G.

In\n   <em>\n    Resende\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was convicted of five counts of drug distribution resulting from hand-to-hand transactions that took place on five different days within a seventeen-day period.\n   <em>\n    Resende\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 456.

In\n   <em>\n    Widener\n   </em>\n   , this court held that the defendant's convictions did not result from \"sequential prosecutions\" because the guilty pleas and sentences imposed for separate crimes occurred at a single hearing and the defendant committed the criminal conduct for both predicate offenses before he pleaded guilty to either.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20696\">\n    91 Mass.
