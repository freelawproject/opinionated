He contends (1) that the judge abused her discretion by denying his request for a continuance of the trial, (2) that several of the judge's factual findings are clearly erroneous, undermining her ultimate termination decision, and (3) that the judge abused her discretion by terminating the father's parental rights and ordering only two visits per year.

The Department of Children and Families (DCF) initiated care and protection proceedings on June 3, 2015, upon the father's arrest on charges of violence against a household member, his father (paternal grandfather). The father was arraigned on another set of charges and held until June 27, 2015, when he was given a suspended two-year sentence and a term of probation. Within a few months he violated the terms of probation and was imprisoned; he remained incarcerated until February, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The same judge presided over this case from its inception. She originally scheduled trial for January 11, 2017. On that date the father requested a continuance until April or May, after his release from prison, to give him time to \"set himself in a situation where he can take care of [Bedelia].\" DCF did not object, but counsel for the child pressed for an earlier date, arguing that \"the child needs resolution, legal resolution. She's been in legal limbo for two years.\" The judge continued the trial to March 23, 2017. On that date, with the father present, the judge allowed the parties' joint request for a continuance until April 25, 2017, with \"[n]o further continuances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The father was not present when trial commenced on April 25, 2017. The father's counsel submitted exhibits and called his first witness, clinical psychologist Dante Spetter. After DCF put on its two witnesses and the judge denied the father's motion for a directed verdict, the father's counsel expressed his desire to call the father as a witness. Because the father was not present and counsel could not explain his absence, counsel asked for a further continuance. The judge denied the motion, noting that the father was present in court when she set the trial date and stated there would be no further continuances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \"The decision on whether to continue any judicial proceeding is a matter entrusted to the sound discretion of the judge, and the judge's decision will be upheld absent an abuse of that discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Gillian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1582871\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/63/398/#p409\">\n    63 Mass.

The father argues that four of the judge's subsidiary findings were clearly erroneous, undermining her ultimate conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before terminating parental rights, the judge must \"make specific and detailed findings, demonstrating that close attention has been given to the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Gregory\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1080014\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/434/117/#p126\">\n    434 Mass. 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 126 (2001). The judge's subsidiary findings of fact must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence and will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1080014\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/434/117/#p126\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A subsidiary finding is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence to support it, or when, \"although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"\n   <em>\n    Custody of Eleanor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3903850\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/414/795/#p799\">\n    414 Mass. 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 799 (1993), quoting\n   <em>\n    Building Inspector of Lancaster\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sanderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4030383\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/372/157/#p160\">\n    372 Mass. 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 160 (1977).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Housing instability\n   </em>\n   . The facts showed clearly and convincingly that the father was unable to provide stable housing for Bedelia. He removed her from Florida to the paternal grandfather's home in East Boston to shelter her from the mother's violence and other issues, yet he soon allowed the mother to move in with them, against the paternal grandfather's wishes, resulting in a chaotic household. The mother's arrival led to a domestic violence incident between the father and the paternal grandfather. The father's consequent arrest left the child and the mother homeless. After this incident, the father stayed with friends in Lynn and Salem until his imprisonment. Upon his release he went back to live with the paternal grandfather. He cancelled an attempted home visit by DCF on March 21, 2017, because he had to work -- yet on that same day he quit the job he had held for only two weeks. Three days before trial he claimed to have obtained housing in Melrose, a fact that DCF could not verify, largely because the father did not respond to the social worker's attempts to contact him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The father argues that the judge erred by finding that he \"refused\" to schedule a home visit. While describing the father's lack of diligence in scheduling home visits as a \"refusal\" may be an overstatement, the facts, combined with the father's inability to secure employment or income, clearly and convincingly demonstrate the father's inability to provide a stable home for the child, or even for himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Substance abuse\n   </em>\n   . The father's substance abuse problems, and his inconsistent and unsuccessful attempts to comply with treatment programs, are well documented. The father claims that the judge's findings in this regard are undermined by her erroneous conclusion that he had a \"history of rescinding releases,\" where the record demonstrates only one such rescission. However, the record also shows that he failed to provide documentation of his completion of Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous programs, with no explanation for his failure to do so, and that the social worker who was assigned to the father since his release from prison was denied information about his treatment at the Medicated Assisted Pathway program because her name was not on the release form. The record supports the judge's determination that the father's substance abuse was a serious shortcoming that repeatedly put the child's welfare at risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Domestic violence\n   </em>\n   . The record supports the judge's finding that the relationship between the father and the mother was \"permeated with domestic violence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   An incident of the mother slapping the father in the face prompted him to relocate to Massachusetts with the child, yet he soon allowed the mother to move in with them. This, in turn, led to another instance of domestic violence, between the father and the paternal grandfather. The child witnessed both of these incidents. The facts support the judge's determination that domestic violence was a factor in the parents' relationship, and that the father has not adequately endeavored to address it. See\n   <em>\n    Custody of Vaughn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"890226\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/422/590/#p595\">\n    422 Mass. 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 595 (1996) (\"[P]hysical force within the family is both intolerable and too readily tolerated, and ... a child who has been either the victim or the spectator of such abuse suffers a distinctly grievous kind of harm\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    Missed visit\n   </em>\n   . Finally, the father takes issue with the judge's characterization of his visits with Bedelia as \"inconsistent,\" where he only missed one scheduled visit, on April 21, 2017. That, however, was a crucial visit, on the eve of trial, and his unexplained failure to attend the visit, coupled with his unexplained absence from trial, indeed demonstrate an inconsistent commitment to his parenting responsibilities. In addition, the father's disciplinary infractions while incarcerated resulted in the postponement or rescheduling of a number of visits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Based on our careful review of the record and of the judge's detailed and comprehensive findings, we conclude that the termination decision \"reflect[s] an even-handed assessment of all the relevant facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Petition of the Dep't of Pub. Welfare to Dispense with Consent to Adoption\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"332000\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/376/252/#p261\">\n    376 Mass. 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 261 (1978). Notwithstanding a few instances of hyperbole, the judge's ultimate conclusion has clear and convincing evidentiary support. See\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Peggy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1178107\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/436/690/#p702\">\n    436 Mass. 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 702 (2002) (while \"two minor findings may have been incorrect,\" \"[b]ecause they relate only marginally, if at all, to the judge's ultimate conclusion of unfitness, we consider them harmless\");\n   <em>\n    Care &amp; Protection of Olga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1250671\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/57/821/#p825\">\n    57 Mass. App. Ct. 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 825 (2003) (\"The two clearly erroneous findings, considered singly or in the aggregate, are not central to the ultimate conclusion of unfitness. Even without those findings, that conclusion has clear and convincing evidentiary support\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Termination and visitation decisions\n   </em>\n   . The father argues that the judge's decision to terminate his parental rights was premature, as he had only recently been released from imprisonment and was making efforts to comply with his service plan. While \"[a] judge may properly be guided by evidence demonstrating reason to believe that a parent will correct a condition or weakness that currently disables the parent from serving his or her child's best interests,\"\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Carlos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3901605\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/413/339/#p350\">\n    413 Mass. 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 350 (1992), the evidence clearly and convincingly supports the judge's conclusion, based on the father's history and his more recent conduct in prison and after his release, that his \"shortcomings will continue undiminished in the future.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Nor did the judge abuse her discretion in ordering posttermination visitation two times per year. The judge credited psychologist Spetter's opinion that the child had a \"secure attachment\" to the father, and noted Spetter's opinion that keeping the father as an ongoing presence in the child's life would \"help mitigate risks, if any, associated with [the father's] potential separation.\" The judge also found a strong bond between the child and her foster parents (who planned to adopt her). The judge appears to have erred in finding that \"Dr. Spetter did not form an opinion as to whether [Bedelia] formed a positive attachment to Father or the foster parents first\" -- Spetter in fact testified that the father was the child's \"[p]rimary as in first\" attachment figure. Taking all the evidence into account, the judge concluded that \"posttermination and post-adoption visitation with Father is in [Bedelia's] best interest.\" The judge ordered \"up to two visits per year,\" subject to review based on the adoptive parents' assessments and the child's wishes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The judge's order demonstrates that she did not, as the father argues, ignore the attachment evidence. Although Spetter testified that two visits would be better than none, and that weekly or biweekly visits would be ideal, the judge was not obligated to adopt his recommendation. A judge must balance the benefit of an order of visitation with the intrusion that such an order imposes on adoptive parents, \"who are entitled to the presumption that they will act in their child's best interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Ilona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270871\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/459/53/#p59\">\n    459 Mass. at 64-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[T]he judge considered the relevant factors and her decision did not 'fall[ ] outside the range of reasonable alternatives.' \"\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Garret\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12548994\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/91/1139/#p676\">\n    92 Mass.
