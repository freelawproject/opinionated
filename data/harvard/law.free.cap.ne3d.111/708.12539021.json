The victim of the offense was Daniels's wife, Crystal Daniels. For ease of discussion, we will refer to Crystal Daniels as Mrs. Daniels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Daniels challenges his conviction on the grounds that the trial court abused its discretion in not dismissing the case at the state's request, his trial counsel was ineffective for not requesting a jury trial after the court denied the request to dismiss and not objecting to prejudicial evidence, and the conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence. We find no merit to Daniels's arguments and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Russell Daniels was charged with one count of domestic violence in violation of R.C. 2919.25(A), a misdemeanor of the first degree. The complaint alleged that Daniels had physically harmed his wife by picking her up by her face and pulling her hair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Daniels pled not guilty and proceeded to a bench trial. Prior to trial, the prosecutor informed the trial court that Mrs. Daniels did not wish to proceed because the charge was based on a heated argument with her husband. The prosecutor requested that the case be dismissed for want of prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The trial court invited the investigating officer to speak. The officer confirmed that the charge was based on a verbal argument that turned physical. He further explained that Mrs. Daniels had alleged that Daniels had attempted to break their dog's neck and had followed her when she had left the house to file a police report. After hearing these facts, the trial court denied the state's request to dismiss the charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Mrs. Daniels and Daniels testified at trial and agreed to the following facts. The Danielses had been married for 22 years, and had three children together. They had been separated for three days when Mrs. Daniels invited him to the marital home to discuss their marriage. The discussion took place in their bedroom, while Mrs. Daniels was lying in bed. Their discussion became heated after he accused her of cheating. Both were screaming and yelling at each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Each testified to a different version of the physical altercation. Mrs. Daniels testified that her hair was in a ponytail, and that Daniels pulled her hair, but did not hurt her. Then he grabbed her face and chin and raised her face upwards. She\n   explained that the facial grab did not leave any marks, but it hurt. While they were arguing, the dog jumped on the bed and tried to play with Daniels. Daniels lifted the dog by the scruff of its neck and set the dog on the floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} After Daniels grabbed her, they continued the argument downstairs. While they were arguing, their 12-year-old daughter came into the room and slapped Daniels in the face. Daniels moved their daughter, but did not hurt her. Mrs. Daniels asked him to leave, and she went to her car with her daughter and the dog to call 911. She saw his car behind hers briefly and initially assumed that he was following her. When she looked behind her a second time, he was gone. She proceeded to drive to the police station to file a report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} During cross-examination, the following exchange occurred between counsel for Daniels and Mrs. Daniels:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Q. This incident allegedly took place on January 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   of this year; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Q. And actually-correct me if I'm wrong, but January 19\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , you actually went to District 3 to inquire about how to file for domestic violence?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A. No, that is [ ] incorrect. * * * I went to District 3 to ask how to keep him off of my work's property because some coworkers felt threatened and my administrator advised me to find out if there was anything I could do to keep him off work's property. They told me no. Unless he comes on the property, then they can call the police.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Q. So you inquired about a protection order?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A. From my work's property, not for myself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The state rested, and Daniels made a Crim.R. 29(A) motion for an acquittal, which the trial court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Daniels testified that the argument began when Mrs. Daniels accused him of cheating. Afterwards, he accused her of cheating, and they were both yelling at each other. As he was leaving, she jumped out of the bed and startled him. He threw up his hands and may have hit her face. Then he left to go to his mother's house. He confirmed that he moved the dog off of the bed, and that his daughter slapped him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 12} For its rebuttal case, the state recalled Mrs. Daniels. She testified that she did not remember jumping off the bed toward her husband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} After summarizing the evidence, the trial court found Daniels guilty because he grabbed his wife's face, and the grab was not a startled reflex. The court further found that Daniels pulled her head up and caused her pain. The trial court concluded that Mrs. Daniels was \"honest\" while testifying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The court sentenced him to 180 days in jail, suspended 179 days, and credited the one day he spent in jail. The court sentenced him to 11 months of probation, placed him on 180 days of electronic monitoring, ordered him to complete an anger-management course and imposed court costs. The sentence was stayed pending the resolution of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    The Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In his first assignment of error, Daniels contends that the trial court erred by denying the state's motion to dismiss the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 16} A trial court's decision to grant or deny a prosecutor's request to dismiss a charge is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The only explanation the prosecutor gave was that Mrs. Daniels had indicated the charge stemmed from a heated argument with her husband. After the investigating officer recited the allegations that led to the filing of the domestic-violence charge against Daniels, the trial court denied the state's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 20} We conclude that the trial court acted within its sound discretion in denying the motion to dismiss. Based on the allegations, the complaint was sufficient to charge a domestic-violence offense, and the prosecuting witness was present to testify regarding the allegations.

He further argues that his counsel should have requested a continuance and filed a jury demand after the court heard the allegations and denied the state's request to dismiss the charge.

Absent any explanation about how counsel's performance was deficient, Daniels has not overcome the presumption that counsel's decision was sound trial strategy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   at 689,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Feltha\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Failure to object to inadmissible testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Here, the state introduced testimony that the Danielses' daughter slapped Daniels in the face while he was arguing with Mrs. Daniels. Daniels argues that testimony was irrelevant and inadmissible because the daughter did not witness the alleged domestic violence, and the slap by the daughter was not relevant to prove the offense. Daniels further argues that he was prejudiced by the testimony because the trial court stated, while rendering the verdict, that \"the fact that the daughter came down and felt the need to slap him, too, that's not exactly helpful.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Assuming, without deciding, that the testimony was inadmissible, Daniels has failed to show that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different absent the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Having considered the evidence provided by the state at trial, we do not find that the absence of the testimony would have changed the outcome of this case. The sole issue in this case was the credibility of the witnesses, and the trial court found that Mrs. Daniels's testimony was more credible than Daniels's testimony. Although the trial court mentioned the testimony about the slap during the summation of the evidence, the court made it clear that the verdict was based on its finding that Mrs. Daniels's testimony was honest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Daniels has failed to demonstrate that, but for counsel's failure to object to the testimony, the outcome of the trial would have been different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Bradley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1418245\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/42/136/#p141\">\n    42 Ohio St.3d at 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=538%20N.E.2d%20373\">\n    538 N.E.2d 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Defense counsel elicited testimony from Mrs. Daniels that she had gone to the police station at the request of her coworkers to find out how to prevent Daniels from driving in the parking lot at her workplace. A review of the testimony reveals that counsel was attempting to show that Mrs. Daniels had asked the police how to file a domestic-violence charge the day before the argument occurred. Taken in context, it appears that counsel was attempting to impeach the witness. This was a reasonable trial strategy and did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Daniels has failed to demonstrate that trial counsel was ineffective.

When considering a challenge to the weight of the evidence, the court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice.\n   <em>\n    State v.
