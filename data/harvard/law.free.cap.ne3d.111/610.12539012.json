Wentling, appeals from the September 22, 2017 Judgment Entry of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas granting summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Richard S. Wentling (\"the deceased\") was an employee of appellee Davis Motor Coach, Ltd. Appellee David Motor Coach purchases wrecked or disabled commercial motor coach buses for the purpose of salvaging parts. Appellee Davis's President is appellee Frank. B. Bolog\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On December 2, 2013, at the direction of appellee Bolog, the deceased was instructed to go to the \"lower lot\" of appellees' facility to obtain a downpipe and muffler bearing off of a scrap bus. The deceased jacked up and crawled underneath the bus in order to obtain the requested parts. While the deceased was underneath the bus, the jack began to sink into the soil causing the bus to compress the deceased's chest and head, slowly asphyxiating him. After another employee of appellee Davis found the deceased and called for emergency assistance, the deceased was transported to an area hospital. He never regained consciousness and died four days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellant, Individually and as Administrator of the deceased's estate, filed a complaint against appellee David Motor Coach, Ltd., appellee Frank. B. Bolog, appellee Fidelity US Coach, Ltd. and appellee Mechanic Realty, Ltd., which is the owner of the property where the injury occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint alleged the following six causes of action:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Count 1-Negligence (all appellees)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Count 2-Employer Intentional Tort (appellees Davis, Fidelity and Bolog)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Count 3-Breach of Lease (appellee Mechanic Realty)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Count 4-Maintaining a Nuisance (all appellees)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Count 5-Premises Liability (all appellees)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Count 6-Wrongful Death (all appellees)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellees filed an answer to the complaint on April 12, 2017. On April 19, 2017, appellees filed a Notice of Filing of Certificate of Premium Payment for Workers' Compensation Coverage. The certificate indicated that appellee Davis Motor Coach, as employer, had paid into the Ohio State Insurance Fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellees, on April 19, 2017, filed A Motion for Summary Judgment, seeking summary judgment on the negligence and intentional tort claims. Appellant, on August 25, 2017, filed a brief in opposition to\n   the Motion for Summary Judgment and a Motion for Discovery Sanctions. Appellant, in the brief in opposition, noted that appellees had \"ignore[d] the nuisance claim at issue and do not address the unsafe condition of the property where the injury occurred.\" With respect to the Motion for Sanctions, appellant sought a \"negative inference\" discovery sanction for the appellees' spoliation of evidence. Appellant stated that the bus that came down on top of the deceased and the jack had both been disposed of and scrapped by appellees. Appellant argued that appellees' spoliation of evidence precluded summary judgment. On September 15, 2017, appellees filed a response to the brief in opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment and a response to appellant's Motion for Discovery Sanctions. Appellees, in their response to the brief in opposition, acknowledged that \"it was an oversight to not specifically address the entirety of Plaintiff's assertion that Defendant's property consists of a nuisance[.]\" Appellees addressed the nuisance claim and noted, in part, that appellee Mechanic Realty, Ltd. had not been cited by a municipality for maintaining a nuisance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The trial court, as memorialized in a Judgment Entry filed on September 22, 2017, granted appellees' Motion for Summary Judgment. The trial court, in its Judgment Entry, stated that \"[t]his is a final appealable order and there is no just cause for delay.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellant now raises the following assignments of error on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AS A MATTER OF LAW IN GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT TO DEFENDANT MECHANIC REALTY, LTD. WHEN IT FAILED TO MEET ITS INITIAL BURDEN UNDER CIV.R. 56(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} II. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT GRANTED SUMMARY JUDGMENT TO DEFENDANT MECHANIC REALTY, LTD. AND FRANK B. BOLOG ON THE BASIS OF EMPLOYER IMMUNITY WHEN NEITHER DEFENDANT EMPLOYED THE DECEDENT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 17} III. THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN FAILING TO ASSESS A \"NEGATIVE INFERENCE\" SANCTION AGAINST DEFENDANTS FOR THEIR SPOLIATION OF EVIDENCE BECAUSE IT APPLIED THE WRONG LEGAL STANDARD TO THE MOTION.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 18} IV. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT UPON PLAINTIFF'S CLAIM FOR EMPLOYER INTENTIONAL TORT BECAUSE PLAINTIFF SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF LIABILITY OF DEFENDANT DAVIS MOTOR COACH, LTD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Appellant, in his first assignment of error, argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellee Mechanic Realty, Ltd. on the property claims. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Civ.R. 56(C) states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action, show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. No evidence or stipulation may be considered except as stated in this rule. A summary judgment shall not be rendered unless it appears from the evidence or stipulation,\n   and only from the evidence or stipulation, that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that party being entitled to have the evidence or stipulation construed mostly strongly in the party's favor. A summary judgment, interlocutory in character, may be rendered on the issue of liability alone although there is a genuine issue as to the amount of damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 21} A trial court should not enter a summary judgment if it appears a material fact is genuinely disputed, nor if, construing the allegations most favorably towards the non-moving party, reasonable minds could draw different conclusions from the undisputed facts.\n   <em>\n    Hounshell v.

Appellees only argued that they were entitled to summary judgment on the negligence and employer intentional tort claims. After appellant, in his brief in opposition, pointed out to the trial court that appellees had failed to address the property claims against appellee Mechanic Realty, Ltd. in the Motion for Summary Judgment, appellees, in their reply brief, agreed and then addressed at least some of the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 25} We concur with appellant that \"[b]ecause MRL [Mechanic Realty, Ltd] never set forth any law or argument to support summary judgment upon Counts 3, 4 or 5 of the Complaint, as a matter of law, MRL did not meet its initial burden under Civ.R. 56.\" As is stated above, appellees, in their Motion for Summary Judgment, only sought summary judgment on the negligence and intentional tort claims. Moreover, as noted by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Matrix Acquisitions, LLC v. Styler\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist. Tuscarawas No. 2010AP040014,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-5343\">\n    2010-Ohio-5343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%204345754\">\n    2010 WL 4345754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at paragraph 17 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The moving party cannot discharge its initial burden under Civ.R. 56 simply by making a conclusory assertion that the nonmoving party has no evidence to\n   prove its case. Rather, the moving party must be able to specifically point to some evidence of the type listed in Civ.R. 56(C) which affirmatively demonstrates that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support the nonmoving party's claims. If the moving party fails to satisfy its initial burden, the motion for summary judgment must be denied\n   <strong>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Appellees never supported their assertion in their September 15, 2017 response that they were entitled to summary judgment on the nuisance claim with any Civ.R. 56(C) evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 27} In short, we find that appellee Mechanic Realty, Ltd. failed to meet its initial burden under Civ.R, 56 with respect to the property claims and that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment with respect to such claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Appellant's first assignment of error is, therefore, sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Appellant, in his second assignment of error, contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to appellees Mechanic Realty, Ltd. and Frank B. Bolog on the basis of employer immunity under R.C. 4123.74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The trial court, in the case sub judice, held that appellees were entitled to immunity under 4123.74. Such section states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Employers who comply with section 4123.35 of the Revised Code shall not be liable to respond in damages at common law or by statute for any injury, or occupational disease, or bodily condition, received or contracted by any employee in the course of or arising out of his employment, or for any death resulting from such injury, occupational disease, or bodily condition occurring during the period covered by such premium so paid into the state insurance fund, or during the interval the employer is a self-insuring employer, whether or not such injury, occupational disease, bodily condition, or death is compensable under this chapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 31} There is no dispute that the deceased was an employee of appellee Davis Motor Coach. Appellee Frank B. Bolog, during his deposition, testified that the deceased was employed by appellee Davis Motor Coach. Appellees, in their brief, now contend as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   As described in Appellee's Statement of Facts, all of the defendants named in this action are part of a literal family of businesses. Beyond the named parties, the Bolog family operates several other entities as part of their transportation and motor coach business. Appellant has made baseless, heinous claims disparaging the Bolog family for this practice, but as a matter of practically and business sense, it is in their best interest to divide their assets and limit their liability in this way. The issue of the multiple different entities was discussed at length before the trial court, and Appellees submit that it was perhaps in part because the trial court thought it obvious, that the negligence claims were denied against Defendants Mechanic Realty Ltd. and Frank B. Bolog because of their relationship to the entity that Appellant themselves acknowledge is immune.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 32} However, in their Motion for Summary Judgment, appellees never argued that the above appellees' relationship with appellee David Motor Coach made them immune from liability under R.C. 4123.74. Appellees simply argued that appellee David Motor Coach was current with all worker's compensation premiums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Based on the foregoing, we find that the trial court erred in granting summary\n   judgment in favor of appellees Mechanic Realty Ltd. and Frank B. Bolog on the negligence claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Appellant's second assignment of error is, therefore, sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Appellant, in his third assignment of error, contends that the trial court abused its discretion in applying the wrong law in refusing to sanction appellees' spoliation of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Appellant, on August 25, 2017, filed a Motion for Discovery Sanctions under Civ.R. 37. Appellant's motion was based on appellees' disposal/destruction of the bus that came down on top of the deceased and that jack that he had been using to get underneath the bus. Appellant, in his motion, argued that, as a result, he had been deprived of any opportunity to determine what equipment safety guards were available to the deceased and if they had been removed and asked that \"a rebuttable presumption of liability should arise in Plaintiff's favor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 37} As noted by the court in\n   <em>\n    Simeone v.

The incident in this case occurred on December 2, 2013 and the deceased died on December 6, 2013. The Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) was on the premises and conducted inspections between December 9, 2013 and January 1, 2014. Citations were issued to appellees by OSHA for safety violations on March 26, 2014. Nearly, twelve months after the accident, appellees scrapped and disposed of the bus and the jack. Appellant then initiated litigation in February of 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 42} As noted by the trial court, \"[d]estruction of evidence in accordance with a standard practice of destroying certain items after a fixed period, before a suit is filed, has been found not to support an inference of willful destruction.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nye v.

Appellee Frank B. Bolog, during his deposition, testified that he never tried to keep a bus longer than 11 months because it cost them money and that, in the ordinary course of business, he tried to get as many parts off of a bus as needed in less than 11 months and then scrapped the shell. Deposition of Frank B. Bolog at 66-67. He further testified that while, on occasion, a bus might remain on the property for 12 or 13 months due to weather or scrap yard circumstances, \"most of the time it's about 11 months.\" Deposition of Frank Bolog at 67. Thus, there was evidence that the bus and jack were disposed of after a fixed period in accordance with a standard practice before suit had been filed. While appellant contends that appellees had constructive notice of potential litigation before they scrapped the bus and jack, appellant conceded that there is no case law on constructive notice in such a context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Appellant's third assignment of error is, therefore, overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Appellant, in his fourth assignment of error, maintains that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on appellant's workplace intentional tort claim against appellee Davis Motor Coach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Prior to April 7, 2005, the courts looked to common law to determine whether an employee established his or her employer committed an intentional tort.

As noted by the trial court, appellees complied with the OSHA investigation and kept the jack and bus for nearly a year after the accident.
