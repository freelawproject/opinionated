English (\"English\") appeals the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants-appellees William Brownlee (\"W. Brownlee\") and Lynde Brownlee (\"L. Brownlee\") (jointly referred to as the \"Brownlees\"), husband and wife, awarding sanctions pursuant to Civ.R. 11 and R.C. 2323.51 against attorney English arising from English's representation of Jeffrey Lansky (\"Lansky\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Brownlees filed a cross-appeal challenging the amount of the award. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background and Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Lansky served as mayor of the city of Maple Heights, Ohio from December 2007 to December 2015, president of city council from 1991 to 2003, and as a city councilman from 1987 to 1991. Lansky died in March 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The Brownlees are publishers of an internet website entitled Maple Heights News (\n   <em>\n    www.MapleHeightsNews.org\n   </em>\n   ) reporting on city community news. Most of\n   the articles are authored gratis by the Brownlees, including an editorial blog entitled \"Throwback Thursday\" published on July 17, 2014. The blog discussed the significant financial issues faced by the city from 2011 until the city was declared to be in fiscal emergency in 2015. The blog also included a copy of campaign literature from Lansky's second mayoral campaign delineating his accomplishments during the first term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The blog attributed a number of service reductions in the community to decisions made by Lanksy that were allegedly not caused or controlled by Lansky:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (1) The closure of a fire station location was attributed to Lansky, though the fire chief made the decision to close the station due to budget cuts rather than use a smaller staff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (2) The city council and not Lansky voted to renegotiate the waste hauling agreement and eliminate curbside recycling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (3) Senior citizens services were not reduced or eliminated by Lansky. Some services were provided by volunteer drivers instead of salaried drivers, and attempts were made to transport several citizens concurrently for required services instead of unilaterally.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (4) Lansky did not veto legislation to place a property tax increase on the ballot as the blog alleged, but allowed it to pass by failing to veto or otherwise act within the period required by the city charter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (5) Contrary to the blog information, Lansky did not terminate the community safety town program. The program ended because funding was no longer available to retain paid staff and residents did not respond to requests for volunteer assistance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (6) City council, not Lansky, voted to stop using public funds to print and mail newsletters to residents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (7) City council, not Lansky, voted to eliminate the budget appropriation for the \"code red\" emergency system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Lansky telephoned W. Brownlee demanding removal of the false statements. Lansky consulted with English who sent correspondence to the Brownlees stating the statements were false, defamatory, and ill-informed and requested the statements be retracted immediately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The Brownlees \"lined through\" certain representations after Lansky complained but the information remained on the website. A July 23, 2014 notice appeared on the site stating that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [The blog] contained [three] errors. A letter from Mayor Lansky's lawyer informed us that he did not veto the 2013 property tax levy, that Fire Station # 2 was closed at the direction of the fire chief, and there was no loss of service for senior transportation. These errors have been \"struck out\" and updated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The original text was legible with the strike-through edit. The Brownlees respond that they used the correction format recommended by \"The Reuters Handbook of Journalism\" for blog corrections. Appellees' brief, p. 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 7} English asserts that the Brownlees were contentious, critical, and disrespectful to Lansky and others at city council meetings, particularly regarding budget cuts required as the result of revenue losses. Lansky pursued an action for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress, allegedly as the result of complaints received from citizens and concern about his reputation due to the blog. Lansky charged that W. Brownlee had actual knowledge of the falsity of the statements\n   due to his position as a city council member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The Brownlees argue that Lansky and English have engaged in a \" 'pattern of intimidation' in bringing meritless defamation suits against Lansky's political opponents\" and that they were the ninth and tenth targets since 1994, a 20-year period. According to the Brownlees, Lansky threatened them with a lawsuit and told them that he did not want to settle. He also asked the Brownlees whether they carried homeowner's insurance to cover a judgment and refused the Brownlees' request that he identify in writing the inaccurate information. Lansky stated during deposition testimony that it was not his responsibility to tell the Brownlees which information was incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In response to Lansky's complaint, the Brownlees counterclaimed for vexatious litigation and frivolous conduct, violation of Civ.R. 11, and malicious civil prosecution. The Brownlees asserted that Lansky's claims were made in bad faith, for improper purposes, were not supported by existing law and did not serve as the basis for establishing new law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On November 13, 2015, in a 28-page opinion, the trial court dismissed Lansky's claims for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress and granted summary judgment for the Brownlees. The trial court determined that the statements complained of were not factually false, the strike through methodology that the Brownlees employed to make corrections to the article was acceptable, and the evidence did not support a finding that the Brownlees acted with actual malice. The Brownlees' counterclaims for a vexatious litigator declaration and malicious prosecution were withdrawn, but the Brownlees continued their pursuit of sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The parties appeared for the sanctions hearing required by R.C. 2323.51(B)(2)(a) on December 15, 2016. Lansky, who was unable to appear due to illness, was allowed to testify by affidavit. English testified that sanctions should not be imposed, and he objected to the claims by the Brownlees for attorney fees and expenses exceeding $160,000. The Brownlees relied on their briefs and affidavits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On December 28, 2016, the trial court issued an entry based on the trial court's review of the entire record. Sanctions were awarded pursuant to Civ.R. 11 and R.C. 2323.51 for: (1) $75 for the counterclaim filing fee; (2) $2,000 for the fees of Brownlees' primary counsel; (3) $5,000 for the fees of counsel assisting the primary counsel; and (4) costs and expenses totaling $2,319.94. The sanctions were imposed against Lansky and English, jointly and severally. On February 15, 2017, the trial court stayed the request of English and Lansky for findings of fact and conclusions of law due to the filing of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 13} We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 14} English presents two assignments of error. First, English argues that he did not engage in frivolous conduct warranting sanctions under R.C. 2323.51. Secondly, English asserts that his conduct did not violate a duty imposed by Civ.R. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Civ.R. 11 and R.C. 2323.51 are the two avenues available under Ohio law for recovery of attorney fees for claims of frivolous conduct. \"[B]oth authorize the award of attorney fees as a sanction for frivolous conduct, [but] they have separate standards of proof and differ in application.\"\n   <em>\n    Bikkani v.
