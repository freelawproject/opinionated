(\"Farmers\") challenges the trial court's order certifying a class of individuals that purchased uninsured motorist coverage from Farmers between October 1994 and September 1997. Farmers argues that class certification is inappropriate. After a thorough review of the record and law, this court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Midwestern Group\n   </em>\n   \"). In\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Midwestern Group\n   </em>\n   , on October 5, 1994, the Ohio Supreme Court invalidated the \"other-owned vehicle\" exclusion to uninsured/underinsured motorist (\"UM/UIM\") coverage in every automobile insurance policy in Ohio. The court held that \"[a]n automobile liability insurance policy provision which eliminates uninsured motorist coverage for persons insured thereunder who are injured while occupying a motor vehicle owned by an insured, but not specifically listed in the policy, violates R.C. 3937.18 and is therefore invalid.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=639%20N.E.2d%20438\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at paragraph three of the syllabus. The\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Midwestern Group\n   </em>\n   decision removed the necessity for insureds to pay UM/UIM premiums on each of the vehicles in their policy. Rather, they would have UM/UIM coverage while in any of their owned vehicles if a UM/UIM premium was paid on one vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Prior to and at the time of the\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Midwestern Group\n   </em>\n   decision, plaintiff-appellee William Bowen had an automobile insurance policy through Farmers. Bowen had multiple vehicles on the policy, and he paid UM premiums on each vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On March 31, 2009, Bowen filed a complaint against Farmers alleging that Farmers continued to assess multiple premiums for UM coverage despite the Ohio Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Midwestern Group\n   </em>\n   . Bowen filed an amended complaint on June 26, 2009. He filed a second amended complaint on January 8, 2010. In the second amended complaint, Bowen asserted causes of actions for breach of contract and fraud relating to Farmers' practice of assessing multiple UM premiums for UM coverage, even after a UM premium was paid on a first vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On February 26, 2010, Farmers filed a motion to dismiss Bowen's second amended complaint. On May 14, 2010, the trial court granted Farmers' motion to dismiss\n   the second amended complaint on the breach of contract claim; the trial court denied Farmers' motion to dismiss on the fraud claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On December 31, 2015, Farmers filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Bowen's fraud claim was barred by the applicable four-year statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bowen filed a brief in opposition on June 14, 2011. Farmers filed a reply brief on June 27, 2011. On January 24, 2013, the trial court denied Farmers' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On March 12, 2015, Farmers filed a motion to strike class allegations pursuant to Civ.R. 23(D)(4) for want of bringing the fraud claim within the statute of limitations. Bowen filed a brief in opposition on April 2, 2015. The trial court denied Farmers' motion to strike class allegations on June 17, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On December 31, 2015, Bowen filed a motion for class certification. Bowen sought to certify a class as defined as follows: \"all persons who purchased automobile insurance from Farmers and paid premiums identified as paying for UM coverage on more than one vehicle in the household at any time during the period October 1994 through September 1997.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Farmers filed a brief in opposition on February 16, 2016. In opposing Bowen's motion for class certification, Farmers argued that Bowen could not satisfy the superiority and predominance requirements under Civ.R. 23(B)(3). Specifically, Farmers argued that the following individual issues would overwhelm common issues: (1) the application of the four-year statute of limitations, (2) proof of class members' desire or lack of desire to obtain guest coverage, and (3) proof of actual reliance. Furthermore, Farmers asserted that proposed class includes members that were not harmed and did not suffer any damages from Farmers' practice of allocating UM premiums on a per-vehicle basis. Bowen filed a reply brief in support of his motion for class certification on March 1, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The trial court held a hearing on Bowen's motion for class certification on April 4, 2016. On March 8, 2017, the trial court granted Bowen's motion for class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On April 6, 2017, Farmers filed the instant appeal challenging the trial court's judgment. Farmers assigns three errors for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   I. The trial court erred in certifying an overly broad class consisting entirely of class members whose claims are barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   II. The trial court erred by finding that common questions predominated where an injury-in-fact to each class member cannot be proven by common evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   III. The trial court erred by finding that common questions predominated because, if tolling can apply to the class claims, the trial court failed to consider the highly individualized inquiries necessary to determine whether each class member's claim was timely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Appellants argued that in order to comply with\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Midwestern Group\n   </em>\n   , Erie was required to charge UM premiums on a per person basis. Erie filed a motion for summary judgment and a supporting affidavit from an agent of the insurance company.

Farmers emphasizes that damages cannot be presumed based solely on the fact that an insured paid multiple UM premiums for UM coverage. In order to determine whether an insured overpaid for UM coverage, Farmers asserts that the following must also be considered: (1) the total amount of premium(s) paid, (2) the coverage received, (3) the risk of being insured, (4) insurance rate-setting practices, (5) the number of vehicles in a particular household, and (6) the number of persons in a particular household.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Farmers argues that when all of these factors are taken into consideration, it becomes evident that some prospective\n   class members received adequate UM coverage, or even more UM coverage, by paying UM premiums on a per-vehicle rather than a per-person basis. In fact, Farmers contends that if it had re-rated UM premiums post-\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

In\n   <em>\n    Baughman\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs, who paid multiple premiums for UM coverage, filed a complaint against their insurance company, State Farm, alleging that (1) State Farm charged premiums for UM coverage that it had no intention of providing, (2) the additional UM premiums were of no value and/or conferred no additional benefit or UM coverage, and (3) State Farm charged the additional UM premiums without informing insureds of the\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Midwestern Group\n   </em>\n   decision or that payment of a UM premium on one vehicle provided UM coverage to all resident relatives in the household. Plaintiffs asserted causes of action for fraud, conversion, unjust enrichment, negligence, breach of implied covenant or duty of good faith and fair dealing, and the return of insurance premiums based on a failure to disclose. The trial court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 30} On appeal, State Farm argued that the trial court abused its discretion by finding that plaintiffs satisfied the Civ.R. 23 typicality, predominance, and superiority requirements. The appellate court emphasized that plaintiffs continued to renew their insurance policies with State Farm after they had a clear understanding of\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Midwestern Group\n   </em>\n   and after they had instituted the civil action. The appellate court concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that plaintiffs satisfied the typicality requirement because plaintiffs' claims and State Farm's potential defenses would not be representative of the prospective class members who paid multiple UM premiums without knowledge of\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

The court explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [plaintiffs] allege that State Farm wrongfully charged them separate premiums for uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage on each of their vehicles without disclosing that only one vehicle in the household need have uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage in order to provide such protection to all resident relatives, regardless of which vehicle they may be occupying when injured. In addition, [plaintiffs] allege that the policies they purchased all contained other-owned-vehicle exclusions, as well as a provision stating that policy terms could only be changed by an endorsement signed by one of State Farm's executive officers. These allegations form the essential gravamen of [plaintiffs'] six claims for relief. These claims arise from the same alleged wrongful practice and course of conduct that forms the claims of the class, and they are based on the same legal theories as those of the other class members. In attempting to establish liability, it appears that appellants will introduce evidence\n   showing State Farm's past practice of informing its insureds of changes in the law bearing on coverage or policy terms, particularly those wrought by judicial decision that affected other-owned-vehicle exclusions, its failure to inform of [\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Midwestern Group\n   </em>\n   ] or the invalidity of the other-owned-vehicle exclusion, and the presence of the integration clause in their policies. This is the same kind of evidence that all class members would be required to present in support of their claims. Thus, the adjudication of [plaintiffs'] claims against State Farm would necessarily involve a determination of State Farm's liability to the class generally, thereby aligning [plaintiffs'] litigation interests with those of the class.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 488,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=639%20N.E.2d%20438\">\n    639 N.E.2d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Bowen also directs this court to\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

Rather, like\n   <em>\n    Baughman\n   </em>\n   , Bowen claims that Farmers (1) actively misled him and class members into paying for UM coverage that was no longer necessary and/or (2) misled him and class members into paying for guest coverage.

After reviewing the record, we find that the superiority and predominance requirements set forth in Civ.R. 23(B) overlap with the merits of Bowen's fraud claim and the statute of limitations issues raised by Farmers. Accordingly, we must consider the statute of limitations issues in addressing Farmers' third assignment of error and determining whether the trial court abused its discretion in determining that Bowen satisfied the predominance requirement pursuant to Civ.R. 23(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 46} In support of its argument that the fraud claim is time-barred, Farmers argues that the discovery rule does not apply because (1) knowledge of multiple UM premiums, rather than knowledge of the illegality of these premiums or the\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Midwestern Group\n   </em>\n   decision triggered the statute of limitations, and (2) Bowen and the prospective class members knew or should have known about the multiple UM premiums because they were reflected in the insureds' declaration sheets. Because the multiple premium charges were reflected in the declaration sheets, Farmers argues that Bowen and the prospective class members knew or should have known that they were paying multiple premiums, and thus, were put on notice to inquire further about the nature of the multiple premium charges. Furthermore, Farmers argues that Bowen's ignorance of the law-the\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Midwestern Group\n   </em>\n   decision-does not toll the four-year statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Bowen, on the other hand, argues that the only billing documents that customers received were the declarations sheets. He emphasizes that the declaration sheets only listed the gross amount of premiums charged for each vehicle, rather than clearly listing or itemizing the UM premiums. In other words, Bowen argues that he and the class members were unable to determine that something was awry-that they were being charged UM premiums on second and third vehicles-by simply looking at the declaration sheets because the declaration sheets do not disclose or reveal that insureds were being charged additional UM premiums\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 48} The trial court explained that Bowen filed his original complaint well after the four-year statute of limitations had expired. As such, the trial court recognized that \"a determination must be made as to when [he] actually discovered or should have discovered the fraud.\" In finding that Bowen satisfied the superiority requirement, the trial court stated, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   For Bowen, the evidence shows that he had actual knowledge [of the fraud] only a short while before the complaint was filed. So the issue for [Bowen] is whether he should have discovered the fraud more than four years before first filing on March 31, 2009. When determining whether, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, a party should have discovered a case of fraud, the relevant inquiry is whether the facts known would lead a fair and prudent man, using ordinary care and thoughtfulness, to make further inquiry.\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.

For all of them-including Bowen-that is a question of fact that only has to be decided once, since the evidence that Farmers pointed at to demonstrate that Bowen, through reasonable\n   diligence and in the absence of actual knowledge of the fraud, should have discovered the fraud long before 2005 will be the same evidence it uses to show that any class members should have discovered the fraud. In other words, the application of the statute of limitations to bar Bowen's claim will rest on whether with reasonable diligence he should have discovered the fraud before 2005, based on information actually known to him-namely, the payment of multiple UM premiums-and information he arguably should have known-the specific language of his policy and the [\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

Exhibits C and D of Bowen's deposition are declaration sheets from Bowen's policy for a 1994 Plymouth Voyager and a 1987 Chevrolet Cavalier. These declaration sheets indicate (1) that Bowen has UM coverage on both vehicles, (2) the policy limits of the UM coverage, (3) that Bowen also has coverage for bodily injury, \"P.D.,\" \"Medical/No-Fault,\" Comprehensive, and Collision on both vehicles, and (4) the total amount of premium charges for each vehicle. The declaration sheets do not, however, specify what portion of the total premium balance is a premium for UM coverage. Farmers acknowledges as much in its reply brief: \"the declaration sheet does not indicate what portion of the total premium paid is for the UM coverage[.]\" Appellants' reply brief at 5, fn. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Exhibits Nos. 7 (F0014), 8 (F0015), and 9 (F0013) of Feldman's deposition are Farmers' internal documents pertaining to Bowen's policy. These documents, unlike the declaration sheets, clearly reflect (1) that Bowen was charged separate UM premiums for his different vehicles, and (2) the precise amounts of these separate UM premiums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Accordingly, unlike\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   , the record reflects that the separate UM premiums for each vehicle were not clearly listed or itemized in the insured's declaration sheets. Had the separate UM premiums been clearly listed or itemized, and had Bowen knowingly paid the multiple UM premiums, he would have been put on notice, or should have been put on notice, to further inquire about the nature of or the coverage received for the multiple UM premium payments. This was not the case. Rather, Bowen knowingly made multiple premium payments, but the documents did not specify that he was charged multiple UM premiums. Accordingly, we cannot say that Bowen, having knowingly made multiple premium payments, was put on notice, or should have been put on notice, to further inquire about the nature of or the coverage received for the multiple UM premiums that were not clearly identified or itemized in the declaration sheets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 58} In the instant matter, the facts giving rise to Bowen's and the class members' fraud claim is the payment of additional UM premiums on top of the UM premium paid on a first vehicle. As noted above, the declaration sheets clearly indicate (1) that Bowen had UM coverage for his vehicles, (2) the policy limits of the UM coverage for each vehicle, and (3) the gross amount of premium charges for each vehicle. However, the declaration sheets do not indicate that Bowen was being charged a separate UM premium on each vehicle, nor do they indicate what portion, if any, of the total premium amount is a UM premium. Accordingly, we cannot say that Bowen actually knew, or should have known, about the facts giving rise to his fraud claim-the payment of multiple UM premiums-based on the information set forth in the declaration sheets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 59} Bowen asserts that the declaration sheets are the only document that Farmers' insureds receive that sets forth billing information. Farmers does not argue that its insureds received different versions of the declaration sheets. Thus, Bowen and the class members all had the same information available to them-the information set forth in the declaration sheets-regarding UM coverage, the UM coverage's policy limits, and the total amounts of premium charges for each vehicle. Thus, individual inquiries will not be required in order to determine whether, based on the information set forth in the insured's declaration sheets, Bowen and class members knew or should have known that they were paying multiple UM premiums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Finally, Farmers argues that some class members may have known that they were paying multiple UM premiums or were aware of the\n   <em>\n    Martin v. Midwestern Group\n   </em>\n   decision and its import. However, the Ohio Supreme Court has held,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   \"[t]hat a statute of limitations may bar the claims of some, but not all, class members does not compel a finding that individual issues predominate over common ones. * * * Rather, as long as there is a sufficient common nucleus of common issues, differences in the application of a statute of limitations to individual class members will not preclude certification under Rule 23(b)(3).\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1323438\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/82/67/#p70\">\n    82 Ohio St.3d at 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=694%20N.E.2d%20442\">\n    694 N.E.2d 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting 5 Moore,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice,\n   </em>\n   Section 23.46[3], at 23-210 to 23-211 (3d Ed.1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 61} Based on the foregoing analysis, we agree with the trial court's determination that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating this case. The record reflects that the prospective class shares a common nucleus of operative facts and asserts\n   the same theory of liability. The substantive elements of the class members' claims require the same proof for each class member, and the class is clearly bound together by a mutual interest in resolving common questions to an extent that is greater than individual interests that may divide the class. Accordingly, the common questions, which represent a significant aspect of this case, predominate over questions related to individual class members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 62} For all of the foregoing reasons, we find no basis upon which to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that Bowen satisfied the predominance requirement under Civ.R. 23(B).
