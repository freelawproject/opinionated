FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"AUO\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Plaintiff Gerald Wade was a prison inmate at the Lakeland Correctional Facility in Coldwater, Michigan. On January 25, 1987, plaintiff slipped on some foreign substance<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and fractured his kneecap. Plaintiff sued the State of Michigan, Department of Corrections, under the public building exception to governmental immunity<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on the basis of the theory that it failed to repair and maintain the Lakeland facility, a public building.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">In the Court of Claims, defendant moved for summary disposition pursuant to the governmental immunity statute, MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court granted defendant\u2019s motion on the basis of its finding that an accumulation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>grease or oil on the floor did not amount to a defect of the building itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The Court of Appeals reversed, finding little distinction between dangerous conditions caused by a structural defect in the floor and a floor covered with an accumulation of oil or grease. <em>Wade v Dep\u2019t of </em>Corrections, 182 Mich App 519, 525; 453 NW2d 683 (1990). The majority rejected the statutory interpretation, which differentiates between risks of injury on the basis of what occasioned the risk. <em>Id. </em>Judge Mackenzie dissented, on the basis of her belief that the public building exception is confined to the duty of preserving the structural integrity of a public building.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Although not specified in the record, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(7) and (C)(8). MCR 2.116(C)(7) tests whether a claim is barred because of immunity granted by law, and requires consideration of all documentary evidence filed or submitted by the parties. MCR 2.116(G)(5); <em>Green v Berrien General Hosp Auxiliary, Inc, </em>437 Mich 1, 4, n 4; 464 NW2d 703 (1990). MCR 2.116(C)(8), failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint and allows consideration of only the pleadings. MCR 2.116(G)(5); <em>Scameheorn v Bucks, </em>167 Mich App 302, 306; 421 NW2d 918 (1988). Under both subrules, all well-pleaded allegations are accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>as true, and construed most favorably to the non-moving party. <em>Scameheorn, supra </em>at 306; <em>Haywood v Fowler, </em>190 Mich App 253, 256; 475 NW2d 458 (1991). A court may only grant a motion pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(8) where the claims are so clearly unenforceable as a matter of law that no factual development could possibly justify recovery. <em>Scameheorn, supra </em>at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Immunity granted by law, such as governmental immunity, pursuant to MCL 691.1401 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.996(101) <em>et seq., </em>is an affirmative defense and requires that the defense be stated in the party\u2019s responsive pleading. MCR 2.111(F)(3)(a). <em>Leite v Dow Chemical Co, </em>439 Mich 920 (1992). In order to survive a motion for summary disposition, the plaintiff must, however, allege facts justifying application of an exception to governmental immunity. <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567, 621, n 34; 363 NW2d 641 (1984); <em>Gibson v Grand Rapids, </em>162 Mich App 100, 103; 412 NW2d 658 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">II. REVIEW OF MICHIGAN CASE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">In <em>Reardon v Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>430 Mich 398; 424 NW2d 248 (1988), this Court examined the scope of the public building exception to governmental immunity. MCL 691.1406; MSA 3.996(106). We held that the intent of the Legislature in enacting the public building exception was to \"impose a duty to maintain safe public buildings, but not necessarily safety <em>in </em>public buildings.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Reardon, supra </em>at 417. The duty to repair and maintain relates to the structural condition of the premises, and a government engaged in a governmental function is open to liability only where the injury results from a dangerous or defective condition <em>of </em>a building. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Although factually distinguishable from the instant case, the holding in <em>Reardon </em>delineating the public building exception is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">In <em>Reardon, </em>a nursing student was assaulted in her dormitory. She alleged that the room, and therefore the building, was unsafe and defective because of the number of master keys in circulation among the employees. In <em>Schafer v Ethridge, </em>430 Mich 398; 424 NW2d 248 (1988), the companion case of <em>Reardon, </em>a severely mentally retarded resident of a center for developmental disabilities was impregnated while staying in the acute care wing. The complaint alleged that the layout of the wing created a dangerous condition allowing an assault to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">This Court rejected the application of the public building exception to these facts on the grounds that no evidence was presented that a condition <em>of </em>the building contributed to the assaults or posed a danger to the plaintiffs. <em>Reardon, supra </em>at 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">In <em>Reardon, </em>we discussed the statutory genesis of the public building exception. In response to the judicial abrogation of governmental immunity for municipalities in <em>Williams v Detroit, </em>364 Mich 231; 111 NW2d 1 (1961), in 1964 the Legislature passed Public Act 170.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The purpose of this act was to restore governmental immunity to nonsovereign agencies, and to provide for uniform treatment of governmental entities when engaged in governmental functions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Reardon, supra </em>at 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Earlier constructions of the governmental immunity act by this Court indicated that with the expansion of governmental activity in recent years, services provided by governmental agencies are not essentially governmental in nature. <em>Pichette v Manistique Public Schools, </em>403 Mich 268, 279; 269 NW2d 143 (1978). We then found that public policy required a narrow construction of the term \"governmental function,\u201d and imposed a broad duty on the government to protect the public from injury by maintaining safe public places. <em>Id. </em>at 285. A \"narrow\u201d interpretation of the public building exception which limited application of the exception to the specific physical structure of the building itself was explicitly rejected. <em>Tilford v Wayne Co General Hosp, </em>403 Mich 293, 299; 269 NW2d 153 (1978). The decisions in <em>Lockaby v Wayne Co, </em>406 Mich 65, 77; 276 NW2d 1 (1979), and <em>Bush v Oscoda Area Schools, </em>405 Mich 716, 731; 275 NW2d 268 (1979), also reflect narrow interpretations of governmental function and governmental immunity. In <em>Bush, </em>this Court rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that the injury must result from dangerous or defective conditions caused by inadequate or negligent repairs or maintenance, and found that \"a building may be dangerous or defective because of improper design, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>faulty construction or the absence of safety devices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">In <em>Ross, supra, </em>the Court reconsidered the scope of the governmental immunity statute. Our purpose in interpreting the immunity act was to create a cohesive, uniform, and workable set of rules to define an injured party\u2019s rights, and the governmental entity\u2019s liability. <em>Id. </em>at 596. We concluded that the intent of the act was to bring into uniformity the liability for state and non-sovereign governmental agencies. <em>Id. </em>at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The decision in <em>Ross </em>settled prior inconsistencies in governmental immunity jurisprudence by finding that the heart of the act, \u00a7 7, provides for broad immunity from tort liability for governmental agencies engaged in governmental functions. <em>Ross, supra </em>at 595. The language of \u00a7 7 is \"in the broadest possible language,\u201d and the term \"governmental function\u201d was likewise to be construed broadly. <em>Id. </em>at 618. From this broad grant of immunity, the Court recognized four narrow statutory exceptions, including the public building exception.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The more recent decision in <em>Hyde v Univ of Michigan Bd of Regents, </em>426 Mich 223, 245; 393 NW2d 847 (1986), also recognized that exceptions to governmental immunity are to be narrowly construed:<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Subsequent Court of Appeals decisions, however, continued to interpret the public building exception broadly. In <em>Davis v Detroit, </em>149 Mich App 249, 262; 386 NW2d 169 (1986), the Court found that the Legislature intended to impose a \"broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>duty\u201d on governmental agencies to maintain safe buildings. And, in <em>Ray v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>156 Mich App 55, 63; 401 NW2d 307 (1986), the Court discussed the broad application of the public building exception, stating that \"it was the intent of the Legislature to apply the same standard of care and duty as would be applied to a department store or supermarket or a privately owned place of business open to the public.\u201d The only differences between private tort liability and that of governmental agencies noted by the Court in <em>Ray </em>were the notice and knowledge requirements in the public building exception statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Various Court of Appeals decisions since our 1988 decision in <em>Reardon, supra, </em>have recognized that the public building exception is now to be interpreted more narrowly, and is limited to dangers actually presented by the building itself. \"[T]he scope of this [public building] exception has been narrowed considerably in the time since <em>Pichette </em>and <em>Tilford Puroll v Madison Heights, </em>187 Mich App 672, 673; 468 NW2d 52 (1990). See <em>Merritt v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>184 Mich App 522, 523; 459 NW2d 10 (1989) (an accumulation of ice on a parking lot maintained by the defendant was not within the public building exception; the scope of the exception was narrowed since Tilford); <em>Dew v Livonia, </em>180 Mich App 676, 679; 447 NW2d 764 (1989) (the intent of the Legislature was to apply the public building exception to \" dangers actually presented by the building itself,\u2019 and not to all injuries incurred inside or adjacent to a public building\u201d); <em>Wing v Detroit, </em>178 Mich App 628, 631; 444 NW2d 539 (1989) (the plaintiff\u2019s claim regarding her slip and fall at the Detroit Zoo requires an expansion of pre-Ross decisions which is precluded by Reardon). See also <em>Abrams v Schoolcraft Community College, </em>178 Mich App <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>668; 444 NW2d 533 (1989), <em>Eberhard v St Johns Public Schools, </em>189 Mich App 466; 473 NW2d 745 (1991), <em>Hall v Detroit Bd of Ed, </em>186 Mich App 469; 465 NW2d 12 (1990), and <em>Hemphill v Michigan, </em>173 Mich App 335; 433 NW2d 826 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The exception has been held applicable where the claim alleges an injury occasioned by a defective or dangerous condition of the building itself. <em>Williamson v Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>176 Mich App 752, 758; 440 NW2d 97 (1989) (a mentally retarded resident drowned in the bath due to an improper design of the shower and bath).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Having reconsidered the scope of the governmental immunity statute, this Court remains persuaded that the legislative intent regarding application of the public building exception statute is limited to injuries occasioned by a \"dangerous or defective physical condition of the building itself.\u201d The statutory scheme does not contemplate transitory conditions because they are not related to the permanent structure or physical integrity of the building. <em>Reardon, supra </em>at 409. In <em>Reardon, </em>we recognized the holding in <em>Bush </em>with approval, reasoning that as long as the injury is presented by a structural condition of the building, it does not matter whether the condition arose because of improper design, faulty construction, or the absence of safety devices. <em>Id. </em>at 410. Our decisions in <em>Pichette, Tilford, Lockaby, </em>and <em>Bush, </em>are in harmony with <em>Reardon, </em>because these decisions preceded our resolution in <em>Ross, </em>which more broadly defined the scope of governmental functions and immunity. <em>Reardon, supra </em>at 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Plaintiff maintains that <em>Reardon </em>does not apply in this case because the injuries to the plaintiffs in <em>Reardon </em>were caused by the acts of third parties. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>We disagree. We find no substantive difference between acts of third parties which directly or negligently cause injury to the plaintiff from the facts involved in the present case. The significant, and we believe determining, aspect of both situations is that the dangerous condition was not caused by a dangerous or defective condition of the building itself. We agree with the reasoning of dissenting Judge Mackenzie who found in this case: \"plaintiff has alleged nothing more than negligent janitorial care. That is not enough to bring this case within the public building exception to governmental immunity.\u201d <em>Wade, supra </em>at 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In contesting defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition, plaintiff asserted that pursuant to the public building exception, he was obligated to establish the source of the substance on the floor in order to prove that the accumulation was the result of some building defect. Plaintiff argues that since no source was alleged in the complaint or the prisoner\u2019s accident report, he should be allowed to develop facts to show that a building defect caused the accumulation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial court, after reviewing only pleadings, found that the mere accumulation of grease or oil did not amount to a defect in the building itself, and therefore, plaintiff did not properly establish facts in his complaint that would have avoided governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded on the grounds that the physical condition of the floor was a physical condition of the building itself. The Court stressed that the result, a slippery floor, is the same regardless of whether the dangerous condition is caused by an accumulation of oil or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>grease rather than a defect in the building itself.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Court relied on the <em>pre-Reardon </em>case of <em>Ray, supra. </em>In light of our holding in <em>Reardon, </em>we find the interpretation of the public building exception in <em>Ray </em>overly broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">In the instant case, the Court of Appeals opined that <em>Ray, </em>was still good law after <em>Reardon. </em>It rejected an interpretation of <em>Reardon </em>that would find the public building exception inapplicable to these facts because the condition was not part of the building itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">We do not agree. The assertion in <em>Ray </em>that a governmental entity is held to the same standards as private landowners, <em>Ray, supra </em>at 63, is not consistent with the finding in <em>Ross </em>of a clear legislative judgment to treat public and private tortfeasors differently. <em>Ross, supra </em>at 618. Mere negligence by \u00e1 governmental agency does not trigger liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">In sum, we conclude that the public building exception is to be narrowly construed, and does not encompass claims of negligent janitorial care. A spill on the floor does not become part of the building itself by virtue of the risk of injury it may create for the plaintiff. Moreover, we do not believe the Legislature intended \"dangerous or defective condition of a public building\u201d to refer to such transitory conditions. The use of the ninety-day period for conclusively presuming knowledge, as well as the reference to time to \"repair\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>defect, reinforces our belief that the public building exception does not encompass transitory conditions or ordinary daily maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In the present case, plaintiff\u2019s claim alleges no more than mere negligence: that grease, oil, food, and water were allowed to accumulate on the floor. This accumulation was the transitory condition which caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury. Furthermore, no defect of the public building itself was pleaded. We find, therefore, that plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and the trial court properly granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b375-7\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley, Boyle, Griffin,. and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-11\"> The public building exception to governmental immunity, MCL 691.1406; MSA 3.996(106), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-12\">Governmental agencies have the obligation to repair and maintain public buildings under their control when open for use by members of the public.

That obligation, the first stated prong of the building exception, is specifically and separately stated in the sentence immediately preceding the sentence stating the second prong, that a governmental agency is subject to liability for damage resulting from a \"dangerous or defective condition\u201d of a public building.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">A governmental agency is thus subject to liability under the building exception where it has failed to repair <em>and maintain </em>a public building, without regard to whether the failure to repair and maintain also constitutes a \"dangerous or defective condition.\u201d This Court, in <em>Reardon v Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>430 Mich 398; 424 NW2d 248 (1988), otherwise regarded by the majority as \"controlling,\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> recognized that the building exception states two separate obligations: \"The <em>\u00f1rst sentence </em>[of the building exception] imposes upon governmental agencies the duty to 'repair and maintain public buildings under their control . . . .\u2019<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \"In <em>addition, the second sentence </em>of the exception imposes liability on governmental agencies for injuries 'resulting from a dangerous or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>defective condition <em>of </em>a public building . . . .\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis supplied in <em>Reardon.)</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Nor is there justification for the majority\u2019s conclusion that the \"dangerous or defective condition\u201d prong of the building exception should be limited by judicial construction</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">\u2014to exclude a dangerous or defective condition that is \"transitory,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u2014to include only a dangerous or defective condition that relates to the \"permanent structure or physical integrity of the building,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">\u2014to a dangerous or defective condition caused by a fault of a governmental agency more egregious than \"[m]ere negligence.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">The words \"transitory\u201d and \"permanent structure or physical integrity of the building\u201d and words establishing a standard of fault more egregious than \"mere negligence\u201d do not appear in the building exception. Nor are such words, or the concepts they convey, so today added by the majority by judicial construction,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> consistent with either a literal reading of, or a purpose of, the building exception, both identified by the majority and supported in the history of the governmental tort liability act or in the development, in Michigan and elsewhere, of statutory delineation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>scope of governmental immunity and of exceptions providing for governmental liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">In <em>Reardon, </em>this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">In light of the <em>historical context </em>in which the statute was enacted, as well as the <em>language chosen </em>by the Legislature, and the generally broad scope of immunity, we hold that the Legislature intended the public building exception to apply in cases where the injury is occasioned by the <em>physical condition </em>of the building itself.[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">\"Physical condition\u201d was not limited in <em>Reardon, to </em>a condition that relates to the \"permanent structure or physical integrity of the building.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">The majority argues that \"use of the ninety-day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>period for conclusively presuming knowledge, as well as the reference to time to 'repair\u2019 the defect,\u201d supports a belief that the building exception \"does not encompass transitory conditions or ordinary daily maintenance.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The argument ignores that the statutory requirement that a governmental agency have knowledge of, and reasonable time to remedy, the condition applies in terms only under the second stated prong, \"dangerous or defective condition of a public building,\u201d and not under the first stated prong, \"repair and maintain public buildings,\u201d of the building exception. See n 1 for text of the building exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The majority\u2019s argument also ignores that an injured person might show that the requisite knowledge was in fact acquired, and that there was also a reasonable opportunity to remedy, within minutes or hours, long before the lapse of ninety days when the governmental agency is conclusively deemed to have knowledge and time to repair. An accumulation of grease or oil might be remedied within minutes or hours of the governmental agency acquiring knowledge, and, remedied or unremedied, concerns the \"physical condition\u201d of the floor and hence of the building itself.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The majority\u2019s statement of this argument additionally ignores that the statute imposes, under the first prong, an obligation to \"repair and <em>maintain\u201d </em>not <em>merely an </em>obligation, as stated in the majority opinion, to \" 'repair\u2019 the defect.\u201d The obligation is actually stated in the statute as an obligation to \"repair and maintain public buildings under their control.\u201d The majority in <em>Reardon, </em>quite correctly, read this as meaning an obligation to \" 'repair <em>or </em>maintain.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">In the instant case, Wade does not assert that the grease or oil accumulated because of a structural defect.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In another case, however, the \"transitory\u201d grease or oil might have accumulated in a crevice in the floor or because the floor, as a result of poor design or poor construction, is slanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The majority relies heavily on <em>Reardon, supra. </em>There the plaintiffs sought to recover, under the building exception, for injuries suffered as a result of a sexual, assault by an employee of the Department of Mental Health on a nursing student, and for a sexual assault on a mentally retarded resident of a facility operated by the department. The plaintiffs alleged that the absence of a method of securely locking the door of a dormitory room, in one case, and the floor plan of a ward, in the other, constituted \"dangerous or defective conditions\u201d of facilities operated by the department.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The Court, in <em>Reardon, </em>observed that \"the assaults were the result of the act of an intervening party rather than a dangerous or defective condition of the building itself,\u201d and stated, and I continue to agree, that \"the Legislature intended to impose a <em>duty to maintain safe public buildings, </em>but not necessarily safety in public buildings\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>concluded \"that the public building exception does not apply <em>under the facts of these cases\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The majority in the instant case states that although <em>Reardon </em>is \"factually distinguishable from the instant case, the holding in <em>Reardon </em>delineating the public building exception is <em>controlling\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">It is unclear on what basis the majority concludes that <em>Reardon </em>is controlling. I agreed with the dispositions in <em>Reardon, </em>read the opinion of the Court as deciding a lawsuit, not as a tour de force, and signed the opinion of the Court. The \"holding\u201d in <em>Reardon </em>is not even pertinent to, let alone controlling of, the correct resolution of the issue presented for the first time in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Courts in other jurisdictions have concluded, as did this Court in <em>Reardon, </em>that a governmental agency is not subject to liability for physical assaults under a statutory building exception worded much like this state\u2019s building exception, and yet have concluded that a governmental agency is subject to liability for a \"transitory\u201d dangerous condition<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>and for a maintenance failure.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The constant reiteration in the instant case of the phrase \"of the building <em>itself\u201d </em>taken from <em>Reardon, </em>suggests that, although that phraseology was indeed used in <em>Reardon </em>\u2014 in the context of distinguishing between an assault by an \"intervening party\u201d and \"a condition <em>of </em>the building itself \u201d \u2014the word \"of\u201d and the word \"itself\u201d mean to the majority that, in construing the exception, the word \"building\u201d is so far paramount that it trumps \"dangerous or defective\u201d and mandates judicial desuetude for \"repair and maintain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The majority then expands \"of the building itself\u201d by adding a gloss limiting \"building\u201d to \"permanent structure or physical integrity of the building.\u201d Having made that leap, the majority continues its activism, expanding the judicially created limitations by adding, as well, the \"transitory\u201d and the \"more-than-negligence\u201d limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">The majority argues that grease or oil on a hallway floor is a condition <em>in </em>a building and not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>condition <em>of </em>the building,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and therefore is not a \"condition of the building itself.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> To be sure, a condition in or on a floor of a building is a condition in a building because a floor is in the building. A condition, in or on a floor, is nonetheless also a condition of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">If a floor of a building was structurally uneven, it would be both a condition <em>in </em>the building and a condition <em>of </em>the building. That such a condition is <em>in </em>the building does not mean that it is not also a condition <em>of </em>the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The emphatic appositive \"itself\u201d means \"that identical one,\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and adds nothing, when employed in a judicial opinion, to, nor can it modify, \"building,\u201d the word used in the statute. \"Itself,\u201d when employed in a judicial opinion, means in this context \"that very building.\u201d The use of \"itself\u201d in <em>Reardon </em>did not and could not change the meaning of \"building,\u201d the word used in the statute without \"itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">This Court is called upon in this case to expound concerning the building exception, not <em>Reardon. </em>As appears from the majority opinion, opinions of this Court are increasingly ephemeral. The statute is more enduring.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">The majority appears to read out of the statute, for the time being or until possibly the next case, both the first prong, \"repair and maintain,\u201d and the second prong, \"dangerous or defective condition,\u201d of the building exception._</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>In the next case, the Court could continue in the direction in which it appears to be headed and declare, on the basis of the analysis and language employed in the instant case, that \"of the building itself \u201d includes only the roof and four outer walls,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> but then only if the governmental agency has, possibly, been reckless or <em>grossly </em>negligent, not \"merely\u201d negligent, in selecting the contractor who installed the roof and four outer walls, but not if there was a design<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> or foundation defect because a design or foundation defect is not \"of the building itself \u201d \u2014 a foundation defect is not in or of the building, but underneath the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The majority has developed its construction of the meaning of the building exception without considering either decisions in other jurisdictions construing similar statutory language or whether the limitations it has imposed by judicial construction are consistent with the construction this Court has, in earlier decisions, placed on the highway<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>and motor vehicle<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Courts in other jurisdictions, construing \"dangerous condition of <em>a </em>public building,\u201d have concluded that failures of maintenance are included.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Statutes in a number of other jurisdictions use the term \"property\u201d or \"real estate\u201d rather than \"building\u201d in stating the exception.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> I would read the legislative intent in using the word \"building,\u201d rather than \"property\u201d or \"real estate,\u201d as excluding parks and recreational facilities, but not as excluding areas that are part of the curtilage of the building. Such a construction would be consistent with the constr\u00fcction of the building exception by this Court in <em>Pichette v Manistique Public Schools, </em>403 Mich 268; 269 NW2d 143 (1978),<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> and</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>with a correct construction of the highway exception.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Such a construction would also be consistent with the statement in <em>Reardon </em>that the Legislature imposed \"a duty to <em>maintain </em>safe public buildings.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">On extensive research of the statutes of other states, no case has been found <em>in any jurisdiction </em>limiting recovery under a building exception to a \"condition\u201d that relates to the \"permanent structure or physical integrity of the building\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> or that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>would exclude \"transitory\u201d conditions. Recovery for \"mere negligence\u201d is the most usual basis of recovery in other jurisdictions under a building exception, and also under highway and motor vehicle exceptions. No case was found imposing a higher standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">A number of cases were found where the courts held that a governmental agency was subject to liability for maintenance failures under statutes worded similarly to the Michigan statute, i.e., liability was imposed for a dangerous condition <em>of </em>a building, or for failure to maintain.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">This Court has not imposed with respect to the highway and motor vehicle exceptions the \"transitory,\u201d \"permanent structure or physical integrity,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>or \"mere negligence\u201d limitations imposed today with respect to the building exception.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Imposing such limitations with respect to the building exception is not consistent with this Court\u2019s decisions construing the other exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567; 363 NW2d 641 (1984), in justification of its construction of the building exception, is misplaced. <em>Ross </em>concerned the meaning of the term \"governmental function\u201d as used in the section of the governmental tort liability act stating that a governmental agency shall be immune from tort liability when \"engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">While <em>Ross </em>does indicate that a majority of the Court took a broad view of the scope of the term \"governmental function,\u201d and was of the opinion that the scope of the term embraced most governmental activities, it does not follow that the Court, as then constituted, would have read the building exception or any of the other exceptions providing for governmental liability as narrowly as the Court today reads the building exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">In all events, the correct construction of the highway, automobile and building exceptions, subjecting governmental agencies .to liability, were not in issue in any of the nine cases consolidated in Ross._</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b375-10\"> Governmental agencies have the obligation to repair and maintain public buildings under their control when open for use by members of the public.

Knowledge of the dangerous and defective condition of the public building and time to repair the same shall be conclusively presumed when such defect existed so as to be readily apparent to an ordinary observant person for a period of 90 days or longer before the injury took place.

In an opinion joined by four other justices on the public building exception issue, Justice Fitzgerald held that the Legislature intended that the statutory exceptions to governmental immunity impose upon governmental entities the duty to maintain safe public places. <em>Id. </em>at 285. Thus, the Court found the building exception applicable to the admittedly dangerous and defective slide, despite the fact that the slide itself was not a building. See also <em>Tilford v Wayne Co General Hosp, </em>403 Mich 293; 269 NW2d 153 (1978) (building exception applicable where plaintiff injured on sidewalk immediately adjacent to hospital). This legislative purpose to maintain safe public places was later echoed in <em>Bush, supra </em>at 731-732 (public building exception applicable where claimed defect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>is absence of safety features), and <em>Lockaby v Wayne Co, </em>406 Mich 65, 76-77; 276 NW2d 1 (1979) (building exception applicable where plaintiff alleged lack of padding in cell where he was being held).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">In <em>Tilford, supra, </em>this Court concluded that the entrance walk of a public building was within the building exception. No one opinion was signed by four justices, but in opinions written by Justices Fitzgerald, Moody and Ryan, six justices so agreed. Justice Ryan\u2019s commentary on the argument that an entrance sidewalk is not within the building exception applies with equal force to the suggestion that the condition of a floor of a public building is not within the building exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">The defendant argues that the Legislature, in employing the term \"building,\u201d intended to impose liability on governmental agencies that was extremely narrow in scope and applicable only to acts or omissions in connection with the care and maintenance of the walled, roofed edifice itself and no more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">In my view, that is an inappropriately narrow reading of the legislation and of the legislative purpose. <em>[Id., </em>p 303.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b387-10\"> See <em>Scheurman v Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>434 Mich 619; 456 NW2d 66 (1990), opinion by Boyle, J., p 637, opinion by Brickley, J., p 637.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b387-11\"> <em>Reardon, supra, </em>p 415 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b387-12\"> While New Mexico courts at one time required a finding of \"physical defect\u201d in a building, this \"narrower view\u201d has been abandoned in more recent cases.
