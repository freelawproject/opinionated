We conclude that the local township board of trustees in this case acted within its authority under the sca and <em>Arrowhead.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">On December 15, 1987, Meridian Township granted the developer plaintiffs\u2019 request to rezone a fifty-three-acre parcel of property north of Haslett Road in Meridian Township for single-family, medium density residential development. The proposed subdivision plan submitted in connection with the rezoning provided for two access routes to Haslett Road. The first was an indirect access at the western end of the development, connecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>via a stub street, Wood Knoll Drive, to an existing subdivision cul-de-sac, Creekwood Lane, which in turn opens onto Haslett Road.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The second was a direct boulevard access opening directly onto Haslett Road at the eastern end of the development. The development of the overall subdivision was apparently envisioned in four stages, although the parties dispute whether it was understood, at the time of the rezoning, whether the direct access road would be built contemporaneously with the first stage of the development, or would not be completed until later stages of the development.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">In any event, the developer submitted a preliminary plat for the first phase of the development, entitled Meadowbrook Estates, on March 2, 1988. This plat proposed construction of twenty-five new homes on an 8.8-acre parcel at the eastern end of the overall development area. For this initial phase of the development, access to Haslett Road was to be provided only through Creekwood Lane, and not through the direct boulevard access. As required by the sca, the developer submitted the plat to the Ingham County Health Department, the Ingham County Drain Commission, and the Ingham County Road Commission, and obtained the necessary approvals. The road commission, however, imposed the condition, not challenged by the developer, that a direct access route to Haslett Road be built for hauling and construction purposes. The Tri-County Regional Planning Commission and the Haslett Public Schools also approved the plat.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>The Meridian Township Planning Commission conducted a public hearing on the plat on June 20, 1988, and heard evidence that increased traffic from the proposed development would aggravate an already dangerous traffic condition at the intersection of Creekwood Lane and Haslett Road. Nevertheless, the planning commission approved the plat on July 11, 1988, by a vote of five to three, with two of the dissenting commissioners expressing concern about the increased traffic load on the Creekwood-Haslett intersection. The planning commission\u2019s approval was subject to six conditions, none challenged by the developer. The fifth condition was that future development beyond the twenty-five homes of phase one would require the construction of the proposed direct access route to Haslett Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The Meridian Township Board of Trustees, the final local authority with regard to plat approval, considered the proposed plat at its regular meeting of September 20, 1988, and disapproved it by a vote of five to one. At meetings on October 3 and November 22, 1988, the board amended the minutes of its September 20 meeting to specify the reasons for its disapproval of the plat and the key condition of approval, which were adopted by a vote of five to two, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-7\">(1) The subdivision is designed in such a way as to encourage use of Creekwood [Lane] by through traffic. Such a design is not consistent with Section 101-4.12(a) of the subdivision regulations, which states that streets shall be so arranged so as to discourage their use by through traffic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>(2) The alignment of Wood Knoll Drive provides sole access onto Creekwood [Lane], which requires egress onto Haslett Road at a point where there is less than 750 feet of sight distance \u2014 in violation of Section VII.B.1 of the County Road Commission Plat Procedures. It would be practical for the proprietor to provide access to Haslett Road farther to the east, where there is 750 feet of sight distance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The developer filed suit to overturn the disapproval of his plat on November 3, 1988, contending that (1) the township board failed properly to approve or disapprove the plat within ninety days of filing, with reasons for disapproval and conditions for approval stated in writing, in accordance with SCA \u00a7 112(2), and (2) the township board lacked substantive authority under the sca and <em>Arrowhead, supra, </em>to disapprove the plat and condition its approval on the requirement that the developer build the direct access route to Haslett Road. The Ingham Circuit Court, on February 1, 1989, granted the township\u2019s motion for summary disposition, rejecting the developer\u2019s \u00a7 112(2) claim, finding that the board\u2019s disapproval of the plat was supported by SCA \u00a7 182(4)(a), and distinguishing <em>Arrowhead. </em>The court also stated, in its oral opinion of January 25, 1989, that the township board was entitled to require the developer to build an entrance to Haslett Road more than 750 feet east of the Creekwood-Haslett intersection, thereby indicating that the court also endorsed the board\u2019s reliance upon \u00a7 VII.B.1 of the road commission plat procedures. The developer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s ruling with regard to the \u00a7 112(2) issue,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but reversed with regard to SCA \u00a7 182(4)(a) and \u00a7 VII.B.l of the road commission plat procedures, and held that the township board\u2019s condition for approval violated the rule of <em>Arrowhead.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Court remanded the case to the circuit court to consider whether the township board\u2019s action was justified under \u00a7 101-4.12(a) of the Meridian Township Subdivision Regulations. The township applied for leave to appeal to this Court. In lieu of granting leave to appeal, we remanded the case to the circuit court for clarification of its ruling, while retaining jurisdiction. 437 Mich 1022 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">On June 25, 1991, the circuit court clarified its opinion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-7\">In the opinion granting summary disposition to Defendant (issued from the bench on January 25, 1989), this Court did, indeed, view Haslett Road as the existing public street and Creekwood [Lane] as not being \"suitable access\u201d to that public street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-8\">The Court recognizes that Creekwood is literally, a public street itself, and that it provides <em>some </em>access to the outside world.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-9\">The issue is whether the legislature authorized a township to decide whether such a residential street provides \"suitable\u201d access. In this Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>view the legislature did grant that authority, and the township may withhold permission to develop the plat until suitable access is provided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">We then granted leave to appeal, 439 Mich 868 (1991), and we now reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, finding ourselves in agreement with the reasoning of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">A. THE TOWNSHIP BOARD\u2019S STATUTORY AUTHORITY</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">The authority of local governing bodies to approve and disapprove proposed subdivision plats is created and governed by the sca. SCA \u00a7 106 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-8\">No approving authority or agency having the power to approve or reject plats shall condition approval upon compliance with, or base a rejection upon, any requirement other than those included in [SCA \u00a7 ] 105.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">SCA \u00a7 105 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-10\">Approval of preliminary and final plats shall be conditioned upon compliance with:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-11\">(a) The provisions of this act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-12\">(b) Any ordinance or published rules of a municipality or county adopted to carry out the provisions of this act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-13\">(c) Any published rules of a county drain commissioner, county road commission, or county plat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>board adopted to carry out the provisions of this act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">In this case, the township board asserts three grounds for its rejection of the developer\u2019s proposed plat, one deriving from each quoted subsection. The board argues that its action is supported by (1) a \"provision[ ] of this act,\u201d namely, SCA \u00a7 182(4)(a), (2) a \"published rule[ ] of a municipality,\u201d namely, \u00a7 101-4.12(a) of the Meridian Township Subdivision Regulations, and (3) a \"published rule[ ] of a ... county road commission,\u201d namely, \u00a7 VII.B.l of the Ingham County Road Commission Procedures for Plat Street Development.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">We do not address the validity of the township board\u2019s reliance upon \u00a7 101-4.12(a) of the subdivision regulations, in view of the fact that neither the circuit court nor the Court of Appeals has passed on that issue, and we find that we need pot address that issue in order to resolve this case. The three issues before this Court are the validity of SCA \u00a7 182(4)(a) and \u00a7 VII.B.l of the road commission plat procedures as bases for the township board\u2019s action and the relevance of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Arrowhead.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">B. SCA \u00a7 182(4)(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">Section 182(4)(a) of the sca states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>The governing body shall . . . [r]eject a plat which is isolated from or which isolates other lands from existing public streets, <em>unless suitable access is provided. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">The Court of Appeals held that \u00a7 182(4)(a)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-5\">does not apply to the instant situation since access to the subdivision is gained by Creekwood [Lane], an existing public street. Nor does the plat isolate any other lands from any public streets. [Slip op, p 4.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">This interpretation would preclude rejecting any plat on the basis of \u00a7 182(4)(a) unless it were <em>totally </em>isolated, without regard for the suitability of whatever minimal access to <em>some </em>public street is provided. The interpretation thus effectively rewrites \u00a7 182(4)(a) so as to eliminate the requirement of <em>\"suitable </em>access.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A9O\">While \"isolated\u201d generally connotes detachment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>or separation, it is a common and ordinary usage of the term to employ it in referring to a <em>relatively </em>remote or inaccessible place or area, even though there may well be \"some access\u201d to such an area.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is thus a fair usage of the term to say that the proposed twenty-five-home subdivision in this case would be relatively \"isolated\u201d from Haslett Road, the main public street nearby, and therefore relatively isolated \"from existing public streets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">In any event, reading \u00a7 182(4)(a) as an integrated whole, it clearly provides that the remedy for \"isolation\u201d is to provide <em>\"suitable </em>access.\u201d Not just <em>any </em>access, or <em>some </em>access, but <em>suitable </em>access. It. would contradict ordinary usage to deem <em>any </em>access, no matter how minimal or inconvenient, to automatically constitute <em>suitable </em>access. One standard dictionary defines \"suitable\u201d as \"[appropriate to a given purpose or occasion,\u201d and offers such synonyms as \"fit, . . . meet, proper, appropriate, apt, fitting, happy, [and] felicitous.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: New College Edition </em>(1982), pp 1217, 508. \"Suitable . . . implies ability to meet requirements related to a particular need or to an occasion . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">Under the Court of Appeals interpretation, if a plat starts out <em>totally </em>isolated from <em>any </em>public street, a township is free to reject the plat until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>and unless access is provided to the plat that the township finds to be \"suitable\u201d \u2014 that is, apt, fitting, appropriate, and able to meet the requirements of the particular situation. But if a plat starts out relatively isolated from existing public streets, but possessing some minimal access via a single entrance, as in the instant case, then \u00a7 182(4)(a) allegedly does not even apply. The existing access must automatically be deemed \"suitable\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 182(4)(a), no matter how inapt, inconvenient, inadequate, and in fact <em>unsuitable, </em>such access may be. This is an incongruous interpretation. Cf. <em>Franges v General Motors Corp, </em>404 Mich 590, 612; 274 NW2d 392 (1979) (\"statutes should be construed to prevent absurdity, hardship, injustice or prejudice to the public interest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">The Court of Appeals interpretation, in effect, rewrites \u00a7 182(4)(a) to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-5\">The governing body shall . . . [r]eject a plat which is <em>totally </em>isolated from or which <em>totally </em>isolates other lands from <em>any </em>existing public street, unless <em>some </em>access is provided <em>to any existing public street. </em>[Emphasized words added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The effective excision of the term \"suitable\u201d from \u00a7 182(4)(a) violates, of course, the familiar principle of statutory construction that \"[e]very word of a statute should be given meaning and no word should be treated as surplusage or rendered nugatory if at all possible.\u201d <em>Baker v General Motors Corp, </em>409 Mich 639, 665; 297 NW2d 387 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">At the very least, the foregoing analysis demonstrates that the meaning of \u00a7 182(4)(a) is open to serious question and cannot be resolved on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>basis of a purely mechanical or literal interpretation. This brings into play the broader principles that govern our interpretation of the sca. Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 34 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-6\">The provisions of this constitution <em>and law </em>concerning counties, townships, cities and villages shall be liberally construed in their favor. <em>Powers granted to counties and townships by this constitution and by law shall include those fairly implied and not prohibited by this constitution. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">We just recently reaffirmed the importance of this principle of liberal construction. See <em>Adams Outdoor Advertising v East Lansing, </em>439 Mich 209, 218, n 14; 483 NW2d 38 (1992). Furthermore, as we have held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-8\">The primary and fundamental rule of constitutional or statutory construction is that the Court\u2019s duty is to ascertain the purpose and intent as expressed in the constitutional or legislative provision in question. Also, while intent must be inferred from the language used, it is not the meaning of the particular words only in the abstract or their strictly grammatical construction alone that governs. The words are to be applied to the subject matter and to the general scope of the provision, and they are to be considered in light of the general purpose sought to be accomplished or the evil sought to be remedied by the constitution or statute. <em>[White v Ann Arbor, </em>406 Mich 554, 562; 281 NW2d 283 (1979).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">Thus, the township board\u2019s authority under \u00a7 182(4)(a) must be broadly and liberally construed in light of the stated legislative purposes of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>Subdivision Control Act, which, as set forth in the act\u2019s preamble, are, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-4\">[T]o promote the public health, safety and general welfare; to further the orderly layout and use of land; . . . [arid] to provide for proper ingress and egress to lots ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The township board\u2019s authority to determine whether the access provided to a proposed subdivision is \"suitable,\u201d above and beyond the minimal existence of <em>any </em>access to <em>any </em>existing public street, flows naturally from \u00a7 182(4)(a) when that provision is interpreted in light of the principles set forth above. The township board\u2019s ability to ensure \"suitability\u201d of access clearly serves the stated legislative concerns relating to public safety, the orderly use of land, and proper ingress to and egress from lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">In sum, we conclude that while Creekwood Lane is, technically, a public street and would provide <em>some </em>access to the outside world for the proposed subdivision, the township board was entitled to conclude that Creekwood Lane would not provide <em>suitable </em>access to the subdivision in light of all the circumstances, in particular the safety concerns regarding the Creekwood-Haslett intersection discussed more fully in part 11(c). Therefore, \u00a7 182(4)(a) supports the township board\u2019s disapproval of the proposed plat.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">C. <em>ARROWHEAD</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">Finally, the condition for plat approval imposed by the township board in this case \u2014 that the devel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>oper construct a direct access route from his initial proposed plat to Haslett Road, across the developer\u2019s own land slated for eventual development and as envisioned by the developer\u2019s own overall development plan \u2014 does not conflict with this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Arrowhead. </em>The contrary argument rests on a strained and overbroad reading of <em>Arrowhead </em>that disregards the many distinguishing features of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">In <em>Arrowhead, </em>the developer submitted for approval a subdivision plat adjoining Chilson Road, a public county road. A steep hill on Chilson Road threatened to create a hazardous sight obstruction for traffic entering and leaving the proposed subdivision by Navajo Trail, one of three planned entrances to the subdivision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Livingston County Road Commission approved the plat subject to the condition that the developer remove the hill on Chilson Road and perform related regrading and resurfacing work to eliminate the sight obstruction. See <em>id., </em>413 Mich 507-509. We stated the dispositive issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-7\">Whether a county road commission has authority to require a subdivision developer to make improvements on a county road located entirely outside the platted subdivision as a condition precedent to plat approval .... <em>[Id. </em>at 510.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Not surprisingly, we answered the question in the negative. In the first place, we noted that the county road law, MCL 224.21; MSA 9.121, places upon counties themselves the duty to maintain and improve public county roads, and specifies borrowing and taxation as the permissible methods for financing such improvements, not the imposition of such costs on the developers of nearby subdivisions. 413 Mich 512-513. In the second place, we noted that the sca simply did not authorize a condition such as that imposed by the road commission in <em>Arrowhead. Id. </em>at 513-516. The only purported statutory basis for the disputed condition was SCA \u00a7 183(1)(b), which provides that a road commission may require \"[a]dequate provision for traffic safety in laying out drives <em>which enter county roads and streets </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This clearly did not authorize a requirement that the developer improve the county road itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">We expressly emphasized two other crucially important factors in <em>Arrowhead. </em>First, we noted that conditioning plat approval on the developer\u2019s improvement of land totally outside his own property would exceed the authority of local governments under the sca because \"only the parcel or tract of land <em>in which the proprietor has an ownership interest </em>can be partitioned or divided by him . . . .\u201d 413 Mich 517 (emphasis added). \"[W]e think the Legislature cannot be said to have intended implicitly to extend the requirements of \u00a7 183(1)(b) to roads outside the subdivision which are not required to be shown on a plat.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Second, we noted that serious constitutional problems might arise from requiring a developer to improve a public road, conferring substantial benefits on other persons and property, without any compensation or allocation of costs.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-6\">[N]owhere does there exist any statutory provision defining suitable standards governing cost allocation of off-site improvements. Apart from the constitutionality of the proposed exaction in this case, a question we neither reach nor decide, it is clear that it would be impermissible to impose the entire cost of an off-site improvement on a single subdivision developer <em>where other persons or property would be specially bene\u00f1ted. [Id. </em>at 519. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Significantly, this Court noted in <em>Arrowhead </em>that \"under \u00a7 183(1)(b) the commission <em>could have required that Arrowhead lay out Navajo Trail in a way which would locate its intersection with Chilson Road at a safe distance from the hazardous sight obstruction . . . .\u201d </em>413 Mich 518 (emphasis added). This hypothetical condition bears a remarkable similarity to the condition that the township board has imposed in this case, which is essentially that the developer locate the main access road to his subdivision at a safe distance from the sight obstruction (the s-curve) on Haslett Road. The developer in this case has not been asked to remedy the sight obstruction on the county road itself, as was the developer in <em>Arrowhead.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>The distinctions between this case and <em>Arrowhead </em>are thus self-evident and fundamental. The disputed condition in this case would not require the developer to undertake any improvement of public land, or of any land outside his own property that he himself has slated for eventual development. The required access road would not confer any special benefits on the public or on other persons or property; it would primarily benefit the developer\u2019s own property and would further his overall development plans. As discussed in part ii(b), the township board has ample statutory authority to require that the developer provide for safe and suitable access to his own proposed subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">While the required access road would extend beyond the boundaries of the initial plat submitted by the developer, it does not constitute, as did the county road in <em>Arrowhead, </em>a road \"outside the subdivision which [is] not 'required to be shown on a plat.\u2019 \u201d 413 Mich 518. To the contrary, the required access road would traverse the developer\u2019s own property across the overall planned subdivision, which the developer himself has already slated for eventual platting and development.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">In sum, nothing more has been asked of the developer in this case than that he develop his own property in a manner consistent with governing statutes, local regulations, and legitimate safety concerns. The duty to provide suitable access in accordance with such statutes and regulations rests with the developer. The township board\u2019s request in furtherance of that goal does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>not in any way conflict with <em>Arrowhead, </em>and is, indeed, arguably endorsed by Arrowhead.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">The courts cannot sit in judgment on the precise merits of the myriad discretionary and factbound decisions reached every day by democratically elected local governing bodies in the area of zoning and development. We can only review whether local governing bodies have discharged their powers in a manner consistent with applicable law. We find no basis for concluding that the township board has done otherwise in this case. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b846-8\">Levin, Boyle, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-5\"> The existing Creekwood Lane subdivision contains twenty-five homes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b834-10\"> This procedural issue does not arise before this Court because the developer did not file any cross-application for leave to appeal from the Court of Appeals decision, and the issue was not raised in the township\u2019s application for leave to appeal.

Such a general policy could not, however, reasonably operate to preclude the township board from assessing the particular safe-access and other issues posed by each development. Equally untenable is the suggestion that the township\u2019s prior consent to the construction of the existing Wood Knoll Drive stub street adjoining Creekwood Lane constituted some sort of irrevocable advance consent to the development of any new subdivisions seeking to use that stub street for access. See <em>post, </em>pp 643-644. The township was not under any legal requirement, \"at the time the Creekwood subdivision was developed,\u201d <em>post, </em>p 644, to give advance notice of what hypothetical future subdivisions adjoining Creekwood Lane it might approve or disapprove, and on what grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b838-9\"> See MCL 8.3a; MSA 2.212(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-10\">All words and phrases shall be construed and understood according to the common and approved usage of the language; but technical words and phrases, and such as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law, shall be construed and understood according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b842-8\"> The original proposed plat in <em>Arrowhead </em>had shown Navajo Trail as an internal cul-de-sac not connecting to Chilson Road.

See <em>Arrowhead, </em>413 Mich 509. This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Arrowhead </em>was influenced by the fact that the road commission itself had, in a sense, created the sight obstruction hazard that it then demanded the developer fix by making improvements to Chilson Road itself.

But we are aware of no authority, and the dissent cites none, that would preclude the local governing body from considering the full context of the submitted plat and any available, competent evidence bearing upon the plat, including related rezoning plans, in reaching an informed decision to approve or disapprove the plat, as long as the governing body acts in full accordance with the sca and any other applicable laws.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b846-9\">Riley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALA\">(dissenting). This case arises out of the rejection by defendants township and township <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>board of a plat submitted by plaintiffs-developer. Because I believe that the township lacked authority to reject the plat pursuant, to the Subdivision Control Act, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals reversing the grant of summary disposition in favor of defendants and remanding to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">I dissent from my colleagues because SCA \u00a7 182(4)(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides for rejection by the governing body of a plat that \"is isolated from or which isolates other lands from existing public streets, unless <em>suitable </em>access is provided.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Defendants assert that a plat is to be considered \"isolated\u201d where there is no \"suitable\u201d access. Because the Creekwood-Haslett intersection is considered dangerous and unsafe, access to the proposed plat is not \"suitable,\u201d and the plat is thus \"isolated.\u201d Defendants conclude, therefore, that it properly rejected plaintiffs\u2019 proposed plat because it was isolated and did not provide for suitable access.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">As conceded by the circuit judge, \"Creekwood is literally, a public street itself, and . . . provides <em>some </em>access to the outside world.\u201d The Court of Appeals also found that \"\u00a7 182(4) does not apply to the instant situation since access to the subdivision is gained by Creekwood Drive, an existing public street.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Twenty-five homes currently utilize Creekwood. Creekwood in fact is already equipped to accommodate an extension to a new subdivision by way of the stub street that was constructed as part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>Creekwood subdivision. The developer of the Creekwood subdivision, a different developer than in the present appeal, was permitted to prepare Creekwood for additional traffic in the future. In addition, the township has a policy of allowing single access routes for developments of fifty homes or less. Plaintiffs planned the size of the initial plat in conformance with that policy. The Creekwood subdivision has twenty-five homes, and plaintiffs\u2019 proposed development consists of twenty-five homes. Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed plat not only has access to a public street that is currently used for vehicular traffic, but, by the policy of the township, plaintiffs complied with the number of residences that could employ a single access to larger public routes. Had the township desired to limit the access to Creekwood, it would not have allowed the building of the stub street, and would have indicated at the time the Creekwood subdivision was developed that its own policy of allowing single accesses to developments of fifty homes or less would not apply to that subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Furthermore, the finding that the defendants\u2019 rejection of plaintiffs\u2019 plat was unwarranted is consistent with a fair reading of the sca and applicable Michigan case law. Approving authorities, such as defendant township board, have no inherent power to approve or reject a proposed development plat. Any power they do have is given by the Legislature, through the sca.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>106 of the sca mandates that an approving authority consider only the requirements enumerated in \u00a7 105 when determining whether to approve or reject a plat.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 105, in part pertinent to the instant case, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">Approval of preliminary and final plats shall be conditioned upon compliance with:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-5\">(a) The provisions of this act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-6\">(b) Any ordinance or published rules of a municipality or county adopted to carry out the provisions of this act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-7\">(c) Any published rules of a county drain commissioner, county road commission, or county plat board adopted to carry out the provisions of this act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">In the instant case, defendants argue that they assumed a secondary access to Haslett Road would be built because it was included in plaintiffs\u2019 larger plan submitted with their rezoning request. Proper zoning is a prerequisite to plat approval. <em>Oakland Court v York Twp, </em>128 Mich App 199, 201; 339 NW2d 873 (1983). A zoning plan is not, however, a plat for purposes of the sca. Because the governing body must act only within the limits of authority given to it by the sca, it must rely only upon a plat submitted pursuant to the sca, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>rather than a plan submitted for rezoning purposes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\"><em>Our decision in Arrowhead Development Co v Livingston Co Road Comm, </em>413 Mich 505; 322 NW2d 702 (1982), does not control the issue in the instant case. Whether or not an alteration could be required outside the plat, but on land owned by the developer and intended to be part of the same subdivision, was not at issue in <em>Arrowhead. </em>The road commission in <em>Arrowhead </em>required that the developer make several alterations to his plat before approval would be granted. Of all the requirements, only the one which involved land outside the submitted plat was stricken by this Court as unwarranted. The commission could have required the developer to relocate Navajo Trail, a road entirely within the boundaries of the proposed plat. 413 Mich 518. Improvements upon the county road which abutted the developer\u2019s property could not be required, for they were entirely outside the land to be partitioned and divided by the developer. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Other cases cited by the parties do not support a contrary result. The <em>pre-Arrowhead </em>decision of <em>Carlson v City of Troy</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>reflects simply that a governing body has no authority to reject a plat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>aside from that given to it by the sca. Therefore, the rejection of a plat not supported by provisions of the sca, or by an ordinance enacted to carry out the provisions of the sca, was improper, and the city could not require that the developer indicate its future subdivision plans for all lands the proprietor owned which adjoined the land within the submitted plat.</p>\n<p id=\"AkrC\">Similarly, in <em>Eversdyk v Wyoming City </em>Council<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and <em>Eyde Construction Co v Meridian Charter Twp</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the grounds upon which the approving authorities based their rejection of the developers\u2019 proposed plats were not supported by the sca. In <em>Eversdyk</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the city council rejected the plat because the city planned to rezone the area to a designation which would be incompatible with the developer\u2019s proposed development. While the sca allows the governing authority to reject a plat on the basis of existing and published rules, rejection on the basis of proposed rules which are not yet operative was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">In <em>Eyde</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the township attempted to require that the developer dedicate recreation land to the township in order to have the plat approved. Such authority is not expressed in the sca, nor could it be fairly implied. The writ of mandamus ordering the township to remove the condition was therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Only in <em>CPW Investments No 2 v City of Troy,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was the governing authority arguably allowed to require that the developer make improvements on land that was not to be divided or partitioned. This case is also distinguishable, however. The developer owned the land in question and could have included it in his plat had it not been previously dedicated to public use under the doctrine of \"highway by user.\u201d The land did not have to be included within the plat, but the Court found that it was included to enhance the value and salability of the lots within the subdivided tract, and not as a reference point to fix the location of the proposed plat to be divided. Furthermore, because the developer had presumably recouped its costs from the new owners of the development homes, the Court also applied equitable considerations in its finding that the developer should not receive a windfall from the city.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Thus with all respect to my colleagues, I would hold that defendants\u2019 rejection of plaintiffs\u2019 proposed plat was not authorized by the powers conferred upon it by the sca. I would therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals, reversing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>grant of summary disposition in favor of defendants, and remand to the trial court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b853-5\">Brickley and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-7\"> MCL 560.182(4)(a); MSA 26.430(182)(4)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b848-6\"> <em>Arrowhead Development Co v Livingston Co Road Comm, </em>413 Mich 505, 513; 322 NW2d 702 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b849-9\"> See <em>Arrowhead, </em>413 Mich 519.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b850-6\"> I disagree with the assumption made by the majority in n 8 of its opinion that the township may consider whatever evidence it chooses, as long as consideration of that evidence is not prohibited by the sca.
