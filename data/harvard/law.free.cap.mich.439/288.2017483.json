Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b495-14\">On May 8, 1987, defendant Marion B. Ingram <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>was arrested for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor or while having a blood alcohol content of 0.10 percent (ouil). MCL 257.625; MSA 9.2325. Defendant was charged in the Kent Circuit Court with , ouil, third offense. The complaint made reference to four underlying ouil convictions. Two of these convictions were obtained in the 5th District Court, one in 1977 and the other in 1983. The third conviction was obtained in the 61st District Court in 1982, the fourth in the Ottawa Circuit Court in 1983. On March 18, 1988, defendant moved for reduction of the charged offense to ouil, second offense, claiming that three of the four prior plea-based convictions were invalid for the purpose of establishing the factual predicate for ouil, third offense. Defendant conceded the validity of the Ottawa Circuit Court plea-based conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">On April 22, 1988, Kent Circuit Judge George S. Buth ruled that the two 5th District Court prior convictions were infirm (having been obtained without counsel). However, Judge Buth ruled that the 1982 61st District Court conviction was not infirm (because defendant had been represented by counsel) and could be used to establish the factual predicate for ouil, third offense. Because two valid underlying ouil convictions remained, defendant\u2019s motion to reduce the charged offense was denied. On December 6, 1988, the Court of Appeals denied defendant\u2019s application for interlocutory review of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">On March 1, 1989, defendant entered a conditional plea of guilty of ouil, third offense, preserving the right to appeal the validity of his prior 61st District Court conviction. Circuit Judge Dennis C. Kolenda, to whom the case had been reassigned, accepted defendant\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>On June 6, 1989, Judge Kolenda denied defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the issue concerning the validity of the 61st District Court prior conviction, concluding that a claim that a court failed to adhere to the applicable plea-taking requirements during the plea proceeding does not provide defendant the opportunity to challenge by later attack. On July 5, 1989, rather than appealing, defendant filed a motion in the 61st District Court to withdraw his 1982 guilty plea which was used to establish the factual predicate for ouil, third offense in the present case. On August 8, 1989, 61st District Judge James B. Howard vacated the guilty plea, set the conviction aside, and reinstated the 1982 case for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">On September 20, 1989, Judge Kolenda denied defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his 1989 plea of guilty to ouil, third offense. Defendant then filed an application for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals. However, while the application was pending, the circuit court found that defendant had violated the terms of his delayed sentence status. Therefore, on November 27, 1989, the court revoked that status and sentenced him to eighteen months to five years in prison. On February 5, 1990, defendant\u2019s pending application for leave to appeal was dismissed without prejudice. Defendant then appealed as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">On December 17, 1990, the Court of Appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded the case for entry of a conviction of ouil, second offense, and resentencing thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">On March 22, 1991, this Court granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">Federal and state courts have consistently found that considerations of finality and administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>consequences must become part of the process with which we assure the achievement of proceedings that are consistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such considerations have been found to be of particular significance in cases where courts have been confronted with the concerns surrounding the procedural issue of collateral attack of plea-based convictions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree and therefore hold that failure of a plea-taking court to adhere to applicable plea-taking requirements during the plea proceeding does not provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>a defendant the opportunity to challenge by collateral attack.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The validity of such a plea, where the defendant was represented by an attorney when entering the plea or when the defendant intelligently waived the right to counsel, including the right to court-appointed counsel if indigent, is unassailable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The issue of collateral attack was not directly presented to, nor addressed by, the Courts in <em>Boykin v Alabama, </em>395 US 238; 89 S Ct 1709; 23 L Ed 2d 274 (1969), <em>People v </em>Jaworski, 387 Mich 21; 194 NW2d 868 (1972), or <em>People v Yost, </em>433 Mich 133; 445 NW2d 95 (1989). The only time that this Court has addressed the issue of a collateral attack of a prior plea-based conviction was in <em>People v Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">In <em>Crawford, </em>the majority stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">A conviction defective under <em>Jaworski </em>can be challenged by a timely motion by the defendant to quash the supplemental information or to strike from the supplemental information the defective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>conviction. To be timely, such a motion must be made before a defendant\u2019s plea of guilty or nolo contendere is accepted. <em>[Id. </em>at 613-614.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">However, because the defendant did not make a timely motion, the <em>Crawford </em>Court affirmed his conviction. Thus, by refusing to allow a collateral attack, the Court was not called upon to actually implement the holding it seemed to announce in the above-quoted paragraph. Rather, the Court conceded in its holding that it did not have the factual underpinnings from which to make a ruling regarding the propriety of a collateral attack of a prior plea-based conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">However, today, with the issue directly before us, we adopt Justice Brickley\u2019s analysis in his concurring opinion in. <em>Crawford, </em>reasoning that only those prior plea convictions taken in violation of <em>Gideon v Wainwright, </em>372 US 335; 83 S Ct 792; 9 L Ed 2d 799 (1963), should be subject to collateral attack.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">Denial of the right to counsel mandated by <em>Gideon </em>is a deprivation of rights altogether different from the issues before us here. The denial of the right to counsel impugns the integrity of the conviction, raising doubts about the guilt of the accused. It is for that reason, and that reason only, that the use of a counselless conviction is forbidden in collateral proceedings notwithstanding that the defendant did not raise the issue on direct review. The requirement of a record waiver of the right to remain silent, to cross-examine witnesses against him, and to be tried by a jury which is required by <em>Boykin-Jaworski, </em>while undoubtedly important, pales beside the right to counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">The United States Supreme Court has never forbidden the use of Boykin-violative convictions in state recidivist proceedings. A majority of this Court does so today because <em>Boykin </em>rights are of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>constitutional stature. Such reasoning begs the question. The right to be free from unreasonable searches, the right to effective assistance of counsel, the right to a properly instructed jury, and countless other rights are also of a constitutional nature. Are we now to assume that all violations of constitutional rights not raised during direct review of a conviction may now be reviewed during habitual offender proceedings? I agree with Justice Stevens, writing for a unanimous Supreme Court in <em>United States v Timmreck, </em>441 US 780, 784; 99 S Ct 2085; 60 L Ed 2d 634 (1979) (failure to advise defendant of a special parole term as required by F R Crim P 11 cannot be raised collaterally) when he states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">\"For the concern with finality served by the limitation on collateral attack has special force with respect to convictions based on guilty pleas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">\" 'Every inroad on the concept of finality undermines confidence in the integrity of our procedures; and, by increasing the volume of judicial work, inevitably delays and impairs the orderly administration of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>[People v Crawford, supra </em>at 615-616.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">We are also in agreement with Justice Brickley\u2019s conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">The adoption by the majority of this rule does nothing to further the interests of finality. Instead of providing incentive for raising claims on direct review where proper relief can be afforded and the error corrected, the majority allows a claim dormant for ten years to be resurrected when the defendant\u2019s tactical considerations so require. <em>[Id. </em>at 616.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Moreover, we find the reasoning presented by Justice Brickley in <em>Crawford </em>consistent with the reasoning of the Courts in <em>Boykin </em>and <em>Jaworski. </em>Neither <em>Boykin </em>nor <em>Jaworski </em>dealt with collateral attacks. These cases were decided in the context of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>direct appeals. <em>Boykin </em>and <em>Jaworski </em>provide procedural safeguards for plea proceedings. However, the technical requirements of these procedural safeguards must at some point be balanced with considerations of finality and administrative consequences in order to best achieve proceedings that are consistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure. We believe when confronted with collateral attack, such a point is reach\u00e9d. See <em>Coleman v Thompson, </em>501 US \u2014; 111 S Ct 2546, 2564; 115 L Ed 2d 640 (1991); <em>Engle v Isaac, </em>456 US 107, 126-127 and ns 31-32; 102 S Ct 1558; 71 L Ed 2d 783 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The procedural safeguards provided for in <em>Boy-kin </em>and <em>Jaworski, </em>and other requirements of plea-taking proceedings, were not intended to broaden the avenues of collateral attacks on prior plea-based convictions. In fact, one of the purposes underlying the decisions in these cases was to provide a procedure that would \"forestall[] the spin-off of collateral proceedings that seek to probe murky memories.\u201d <em>Boykin, supra </em>at 244. In <em>Jaworski, </em>the Court, after reaching its holding, went on to note its concern regarding the waste of judicial time spent on direct review of these cases. Although such direct review was held to be warranted by the holding in <em>Jaworski, </em>it is clear that the Court was concerned with the effect considerations of finality and administrative consequences would have on such a holding. The Court, evidencing its concern, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">In this case, if we were to follow the philosophy that assuring counsel insures understanding pleas, we should dismiss the petition for review \u2014 somewhat leaving counsel hoisted on his own petard as far as serving his client. On the other hand, if we should grant relief, we would in effect be passing judgment <em>sub silentio </em>that we could not as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>judicial procedure rely on counsel to fully advise a defendant of his rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-4\">This leaves unspoken a theoretical further alternative, namely a criminal trial as an adversary procedure not only between defendant and prosecutor, but between defendant and the court as well. The implications of this certainly do not comport with this Court\u2019s philosophy of the proper administration of justice. As a consequence, we shall look to counsel in all criminal cases to advise their clients to the best of their ability, and as well or better than the high standard that the State Bar will seek to impose. But further than that this Court, regarding attorneys as officers of the court, will look to them to cooperate with the courts and not only see that their clients are personally well advised by them, but that the court will be assisted to see that all of a client\u2019s rights are protected on the record. An attorney will do this not only in fulfillment of his oath and duty as an attorney, but also because any petition for review that is based on the defendant seeking a plea review on the grounds he did not enter his plea understanding^ is a reflection on both the court and the defendant\u2019s counsel, and incidentally insofar as proper procedure could have avoided the necessity of review, a burden on the administration of justice, and a disservice, if not an injustice, to others who have occasion to employ or operate the machinery of justice. <em>[Id. </em>at 32-33.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">We find that Justice Brickley\u2019s declaration in <em>Crawford </em>represents the legitimate extension of the concerns expressed in <em>Boykin </em>and <em>Jaworski </em>to the situation where a claim of a defective plea proceeding is raised in a collateral attack. This Court has rejected in the past the claim that <em>Boykin </em>and <em>Jaworski </em>provide a remedy for every defendant who makes any attack on the validity of their plea proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In <em>People v Kuchulan, </em>390 Mich 701, 704; 213 NW2d 95 (1973), this Court stated that <em>Boykin</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>should not be read as imposing on the state or Federal courts as an absolute imperative in every case a requirement that a defendant be informed before he pleads guilty of the three constitutional rights mentioned in Justice Douglas\u2019 opinion. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">Whether to require that this information be imparted as a precondition to the acceptance of a plea of guilty is a question of policy for this Court to decide, and not one of Federal constitutional law. We agree that a judge should be obliged to so inform a defendant pleading guilty as attested by our votes to adopt amended rule [GCR 1963] 785.3-785.11. We also accept the authority of <em>Jaworski </em>under the doctrine of stare decisis; the individual Justices of this Court, just as the other members of the profession, are bound by its decisions until a majority of the Court adopts a different view.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">The rule of a case is, however, frequently less expansive than the reasoning and generalizations in the opinion of the Court. <em>Jaworski, </em>like most cases, was decided in the context of the facts of that case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-8\"><em>Jaworski </em>was not decided in the context of a collateral attack. The concerns involved in collateral attacks are quite different than those on direct appeal and implicate considerations of finality and administrative consequences.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>suaded that in order to best achieve the legitimate goals of finality and the efficient and effective administration of justice, while also achieving the goals of <em>Boykin </em>and <em>Jaworski, </em>as well as the goals of all applicable plea-taking requirements and procedural safeguards in these cases, we must follow a policy which provides incentive for raising claims on direct review where proper relief can be afforded and error corrected. See <em>McCleskey v Zant, </em>499 US \u2014, \u2014; 111 S Ct 1454, 1469; 113 L Ed 2d 517 (1991); <em>Engle, supra </em>at 127-129.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Such a policy, we find, would do the most to insure the achievement of proceedings that are consistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While this Court has not previously articulated this distinction between collateral attacks and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>direct appeals in the application and adoption of the requirements regarding plea-taking proceedings, such a distinction is now properly drawn, when for the first time the specific issue is directly before us. <em>Kuchulan, supra </em>at 704-705.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and affirm defendant\u2019s conviction of ouil, third offense.</p>\n<judges id=\"b506-7\">Brickley, Boyle, Griffin, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-15\"> Collateral attacks encompass those challenges raised other than by initial appeal of the conviction in question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b497-13\"> 437 Mich 926 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b498-6\"> See <em>McCleskey v Zant, </em>499 US \u2014; 111 S Ct 1454, 1468-1469; 113 L Ed 2d 517 (1991); <em>Coleman v Thompson, </em>501 US \u2014; 111 S Ct 2546, 2563-2565; 115 L Ed 2d 640 (1991); <em>Murray v Carrier, </em>477 US 478, 487-492; 106 S Ct 2639; 91 L Ed 2d 397 (1986); <em>Engle v Isaac, </em>456 US 107, 126-128; 102 S Ct 1558; 71 L Ed 2d 783 (1982); <em>Wainwright v Sykes, </em>433 US 72, 88-89; 97 S Ct 2497; 53 L Ed 2d 594 (1977); <em>Henderson v Kibbe, </em>431 US 145, 154, n 13; 97 S Ct 1730; 52 L Ed 2d 203 (1977); <em>Stone v Powell, </em>428 US 465, 491 and n 31; 96 S Ct 3037; 49 L Ed 2d 1067 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b498-9\"> <em>United States v Timmreck, </em>441 US 780, 784; 99 S Ct 2085; 60 L Ed 2d 634 (1979) (\"concern with finality served by the limitation on collateral attack has special force with respect to convictions based on guilty pleas\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">The United States Supreme Court has never forbidden the use of plea-based convictions alleged or found to be in violation of plea proceeding requirements. We recognize, however, that there has been some case law development in the federal courts recently which may call into question the use of prior plea-based convictions for the purpose of sentence enhancement when such convictions are alleged or found to be in violation of plea proceeding requirements. See, e.g., <em>Dunn v Simmons, </em>877 F2d 1275 (CA 6, 1989) (the court, through a writ of habeas corpus, found that the State of Kentucky could not prevent a collateral attack on a prior felony conviction when it was used for sentence enhancement. The prior felony conviction was based on a guilty plea that the defendant claimed was in violation of <em>Boykin v Alabama, </em>395 US 238; 89 S Ct 1709; 23 L Ed 2d 274 [1969]). But in any event, we realize that the present case is not a sentence enhancement case.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">Furthermore, we note that the United States Supreme Court has continued to recognize and emphasize the importance that the considerations of finality and administrative consequences have in assuring the achievement of proceedings that are consistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure. See <em>McCleskey, </em>n 3 <em>supra, </em>111 S Ct 1468-1469 (\"we have taken care in our habeas corpus decisions to reconfirm the importance of finality. . . .

See <em>McCleskey, supra </em>at 1468-1469; <em>Engle, supra </em>at 127-129. Such incentive provides fairness in the law to all parties concerned by promoting the enforcement of procedural safeguards in every case (including those cases in which the defendant, by pleading guilty, is placed on probation, and thus according to Justice Levin in his separate opinion and Chief Justice Cavanagh in his dissent, does not have an incentive to make sure procedural safeguards were provided) and by reducing the costs to society and burdens placed on the judicial system by this type of collateral litigation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\"> Perpetual disrespect for the finality of convictions disparages the entire criminal justice system.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">\"A procedural system which permits an endless repetition of inquiry into facts and law in a vain search for ultimate certitude implies a lack of confidence about the possibilities of justice that cannot but war with the underlying substantive commands. . . .

The majority severely restricts collateral attacks on prior convictions. I dissent for two reasons. First, the majority once again rejects established precedent, thereby rendering useless the concept of stare decisis. Second, it allows a sentence for ouil, third offense, to stand where there is only one valid prior conviction of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Certainty and predictability are among the key <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>determinants of fairness in the law. See <em>Parker v Port Huron Hosp, </em>361 Mich 1; 105 NW2d 1 (1960). To ensure this predictability, the courts have traditionally been guided by the doctrine of stare decisis. <em>People v Jamieson, </em>436 Mich 61; 461 NW2d 884 (1990). In 1983, this Court carefully and fully considered the question of allowing collateral attack on a conviction used to enhance the severity of a subsequent offense. <em>People v Crawford, </em>417 Mich 607; 339 NW2d 630 (1983). At that time the Court expressly held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">A conviction defective under <em>[People v Jaworski, </em>387 Mich 21; 194 NW2d 868 (1972)] can be challenged by a timely motion by the defendant to quash the supplemental information or to strike from the supplemental information the defective conviction. <em>[Crawford </em>at 613.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Under <em>Jaworski, </em>the defendant must be advised of the right to trial by jury, the right to confront one\u2019s accuser, and the privilege against self-incrimination. As Justice Levin explained in <em>Crawford, </em>these rights \"are of such importance that the failure to advise of such rights requires that a guilty plea be set aside.\u201d 417 Mich 614, n 14 (citing <em>Jaworski </em>and <em>Guilty Plea Cases, </em>395 Mich 96; 235 NW2d 132 [1975]).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Rather than construing the precedent established in <em>Crawford,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court today adopts the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>concurring opinion in that case which advocated allowing collateral attack only where the plea was taken in the absence of counsel. This Court, in <em>Jaworski </em>and <em>Guilty Plea Cases, </em>recognized the importance of the right to counsel,- but also assigned preeminent importance to the rights of confrontation and trial by jury and the privilege against self-incrimination. Recognizing that the right to counsel may be paramount does not lead ineluctably to the conclusion that we must overlook the breach of all other rights or ignore a trial court\u2019s failure to follow applicable court rules. I agree that this is not a question of constitutional dimension; rather, it is a question of policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But this Court resolved the policy question when it adopted the court rules requiring that these rights be explained to the defendant on the record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, I am not convinced that the mere fact that an attorney made an appearance, or was appointed, will necessarily insure that the defendant will receive adequate advice. For example, the defendant in this case was represented by counsel, and yet the record reflects no indication that he was informed of even the basic right to trial, which was expressly required by the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>rule in effect at that time.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I fail to see any justification for elevating the rather mundane concepts of finality and administrative consequence over that of fair procedure. While finality is of course desirable, it is not imbued with any particular reverence, and, where a defendant had no incentive to appeal because he had been placed on probation, the record of his conviction should not be considered sacrosanct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> I would affirm the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>ment of the Court of Appeals on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The majority also completely evades a unique issue in this case. The circuit court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea of guilty of ouil, third offense, even though one of the convictions used to enhance was later set aside by the court that originally took the plea. At the time the plea was accepted, there were two valid prior convictions of record, but on August 8, several weeks before sentencing on November 27, the district court set one of these convictions aside. The defendant was convicted and sentenced under MCL 257.625(6); MSA 9.2325(6), which is implicated only when a defendant is convicted of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants within ten years of <em>two or more </em>prior convictions. The term \"conviction\u201d has been defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">\"[A] final judgment on a verdict or finding of guilty, a plea of guilty, or a plea of nolo contendere, and do[es] not include a final judgment which has been expunged by pardon, reversed, set aside, or otherwise rendered nugatory.\u201d [Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed), p 301, citing 18 USC 4251.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">After the 1982 conviction was set aside by the district court, an interesting question arose regarding whether the factual underpinning for a conviction and sentence for ouil, third offense, still existed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The statute specifically requires two prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\"convictions\u201d as the linchpin of this offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The Court of Appeals did not reach this issue because it was remanding for entry of a conviction for the reduced charge of ouil, second offense. Because this issue has not been addressed, I believe remand is appropriate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-8\"> The majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Crawford </em>is unpersuasive. See <em>ante, </em>pp 295-296. The defendant in <em>Crawford </em>had not made a timely motion, and, accordingly, his conviction was affirmed. But the rule of stare decisis refers to principles and points of law, not to factual situations that exist in the cases where the principles are applied. <em>In re Sprenger Estate, </em>337 Mich 514, 523; 60 NW2d 436 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">The fact remains that, in <em>Crawford, </em>this Court expressly held that collateral attacks are acceptable if the motion is timely. Even though that defendant was not protected by the rule established, this Court <em>did </em>establish the rule, and there is no basis for discarding that rule now.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b510-4\"> See <em>People v Yost, </em>433 Mich 133, 139-140; 445 NW2d 95 (1989), where we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB2\">As we [have] explained . . ., and as we have demonstrated through the development of the court rules, there is no federal constitutional requirement that <em>Boykin </em>[v <em>Alabama, </em>395 US 238; 89 S Ct 1709; 23 L Ed 2d 274 <em>(1969)]/Jaworski </em>advice be given when misdemeanants plead guilty. It is a matter of policy for this Court.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b510-6\"> Even though the court rule as it existed at the time of this defendant\u2019s plea did not require explanation of all the <em>Jaworski </em>rights, it did require that the defendant be advised of his trial rights. The policy decision had then been made to require this advisement, and this should have been enforced at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b511-5\"> The rule required that a defendant pleading guilty in district court be advised \"that if his plea is accepted, he will not have a trial of any kind, so he gives up the rights he would have at a trial . . . .\u201d See former DCR 785.4(e)(1). This rule was amended to require the <em>Boykin/Jaworski </em>rights in 1988. See former MCR 6.201(E)(3)(b)(i)-(iii), now MCR 6.610(E)(3)(b)(i)-(iii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b511-6\"> 1 note further, as a general matter, that the majority, in its rhetorical obeisance to the icon of \"finality,\u201d fundamentally confuses two different types of collateral challenge. The cases cited by the majority in support of its argument regarding the importance of \"finality,\u201d see <em>ante, </em>p 294, ns 3-4, citing <em>McCleskey v Zant, </em>499 US \u2014; 111 S Ct 1454, 1468-1469; 113 L Ed 2d 517 (1991), <em>Coleman v Thompson, </em>501 US \u2014; 111 S Ct 2546, 2563-2565; 115 L Ed 2d 640 (1991), <em>Murray v Carrier, </em>477 US 478, 487-492; 106 S Ct 2639; 91 L Ed 2d 397 (1986), <em>Engle v Isaac, </em>456 US 107, 126-128; 102 S Ct 1558; 71 L Ed 2d 783 (1982), <em>Wainwright v Sykes, </em>433 US 72, 88-89; 97 S Ct 2497; 53 L Ed 2d 594 (1977), <em>Henderson v Kibbe, </em>431 US 145, 154, n 13; 97 S Ct 1730; 52 L Ed 2d 203 (1977), <em>Stone v Powell, </em>428 US 465, 491 and n 31; 96 S Ct 3037; 49 L Ed 2d 1067 (1976), and <em>United States v Timmreck, </em>441 US 780; 99 S Ct 2085; 60 L Ed 2d 634 (1979), all involved direct attacks on prior convictions in their own right. The attacks were styled \"collateral\u201d because they proceeded by habeas corpus or other means apart from direct appeal. None of those cases involved \"collateral\u201d attacks in the sense posed by the instant case\u2014 that is, involving the use of a prior conviction to <em>enhance </em>criminal culpability in a <em>present, ongoing </em>criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">This is a crucial distinction. The state\u2019s invocation of \"finality\u201d is greatly weakened when the state itself seeks to resurrect one or more prior convictions and put them to new use, to impose new and further adverse repercussions on the defendant. Indeed, this Court in <em>Crawford </em>distinguished the case of <em>Timmreck, supra, </em>by explicitly emphasizing this very distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">[T]he question here is not whether the conviction is subject to <em>collateral attack as an alternative to direct appeal, </em>the issue dealt with in <em>Timmreck, </em>but whether the defective conviction may be used in supplemental proceedings <em>when the repercussions to the defendant of his failure to appeal may yet be felt. </em>A defendant placed on probation might not appeal a defective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>conviction. We are persuaded that a plea-based conviction, violative of <em>Boykin-Jaworski, </em>cannot be used to <em>supplement a charge in habitual offender proceedings. [Crawford, </em>417 Mich 614, n 14. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b512-12\"> In <em>Lewis v United States, </em>445 US 55; 100 S Ct 915; 63 L Ed 2d 198 (1980), the defendant was charged with possession of a firearm while being a convicted felon. The prior felony conviction in <em>Lewis </em>was subject to collateral attack in the state court but had not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>vacated. The Court declared that it is a \"common-sense notion\u201d that after a conviction is vacated it can no longer serve as a factual predicate for a subsequent offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">One might argue, of course, that the language is so sweeping that it includes in its proscription [against possessing a firearm] even a person whose predicate conviction in the interim had been finally reversed on appeal and thus no longer was outstanding . . . though we have no need to pursue that extreme argument in this case, <em>we </em>reject. <em>it.
