MCL 125.271 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.2963(1) <em>et seq. </em>Contrary to the opinion of the Court of Appeals in <em>Fox &amp; Associates, Inc v Hayes Twp, </em>162 Mich App 647; 413 NW2d 465 (1987), we find that the trza does in fact vest townships with such authority, and reverse the decision of the trial court, and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">i. factual background</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">On August 30, 1977, Pine Bluff Estates Association<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a petition with the West Bloomfield Charter Township Board for approval of a site plan and for a special use permit for a commonly owned lot, hereinafter referred to as outlot A, within the Pine Bluff Estates Subdivision. The association was seeking to convert this pie-shaped lot which abuts Pine Lake, into a private park and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>beach for its members\u2019 use. The petition was filed by the association in accordance with the requirements of the West Bloomfield Charter Township Zoning Ordinance. Neither the necessity nor the authority under the zoning ordinance for the special use permit for docking privileges at outlot a has been questioned by the parties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>On April 11, 1978, the planning commission recommended the board approve the site plan and special use permit for outlot a.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The commission indicated that the dimensions of outlot a were not in conformance with the requirements of the zoning ordinance regarding subdivision recreational parcels of land with lake frontage; however, it determined that the association should be allowed to improve outlot a as long as any dock constructed on that lot was not used to launch or moor boats.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">On June 19, 1978, the board granted the approval for the site plan and special use permit. However, the board, contrary to the recommendation of the commission, allowed two boats to be moored at the dock.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The boat restriction was acceptable to plaintiffs because few of the backlots within the subdivision had been developed at that time.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, on June 12, 1989, after all eleven of the backlots had been developed, the association submitted a petition to amend the special use permit for outlot A to increase mooring capacity of the dock from two to eleven boats. On July 25, 1989, the commission issued a recommendation to the board that the petition filed by the association should be denied because such use would not conform to the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>quirements of the West Bloomfield Township Zoning Ordinance. On October 16, 1989, the board adopted the recommendation of the commission and denied the petition, despite being informed of the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Fox, supra, </em>which had held that the trza does not vest authority to regulate docking upon township governmental units.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">On November 3, 1989, plaintiffs filed a six-count complaint in the Oakland Circuit Court. Plaintiffs were attempting to have the court invalidate regulation of the docking privileges as exercised by the board with regard to outlot a. The first count, relying upon <em>Fox, supra, </em>asserted the zoning regulation employed by the board was invalid because there was no authority for regulating the docking of boats through the application of a zoning ordinance. Counts ii through vi included: a claim for mandamus to require the board to accept the petition for a variance, a complaint for superintending control to reverse the decision of the board, an appeal from the decision of the board, a claim for inverse condemnation, and an allegation of a violation of 42 USC 1983, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Plaintiff brought a motion for partial summary disposition with regard to counts i and iv, relying on the decision in <em>Fox. </em>Plaintiffs alleged that there was no question of material fact in this case and that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law with regard to count i, pursuant to MCR 2.116(0(10). After hearing oral arguments regarding this issue on May 18, 1990, the trial court, relying upon <em>Fox, </em>determined that the board had acted without authority in regulating the mooring of boats at outlot a.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>certify the decision as a final order; therefore, defendants filed an interlocutory appeal in the Court of Appeals which was denied on December 20, 1990.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendants\u2019 application for leave to appeal to this Court was granted. 437 Mich 1047 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">In <em>Square Lake Hills Condominium Ass\u2019n v Bloomfield Twp, </em>437 Mich 310; 471 NW2d 321 (1991), a majority of this Court, albeit by more than one opinion, determined that townships possess authority to regulate mooring of boats by ordinance, pursuant to the police power provided by the township ordinance act, MCL 41.181 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.45(1) <em>et seq. </em>In this case, however, defendant West Bloomfield Township enacted the relevant zoning provisions in accordance with the statutory requirements of the trza. Therefore, our only consideration is whether the enabling provision of that act vested the township with authority to regulate the construction of a dock and the ability to limit the number of boats that could be moored there.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The enabling provision of the trza states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">The <em>township board </em>of an organized township in this state <em>may provide by zoning ordinance for the regulation of land development and the establishment of districts in the portions of the township </em>outside the limits of cities and villages <em>which </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number><em>regulate the use of land and structures; </em>to meet the needs of the state\u2019s citizens for food, fiber, energy, and other natural resources, places of residence, recreation, industry, trade, service, and other uses of land; <em>to insure that use of the land shall be situated in appropriate locations and relationships; </em>to limit the inappropriate overcrowding of land and congestion of population, transportation systems, and other public facilities; to facilitate adequate and efficient provision for transportation systems, sewage disposal, water,' energy, education, recreation, and other public service and facility requirements; and to promote public health, safety, and welfare. For these purposes, the township board may divide the township into districts of such number, shape, and area as it considers best suited to carry out this act. The township board of an organized township may use this act to provide by ordinance for the regulation of land development and the establishment of districts which apply only to land areas and activities which are involved in a special program to achieve specific land management objectives and avert or solve specific land use problems, including the regulation of land development and the establishment of districts in areas subject to damage from flooding or beach erosion, and for that purpose may divide the township into districts of a number, shape, and area considered best suited to accomplish those objectives. [MCL 125.271; MSA 5.2963(1). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">In <em>Fox, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals found the enabling provision of the trza to be limited to regulation of land activities \"and does not extend to the regulation of the riparian rights of a landowner, especially when such regulation attempts to limit access to navigable waters or the number of dock slips a riparian landowner may build or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>possess.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652. That case presented a situation in which a proposed condominium development, which had frontage on Lake Charlevoix, was rejected because of nonconformance with the applicable zoning ordinances. The zoning ordinances involved in that case regulated the building of structures along the shoreline and also the amount of dock space which would have been available to the condominium owners. The Court of Appeals held that the Legislature did not intend to allow such zoning regulation to be exercised by townships, pursuant to the trza, because the language within that act was limited to land use or development and did not mention water activity or riparian rights. The panel employed this interpretation of the trza despite a constitutional mandate of liberal construction in favor of the township.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-5\">Even with the liberal construction of the provisions of the constitution in mind, we do not believe that the trza grants authority to townships to regulate or limit boat dockage construction or riparian access rights. After consideration of all the applicable rules of statutory construction, we can only conclude that the Legislature, in enacting the trza, granted authority to townships to zone land use but not water use or to regulate riparian rights. <em>[Id. </em>at 656.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The dissenter opined that the trza should not have been given as narrow an interpretation as that adopted by the majority, especially in light of the constitutional m\u00e1ndate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-7\">In summary, riparian rights are not different from any other rights that arise out of the ownership or an estate in land. Consequently those rights are subject to the regulation and control of the township under the authority of the Township Rural Zoning Act. <em>[Id. </em>at 662.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>We granted leave to appeal in <em>Fox, </em>on March 22, 1988. See 430 Mich 858. Our order granting leave indicated that the limited issue to be addressed was \"whether under the Township Rural Zoning Act ... a township has the authority to enact a zoning ordinance which limits boat dockage and funnel development by riparian owners.\u201d That issue was almost identical to the issue before us today, and would likely have eliminated any need for us to review the instant case. However, we vacated our order granting leave to appeal in <em>Fox </em>on July 19, 1989, after the parties agreed to a consent judgment. 432 Mich 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">The trza makes express references to \"land development\u201d and \"use of land\u201d within its enabling provision without expressly referring to water or riparian rights. However, that provision also does not expressly prohibit the zoning of water-related uses or riparian rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">The question becomes whether the term \"land,\u201d as used in the enabling provision of the trza when \"liberally construed\u201d in favor of the township, \"fairly implies]\u201d the inclusion of boat dockage. For the reasons that follow we think that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">Interpretation of the trza is aided by Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 34, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-11\">The provisions of this constitution and law concerning counties, townships, cities and villages shall be liberally construed in their favor. <em>Powers granted to </em>counties and <em>townships </em>by this constitution and <em>by law shall include those fairly implied </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number><em>and not prohibited by this constitution. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">We must employ this constitutional mandate in conjunction with the following statutory rule of construction in our interpretation of the enabling provision of the trza.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">MCL 8.3; MSA 2.212, establishes a statutory rule of construction for interpreting certain enumerated terms found within various statutory provisions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-7\">In the construction of the statutes of this state, the rules stated in sections 3a to 3w shall be observed, <em>unless </em>such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the legislature. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">A statutory definition for the term \"land\u201d is included within MCL 8.3i; MSA 2.212(9), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-9\">The words \"land,\u201d \"lands,\u201d \"real estate\u201d and \"real property\u201d mean lands, tenements and real estate, <em>and all rights thereto and interests therein. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">Accordingly, the statutory definition of land within this provision includes all rights and interests which are associated or attached to any piece of real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">A</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-12\"><em>Land which includes or is bounded by a natural watercourse is de&amp;ned as riparian. </em>Persons who own an estate or have a possessory interest in riparian land enjoy certain exclusive rights. These include the right to erect and maintain docks along the owner\u2019s shore, and the right to anchor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>boats permanently off the owner\u2019s shore. <em>[Thies v Howland, </em>424 Mich 282, 287-288; 380 NW2d 463 (1985). Citations omitted. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Outlot a clearly fits the definition of riparian property since it is a piece of land which abuts a natural watercourse, Pine Lake.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Riparian rights are derived from and are dependent on ownership of \"land\u201d which abuts a natural body of water; thus, they constitute part of the property possessed by riparian landowners and become their property rights. See <em>Square Lake Hills, supra </em>(Cavanagh, C.J., dissenting); <em>Thompson v Enz, </em>379 Mich 667; 154 NW2d 473 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Therefore, we conclude that the term \"land,\u201d as used within the trza, includes those rights or interests that attach to the ownership of land, which extends to riparian rights. Mooring of boats at a dock adjacent to outlot A constitutes an exercise of the riparian rights of the property owners of that piece of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">Including riparian rights within the term \"land\u201d as it is used in the trza is not \"inconsistent with the manifest intent of the legislature.\u201d The Legislature indicated its intentions in adopting the TRZA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-11\">The zoning ordinance shall be <em>based upon a plan designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare; to encourage the use of lands in accordance with their character and adaptability, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number><em>and to limit the improper use of land; </em>to conserve natural resources and energy; <em>... to insure that uses of the land shall be situated in appropriate locations and relationships; . . . </em>and to conserve the expenditure of funds for public improvements and services to conform with the most advantageous uses of land, resources, and properties. The zoning ordinance shall be made with reasonable consideration, among other things, to the character of each district; its peculiar suitability for particular uses; the conservation of property values and natural resources; <em>and the general and appropriate trend and character of land, building, and population development. </em>[MCL 125.273; MSA 5.2963(3). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">This provision was broadly written to permit townships to regulate activities to promote the general welfare of the public and to protect the character and natural resources of a township community. In order to accomplish this goal, the Legislature must have been aware of the importance of riparian rights with regard to the overall use of land. In a state such as Michigan, with its abundant bodies of water, there would be no way to ensure that land uses are compatible with surrounding properties unless water activities are evaluated. Similarly, the conservation of natural resources, which clearly includes water, cannot be undertaken if there is no means for regulating riparian rights. Finally, the stated purpose of the trza is to allow townships to balance the most advantageous uses of the lands, resources, and properties within their boundaries and to create zoning districts and ordinances in accordance with such evaluations. Such a balance could not be achieved if riparian rights are excluded from any zoning control by the township.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Review of the historical development of the trza indicates the Legislature intended the regulatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>authority possessed by the townships to encompass more than activities which are located on \"dry land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The original version of the trza was enacted in 1943 PA 184. The first sentence in the first section of that act provided the authority for townships to designate zoning districts in which they could encourage, regulate, or prohibit certain types of activities or uses of the land within the zoning districts created, i.e., agricultural, forestry, recreational, residential, etc. The remainder of that section addressed regulation of dwellings or structure sizes within the zoning districts created by the township. There was minimal discussion of the authority of townships to control land development within the several zoning classifications. In 1978, the Legislature drastically amended this crucial provision of the trza to address and correct the inadequacy of the prior version.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">An indication of the legislative concern for the environment is apparent from the clause that was added to MCL 125.271; MSA 5.2963(1) in 1978, providing that townships shall have the authority to enact zoning ordinances to \"promote public health, safety, and welfare.\u201d This indicates that a much broader grant of authority was intended by the Legislature when it amended the trza in 1978. Additionally, the constitution states that conservation and protection of natural resources shall constitute a paramount concern in the interest of the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the State of Michigan.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-8\">The conservation and development of the natural resources of the state are hereby declared to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>of <em>paramount public concern in the interest of the health, safety and general welfare of the people. The legislature shall provide for the protection of the air, water and other natural resources of the state from pollution, impairment and destruction. </em>[Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 52. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Thus, by granting townships the authority to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare through enactment of zoning ordinances, the Legislature was complying with this constitutional mandate to protect the environment, including bodies of water, from impairment or destruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">In order for townships to properly protect the bodies of water from destruction or impairment, pursuant to their zoning power within the trza, there must be an ability to regulate the exercise of riparian rights. To prohibit townships from exercising such regulatory zoning authority over riparian rights would permit the destruction or impairment of the natural resources associated with such bodies of water. To construe the trza in the manner asserted by plaintiffs, and the Court of Appeals majority in <em>Fox, supra, </em>would essentially prohibit townships from protecting the natural resources located within their communities that happen to be associated with bodies of water. This clearly could not have been the intention of the Legislature when it expanded the powers of the townships to regulate land development and to promote the public health, safety, and welfare, pursuant to the zoning authority of the trza. Therefore, our reading of the trza is not only not \"inconsistent with the minifest intent of the legislature,\u201d it is manifestly consistent with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">We conclude that the trza permits townships to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>regulate riparian rights, such as dockage of boats, as part of their zoning power. This interpretation is consistent with the underlying purpose of the enactment of the trza and its subsequent amendment, and is appropriate in light of the constitutionally mandated liberal construction. We reverse the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b770-4\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Boyle, Riley, Griffin, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-11\"> The association represents all twenty-two lot owners within the subdivision.

The plaintiffs did indeed apply for a special use permit to dock and launch boats from outlot a. But the provision of the zoning ordinance here at issue does not, either in terms or in substance, seek to regulate the use of lake frontage or use of the lake. The provision regulates, rather, the use of land \u2014 without regard to whether it fronts on a lake \u2014 as a park for outdoor recreation, stating that the township board may authorize use of land, such as outlot a, as a park for outdoor recreation on a finding that such use would not be \"incompatible with already existing uses in the area\u201d and, in particular, \" 'that such use does not impair the natural appearance of such land or tend to produce unreasonable noise or annoyance to surrounding properties.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Under this provision of its zoning ordinance, the only provision here at issue, West Bloomfield denied plaintiffs a special use permit to increase from two to eleven the number of boats that might be docked at outlot a. That denial of a special use permit was in accordance with the terms of the ordinance if such use would in fact have impaired the natural appearance of outlot A or have tended to produce unreasonable noise or annoyance to surrounding properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The majority reverses the order of summary disposition for the plaintiffs entered by the circuit court and remands for further proceedings consistent with the opinion of the Court. I agree with this disposition, and suggest that an issue on remand might be whether the special use sought by the plaintiffs would in fact impair the natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>appearance of outlot A or tend to produce unreasonable noise or annoyance to surrounding properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">I write separately to express my disagreement with the majority\u2019s decision to declare whether a township has the authority to regulate riparian rights or the docking of boats pursuant to the trza in a case where the zoning ordinance provision at issue does not purport to regulate riparian rights or the docking of boats.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">The circuit court, in granting Hess\u2019 motion for partial summary disposition, declared that West Bloomfield\u2019s zoning ordinance was invalid \"insofar as it purports to regulate dock construction and boat dockage.\u201d The judge based his ruling on the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Fox &amp; Associates, Inc v Hayes Twp, </em>162 Mich App 647; 413 NW2d 465 (1987), which the judge said was \"controlling.\u201d He said that the Court of Appeals there held that \"Hayes Township had no authority under the trza to regulate dock construction and boat dockage through its zoning ordinance.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">I concur in reversal of the circuit court. I would, however, reverse on the basis that the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>court erred in concluding, first, that West Bloomfield was \"attempting to regulate boat dockage\u201d under the provision of its zoning ordinance here relied on, requiring a special use permit to use land as a park for outdoor recreation, and, second, that <em>Fox &amp; Associates </em>barred West Bloomfield from denying plaintiffs a special use permit to increase from two to eleven the number of boats docked at outlot A.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">I thus agree with the position advocated by West Bloomfield in the circuit court, where West Bloomfield argued that the ordinance involved in <em>Fox &amp; Associates </em>\"attempted to regulate water, use rights. <em>That's not what we have in this case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">West Bloomfield further argued that when the plaintiffs sought permission to increase the number of boats that could be docked at outlot a, the issue under the pertinent provision of its zoning ordinance was whether the proposed increased use of outlot A was reasonable in a residential area, and whether, as set forth in the ordinance,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \"the use of the land was going to tend to produce <em>unreasonable noise and annoyance </em>to neighbors. Very simple, very simple, <em>if you remove the water context, </em>this kind of administrative issue comes up every month at a normal Township proceeding. Is the use of this property going to be interfering with adjoining property.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Disposition of this appeal does not require or justify addressing the issue decided by the Court of Appeals in <em>Fox &amp; Associates. </em>All that need be said to decide this appeal is that, first, entirely apart from whether <em>Fox &amp; Associates </em>correctly ruled that the trza does not authorize a township to regulate water use or riparian rights, a township has the authority under the trza to regulate land use, and thus to permit the use of land as a park for outdoor recreation only to the extent that such use does not either impair the natural appearance of the land or tend to produce unreasonable noise or annoyance to surrounding properties. And, second, that the circuit court erred in ruling that the Court of Appeals decided in <em>Fox &amp; Associates </em>that the trza proscribes regulation of land use that affects in any way \"dock construction and boat dockage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">It is not appropriate for this Court to seek to decide in this case, where there truly is no issue regarding the authority of a township to regulate water use or riparian rights, the question whether the Legislature has delegated such authority to a township under the trza. The authority of a township to regulate riparian rights and docking of boats properly can be decided only in a case where the zoning provision at issue regulates riparian rights or the docking of boats and the validity of such a regulatory provision is truly at issue._</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>To be sure, West Bloomfield, by denying a special use permit to increase from two to eleven the number of boats that might be docked at outlot A, did seek to regulate the docking of boats at outlot a. But it asserted the authority to do so <em>not </em>on the basis that it had the right under the trza to regulate water use or riparian rights, but on the basis that it had the right to regulate the use of the land at which the dock was sited so that any increase in the number of boats docked would neither impair the natural appearance of the land nor tend to produce unreasonable noise or annoyance to surrounding properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">While it may be of little importance to the plaintiffs here whether they are. denied an increase in boat dockage on one basis or the other, in another case it might be of considerable importance whether a township may, under the trza, regulate a riparian owner\u2019s use of the water or the docking or launching of boats irrespective of whether such use might, in a recreational park setting, result in unreasonable noise or annoyance to surrounding properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">This Court, first in <em>Square Lake Hills Condominium Ass\u2019n v Bloomfield Twp, </em>437 Mich 310; 471 NW2d 321 (1991), and now in this case, has been striving to address the question whether <em>Fox &amp; Associates </em>was correctly decided. That the issue has not been squarely presented in either case may be frustrating, but does not justify departure from the norms of decision making.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">After the parties resolved the controversy underlying <em>Fox &amp; Associates, </em>this Court declined to provide an advisory opinion regarding the law applicable in the factual situation presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>that case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This Court should adhere to the principle underlying its refusal to render such an opinion in <em>Fox &amp; Associates, </em>by declining to render such an opinion in a case that does not even present the issue there presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">It appears that West Bloomfield is largely a developed community. Any zoning of water use or riparian rights by West Bloomfield would most often affect land that has been subdivided and intensively developed and used for some time. Any effort to rezone against existing uses would confront the rights of p\u00e9rsons who then would become nonconforming users.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">While it may be reasonable to regulate land use with an eye to water use, especially where the entire body of water lies, as in the instant case, within a single township, different questions will arise where the water is bordered by land located in several townships, as in <em>Fox &amp; Associates.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Where several townships border the water, one township may not, as a practical matter, be able effectively to regulate water use.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This would im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>plicate the power of the state to regulate water use and plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the state has preempted the regulation of water use and riparian rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">It is asserted that there is a need to recognize a power in townships to regulate water use and riparian rights to provide a means for controlling overuse of lakes by backlot owners in funnel developments. The asserted need arises where a township\u2019s zoning ordinance permits<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the use of lakefront land for a use other than single or multiple family residences fronting on the lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Where, however, township zoning does not in effect permit the recreational use of lakefront land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>by persons who are not the owners of single or multiple family residences fronting on the lake, a township may not need an expansive construction of the zoning power to prevent overuse resulting from funnel development. Townships, in the exercise of their undoubted power to zone land use, might proscribe for future subdivisions the use of lakefront land except for single family residences or, possibly, multiple family residences with a family density limitation<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> based on lakefront footage.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>As set forth in <em>Square Lake, supra, </em>p 335, and to that extent I there agreed with the majority, \" 'townships have the authority to regulate boat docking and launching for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of persons and property within their communities under the township ordinance act,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> even though they may not have such power under the trza. I suggested that \"[a] township could, accordingly, appropriately enact, under the township ordinance act, a regulation barring the docking of motorboats in an unsafe or hazardous manner, or the launching of motorboats during usual sleeping hours.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In sum, there is neither need nor justification for addressing a fundamental question of water and zoning law in a case where the issue is not truly presented.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-7\"> MCL 125.271 <em>et </em>seq.; MSA 5.2963(1) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b770-8\"> <em>Ante, </em>pp 565-566.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b770-9\"> \"The following uses <em>may be permitted in an R-10, R-12.5 and R-15 one-family residential district after review and approval </em>of the site plan by the planning commission <em>and </em>provided that the planning commission finds <em>that the use would not be incompatible with already existing uses in the area </em>or would not interfere with orderly development of the area and will not be detrimental to the safety or convenience of vehicular or pedestrian traffic, subject to the conditions imposed for each use, <em>and subject to final approval by the township board:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">\"(4) Land may be used for <em>privately owned and operated parks, </em>picnic groves or similar facilities for outdoor recreation which may not he operated for profit; <em>provided, that such use does not impair the natural appearance of such land or tend to produce unreasonable noise or annoyance to surrounding properties, </em>and provided further that no use shall be made of any open land or water for boat liveries or commercial bathing beaches.

After consideration of all the applicable rules of statutory construction, we can only conclude that the Legislature, in enacting the trza, granted authority to townships to zone land use but not water use or to regulate riparian rights. <em>[Fox &amp; Associates v Hayes Twp, supra, </em>p 656.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b773-7\"> See n 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b773-8\"> West Bloomfield further argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-9\">In this case we happen to have a lake next door or adjoining the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-10\">And the question before the Township is just what can be done on this out lot as a recreational piece of property, <em>not as a boat issue. </em>It\u2019s not a situation like in <em>Fox </em>where they\u2019re saying how many boats can you have, how many docks can you put in, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>period. The question is how can you use this recreational piece of land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-8\">So it\u2019s completely distinguishable from <em>Fox </em>because it\u2019s not a matter of how are you going to regulate the water.

Finally, the stated purpose of the trza is to allow townships to balance the most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>advantageous uses of the lands, resources, and properties within their boundaries and to create zoning districts and ordinances in accordance with such evaluations. Such a balance <em>could not </em>be achieved if riparian rights are excluded from any zoning control by the township.
