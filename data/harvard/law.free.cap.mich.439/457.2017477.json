FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"AJqi\">A. <em>LI v FELDT</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-14\">Plaintiff Chen Li was injured in an automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>collision on May 5, 1983, which was allegedly caused, in part, by an improperly timed traffic light operated by the City of Ann Arbor. The defendants before us in <em>Li </em>are the city and two of its employees, Kenneth Feldt and John Robbins. Li filed suit on March 11, 1986, and the trial court initially granted summary disposition for the defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals initially reversed in part and remanded for further proceedings regarding Li\u2019s claim of intentional nuisance. 162 Mich App 767; 413 NW2d 493 (1987). This Court vacated and remanded in light of <em>Hadfield v Oakland Co Drain Cornm\u2019r, </em>430 Mich 139; 422 NW2d 205 (1988), in which a majority of this Court held that \u00a7 7(1) mandates an historical approach to determining the existence of exceptions to governmental immunity. 430 Mich 882 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">On remand, the Court of Appeals found that there was an historically recognized intentional nuisance exception to governmental immunity, and again reversed the trial court\u2019s summary disposition. 170 Mich App 256; 428 NW2d 36 (1988). This Court granted leave to appeal, 432 Mich 891 (1989), and reversed, reaffirming <em>Had\u00f1eld\u2019s </em>historical approach and finding that there is no. intentional nuisance exception to governmental immunity. 434 Mich 584; 456 NW2d 55 (1990). This Court again remanded the case to the Court of Appeals, to determine whether a public nuisance or nuisance per se exception to governmental immunity existed, and whether either exception applied to the facts presented, \"if, and to the extent that, [such issues] were properly raised before the Court of Appeals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596._</p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>On second remand, the Court of Appeals held that the relevant issues had been adequately raised and preserved in that Court, that both public nuisance and nuisance per se were historically recognized exceptions to governmental immunity, that Li had stated a claim of public nuisance on the facts presented, and that Li\u2019s claim of nuisance per se was sufficiently colorable on the facts presented to warrant further consideration by the trial court. 187 Mich App 475, 492; 468 NW2d 268 (1991). The Court of Appeals therefore reversed again the trial court\u2019s summary disposition. We granted leave to appeal, 437 Mich 1006 (1991), and, for reasons set forth below, we now reverse again the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">B. <em>GARCIA v CITY OF JACKSON</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 decedent Javier Garcia, a young boy, drowned on February 26, 1983, after he went swimming in the holding pond behind the Holton Dam in Jackson. The pond was connected to the Grand River by a 2,000-foot-long, five- by ten-foot, underground conduit, the mouth of which was not guarded by a grating. Garcia was sucked into the conduit and dragged through it into the Grand River, where his body was later found. Another young boy had drowned in a similar manner at the Holton Dam in 1981, producing a public outcry. At the time Garcia drowned, signs had been placed around the pond warning against swimming; indeed, Garcia\u2019s friend who accompanied him on that tragic day warned him against swimming in the pond. It was not until October 10, 1983, however, nearly eight months after Garcia\u2019s death, that the City of Jackson began making physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>improvements at the dam site to enhance its safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Garcia\u2019s father, on his own behalf and as the personal representative of his son\u2019s estate, and others, filed suit against the city on June 23, 1983.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Garcia\u2019s first complaint alleged nuisance per se and nuisance in fact, an amended complaint alleged only nuisance per se, and . a second amended complaint alleged only wilful and wanton misconduct. The substance of the allegations remained, however, that the city had maintained the Holton Dam in a dangerous condition, when it knew or should have known that drownings were likely to result. The trial court initially granted summary disposition for the city. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding that Garcia had stated a claim of intentional nuisance and that intentional nuisance constituted an exception to governmental immunity. 152 Mich App 254; 393 NW2d 599 (1986). This Court, just as in <em>Li, </em>vacated and remanded in light of <em>Hadfield, supra. </em>430 Mich 877 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">On remand, the Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, again reversed the trial court\u2019s summary disposition, finding its earlier decision unaffected by <em>Hadfield. </em>174 Mich App 373; 435 NW2d 796 (1989). This Court granted leave to appeal, 432 Mich 891 (1989), and, deciding the case together with <em>Li, </em>reversed, holding that intentional nuisance was not an historically recognized exception to governmental immunity. 434 Mich 584; 456 NW2d 55 (1990). This Court, just as in <em>Li, </em>remanded the case to the Court of Appeals to determine whether a public nuisance or nuisance per se exception to governmental immunity existed, and whether either exception applied to the facts pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>sented, \"if, and to the extent that, [such issues] were properly raised before the Court of Appeals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">On second remand, the Court of Appeals, again over a dissent, held that the relevant issues had been adequately raised and preserved in that Court, that public nuisance and nuisance per se were historically recognized exceptions to governmental immunity, that \"the factual allegations in this case can support the claim of nuisance per se or public nuisance sufficiently to avoid a grant of summary disposition for the defendant,\u201d that Garcia should be afforded an opportunity on remand to amend his pleadings to more clearly state the law and facts relied upon, and that the trial court should then determine whether Garcia had adequately pleaded a claim of public nuisance or nuisance per se. 190 Mich App 197, 201-202; 475 NW2d 851 (1991). The Court of Appeals therefore reversed again the trial court\u2019s summary disposition. We granted leave to appeal and ordered the case considered together with <em>Li, </em>438 Mich 863 (1991), and, for reasons set forth below, we now reverse again the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AYxY\">A. PUBLIC NUISANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">It has become almost <em>de rigueur </em>to begin a discussion of nuisance, as did the Court of Appeals in <em>Li (On Second Remand), </em>187 Mich App 480, by quoting Justice Talbot Smith\u2019s typically apt description of it as \"the great grab bag, the dust bin, of the law.\u201d <em>Awad v McColgan, </em>357 Mich 386, 389; 98 NW2d 571 (1959). The Court of Appeals in <em>Li (On Second Remand) </em>also noted Prosser and Kee<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>ton\u2019s descriptions of nuisance as an \" 'impenetrable jungle\u2019 \u201d and \" 'all things to all people,\u2019 \u201d 187 Mich App 480, quoting Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 86, p 616, while adding its own apt metaphor that \"[w]hile nuisance may be an impenetrable jungle, the issue of exceptions to governmental immunity for nuisance per se and public nuisance is more akin to an arid wasteland, with few landmarks to be found.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While we sympathize with these metaphors, we think the Court of Appeals overlooked the implications of the latter. The very aridity of the historical case law in this area actually makes it easier to apply the governing historical test for exceptions to governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">MCL 691.1407(1); MSA 3.996(107)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">Except as otherwise provided in this act, all governmental agencies shall be immune from tort liability in all cases wherein the government agency is engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function. Except as otherwise provided in this act, this act shall not be construed as modifying or restricting the immunity of the state from tort liability as it existed before July 1, 1965, which immunity is affirmed.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">This Court, in <em>Li v Feldt (After Remand), </em>434 Mich 584, 592-595; 456 NW2d 55 (1990), squarely reaffirmed the historical approach articulated by Justice Brickley\u2019s plurality opinion in <em>Hadfield, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number><em>supra, </em>for purposes of determining the scope of possible exceptions to the immunity conferred by \u00a7 7(1). Under this approach the question is whether the claimed exception was clearly recognized in authoritative Michigan case law before July 1, 1965. See <em>Li (After Remand), </em>434 Mich 594-595. This Court in <em>Hadfield </em>found such a clearly recognized historical exception in the-case of the tort of \"trespass-nuisance.\u201d See <em>Hadfield, </em>430 Mich 154-169 (Brickley, J.). Where the historical case law regarding a claimed exception truly constitutes an \"arid wasteland,\u201d however, that would seem to be a strong indication that the exception cannot properly be recognized under \u00a77(1). This indication is confirmed in the case of the claimed public nuisance exception to governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The argument for historical recognition of a public nuisance exception rests largely upon Justice Boyle\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Hadfield, </em>430 Mich 206-207 \u2014 which in turn relied upon <em>Attorney General ex rel Wyoming Twp v Grand Rapids, </em>175 Mich 503; 141 NW 890 (1913), and <em>Trowbridge v City of Lansing, </em>237 Mich 402; 212 NW 73 (1927)\u2014 and upon <em>Pound v Garden City School Dist, </em>372 Mich 499; 127 NW2d 390 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\"><em>Wyoming Twp </em>and <em>Trowbridge </em>do not support the existence of a public nuisance exception. In the first place, both cases involved plaintiffs seeking only prospective equitable relief in the form of abatement, to which this Court, in both cases, found they were entitled. As Justice Brickley correctly noted in <em>Hadfield, </em>such cases do not even fall within the purview of governmental immunity and cannot properly be cited in that context. See <em>Hadfield, </em>430 Mich 152, n 5, 174, n 15. Justice Boyle in <em>Hadfield, </em>after citing <em>Wyoming Twp </em>and <em>Trowbridge, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Presumably, this Court, after recognizing the remedy of abatement against the government for a public nuisance, would not deprive a private individual who suffered special harm because of the same nuisance from a remedy well established at common law [e.g., damages]. It should follow that the public nuisance remedy, even where not based on invasion of another\u2019s property rights, is an exception to governmental immunity. <em>[Id. </em>at 207.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">We conclude, however, that this does not follow. The distinction between the government\u2019s liability for prospective equitable relief and its liability for retrospective damages or compensation, and the principle that the former kind of liability is generally not barred by sovereign immunity, are fundamental to sovereign immunity law.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The United States Supreme Court, for example, has long recognized this distinction in the context of the states\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in the federal courts, which immunity, the Court has held, does not extend to prospective equitable relief or ancillary costs associated therewith. See, e.g., <em>Missouri v Jenkins, </em>491 US 274, 278-280; 109 S Ct 2463; 105 L Ed 2d 229 (1989); <em>Will v Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 US 58, 71, n 10; 109 S Ct 2304; 105 L Ed 2d 45 (1989) (noting that \"[t]his distinction is 'commonplace in sovereign immunity doctrine\u2019 \u201d); <em>Edelman v Jordan, </em>415 US 651; 94 S Ct 1347; 39 L Ed 2d 662 (1974); Ex <em>parte </em>Young, 209 US 123; 28 S Ct 441; 52 L Ed 714 (1908). This Court recognized this basic distinction in <em>McDowell v State Highway Comm\u2019r, </em>365 Mich 268; 112 NW2d 491 (1961). Upholding an assertion of governmental immunity in that case, we noted that \"plaintiffs attempt to hold a department of the State, and so the State, responsible in damages for a tort. <em>No question of abatement of a nuisance, or of other relief a court </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number><em>of equity might properly grant, </em>is or could be before us on review of these judgments of the court of claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269-270 (emphasis added, citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Furthermore, as Justice Brickley noted in <em>Had-field, </em>both <em>Wyoming Twp, </em>in which the plaintiffs sought abat\u00e9ment of river sewage dumping which affected riparian landowners, and <em>Trowbridge, </em>in which the plaintiffs sought abatement of the operation of a \"piggery\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which afflicted neighboring landowners with offensive insects and odors, fell comfortably within \"the category of trespass-nuisance.\u201d Hadfi<em>eld, </em>430 Mich 174. Given that the challenged conduct in both <em>Wyoming Twp </em>and <em>Trowbridge </em>w\u00e1s \"clearly trespass-nuisance and in line with the exception adopted [in <em>Hadfield],\u201d id. </em>at 175, we see no basis for reading either case as establishing a public nuisance exception.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>We find <em>Pound, supra, </em>to be of no more help in establishing a public nuisance exception. At the outset, the question arises whether <em>Pound </em>is properly even considered as part of the relevant body of historical case law for purposes of \u00a7 7(1). As Justice Brickley noted in <em>Hadfield, </em>430 Mich 176, n 17, \"it may ... be argued\u201d that it is not, given that the bill which became 1964 PA 170 was introduced and passed by the Senate before <em>Pound </em>was decided.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Justice Brickley did not decide this issue in <em>Hadfield, </em>however, and his opinion did not command a majority in any event. Upon further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>consideration, we now conclude that <em>Pound </em>is properly considered for purposes of \u00a7 7(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">First, while the drafters of 1964 PA 170 incorporated the language preserving the scope of governmental immunity \"as it existed heretofore,\u201d and the Senate initially passed it, before <em>Pound </em>was decided, that language was not finally passed by either House of the Legislature or enacted into law until after <em>Pound </em>was decided. See n 6. We believe it is the date of final passage that is most relevant for interpretive purposes; furthermore, a time-relative statutory term like \"heretofore\u201d should ordinarily be interpreted with reference to the date the language takes legal effect. We thus agree with the Court of Appeals in <em>Li (On Second Remand), </em>187 Mich App 486-487, that the Legislature, in adopting 1964 PA 170, must be presumed to have been aware of <em>Pound </em>and to have felt no need to modify the bill to exclude <em>Pound </em>from its scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Second, the intent of the 1964 Legislature in this regard is no longer controlling in any event. The Legislature amended the statute in 1986 by, in part, replacing \"as it existed heretofore\u201d with \"as it existed before July 1, 1965.\u201d 1986 PA 175, \u00a7 1. This amendment mooted the issue regarding what date the word \"heretofore\u201d in the original statute should be interpreted with reference to. <em>Pound, </em>decided more than a year before July 1, 1965, plainly falls within the scope of the amended language. Thus, <em>Pound </em>must be considered as part of the historical case law under \u00a7 7(1) for purposes of applying the test adopted in <em>Hadfield </em>and <em>Li (After </em>Remand).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number><em>Pound </em>involved a claim for injuries caused by water dripping off the roof of the defendant\u2019s public school building, which caused a neighboring public sidewalk to become coated with ice on which the plaintiff slipped and fell. This Court, relying heavily on <em>Ferris v Detroit Bd of Ed, </em>122 Mich 315; 81 NW 98 (1899), found that the claim was not barred by governmental immunity. In <em>Ferris, </em>ice and snow had fallen from the roof of the defendant\u2019s public school building onto the plaintiff\u2019s private premises, causing him to slip and fall. <em>Ferris </em>was thus a classic trespass-nuisance case. As Justice Brickley noted in <em>Had\u00f1eld, </em>430 Mich 159-160, <em>Ferris </em>exemplifies the development of the trespass-nuisance exception to governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">As this Court stated in <em>Pound, </em>that case involved</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACHp\">facts similar enough to those in <em>Ferris </em>to meet that case\u2019s criterion of \"a direct injury to the person of the plaintiff, while outside the limits of the defendant\u2019s premises.\u201d We hold, therefore, that [the claim in <em>Pound </em>is] sufficient to state a cause of action to which the defense of governmental immunity may not be interposed. To hold otherwise would be to establish a distinction between a plaintiff who is directly injured while upon his own premises by the wrongful act of defendant and another plaintiff who is likewise directly injured in a place, such as a public way, where he has a right to be <em>and which is not subject to the authority of defendant. </em>Such a distinction would be without justification in logic or public policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">Defendant cites several cases which have sustained the defense of governmental immunity to actions for tortious injury, but in those cases the injury which plaintiff sustained did not occur, as in <em>Ferris </em>and <em>Pound, </em>\"outside the limits of the defendant\u2019s premises\u201d but rather occurred in areas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>subject to the authority of defendants. See, e.g., <em>McDowell v State Highway Comm\u2019r, </em>365 Mich 268. <em>[Pound, </em>372 Mich 501-502. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-6\"><em>Pound\u2019s </em>citation and distinction of <em>McDowell </em>is highly significant. <em>McDowell, </em>like the instant case of <em>Li, </em>involved a claim arising from the allegedly unsafe maintenance of a roadway. In <em>McDowell, </em>the state highway department\u2019s allegedly negligent failure to drain water from the surface of a highway permitted a dangerous sheet of ice to form. The facts of <em>Li </em>are thus far closer to those of <em>McDowell </em>than to those of <em>Pound. </em>In both <em>Li </em>and <em>Garcia, </em>like <em>McDowell </em>but unlike <em>Pound, </em>the injury occurred in an area subject to the authority of the defendant. Thus, neither <em>Li </em>nor <em>Garcia </em>falls within the narrow exception to governmental immunity enunciated in <em>Pound.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">In sum, <em>Pound </em>did not establish any public nuisance exception to governmental immunity; rather, it established, at most, a narrow corollary to the narrow trespass-nuisance exception recognized by cases such as <em>Ferris </em>and <em>Hadf\u00edeld. </em>Finding no other basis for a public nuisance exception in the case law before July 1, 1965, we conclude that no such exception exists under \u00a7 7(1). Thus, to whatever extent the plaintiffs in <em>Li </em>and <em>Garcia </em>may have properly stated claims of public nuisance \u2014 and we emphasize that we do not pass on that question \u2014 such claims are barred by governmental immunity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">B. NUISANCE PER SE</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">Whether there was an historically recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>nuisance per se exception to governmental immunity poses a more difficult question. Justice Boyle, in her concurring opinion in <em>Hadfield, </em>430 Mich 207-208, expressed the view that a damages claim alleging a nuisance per se would fall outside the scope of governmental immunity, relying upon <em>Wyoming Twp, supra, Trowbridge, supra, </em>and <em>Royston v City of Charlotte, </em>278 Mich 255; 270 NW 288 (1936). As noted above, however, both <em>Wyoming Twp </em>and <em>Trowbridge </em>involved claims for prospective equitable relief, not damages, and are thus inapposite to the governmental immunity issue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\"><em>Royston </em>does provide some support for a nuisance per se exception, stating squarely (albeit in dicta and without supporting citation), that \"[a]cts in the discharge of governmental functions which create a nuisance per se do not come within the immunity otherwise accorded.\u201d 278 Mich 260. While the significance of this language has been questioned, see, e.g., <em>Hadfield, </em>430 Mich 175, n 16 (Brickley, J.), we note that it is undeniably part of the body of historical case law for purposes of applying \u00a77(1), although, to be sure, it lacks the weight which would be accorded to language constituting the ratio decidendi of a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The significance of <em>Royston\u2019s </em>dicta is augmented by a consideration of dicta in <em>Burford v Grand Rapids, </em>53 Mich 98; 18 NW 571 (1884), which held that governmental immunity barred a suit for damages arising from the injury of the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>horse, which was hit by a recreational bobsled on a public street. The plaintiff argued, inter alia, that the defendant was not entitled to immunity because, by authorizing recreational sledding (or \"coasting,\u201d as it was then called) on the street, it had essentially authorized an activity constituting a nuisance per se. Chief Justice Cooley, for the unanimous Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">If it were unquestionable that coasting upon a public highway was always a nuisance, there would be much plausibility in this contention, and perhaps it should be accepted as sound. . . . But coasting does not necessarily interfere with the customary use of the street, and might be indulged in with no serious inconvenience to any one .... On the contrary, as [coasting] itself is healthful and exhilarating, it seems eminently proper, if the street is not put -to other public use, that this diversion be allowed, if not expressly sanctioned. <em>[Id. </em>at 103-104; see also <em>Rosario v City of Lansing, </em>403 Mich 124, 135, n 9; 268 NW2d 230 (1978) (opinion of Fitzgerald, J.)

See <em>Hadfield, </em>430 Mich 207 (Boyle, J., concurring); <em>Gerzeski v Dep\u2019t of State Highways, </em>403 Mich 149, 168; 268 NW2d 525 (1978) (Ryan, J., dissenting); <em>Bluemer v Saginaw Central Oil &amp; Gas Service, Inc, </em>356 Mich 399, 411; 97 NW2d 90 (1959); <em>People v Detroit White Lead Works, </em>82 Mich 471, 476-479; 46 NW 735 (1890). \"[U]nlike the nuisance in fact, nuisance per se is not predicated on the want of care, but is unreasonable by its very nature.\u201d <em>Hadfield, </em>430 Mich 208 (Boyle, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Neither the operation of the traffic light in <em>Li </em>nor the maintenance of the holding pond in <em>Garcia </em>can be said to constitute an intrinsically unreasonable or dangerous activity, without regard for care or circumstances. To the contrary, both activities serve obvious and beneficial public purposes and are clearly capable of being conducted in such a way as not to pose any nuisance at all. The very essence of the claims in both <em>Li </em>and <em>Garcia </em>is that the underlying activities became unreasonable and dangerous under the particular circumstances of each case because the defendants allegedly exercised improper or inadequate care. Thus, regardless of whether nuisance per se might qualify as an exception to governmental immunity, neither <em>Li </em>nor <em>Garcia </em>presents a colorable claim of nuisance per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">III.

See Boyle, J., <em>post, </em>pp 480-481. She also suggests reliance upon five cases cited by <em>Wyoming Twp: Onen v Herkimer, </em>172 Mich 593; 138 NW 198 (1912), <em>Merritt Twp v Harp, </em>131 Mich 174; 91 NW 156 (1902), <em>Seaman v City of Marshall, </em>116 Mich 327; 74 NW 484 (1898), <em>Ashley v Port Huron, </em>35 Mich 296 (1877), and <em>Pennoyer v Saginaw, </em>8 Mich 534 (1860).

That case <em>rejected </em>a claim for damages against a city arising from the flooding of the plaintiff\u2019s cellar by the city sewer, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-10\">The law is well settled in this country, and in England, that towns and boroughs are not liable to individuals for defects in their roads or bridges, except by some statute; and it is obvious that the powers granted to and exercised by the defendants in laying out streets and constructing sewers, are identical with those of highway commissioners in establishing highways and building bridges. [4 Mich 442-443.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">Even if <em>Dermont </em>had authorized recovery against the city, the case would fall squarely within the trespass-nuisance tradition.

While <em>Seaman </em>explicitly authorized, and <em>Ashley </em>and <em>Pennoyer </em>may have implicitly countenanced, damages relief against the governmental defendants, all three cases are classic examples of the tort of trespass-nuisance. This is reflected both in Justice Brickley\u2019s discussion of <em>Pennoyer, Ashley, </em>and <em>Seaman </em>in his <em>Had\u00f1eld </em>plurality opinion, 430 Mich 155-159, and in the explicit language used by this Court in the original decisions. See, e.g., <em>Ashley, </em>35 Mich 301 (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">The right of an individual to the occupation and enjoyment of his premises is exclusive, and the public authorities have no more liberty to <em>trespass </em>upon it than has a private individual.

I write separately to explain that to the extent that my concurrence in <em>Hadfield v Oakland Co Drain Comm\u2019r, </em>430 Mich 139; 422 NW2d 205 (1988), may have been perceived as recognizing the principle that recasting negligence claims as nuisance will avoid the bar of immunity, that view is mistaken. Rather, my reservations regarding trespass nuisance as the only exception to immunity were based on the juridical notion that the Court should not eliminate all possible grounds for action against exceptional activities of government unless required to do so by the application of precedent to the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">Nuisance law can be likened to a kaleidoscope of categories<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> comprised of a shifting mosaic that appears stable only at the moment a given court resolves a given set of issues. The same set of facts, however, may raise claims of public and private nuisance, nuisance per se, and trespass-intruding nuisance. For example, a township\u2019s building of a piggery in a residential area may constitute a nuisance per se, and if an ordinance prohibits such a use, a public nuisance, and if the noise or odors interfere with the use and enjoyment of neighbors, a private nuisance. These shifting concepts sometimes threaten to confound this Court\u2019s investigation into the existence of common-law exceptions to governmental immunity for various types of nuisance and the attempt to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>guidance to lower courts and practitioners regarding actionable nuisance claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">With this as a point of departure, it is important to consider precisely the facts before us. In <em>Li, </em>the plaintiff brought suit to recover for injuries she suffered in an automobile collision that allegedly resulted, in part, from an improperly timed traffic light.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff seeks to recover from the defendants, the city, and two of its employees, on public nuisance and nuisance per se theories. On second remand, the Court of Appeals ruled that the plaintiff had stated a claim of public nuisance on these facts and that the nuisance per se claim was sufficiently colorable to merit further trial court consideration. 170 Mich App 256; 428 NW2d 36 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">In <em>Garcia, </em>the plaintiffs seek to recover for the decedent\u2019s death by drowning in a pond behind a dam connected to an uncapped sewer pipe that created an undercurrent that pulled the decedent toward it. Although the city was aware of a previous drowning, the pipe was not guarded or covered. The plaintiffs also complained of inadequate warnings, which stated \"no swimming,\u201d and failure to implement proper safety regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">1 agree with the majority\u2019s result in <em>Li </em>because it constitutes a classical negligence claim, rather than actionable nuisance, and I agree with the majority\u2019s result in <em>Garcia </em>because the city is correct that, historically, the city would not have been liable in damages for its decisions regarding the proper method of constructing the sewer, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>discretionary function.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although I believe we may yet be persuaded that a limited public nuisance exception to governmental immunity exists, it cannot be said to reach the facts of either of these cases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The majority observes that the argument for recognition of a public nuisance exception rests largely on my concurring opinion in <em>Had\u00f1eld. Ante, </em>Cavanagh, C.J. at 468. As I there observed, public nuisance is derived from criminal law and much of it remains predicated upon violation of statutes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Early common-law cases from this jurisdiction mention public nuisance as an exception to immunity as well. As early as 1857, this Court adverted to public nuisance in examining whether an individual could sue a municipality for damages for a defective public sewer that caused water to back up into his cellar. <em>Dermont v Mayor of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number><em>Detroit, </em>4 Mich 435 (1857). Explicitly distinguishing a situation in which a municipality created a public nuisance, the Court ruled that the corporation was under no obligation to furnish drainage and could not be sued. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in its discussion of nuisance in <em>Burford v Grand Rapids, </em>53 Mich 98, 103; 18 NW 571 (1884), the Court intimated that municipal authorities might be held liable if they licensed a public nuisance noting that \"[i]f it were unquestionable that coasting upon a public highway was always a nuisance, there would be much plausibility in this contention, and perhaps it should be accepted as sound.\u201d In <em>Attorney General ex rel Wyoming Twp v Grand Rapids, </em>175 Mich 503; 141 NW 890 (1913), the Court granted injunctive relief to the township preventing the city from emptying its sewage into a river. The Court emphasized that a city that creates a public nuisance might be liable. <em>Id. </em>at 534.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These authorities suggest the existence of a limited public nuisance exception to immunity. Neither Justice Brickley in <em>Had\u00f1eld, </em>nor Chief Justice Cavanagh in this case, suggest that no public nuisance exception exists. Rather, they appear to counsel against recognizing any public nuisance exception beyond that which falls within the confines of trespass or intruding nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">My reservations regarding the notion that the only public nuisance exception that survives is wholly encompassed within the trespass nuisance category are premised on the view that a potential exception to governmental immunity exists where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>the claim for relief is based on actions of government for those uses of land that constitute an impending danger to persons in the enjoyment of property rights. For example, if the government concluded that it would be profitable to establish a gambling casino, and to situate such an establishment in a residential neighborhood, the government might be subject to abatement and to an action in damages by one who suffered special damages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As this Court explained in <em>Kilts v Kent Co Bd of </em>Supervisors, 162 Mich 646, 651; 127 NW 821 (1910), a nuisance involves a condition \"so serious as to interfere with the comfort of life and enjoyment of property, or so threatening as to constitute an impending danger to persons in the enjoyment of their legitimate rights.\u201d I am not yet persuaded that this limited exception to immunity does not remain. Conceding that the question of a nuisance per se exception \"poses a more difficult question,\u201d the majority bypasses it by ruling that the claims in both <em>Li </em>and <em>Garcia </em>do not \"constitute an intrinsically unreasonable or dangerous activity, without regard for care or circumstances.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>Cavanagh, C.J. at 475, 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In <em>Hadfield, </em>I explained that nuisance per se is a category or method of proving public or private nuisance. It arises in those exceptionally narrow circumstances where \"the Legislature or this Court may label a condition or activity patently unreasonable by its very nature . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the majority acknowledges, there is strong evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>that Michigan courts have recognized a nuisance per se exception to immunity. <em>Ante, </em>Cavanagh, C.J. at 474-477. The majority apparently concludes, however, that because several of the cases finding a nuisance per se overlap with the trespass-nuisance category, that justifies its decision to avoid recognizing it as an historically valid common-law exception to statutory immunity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Thus, I write separately because I believe that the early cases of <em>Wyoming Twp, Trowbridge v City of Lansing, </em>237 Mich 402; 212 NW 73 (1927), <em>Royston v City of Charlotte, </em>278 Mich 255; 270 NW 288 (1936), and <em>Burford, supra, </em>support the existence of a nuisance per se exception to governmental immunity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Such an exception ensures that \"[i]n the few instances wherein the Legislature or this Court may label a condition or activity patently unreasonable by its very nature, the state may not circumvent its liability in connection with the situation or operation by raising the shield\u201d of immunity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">I agree with the majority that neither <em>Li </em>nor <em>Garcia </em>presents facts that would fall within a nuisance per se exception.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-9\"> Categories that this Court has recognized to define and delineate the parameters of nuisance include intentional or negligent nuisance, public or private nuisance, nuisance per se or nuisance per accidens, and intruding or trespass nuisance.

The lead opinion does not define public nuisance, and declines to \"pass on [the] question\u201d whether the <em>Li </em>and <em>Garcia </em>plaintiffs \"have properly stated claims of public nuisance . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The opinion states that decisions of this Court that arguably presented public nuisance claims<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> should not be read to establish a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>public nuisance exception to governmental immunity because these cases fall \"comfortably within 'the category of trespass-nuisance\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and are therefore \" 'in line with the [trespass-nuisance] exception adopted [in <em>Had\u00f1eld].\u2019 </em>\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The lead opinion then cites authority suggesting that there is a nuisance per se exception to governmental immunity,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but finds it unnecessary to decide whether such an exception has been judicially recognized because \"neither <em>Li </em>nor <em>Garcia </em>presents a colorable claim of nuisance per se\u201d as the term has been defined by this Court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">In essence, then, the lead opinion states that nuisance per se. might well be an exception to governmental immunity, but is not presented by these cases, while public nuisance \u2014 no matter what it may be, and whether or not presented by these cases \u2014 is not an exception to governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The effect of the lead opinion\u2019s analysis is to restrict nuisance exceptions to cases presenting trespass-nuisance and, possibly, nuisance per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">The lead opinion defines nuisance per se as \"an activity or condition which constitutes a nuisance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>at all times and under all circumstances, without regard to the care with which it is conducted or maintained,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and as \"an intrinsically unreasonable or dangerous activity . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This Court has also said that the creation or maintenance of a condition statutorily defined as a nuisance constitutes a nuisance per se.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It appears that nuisance per se, under these definitions, constituted an exception to governmental immunity at common law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">I agree with the lead opinion that, to the extent that the instant plaintiffs have failed to allege facts raising colorable claims of nuisance per se\u2014 and, I would add, public nuisance \u2014 it is not appropriate to decide the extent of exceptions from governmental immunity therefor.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">I further agree that neither <em>Li </em>nor <em>Garcia </em>presents a colorable claim of nuisance per se. The activity engaged in by the governmental defendant did not, in either case, constitute \"a nuisance at all times and under all circumstances, without regard to the care with which it is conducted or maintained.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">I also agree that the plaintiff in <em>Li </em>may not maintain an action founded on a public nuisance exception to governmental immunity, but disagree with the reasoning adopted by the lead opinion in reaching that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Taking account of the factual allegations in <em>Garcia, </em>I would hold that a common-law public nuisance exception to governmental immunity might provide the plaintiffs in <em>Garcia </em>with a cause of action against the City of Jackson, a municipal corporation, and thus would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">At common law, depending on the facts of the case and the jurisdiction in which the case arose, liability for personal injury arising out of the creation or maintenance of a nuisance on government property, even where there was no intrusion on private property, was a recognized exception to governmental immunity. The types of nuisance constituting exceptions to immunity were not limited to trespass-nuisance, but encompassed elements of public nuisance, nuisance per se, intentional or \u201cabsolute\u201d nuisance,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and \"attractive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>nuisance.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To judge from what courts did rather than what they said they were doing, these formulations were inconsistently labeled, and overlapped to a large degree. Thus, that findings of governmental liability have not always been neatly coextensive with particular definitions of nuisance should not be determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">The majority, of jurisdictions at common law viewed nuisance as an exception to the immunity of municipal corporations,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and many, though not all, jurisdictions adopting this view allowed recovery for personal injury resulting from maintenance of a nuisance. Most early cases addressing the subject involved trespass-nuisance, but courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>stated broadly that the government had no greater right than a natural or corporate person to maintain a nuisance to the injury of members of the public.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In practice, this often meant that cities were subject to actions at law and in equity for essentially private nuisances, often with a trespassory component, and for damage actions where injuries were caused by defectively maintained public roads or by obstructed or polluted public waterways.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">As applied to municipal corporations,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> a majority of jurisdictions addressing the question have held that governmental immunity does not bar actions to recover damages for personal injury resulting from a nuisance, including a public nuisance, created or maintained by a city, without regard to whether the conduct leading to the creation or maintenance of the nuisance occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>in the exercise of a governmental function.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Some of these jurisdictions have applied this approach to injuries occurring entirely on government property, where no invasion of private property occurred.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">It appears that the common law of Michigan, as it had developed before July 1, 1965, does not yield a satisfactorily clear answer to the question whether certain types of nuisance, including \"public nuisance,\u201d constituted an exception to governmental immunity from actions for damages,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> particularly in the context of personal injury suffered entirely on government property.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">While there are \" 'few landmarks to be found\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> directly in point in Michigan case law, it is clear that there is a territory, albeit imperfectly defined, of public nuisance for which a member of the public may maintain an action against a govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>mental entity. It is the responsibility of this Court to draw reasoned lines to establish the boundaries of that territory.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>[A] majority of the courts which have passed upon the question have held that the immunity of municipal corporations from liability for acts done in the performance of governmental functions does not extend to cases of personal injuries or death resulting from a nuisance created or maintained by a municipality[.] [Id., \u00a7 649, p 358.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>From at least as early as 1860, this Court has recognized that members of the public had a right to be free from nuisances created or maintained by municipalities, and that, when this right was violated, damages were recoverable in appropriate cases.

As set forth in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>lead opinion, <em>ante, </em>pp 475-476, the city was held not liable because coasting was not \"always a nuisance.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In his discussion of municipal liability,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Justice Cooley cited <em>Little v City of Madison, </em>42 Wis 643 (1877), for the proposition that \"any dangerous and illegal use of a city street under the license of its common council will be a nuisance for the consequences of which the city must respond.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">In <em>Kilts v Kent Co Bd of Supervisors, </em>162 Mich 646; 127 NW 821 (1910), the plaintiff alleged both negligence and nuisance in an action arising out of the death of an employee working on a water tower platform, which collapsed. The Court disposed of the negligence claim, but <em>not </em>the nuisance claim, on the ground of governmental immunity. The nuisance claim was dismissed on definitional grounds: the plaintiff\u2019s decedent, an employee, was not regarded as a member of the public while on the premises, and thus could not assert the claim of public nuisance that would have been available if the injury had been occasioned by a \"defective structure\u201d that was \"contiguous to a highway.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 650. Nor could he assert the claim of private nuisance that would have been available if the tower had been \"adjacent to an adjoining proprietor\u2019s land so that it was a menace to his property, or to his person in the use of his land[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In <em>Attorney General ex rel Wyoming Twp v Grand Rapids, </em>175 Mich 503, 534; 141 NW 890 (1913), the Court held that dumping sewage into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>the Grand River was an enjoinable public nuisance. In observing that cities creating public nuisances were \"subject to the same rules as would be a private individual,\u201d the Court cited <em>Pennoyer </em>and <em>Ashley, supra, </em>both of which were actions for damages. The city\u2019s conduct in <em>Wyoming Twp </em>risked physical injury to the public at least as much as damage to property, and directly affected a navigable waterway, the very waterway involved in <em>Garcia.</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Further, after enactment of the governmental tort liability act, justices of this Court recognized nuisance exceptions to governmental immunity other than nuisance per se and trespass-nuisance.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The lead opinion, acknowledging that nuisance is an unstated exception to governmental immunity, leaves intact the trespass-nuisance exception previously discovered in the cases, and reserves the question whether nuisance per se constitutes a further exception to governmental immunity. The lead opinion dismisses the public nuisance exception by arguing that a number of public nuisance cases in which damages were recovered against governmental entities may be explained in other terms.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>The absence of clear authority in Michigan allowing recovery against a governmental entity for maintenance of a public nuisance does not justify the lead opinion\u2019s sweeping conclusion that a public nuisance exception did not exist at common law. There is no authority, other than today\u2019s pronouncement, to support the intuition that the Legislature, which the Court has acknowledged did not contemplate or address abrogation of nuisance causes of action,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \"intended,\u201d in enacting the governmental tort liability act,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> to allow recovery for trespass-nuisance and (perhaps) nuisance per se, but did not so \"intend\u201d with regard to public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">The lead opinion reads this Court\u2019s prior decisions narrowly, and does not consider the possibility that prior cases may not have arisen in such a way as to place directly in issue recovery of damages for injury suffered on governmental property as a result of a \u00a1public nuisance. With the sole exception of <em>McDowell v State Hwy Comm\u2019r, </em>365 Mich 268; 112 NW2d 491 (1961), which is readily distinguishable as involving sovereign immunity,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the signers of the lead opinion cannot point to any case in which this Court has expressly rejected such recovery, or in which this Court has ruled that, while other jurisdictions have held otherwise, the rule excepting nuisance actions from governmental immunity does not apply to public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The concern of those who favor expansive construction of governmental immunity is that, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>a substantive nuisance exception to be explicitly recognized in an area of the law lacking in fixed boundaries, any misstep by a governmental entity might subject that entity to liability, culminating in fiscal hemorrhage. This concern is understandable, but does not justify the conclusion that there is no public nuisance exception to governmental immunity. Public nuisance must be clearly defined, and rationally confined, so as to prevent an end run around governmental immunity. Line drawing is the business of this Court; that we might encounter difficulties does not relieve us of our responsibility.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">In <em>Garfield Twp v Young, </em>348 Mich 337, 341-342; 82 NW2d 876 (1957), this Court adopted Prosser\u2019s definition of public nuisance, which imparts some of the history of the concept:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">\"[A]n act or omission 'which obstructs or causes inconvenience or damage to the public in the exercise of rights common to all Her Majesty\u2019s subjects.\u2019 The term comprehends a miscellaneous and diversified group of minor criminal offenses, based on some interference with the interests of the community, or the comfort or convenience of the general public. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">\"To be considered public, the nuisance must affect an interest common to the general public, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>rather than peculiar to one individual, or severed. ... It is not necessary, however, that the entire community be affected, so long as the nuisance will interfere with those who come in contact with it in the exercise of a public right.\u201d (Prosser [Torts], \u00a7 71, pp. 401, 402.)[<footnotemark>34</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">In the early stages of development of the law, only conduct constituting a criminal offense was a public nuisance. According to the Second Restatement of Torts, however, it is now established that, in a public nuisance action, \"a defendant need not be subject to criminal responsibility. Thus a municipal corporation, which cannot be prosecuted for a crime, may still be liable in tort for the creation or maintenance of a public nuisance if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>conduct is such that a private individual would be liable.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Courts in other jurisdictions have held municipal corporations subject to liability in public nuisance for creating or maintaining conditions that endanger the health or safety of members of the public. Courts addressing liability for nuisance, including those speaking in terms of public nuisance, have offered inconsistent definitions and modes of analysis. Some of the cases are perhaps properly considered to involve attractive nuisances, and some involve public ways.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The exception to immunity for public nuisance derived in part from the notion that certain acts or omissions of governmental entities went significantly beyond negligence.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The same intuition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>that prompted courts to grant relief for trespass-nuisance may have prompted courts to allow recovery for injuries sustained as a result of defective public ways, including highways<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and water<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>ways, and for other forms of harm suffered by persons while in the exercise of undoubted \"public rights.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The exception from immunity for trespass-nuisance did not evolve solely from concern about takings of private property without just compensation.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Judicial decisions allowing recovery for personal injury as well as damage to property on the basis of trespass-nuisance indicate that the right of action for trespass-nuisance does not depend on constitutional doctrine. In <em>Ferris v Detroit Bd of Ed, </em>122 Mich 315; 81 NW 98 (1899), this Court found that governmental immunity did not bar a claim for injuries sustained when, as expressed by the lead opinion, \"ice and snow [fell] from the roof of the defendant\u2019s public school building onto the plaintiff\u2019s private premises, causing him to slip and fall.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>\"Intruding\u201d governmental conduct constituting a nuisance may cause physical injury to a plaintiff without amounting to a taking, and without causing sufficient harm to the plaintiff\u2019s property to amount to actionable private nuisance, although it may in some cases also constitute trespass. If governmental liability for personal injury caused by nuisance be admitted in such cases, there would seem to be no sound reason to predicate availability of a remedy on the often fortuitous circumstance of where the plaintiff happened to be standing at the time of the injury.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Although the lead opinion posits a gulf between trespass-nuisance and public nuisance, it is clear that they are aspects of the same principle. This Court had not ruled or suggested before July 1, 1965, that while a member of the community has an historical right to recover for personal injury caused by a nuisance that impinges on his or her property notwithstanding governmental immunity, there is no parallel historical right to recover for personal injury suffered in the road or waterway that runs in front of the property and constitutes its only link to the rest of the world.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The governmental entities involved in these cases as defendants and amici curiae have issued dire warnings that recognition of nuisance exceptions will eradicate the longstanding immunity for negligent performance of governmental functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">In <em>Royston v City of Charlotte, 278 </em>Mich 255, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>260; 270 NW 288 (1936), recovery was denied to a plaintiff injured on a defectively maintained park swing. This Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">Acts in the discharge of governmental functions which create a nuisance per. se do not come within the immunity otherwise accorded. Want of care in maintenance, however, presents the question of negligence only, and not that of a public nuisance, which must rest on inherent danger even under the best of care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">These remarks were dicta \u2014 no nuisance per se was presented in the case \u2014 but demonstrate the Court\u2019s awareness of the exception, which extends to public nuisance as well. The Court was not careful with the definition of public nuisance, which is here made to seem indistinguishable from nuisance per se. The Court\u2019s primary concern appears to have been the hazard that actions predicated on negligence might be recast as \"nuisance\u201d to evade governmental immunity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">Application of such rule would abrogate the established doctrine of governmental immunity by merely classifying as a nuisance the result of the negligence of the municipal agents and employees in the maintenance of a governmental instrumentality, and for which the city is not liable, to one of liability under another designation; or, in other words, immunizing the negligence but not the result.[<footnotemark>44</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">It would indeed be incorrect to hold that every act of negligence on the part of a municipality is actionable as a nuisance. But the complementary proposition \u2014 that an action in nuisance can never be predicated on negligent acts \u2014 is equally untena<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>ble. Because the city\u2019s particular acts or omissions constituting negligent maintenance of the park swing were not themselves grounds of liability, the consequences of negligent maintenance, without more, could not be the subject of a nuisance action.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The Court did not suggest that the presence of negligence invariably precludes maintenance of a nuisance action. Decisions in other jurisdictions state the contrary.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">I turn to the disposition of the instant cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">In <em>Li, </em>I agree with the result reached by the lead opinion. The plaintiff essentially asserts that the City of Ann Arbor created or maintained a dangerous condition \u2014 a poorly timed traffic signal \u2014in a public road, thus interfering with plaintiff\u2019s safe use of the road. Such interference, usually styled a public nuisance, lies at the core of the nuisance exception to governmental immunity.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Plaintiff alleges that the traffic signal at issue was programmed in such a way that a particular motorist was often obliged to remain at the intersection through two light cycles before being allowed to turn left. Faced with this hindrance, plaintiff\u2019s driver ran a red light to make a left turn. Plaintiff argues that \"[s]afe travel on the public highway on which she rode was impeded by the programmed signal light which was dangerous in itself, a nui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>sanee per se, as well as being an obstruction to travel, a public nuisance.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AM0N\">Nuisance causes of action have been successfully asserted against governmental entities where traffic signs or signals were malfunctioning (particularly if the malfunctions were clearly dangerous),<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> and, under similar circumstances, where the defendant had actual or constructive notice of the defect. However, no published decision in Michigan or any other jurisdiction appears to hold a governmental entity subject to liability for nuisance per se, or public nuisance, or nuisance of any stripe, where the asserted obstruction to travel was anything like the improperly programmed traffic signal here alleged.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Nor do these allegations appear to support a cause of action against a governmental entity on any other legal theory.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Only <em>unreasonable </em>obstructions are public nuisances.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> \"[I]ntrinsically unreasonable or danger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ous\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> conditions are nuisances per se. The traffic light that led to disaster in <em>Li </em>was, no doubt, frustrating and annoying, but it was not treacherous,, and did not constitute a trap.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">In contrast with <em>Li, </em>the complaint in <em>Garcia </em>alleged a condition that was, although not so unavoidably dangerous as to constitute a nuisance per se, a deadly trap for the decedent, of which the city had notice. On these allegations, the question whether such a cause of action may be maintained can properly be resolved only with reference to all the facts of the case, inquiry into which has been foreclosed by the lead opinion\u2019s determination that public nuisance is not an exception to governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The trespass-nuisance and public nuisance exceptions to governmental immunity include the well-established principle that members of the community may not be impeded from the safe use of ways of necessity, such as public roads and navigable waterways, which have historically been the lines of communication making community possible. Nor may a member of the community be dispossessed by the government of - his physical well-being while \"in a place, such as a public way, where he has a right to be.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Such \"a place\u201d may, depending on the circumstances as they appear after full factual development, include premises \"subject to the authority of defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">The record does not permit resolution of the critical question in <em>Garcia: </em>whether, and in what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>capacity, the plaintiff\u2019s decedent may have had a right to swim in the holding pond behind the Holton Dam in Jackson. The dam and pond are an obstruction, albeit a governmentally created obstruction, in the path of the Grand River. If the holding pond were still an undisturbed part of the Grand River, a municipality might not have the authority to bar a member of the community from using the waters for transportation or recreation.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">A governmental entity, certainly a municipal corporation, would be subject to liability for creating a nuisance by contaminating the river, just as it would be subject to liability for creating a nuisance by contaminating private property. As the city has no greater right than a private person to commit a trespass on private land, a member of the community ordinarily has as much right as the city to the use of a waterway such as the Grand River, at least as the Grand River existed in the days before projects such as Holton Dam were undertaken.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> A governmental entity ordinarily has no inherent right to obstruct the use of, or create a trap in, a way of necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">It is clear, of course, that a few things have changed since Michigan was settled.

The Court in <em>Pound </em>did not state whether the formulations recited were words of description or words of limitation. The quoted phrases clearly describe what the Court actually did in that case, holding a governmental entity subject to liability for injuries received by a plaintiff while in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>an area where he had a right to be and which was not subject to the authority of the governmental defendant. To parse the <em>Pound </em>formulations as words of limitation, so as to suggest that a governmental defendant maintaining a nuisance on a public way, or in another place where a plaintiff has an undoubted right to be, will not be subject to liability <em>unless </em>the site of the injury is \"outside the limits of the defendant\u2019s premises,\u201d is to read into <em>Pound </em>a proposition that this Court has never stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">The distinction by the Court in <em>Pound </em>of <em>McDowell, </em>n 4 <em>supra, </em>as a case involving injury in an area subject to the authority of the governmental defendant does not, contrary to the lead opinion\u2019s assertion, appear to be \"highly significant,\u201d <em>ante, </em>p 474, for reasons set out in n 38 <em>supra. </em>Assuming that the school district in <em>Pound </em>was accorded the same sovereign immunity as the state highway department in <em>McDowell, </em>see <em>Sayers v School Dist No 1, </em>366 Mich 217; 114 NW2d 191 (1962), the fact remains that municipal corporations were not entitled to sovereign immunity at common law.

It must have violated the absolute duty of refraining 'from the participating acts, not merely the relative duty of exercising reasonable care, foresight and prudence in their performance.

The court approved admission into evidence of a city ordinance that defined such conditions as nuisances and provided penalties for their maintenance. Insofar as the city\u2019s conduct was unlawful, and maintenance of the water pit constituted a nuisance as defined by law, the water pit might properly have been further characterized as a public nuisance or a nuisance per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Because attractive nuisance is part of the law of negligence, see n 16, the plaintiff must show that maintenance of the holding pond was not a \"governmental function.\u201d See <em>Heino v Grand Rapids, </em>202 Mich 363; 168 NW 512 (1918).

It would remain a question of fact whether the \"no swimming\u201d signs posted by the defendant, and even the warning the plaintiff\u2019s decedent is said to have received from a playmate, were sufficient to support such a defense in light of allegations that the decedent was mentally retarded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
