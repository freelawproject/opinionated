See <em>Babin </em>v. <em>Ashland, </em>160 Ohio St. 328, 116 N. E. 2d 580, paragraph six of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>However, the Charter of the city of Dayton which governs contains the following provisions:</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Section 84. \u201cThe City Purchasing Agent shall, in manner provided by ordinance, purchase all supplies for the city, sell all real and personal property of the city not needed or unsuitable for public use * *</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Section 85. \u201cBefore making any purchase or sale, the City Purchasing Agent shall give opportunity for competition * *</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Section 92. \u201cAll contracts, agreements or other obligations entered into and all ordinances passed, resolutions and orders adopted, contrary to the provisions of the preceding sections, shall be void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">Section 85 specifically states that before making a sale of real property opportunity for competition shall be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">Under the evidence in this case, the sale of the city\u2019s property was conducted pursuant to a prior arrangement, whereby the Mayos were favored and placed in an advantageous position with the result that an exchange of properties actually took place in such a manner as to preclude fair and unhampered opportunity for competition in the purchase of the property by others, including Young who was interested in making the purchase. By the arrangement described, Section 85 of the City Charter was violated and the sale to the Mayos was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">Such were the findings and conclusions of the Court of Appeals, with which we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b105-14\">Matthias, O\u2019Neill, Herbert and Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b105-15\">Taft, C.J., and Schneider, J., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b105-16\">Taft, C.

Hence, there was an \u201copportunity for competition\u201d within the meaning of Section 85 of the Dayton Charter. Since there were no other bidders, there is no basis for concluding that there was any interference with that \u201copportunity for competition.\u201d</p>\n<judges id=\"b105-17\">Schneider, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
