Years later, each Defendant was convicted of robbery in violation of California Penal Code (\"CPC\") \u00a7 211. Upon completion of their prison terms, both Defendants were deported to Mexico after immigration officers determined that their robbery convictions were for \"crimes of violence\"-and thus constituted aggravated felonies under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After returning to the United States, both defendants were convicted of illegal reentry in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In these consolidated appeals, they collaterally attack their removal orders, arguing that a conviction under CPC \u00a7 211 no longer qualifies under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) as\n   a crime of violence. We agree with that argument. But that agreement avails the Defendants little, because the district courts in both cases correctly held that \u00a7 211 robbery qualifies as a generic theft offense under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(G), and thus is an aggravated felony under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii).

Carcamo pleaded guilty to CPC \u00a7 211 robbery in 2009 and received a three-year sentence. After release from prison, each Defendant was served with a Notice of Intent to Issue a Final Administrative Removal Order (\"Notice\") and placed in expedited removal proceedings pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201228\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The district courts denied the motions, reasoning that even if CPC \u00a7 211 robbery were not a \"crime of violence\" aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F), it still was a \"theft offense\" aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). Carcamo entered into a conditional plea agreement allowing him to appeal the denial of his \u00a7 1326(d) motion.

But, this case arrives in a quite different procedural posture than our direct review of BIA decisions. In addressing petitions for review, our inquiry is limited to determining whether the agency decision is supported by substantial evidence or the BIA made an error of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan v.
