After testing for sobriety and finding marijuana in the vehicle, police transported him to the Hamilton County Jail. Dingman conducted the booking procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During booking, Parrish told Dingman he had several physical impairments from breaking his right femur and right arm in a motorcycle accident five years earlier. Dingman had heard about the accident and knew Parrish had significant injuries. Parrish walked with a limp. He told Dingman that he wears prescription glasses for double vision and special orthotic shoes because his right leg is shorter than his left. Dingman let him keep his shoes and glasses in the holding cell. Parrish also asked for an isolated cell due to his physical impairments. After completing intake, Dingman gave Parrish a mattress to make him more comfortable and escorted him to the male holding cell. During booking and intake, Parrish was cooperative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Surveillance video captured what happened next. Parrish walked through the cell door holding the mattress in front of his chest. Dingman was behind him. Seeing another inmate in the cell, Parrish turned\n   to face Dingman and asked again for an isolated cell. Dingman shook his head no. Parrish then stepped forward toward the open cell door \"to get the doorway open to get [Dingman's] answer.\" The mattress protruded through the cell door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dingman believed Parrish was attacking him and trying to leave the holding cell. He was concerned Parrish could use the mattress as a shield. Dingman then stepped into the cell, pushed Parrish into the wall, leveraged him to the floor with his hands on Parrish's arm and neck, and handcuffed him. Parrish's right wrist was swollen and bruised from the handcuffs. He later received chiropractic treatment for lower back pain and four injured ribs. He also sought mental health treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Parrish sued Dingman, Hagenson, and Hamilton County under federal and state law. The officers and the County invoked qualified and statutory immunity. The district court granted them summary judgment. Parrish appeals his claims against Dingman for excessive force and assault and battery, and his claim against the County for respondeat superior liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This court reviews de novo the grant of summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity, \"viewing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Chambers v.
