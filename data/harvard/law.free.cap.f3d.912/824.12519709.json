Consistent with the conclusions of our sister circuits who have addressed the issue, we conclude that the district court was correct in determining that it does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   However, due to the many other arguments raised in this appeal, we AFFIRM in part, AFFIRM as modified in part, VACATE in part, and REMAND for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Coleman was in the Air Force from 1999 to 2005. In 2005, she had a laparoscopic gastric band (\"lap band\") inserted by a private medical facility. In April 2014, Coleman went to the Audie L. Murphy Memorial VA Hospital in San Antonio (VAH-SA), where she complained of daily vomiting and reflux. She requested removal of the lap band and a surgical revision to a sleeve gastrectomy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A lap band removal date was eventually scheduled for November 2015. However, in November 2015, a resident under the supervision of an attending physician performed an upper endoscopy and concluded that there was no evidence of the lap band slipping, so the lap band was left in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Coleman reported continuing symptoms, and, in February 2016, the VA referred Coleman to the San Antonio Military Medical Center (SAMMC), where another physician agreed to schedule Coleman for lap band removal and a possible sleeve gastrectomy. However, before those surgeries could be performed, Coleman returned to the VAH-SA, was diagnosed with a slipped lap band, and, in March 2016, a VAH-SA physician surgically removed the lap band. Coleman still requested to proceed with the sleeve gastrectomy. In May 2016, a SAMMC physician attempted to perform the sleeve gastrectomy, but aborted the procedure mid-surgery after concluding that the risk of post-operative complications was too high. In July 2016, Coleman went to a private medical facility where the sleeve gastrectomy was ultimately performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   From March 2016 through October 2016, Coleman filed at least a dozen administrative complaints with the VA. Those complaints alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the VA was negligent in treating her slipped lap band, negligent in approving her sleeve gastrectomy procedure, negligent in failing to refer her for a psychological evaluation, and negligent in prescribing her medications. She also alleged that the VA wrongfully disclosed her medical records, wrongfully recorded her phone calls, wrongfully operated on her without her consent, wrongfully inflicted emotional distress on her son, and wrongfully discriminated against her based on her race, gender, and disability. The VA denied all of those claims. When the VA mailed its denial letters to her, Coleman accused the VA of threatening, harassing, and oppressing her, as well as retaliating against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 17, 2016, Coleman filed her original complaint in federal district court. The next day she filed her first amended complaint. Less than a week later, she filed her second amended complaint. Then, on November 7, 2016, she filed her third amended complaint, which the district court determined to be the live pleading for its summary judgment determination. In that complaint, as liberally construed, she asserts numerous claims against the VA under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   including allegations of medical malpractice, violations of the Privacy Act,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and discrimination in violation of the Civil Rights Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   She sought monetary damages. However, some of her administrative complaints were not yet denied by the VA at the time that she filed her third amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To support some of her medical malpractice claims, Coleman offered reports from two medical experts, Dr. Saini and Dr. Flancbaum. The magistrate judge assigned to the case struck the testimony of Dr. Saini after determining that Coleman repeatedly failed to make him available for deposition, but allowed the testimony of Dr. Flancbaum over the government's objection that Texas law required medical experts in malpractice lawsuits to be \"practicing medicine.\" The magistrate judge concluded that Texas state requirements governing expert witness qualification were not applicable to FTCA claims brought in federal court, noting that \"whether a witness is qualified as an expert is a matter to which the Federal Rules of Evidence apply.\" The government objected to that conclusion. The district court then declined to adopt that recommendation of the magistrate judge and struck Dr. Flancbaum's testimony, reasoning that Federal Rule of Evidence 601 requires a federal court hearing a medical malpractice claim under the FTCA to apply state rules for determining the competency of proffered medical experts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Once both of Coleman's proffered medical experts were stricken, the district court held that she could not meet her threshold burden for establishing the relevant standard of care, and consequently the court granted summary judgment to the government on Coleman's FTCA medical malpractice claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As to the privacy-related claims, the district court construed Coleman's pleadings as using violations of the federal Privacy Act as the basis for bringing claims under\n   the FTCA. For the privacy-related claims that were not denied by the VA at the time Coleman filed her third amended complaint, the district court determined that they were not administratively exhausted under the FTCA and dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. For the privacy-related claims deemed to be exhausted, the district court determined that Coleman had not produced sufficient evidence that the alleged disclosures were harmful or willful. Consequently, the district court granted summary judgment to the government on those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The district court then determined that to the extent Coleman had alleged claims of discrimination, infliction of emotional distress on her son, and assault and battery, she had failed to offer evidence in support of those claims sufficient to survive summary judgment. As to the assault and battery claim, the district court further held that even if Coleman had offered sufficient evidence, her intentional tort claims were jurisdictionally-barred under the FTCA. Thus, the district court held that \"summary judgment and/or dismissal\" was appropriate for all the remaining claims. Coleman's motion for reconsideration was denied. Coleman timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The filings of a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigant are \" 'to be liberally construed,' ... and 'a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   complaint, however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    Erickson v.

Liberally construed, she argues that the district court erred by: (1) applying\n   Texas witness competency requirements to disqualify the proffered expert for her FTCA medical malpractice claim; (2) dismissing some of her privacy-related claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies; (3) granting summary judgment on the remaining privacy-related claims; and (4) holding that her assault and battery claims were both unsupported and jurisdictionally-barred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Coleman argues that the district court erred by applying a Texas state requirement governing expert witness qualification to disqualify the proffered testimony of Dr. Flancbaum in her malpractice claims brought under the FTCA. The FTCA is a limited waiver of the federal government's immunity from tort lawsuits, allowing plaintiffs to sue the federal government \"for money damages ...

Specifically, the Texas statute states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (a) In a suit involving a health care liability claim against a physician for injury to or death of a patient, a person may qualify as an expert witness on the issue of whether the physician departed from accepted standards of medical care only if the person is a physician who:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (1) is practicing medicine at the time such testimony is given or was practicing medicine at the time the claim arose;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (2) has knowledge of accepted standards of medical care for the diagnosis, care, or treatment of the illness, injury, or condition involved in the claim; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (3) is qualified on the basis of training or experience to offer an expert opinion regarding those accepted standards of medical care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (b) For the purpose of this section, \"practicing medicine\" or \"medical practice\" includes, but is not limited to,\n   training residents or students at an accredited school of medicine or osteopathy or serving as a consulting physician to other physicians who provide direct patient care, upon the request of such other physicians.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (d) The court shall apply the criteria specified in Subsections (a), (b), and (c) in determining whether an expert is qualified to offer expert testimony on the issue of whether the physician departed from accepted standards of medical care, but may depart from those criteria if, under the circumstances, the court determines that there is a good reason to admit the expert's testimony. The court shall state on the record the reason for admitting the testimony if the court departs from the criteria.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2074.401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 74.401.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The magistrate judge in this case determined that Section 74.401(a) does not apply to FTCA claims, holding instead that the question of expert witness qualification in federal courts is determined solely by the Federal Rules of Evidence, and that Dr. Flancbaum was qualified as an expert witness under Federal Rule of Evidence 702.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court, however, determined that Section 74.401(a) does apply to FTCA claims because of Federal Rule of Evidence 601,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that Dr. Flancbaum must therefore be qualified to act as an expert witness under both Texas law and Rule 702. The district court then stated it was \"undisputed\" that Dr. Flancbaum was not \"practicing medicine\" during the relevant time periods, and disqualified him as an expert witness under Section 74.401(a) without reaching the question of qualification under Rule 702. However, a review of the briefs and the record reflects that this point was indeed disputed-both before the district court and again on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Now on appeal, Coleman disputes the district court's determination. Fundamentally, Coleman's argument is that Texas's expert witness qualification rule is purely procedural and therefore inapplicable to FTCA claims brought in federal courts. As such, she asserts that the district court erred, that the admissibility of Dr. Flancbaum's expert witness testimony should have been determined solely by applying Rule 702, and that interpreting Rule 601 to require the importation of Texas expert witness requirements into federal court would put Rule 601 into conflict with Rule 702. The government responds that Texas's expert witness qualification rule is at least partially substantive and must be applied by federal courts under Rule 601. As such, the government asserts that the district court correctly applied the relevant state requirements, and that Rule 601 's importation of state competency requirements is not in conflict with Rule 702 's admissibility requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   District courts within this circuit have split on the issue.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Muniz v.

That is especially true in medical malpractice claims, where the substantive law of the state requires that the testimony of an expert witness, rather than the text of a statute, establish the relevant standard of care against which the defendant will be held. Thus, defining who is competent to offer the testimony that establishes the legally relevant standard of care is itself a substantive action. As the Ninth Circuit held in a very similar case: \"[T]he [state] statute here [governing expert witness competency for medical malpractice suits] is intertwined with the state's professional negligence law because it limits what kind of professional can testify to the standard of care. That limitation,\n   in turn, affects the standard of care against which the defendant's conduct will be tested-an inherently substantive inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    Liebsack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048860\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/731/850/#p855\">\n    731 F.3d at 856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As such, reading Rule 601 to import state requirements for expert witness competency in this case incorporates rather than conflicts with the\n   <em>\n    Erie\n   </em>\n   doctrine, as the question of who can testify to the relevant standard of care is at least partially substantive in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Moreover, the question of competency under Rule 601 complements rather than displaces the question of admissibility under Rule 702. Commentators have observed that \" Rule 601 pertains specifically to the legal status to testify as a witness[,]\" and \"one key to establishing the scope of Rule 601 is to distinguish between competency and admissibility. ... [A] witness might be able to offer testimony that is admissible, but that witness still is prevented from taking the stand if [he is not competent to testify].\" 27 Charles Wright &amp; Victor Gold, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 6003 (2d ed. 2007). Thus, an expert's testimony might be admissible under Rule 702, yet the witness himself barred under Rule 601 when relevant state law deems him legally incompetent to testify on the matter. Conversely, an expert might be legally competent to testify under Rule 601, yet nonetheless offer testimony that is inadmissible under Rule 702. As the Sixth Circuit held: \"We therefore find no conflict between [Tennessee's expert witness statute, as applied through Rule 601,] and Fed.R.Evid. 702, since the first is directed at establishing the substantive issue in the case, and the second is a gatekeeping measure designed to ensure 'fairness in administration' of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Legg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"940778\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/286/286/#p289\">\n    286 F.3d at 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (referencing Fed.

As already noted, Coleman explicitly disputed this point both before the district court and before us. Section 74.401(b) provides a non-exhaustive list of activities that constitute \"practicing medicine\" under state law, and, while Texas affords trial courts considerable discretion in determining whether an expert's activities constitute \"practicing medicine\" at the relevant times-\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Larson v.

For example, this court can easily imagine a situation wherein a well-respected and recently retired surgeon would still be eligible to act as an expert witness in a medical\n   malpractice case even if he was no longer performing surgeries. Thus, on remand the district court must consider whether Dr. Flancbaum performed activities that would be deemed to be \"practicing medicine\" under the non-exhaustive definition provided in Section 74.401(b) ; and alternatively, even if he was not \"practicing medicine\" as Texas defines the term, whether he is nonetheless competent to testify under Section 74.401(d), which permits departure from the \"practicing medicine\" requirement where there is \"good reason.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Consequently, we VACATE the judgment of the district court deeming it to be undisputed that Dr. Flancbaum was not competent to testify as a medical expert, and REMAND for that dispute to be adjudicated in the first instance, as well as for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Coleman next argues that the district court erred by holding that she did not exhaust the administrative remedies for some of the privacy-related allegations possibly raised in her complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The district court determined that only some of Coleman's privacy-related claims were administratively exhausted-those that had been denied by the VA on or before the date that she filed her third amended complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those claims were allowed to proceed-and then disposed of by summary judgment,\n   <em>\n    see infra\n   </em>\n   Section III.C.-while any other privacy-related claims possibly raised by Coleman's complaint were dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Coleman's argument appears to be that the government waived its ability to raise failure to exhaust as an affirmative defense.

Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment for the government on Coleman's Privacy Act claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Those claims also fail because, as the district court correctly held, Coleman failed to present sufficient evidence that\n   the VA acted with at least gross negligence in disclosing the information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carrington v.

Coleman's claim is that the VA operated on her without her consent when a resident performed the upper endoscopy in November 2015. Coleman is correct that the district court erred by holding that it was jurisdictionally-barred from considering her allegations of assault and battery under the FTCA in this context; nevertheless, we hold that summary judgment was appropriate for this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The district court based its determination that Coleman's assault and battery claim was jurisdictionally-barred on the exception to the FTCA codified in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202680\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) (stating the United States' waiver of sovereign immunity under the FTCA shall not apply to \"[a]ny claim arising out of assault, battery ...\").

As such, even though the claim was not jurisdictionally-barred, summary judgment was proper and we AFFIRM this portion of the district court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In summary, the district court was correct in its determination that Federal Rule of Evidence 601 requires that Coleman's proffered expert witness must satisfy the state law standards for expert witness competency in addition to the Federal Rule of Evidence 702 standards for the admissibility of expert witness testimony. However, because the district court erred in its determination that it was undisputed that Coleman's proffered expert failed to meet those state law standards, and also failed to consider whether there was \"good reason\" for excusing that requirement, we VACATE and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The district court's dismissal for non-exhaustion of any privacy-related claims\n   raised in Coleman's complaint that were not denied by the VA by the date that the third amended complaint was filed is AFFIRMED as modified. The district court's summary judgment for the government on the three privacy-related claims that were reached on their merits is AFFIRMED. Finally, the district court's determination that summary judgment was appropriate on the assault and battery claim is AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Unlike a lap band procedure, which involves placing a band around the patient's stomach, a sleeve gastrectomy is the surgical removal of a portion of the patient's stomach.\n    <em>\n     See Sleeve Gastrectomy\n    </em>\n    , Mayo Clinic , https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sleevegastrectomy/about/pac-20385183 (last visited Oct. 29, 2018).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Stat.%20842\">\n     60 Stat. 842\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (codified as amended at\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201346\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b), 2671 -2680 ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Privacy Act of 1974, Pub.
