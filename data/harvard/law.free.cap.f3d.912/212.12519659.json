U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (USSG) \u00a7\u00a7 2A2.1, 2K2.1(c)(l)(A), 2X1.l(a) (2016). We directed supplemental briefing on the additional issue of whether in light of USSG \u00a7 5G3.1(c), the district court erred in failing to impose its sentence to run concurrently with an anticipated term of state imprisonment. We now affirm the district court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 4, 2016, Officer A.D. Gardner of the Winston-Salem Police Department stopped a speeding vehicle occupied by Lynn along with two other individuals. While standing near the vehicle, Officer Gardner smelled marijuana, and he requested additional officers for assistance. When the other officers arrived, Officer Gardner asked each of the occupants to exit the vehicle. After Officer Gardner frisked Lynn, Gardner instructed him to stand by a guardrail with the driver of the vehicle. As Officer Nicholas Powell was frisking another passenger, Lynn jumped into the driver's side of the vehicle and Officer Powell followed, landing on top of him. The two struggled over control of the vehicle, with Lynn putting the vehicle into drive, and Officer Powell pulling the emergency brake. The vehicle rolled away, and Officer Gardner pursued it. He heard a gunshot, and when he reached the vehicle, he saw Officer Powell lying on top of Lynn and holding Lynn's left hand, in which Lynn had a pistol pointed at Officer Powell. Officer Powell had suffered gunshot wounds to his arms and chest. Lynn had also suffered a gunshot wound, although Officer Powell had not fired his weapon during the struggle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Lynn was arrested and charged in state court with attempted first-degree murder, possession of a firearm by a felon, and fleeing or eluding arrest with a motor vehicle. While Lynn was detained in state custody, he was indicted on a federal charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm, stemming from the same conduct as the\n   state charges. Lynn was obtained by the district court on a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum while his state charges were pending, and he eventually pleaded guilty to the federal firearms charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At Lynn's federal sentencing hearing on February 28, 2017, he and Officer Powell both testified about what had occurred in the vehicle. Officer Powell stated that after he had been able to bring the vehicle to a stop, Lynn dove between the front seats, and as Officer Powell had turned to face Lynn, he felt gun shots hit him. On the other hand, Lynn testified that he and Officer Powell had struggled over possession of the firearm, and it went off accidentally during the struggle. The district court found that Officer Powell's testimony was credible while Lynn's was not, and it determined that a sentence of 120 months' imprisonment -the statutory maximum-was appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court also heard argument as to whether this sentence should run concurrently with or consecutive to Lynn's future anticipated state sentence. Because Lynn was in primary state custody, that state sentence would be served in its entirety before he entered the federal prison system. The district court stated that it would be \"terribly difficult\" for it to calculate what portion, if any, of Lynn's sentence should run concurrently with his anticipated state sentence in light of the variety of state charges he faced, along with the dispute as to the facts surrounding the shooting. J.A. 153. The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [L]et's say that a state court jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt ... that there was a struggle and this constitutes some kind of aggravated assault. I'm not sure I would want this sentence to be imposed to run concurrently based on the facts that I found.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   On the other hand, if there's an attempted second degree murder conviction and some 288-month sentence is imposed, then I think, in fairness, the circumstances might merit some overlapping consideration, but I just don't know at this point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   J.A. 154. The court also suggested that, in light of its uncertainty regarding the extent to which its sentence should run concurrently with the anticipated state sentence, the state court could take the federal sentence into account in fashioning its sentence, and Lynn could also request the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to designate the state prison as his place of confinement, thus effectively running his federal sentence concurrently with the state sentence. Ultimately, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I am not able to make a determination as to how much of this sentence should be imposed to run concurrently with the state court prosecution that is now pending. ... Therefore, at this time I will decline to make a finding with respect to running any part of this sentence concurrently to any sentence imposed in the state court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   J.A. 159.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thereafter, on May 4, 2017, Lynn pleaded guilty in North Carolina Superior Court to assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, inflicting serious bodily injury, possession of a firearm by a felon, and fleeing or eluding arrest with a motor vehicle. The state court imposed a total sentence of 104 to 137 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before resolving the issue that was the subject of supplemental briefing and oral argument, we can easily dispose of the question raised in the\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We review a defendant's sentence \"under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Gall v.

Here, the district court found that Lynn committed attempted murder with the firearm at issue.

Moreover, ballistic evidence indicated that multiple shots were fired from Lynn's firearm and that more would have been fired had it not malfunctioned.

Instead, the Court determined that in the first instance, the district court, rather than the BOP, should decide whether a federal sentence runs concurrently with or consecutive to an anticipated state sentence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188896\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188896\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/231/\">\n    at 242-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188896\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/231/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, recognizing an exception to this determination, the Court stated that \"a district court should exercise the power to impose anticipatory consecutive (or concurrent) sentences intelligently. In some situations, a district court may have inadequate information and may forbear, but in other situations, that will not be the case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188896\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/231/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188896\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/231/\">\n    at 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188896\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/231/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   n.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Lynn's argument requires us to consider the boundaries of this exception-in what situations does a district court's lack of information permit it to decline to\n   order its sentence to run concurrently with an anticipated state sentence? To be sure, these situations will be limited. When a state sentence is anticipated, the district court will normally lack definite information about that sentence, and if this alone were sufficient to permit the district court to forbear, the exception would swallow the rule. Thus, in most cases, the district court should decide whether its sentence will run concurrently with or consecutive to an anticipated state sentence involving relevant conduct. But as pointed out by the Sentencing Commission with regard to USSG \u00a7 5G1.3, \"[d]etermining whether, and how, to use this discretion will depend on the adequacy of the information available.\" USSG Amend. 776 (Nov. 1, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   It is clear that Lynn's case was not routine. First, the conduct at issue was extremely serious. As the district court stated, \"this is ... one of the most, if not the most, serious forms of a 922(g)(1) offense. The only thing more serious is a shooting in which an individual is actually killed.\" J.A. 158. Further, the variety of state charges against Lynn, along with his dispute as to the facts surrounding the shooting-in particular, his testimony that the shooting was accidental-made it possible for his anticipated state sentence to range from relatively short to over double his federal sentence.

That is, the district court had the discretion either to follow or depart from the Sentencing Commission's recommendation on concurrency. But the district court did not have the discretion to make no decision on concurrency at all. Therefore, I respectfully dissent as to Part II.B of the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Lynn's federal sentencing hearing took place before his pending state charges were resolved. During the sentencing, the government raised U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G3.1(c) and its recommendation that Lynn's federal sentence run concurrently with his anticipated state sentence. Both government and defense counsel argued that \u00a7 5G3.1(c) applied and that at least a portion of Lynn's federal sentence should run concurrently with his anticipated state sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In response, the district court stated that it was \"terribly difficult\" to calculate how much of Lynn's federal sentence should run concurrently with a yet-to-be-determined state sentence. J.A. 153. The length of Lynn's future state sentence could vary widely, from a relatively short sentence for aggravated assault to a far longer sentence for attempted murder. Should Lynn receive a short sentence, the court was \"not sure\" that it wanted any of the federal sentence to be served concurrently with the state sentence. J.A. 154. If, however, Lynn received a long state sentence, the court believed that \"in fairness, the circumstances might merit some overlapping\" of the sentences.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The district court then opined that it need not decide the \u00a7 5G3.1(c) question because \"ultimately, the Bureau of Prisons has the authority to come back in and handle [this situation] through one of those retroactive designations.\" J.A. 153. When defense counsel expressed confusion regarding what the court meant by retroactive designations, the court replied: \"When an individual does finally arrive at the Bureau of Prisons,\" meaning after the defendant has served his state sentence and is transferred to federal custody to serve his federal sentence for related conduct, \"there is an administrative process where [offenders] can apply and ask for that overlap - the overlapping sentences to be taken into consideration and the Bureau of Prisons backdate the start of the federal sentence to some date during the state sentence that's been served.\" J.A. 156. When such a request is made, the district court continued, \"I usually get a letter that asks for my position on that, and if it is truly a circumstance where there was\n   overlapping conduct that enhanced both sentences, I usually tell that to the Bureau of Prisons, but I don't know what they do with that once I've made my comment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Ultimately, the district court declined to decide whether to apply \u00a7 5G3.1(c)'s recommendation that Lynn's sentences be served concurrently, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   I am not able to make a determination as to how much of this sentence should be imposed to run concurrently with the state court prosecution that is now pending. Certainly, to the extent Mr. Lynn was ultimately either found guilty or pled guilty to an attempted second-degree murder [in state court], there would be significant overlap between these two sentences that are imposed in this case, but, ultimately ... should Mr. Lynn ultimately be convicted of a [weapons possession] offense or some other offense, I would not be inclined to run any of this sentence concurrent to the sentence that may be imposed in state court. Therefore, at this time I will\n   <em>\n    decline to make a finding with respect to running any part of this sentence concurrently\n   </em>\n   to any sentence imposed in the state court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   J.A. 159 (emphasis added). I thus disagree with my colleagues in the majority to the extent that they understand the district court's ruling as a decision to not adopt \u00a7 5G3.1(c)'s concurrency recommendation. Rather, we are faced here with a case in which the district court refrained from making any decision at all on a pertinent Sentencing Guideline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) role in making concurrency determinations serves as important background here. The BOP is empowered by statute to decide where federal inmates serve their sentences.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203621\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (2012). When making that determination, the BOP may \"designate any available penal or correctional facility that meets minimum standards ... whether maintained by the Federal Government or otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Thus, \"when a federal defendant is already serving a state sentence, BOP has the practical power to 'make the federal sentence run concurrently by designating the state prison as a place of federal confinement, so that the clock would start to tick on the federal sentence.' \"\n   <em>\n    Fegans v.

The Court went on to explain that, by relying on the maxim of\n   <em>\n    expressio unius est exclusion alterius\n   </em>\n   , or the explicit mention of one thing is the exclusion of another,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Setser ... suggests that, because \u00a7 3584(a) recognizes judicial discretion in scenario\n   <em>\n    A\n   </em>\n   and scenario\n   <em>\n    B,\n   </em>\n   there is no such discretion in scenario\n   <em>\n    C\n   </em>\n   . But the same maxim shows much more convincingly why \u00a7 3621(b) [which grants the BOP the power to designate state prisons as a federal inmate's place of confinement] cannot be read to give the Bureau of Prisons exclusive authority to make the sort of decision committed to the district court in \u00a7 3584(a). When \u00a7 3584(a) specifically addresses decisions about concurrent and consecutive sentences, and makes no mention of the Bureau's role in the process, the implication is that no such role exists. And that conclusion is reinforced by application of the same maxim (properly, in this instance) to \u00a7 3621(b) -which\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a conferral of authority on the Bureau of Prisons, but does not confer authority to choose between concurrent and consecutive sentences.\n   <em>\n    Put to the choice, we believe it is much more natural to read \u00a7 3584(a) as not containing an implied \"only,\" leaving room for the exercise of judicial discretion in the situations not covered, than it is to read \u00a7 3621(b) as giving the Bureau of Prisons what amounts to sentencing authority\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 238-39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188896\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/231/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (second emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   While the\n   <em>\n    Setser\n   </em>\n   Court held that district courts have the authority to decide that a federal sentence should run concurrently with an anticipated state sentence, it stopped short of deciding that the BOP's decades-old\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   designation process is itself unlawful.

Such concern has been echoed by other Courts of Appeals.

However, while the district court acknowledged \u00a7 5G1.3(c)'s existence, heard argument on it, and discussed its application at some length during the sentencing hearing, the district court ultimately decided to neither adopt nor reject the Guidelines' recommendation. Typically, this result would not be possible: When imposing a federal sentence, district courts necessarily decide whether to accept or reject the pertinent Sentencing Guidelines whenever they decide the length of a sentence. Section 5G1.3(c), however, uniquely provides an opportunity to make no decision at all because a district court's failure to rule in situations where \u00a7 5G1.3(c) applies creates no presumption one way or another regarding whether the prisoner's two sentences should be served concurrently.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mangum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321479\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/98/#p101\">\n    824 F.3d at 101-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This language, however, was written before the U.S. Sentencing Commission adopted \u00a7 5G1.3(c). It does not change the district court's obligation to rule on each pertinent Sentencing Guideline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Criminal sentencing has been entrusted to the judicial branch, and deciding whether multiple sentences should run concurrently is intrinsically a determination of the length of imprisonment. Such decisions should be made by the district court just like any other determination about the number of months that a defendant will serve. Therefore, the district court's failure to rule on \u00a7 5G1.3(c)'s applicability to Lynn's sentence punts the determination on the length of his sentence to the BOP.

I therefore respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    When \u00a7 3584(a)'s final sentence refers to \"[m]ultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times,\" it means the situation described in the first sentence, where a second prison term is \"imposed on a defendant who is already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment.\"\n    <em>\n     Setser v.
