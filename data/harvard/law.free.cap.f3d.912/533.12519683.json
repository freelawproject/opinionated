LL Liquor, Inc., which does business as \"Lolo Liquor,\" is one of ninety-six liquor stores in the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Until 2016, the DOR did not use a uniform pricing scheme for agency franchise stores. Instead, the price of liquor varied based on discount rates set forth in each store's \"agency franchise agreement,\" a contract between the DOR and the individual store. A higher discount rate meant cheaper liquor. These discount rates-known\n   as \"commission rates\"-were negotiated between the DOR and each store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Two years into the term of Lolo Liquor's contract, Montana changed the rules, applying a uniform commission structure to all franchise stores in the state. The principal question before us is whether this change gives rise to a Contracts Clause claim by Lolo Liquor against the state. We conclude that it does not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In March 2013, Lolo Liquor entered into a ten-year franchise agreement with the DOR to operate an agency franchise store based in Lolo, Montana, a town about ten miles outside Missoula. Three sections of that agreement are particularly relevant here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Section 2, titled \"Agency Franchise Agreement,\" provided that the \"Agreement must be renewed every ten years if the requirements of [the] Agreement have been satisfactorily performed,\" with the caveat that \"[s]ubsequent changes to the law by the legislature may require terms to change in future renewals.\" This provision referenced section 16-2-101(5)(a) of the Montana Code, which, at the time the agreement was made, stated that an agency franchise agreement \"must be renewed at the existing commission rate for additional 10-year periods.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mont.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016-2-101\">\n    Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 16-2-101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(a) (2013). Section 2 also stated that, \"[d]uring the term of [the] Agreement, the commission ... rate may be reviewed every three years, as provided by law.\" This clause included a reference to section 16-2-101(6) of the Montana Code, which at that time provided that the commission rate \"may be reviewed every 3 years at the request of either party\" but that the rate would only be adjusted \"[i]f the [the franchise store] concurs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mont.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016-2-101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 16-2-101(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Section 5, titled \"Agent's Discount Rates,\" set forth how the commission rate of 16.144% was calculated. That commission rate comprised three separate discount rates: the \"commission percentage discount rate\" (11.400%), the \"weighted average discount percentage rate\" (3.869%), and the \"volume of sales discount rate\" (0.875%). The commission percentage discount rate was the part of the commission rate subject to negotiation; the remaining two discount rates were set by statute. This section also noted that Lolo Liquor's commission rate \"may be reviewed and adjusted in accordance with Montana law.\" Notably, the commission rate was the only financial term found in the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Finally, section 11, titled \"Modification, Merger, and Definitions,\" provided that \"[t]he parties agree that the [DOR] may amend or modify [the] Agreement to conform to changes in state or federal laws.\" Additionally, Section 11 included a merger clause, which stated that the agreement would \"not be enlarged, modified or altered except in writing signed by all parties,\" with one important caveat-\"that any change required by a change in Montana law shall be effective immediately upon the effective date of such change in law, notwithstanding the failure of a party to agree in writing to such change.\" Section 11 also required that the parties \"make reasonable efforts to promptly reduce to writing the specific changes to the provision of this Agreement that may be required by such change in law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2014, Lolo Liquor was purchased by its current owners, Josh and Leigh Paffhausen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Paffhausens maintain that, around the time of the purchase, they were given assurances by the DOR that their commission rate \"could never be lowered\" during the term of the agreement. Soon after purchasing Lolo Liquor, the Paffhausens began an aggressive expansion into the wholesale market, both around the town of Lolo and beyond. The expansion was quite successful-in three years, Lolo Liquor was buying more than ten times as much liquor from the DOR as it had before the Paffhausens' purchase. The Paffhausens attributed their success to innovation and customer service, while their competitors maintained that Lolo Liquor's success was due its higher commission rate, which enabled Lolo Liquor to provide services that others could not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Around the time Lolo Liquor was expanding, the Liquor Store Owners Association of Montana, an industry group, proposed changes to the commission structure for agency franchise stores. This proposal was eventually introduced in the Montana Senate as Senate Bill (SB) 193. In 2015, the Montana Legislature passed SB 193, and the bill was signed into law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2015 Mont. Laws ch. 362.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   SB 193 restructured the way in which commission rates are calculated. Under SB 193, the commission rates would no longer be determined by negotiations between the DOR and each store. Instead, the rates would be based on a preset schedule reflecting each store's total liquor purchases from the DOR during the previous calendar year. The less a store purchased in the last year, the higher its commission rate would be.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mont.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016-2-101\">\n    Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 16-2-101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4)(b) to - 101(4)(c) (2017). Because the amount purchased by each store is largely based on the store's sales, this change meant that stores selling less liquor would receive higher commission rates-and thus cheaper liquor-from the DOR.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mont.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016-2-101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These new rates did not take effect immediately; they were gradually phased in over the course of two years, beginning in February 2016.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mont.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016-2-101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 16-2-101(4)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Under the new enactment, most agency franchise stores received a modest increase in their commission rates. Lolo Liquor, however, saw a reduction. The Paffhausens, understandably unhappy with the change, refused to sign an addendum sent by the DOR informing them of the revised commission structure. The DOR continued to sell liquor to Lolo Liquor but, in February 2016, unilaterally implemented the new commission structure in accordance with SB 193, over the Paffhausens' objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Shortly after SB 193 was enacted, Lolo Liquor sued in state court for, among other claims, breach of contract and violations of the Contracts Clause of the U.S. Constitution and its state counterpart. Lolo Liquor's complaint sought damages and declaratory and injunctive relief. According to the complaint, section 2 of the agreement promised that the commission rate would not change without Lolo Liquor's consent during the ten-year term of the agreement. Montana's unilateral change of the commission structure, the complaint alleged, either breached the agreement or impaired a contractual obligation in violation of the Contracts Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Montana removed the case to federal district court, after which Lolo Liquor moved for a preliminary injunction based on its Contracts Clause claims. In response, Montana argued that Lolo Liquor was unlikely to prevail on its Contracts Clause claims because, under section 11 of the agency franchise agreement, the parties had expressly agreed that \"any change required by a change in Montana law shall be effective immediately upon the effective date of such change in law, notwithstanding\n   the failure of a party to agree in writing to such change.\" The district court agreed with the state and denied Lolo Liquor's request for a preliminary injunction. On appeal, a panel of this court affirmed in a memorandum disposition.\n   <em>\n    LL Liquor, Inc. v.

If Montana would provide a state law remedy, then its alteration of the commission structure was not an \"impairment\" within the meaning of the Contracts Clause. If it does not so provide, then our inquiry under the Contracts Clause continues. In making this determination, we look to what remedies would in fact be available under state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cayetano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11549479\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/183/1096/#p1102\">\n    183 F.3d at 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   More specifically, Lolo Liquor maintains here that Montana promised in the agency franchise agreement that the commission rate would not change during the ten-year term of the agreement unless Lolo Liquor consented, but then breached that promise by lowering the rate in accordance with SB 193. If Lolo Liquor retains the ability to recover for this alleged breach under state law, then it does not have a Contracts Clause claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pure Wafer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178073\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/943/#p951\">\n    845 F.3d at 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We must therefore consider Montana's defenses to liability for the alleged breach. Particularly relevant to our analysis is whether Montana is attempting only \"to\n   <em>\n    refute\n   </em>\n   [Lolo Liquor's] claimed rights\" under the agreement, or whether the state is trying \"to render such rights legally unenforceable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178073\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/943/#p951\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178073\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/943/#p951\">\n    at 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, Montana provides two related reasons why Lolo Liquor cannot recover for a breach of contract. First, Montana argues that the parties expressly acknowledged in section 11 that any provision of the agreement-including the established commission rate-was subject to modification by state law. Thus, Montana contends, its adjustment of the commission rates was fully consistent with the terms of the agreement. Second, Montana asserts that \"when a state, exercising its sovereign power, enters into a franchise agreement,\" as Montana did here, \"the sovereign may retain the right to unilaterally modify the terms of the agreement.\" Montana therefore suggests that, without regard to section 11, the state was permitted to adjust the commission rates without Lolo Liquor's consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Montana's first argument does not implicate the Contracts Clause. With that contention, Montana is responding to a contractual-not a constitutional-argument made by Lolo Liquor. Lolo Liquor interprets the agreement to provide a right to a fixed commission rate during the agreement's duration; Montana disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   That one of the provisions at issue-section 11-could permit Montana unilaterally to modify the agreement does not compel a different conclusion. If the parties agreed that the commission rate would not change, then Montana breached the agreement by changing the commission rate. If the parties agreed that the commission rate was subject to unilateral modification, then no breach occurred. At bottom, the parties' arguments amount to dueling interpretations between the parties over the proper meaning of their agreement. As in\n   <em>\n    Pure Wafer\n   </em>\n   , to the extent Montana's defense is grounded in the meaning of the contract, the state has not \"attempted to render such [a] right[ ] legally unenforceable\" but has instead \"attempted to\n   <em>\n    refute\n   </em>\n   \" the existence of that right.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178073\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/943/#p951\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178073\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/943/#p951\">\n    at 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
