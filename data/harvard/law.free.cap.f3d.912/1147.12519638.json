U.S. authorities detained Dr. Ibrahim because her name was on the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) \"No Fly\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   list (the No Fly list). After almost a decade of vigorous and fiercely contested litigation against our state and federal governments and their officials, including two appeals to our court and a weeklong trial, Dr. Ibrahim won a complete victory. In 2014, the federal government at last conceded that she poses no threat to our safety or national security, has never posed a threat to national security, and should never have been placed on the No Fly list. Through Dr. Ibrahim's persistent discovery efforts, which were met with stubborn opposition at every turn, she learned that she had been nominated to the No Fly list and the Interagency Border Inspection System (IBIS), which are stored within the national Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB)-the federal government's centralized watchlist of known and suspected terrorists-and which serve as a basis for selection for other counterterrorism sub-lists. From there, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) special agent so misread a nomination form that he accidentally nominated Dr. Ibrahim to the No Fly list, intending to do the opposite, as the No Fly list is supposed to be comprised of individuals who pose a threat to civil aviation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   But Dr. Ibrahim did not accomplish this litigation victory on her own. Indeed, since she was finally allowed to travel to Malaysia in 2005, the United States government has never allowed her to return to the United States, not even to attend the trial that cleared her name. Throughout this hard-fought litigation, the civil rights law firm McManis Faulkner has represented her interests without pay, but with the understanding that if it prevailed on her behalf, it could recover reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, in addition to costs, pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202412\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The firm filed a motion for an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, supported by documentary evidence and declarations, which the government opposed. The motion was met with the \"compliments\" of the district court and drastic reductions in the claimed fees, by almost ninety percent. In reducing the claimed legal fees, the district court misapplied\n   <em>\n    Commissioner, I.N.S. v. Jean\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122211\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/154/\">\n    496 U.S. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122211\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/154/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122211\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/154/\">\n    110 L.Ed.2d 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990), by taking a piecemeal approach to determining whether the government's position was \"substantially justified,\" and so disallowing fees for particular stages of proceedings rather than examining the record as a whole and making a single finding. The district court further erred by treating alternative claims or theories for the same relief Dr. Ibrahim achieved-which the court, therefore, did not reach-as unsuccessful, and reducing fees for work pursuing those claims, contrary to\n   <em>\n    Hensley v. Eckerhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/\">\n    461 U.S. 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298707\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/424/\">\n    76 L.Ed.2d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983). These errors were compounded by the now-withdrawn three-judge panel decision, which misapplied the\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   standard for determining \"relatedness,\" i.e., whether the claims arose from a \"common course of conduct,\" to wrongly conclude that because the claims in the alternative were \"mutually exclusive,\" they were not related. In point of fact, all of the legal theories pursued on behalf of Dr. Ibrahim challenged the same and only government action at the heart of this lawsuit: the government's placement of her name on the No Fly list without any basis for doing so. Finally, our prior precedent, which we now reaffirm, requires that when a district court analyzes whether the government acted in bad faith, it must consider the totality of the circumstances, including both the underlying agency action and the litigation in defense of that action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We reheard this appeal en banc to clarify the standards applicable to awards of attorneys' fees under the EAJA. We now reverse, vacate the award of attorneys'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   fees, and remand with instructions to recalculate fees consistent with this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Dr. Ibrahim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dr. Ibrahim is a Muslim woman, scholar, wife, and mother of four children. She lived in the United States for thirteen years pursuing undergraduate and post-graduate studies. Here's what happened to Dr. Ibrahim, as the events that ultimately excluded her from this country unraveled:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In early January 2005, Dr. Ibrahim planned to fly from San Francisco to Hawaii and then to Los Angeles and on to Kuala Lumpur. She intended to attend a conference in Hawaii sponsored by Stanford University from January 3 to January 6, at which she would present the results of her doctoral research. She was then working toward a Ph.D. in construction engineering and management at Stanford University under an F-1 student visa. On January 2, 2005, Dr. Ibrahim arrived at SFO with her daughter, Rafeah, then fourteen. At the time, Dr. Ibrahim was still recovering from a hysterectomy performed three months earlier and required wheelchair assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When Dr. Ibrahim arrived at the United Airlines counter, the airline staff discovered her name on the No Fly list and called the police. Dr. Ibrahim was handcuffed and arrested. She was escorted to a police car (while handcuffed) and transported to a holding cell by male police officers, where she was searched for weapons and held for approximately two hours. Paramedics were called to administer medication related to her surgery. No one explained to Dr. Ibrahim the reasons for her arrest and detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Eventually, she was released and an aviation security inspector with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) informed Dr. Ibrahim that her name had been removed from the No Fly list. The police were satisfied that there were insufficient grounds for making a criminal complaint against her. Dr. Ibrahim was told that she could fly to Hawaii the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The next day she returned to SFO where an unspecified person told her that she was again-or still-on the No Fly list. She was nonetheless allowed to fly, but was issued an unusual red boarding pass with the letters \"SSSS,\" meaning Secondary Security Screening Selection, printed on it. Dr. Ibrahim flew to Hawaii and presented her doctoral findings at the Stanford conference. From there, she flew to Los Angeles and then on to Kuala Lumpur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Two months later, on March 10, 2005, Dr. Ibrahim was scheduled to return to Stanford University to complete her work on her Ph.D. and to meet with an individual who was one of her Stanford dissertation advisors and also her friend, Professor Boyd Paulson, who was very ill. But when she arrived at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, she was not permitted to board the flight to the United States. She was told by one ticketing agent that she would have to wait for clearance from the U.S. Embassy, and by another that a note by her name indicated the police should be called to arrest her. Dr. Ibrahim has not been permitted to return to the United States to this day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 24, 2005, Dr. Ibrahim submitted a Passenger Identity Verification Form (PIVF) to TSA. Before 2007, individuals who claimed they were denied or delayed boarding a plane in or for, or entry to, the United States, or claimed they were\n   repeatedly subjected to additional screening or inspection, could submit a PIVF to TSA. A PIVF prompted various agencies to review whether an individual was properly placed in the TSDB or in related watchlist databases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Next, on April 14, 2005, the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur wrote to inform Dr. Ibrahim that the Department of State had revoked her F-1 student visa on January 31, 2005, which seemed to explain why she had not been allowed to fly in March, but gave her no further information regarding her status. The April 14 letter cited Dr. Ibrahim's possible ineligibility \"under Section 212(a)(3)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [ (INA) ],\" codified at 8 U.S.C \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B), to explain the revocation. That section prohibits entry into the U.S. by any person who engaged in terrorist activity, was reasonably believed to be engaged in or likely to be engaged in terrorist activity, or who has incited terrorist activity, among other things.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(B). However, the letter also told her that the revocation did \"not necessarily indicate that [she would be] ineligible to receive a U.S. visa in [the] future.\" Not having heard back from TSA, Dr. Ibrahim retained McManis Faulkner. And on January 27, 2006, she filed the underlying action to challenge her placement on the No Fly list, as well as the federal and state governments' administration of the list and their treatment of her with respect to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In a letter dated March 1, 2006, Dr. Ibrahim received a response to her PIVF. That letter stated that TSA had \"conducted a review of any applicable records in consultation with other federal agencies, as appropriate,\" and continued, \"[w]here it has been determined that a correction to records is warranted, these records have been modified to address any delay or denial of boarding that you may have experienced as a result of the watchlist screening process.\" The letter did not indicate Dr. Ibrahim's status with respect to the No Fly list or any other federal watchlist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In 2009, Dr. Ibrahim applied for a visa to attend proceedings in this action. The U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur interviewed her on September 29, 2009. On December 14, 2009, a consular officer of the U.S. Department of State sent a letter to Dr. Ibrahim notifying her of her visa application's denial. The consular officer wrote the word \"(Terrorist)\" next to the checked box for INA \u00a7 212(a)(3)(B) on an accompanying form to explain why Dr. Ibrahim was deemed inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In September 2013, Dr. Ibrahim submitted a visa application so that she could attend the trial in her case. She went to a consular officer interview in October 2013. At the interview, the consular officer asked her to provide supplemental information via e-mail, which Dr. Ibrahim duly provided. Trial in this action began on December 2 and ended on December 6. While she did not receive a response to her visa application before trial, at trial, government counsel stated that the visa had been denied. Dr. Ibrahim's counsel said that they had not been aware of the denial and that Dr. Ibrahim had not been notified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. United States Government\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   While Dr. Ibrahim stood in limbo, unaware of her status on any list and unable to return to the United States, even to attend the trial of her own case, the government was well aware that her placement on the No Fly list was a mistake from the get-go.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Here it is helpful to understand, as much as we can on this record, how the U.S. \"government maintains and operates a web of interlocking watchlists, all now centered on the [TSDB],\" as described in the district court's post-trial order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FBI, DHS, the Department of State, and other agencies administer an organization called the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC), which manages the TSDB. Both the TSC and TSDB were created in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, in order to centralize information about known and suspected terrorists. That information is then exported as appropriate to various \"customer databases,\" i.e., government watchlists, operated by other agencies and government entities. In this way, \"the dots could be connected.\" While the TSDB does not contain classified information, the government stores classified \"derogatory\" information in a closely allied and separate database called the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE), which is operated by the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) branch of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. These terrorist watchlists, and others, provide information to the United States intelligence community, a coalition of seventeen agencies and organizations within the executive branch, and also provide information to certain foreign governments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Today, individuals are generally nominated to the TSDB using a \"reasonable suspicion standard,\" meaning \"articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences, reasonably warrant the determination that an individual is known or suspected to be or has been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism and terrorist activities.\" This standard was created by executive branch policy and practice and was not promulgated by Congress or the judicial branch. However, from 2004 to 2007, the executive branch and its agencies employed no uniform standard for TSDB nominations, allowing each agency to use its own nominating procedures for inclusion in the TSDB based on each agency's interpretation of homeland security presidential directives and the memorandum of opinion that established the TSC. These directives provided little instruction. For example, one such directive was Homeland Security Presidential Directive 6 (HSPD-6), which stated, \"[t]his directive shall be implemented in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Constitution and applicable laws, including those protecting the rights of all Americans.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As the centralized database, the TSDB is the repository for all watchlist nominations. Various government agents nominate individuals by filling out a physical form, which is later computerized and used by the TSDB to indicate on which watchlist each nominee should be included or excluded. There are several watchlists affected by the TSDB, namely\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 the No Fly list (TSA);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 the Selectee list (TSA);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 Known and Suspected Terrorist File (KSTF, previously known as the Violent Gang and Terrorist Organizations File);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS, including CLASS-Visa,\n   a Department of State database used for screening of visa applicants, and CLASS-Passport, a database that applies only to United States citizens who might be watchlisted) (Department of State);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 TECS (not an acronym, but the successor to the Treasury Enforcement Communications System) (DHS);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 Interagency Border Inspection System (IBIS) (DHS);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 Tipoff United States-Canada (TUSCAN) (used to export information from the United States to Canada); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 Tipoff Australia Counterterrorism Information Control System (TACTICS) (used to export information from the United States to Australia).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   These TSDB designations are then exported to the customer/government watchlists, which are each operated by various government entities and used in various ways. For example, TSDB nominations are transmitted to the Department of State for inclusion in CLASS-Visa or CLASS-Passport. In ruling on visa applications, consular officers review the CLASS database for information that may inform the visa application and adjudication process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In November 2004, shortly after Dr. Ibrahim's husband Mustafa Kamal Mohammed Zaini visited her from Malaysia to help her after her surgery, FBI Special Agent Kevin Michael Kelley (Agent Kelley), located in San Jose, California, unintentionally nominated Dr. Ibrahim, who was then a graduate student at Stanford University, to various federal watchlists using the FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Violent Gang and Terrorist Organizations (VGTO) File Gang Member Entry Form (VGTOF). VGTO was an office within NCIC. Agent Kelley misunderstood the directions on the form and erroneously nominated Dr. Ibrahim to the TSA's No Fly list and DHS's IBIS. He did not intend to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Agent Kelley testified at trial that he intended to nominate Dr. Ibrahim to the CLASS, the TSA Selectee list, TUSCAN (information exported to Canada), and TACTICS (information exported to Australia) lists. He checked the wrong boxes, filling out the form exactly contrary to the form's instructions. The form expressly indicated that he was to check the boxes for the databases into which the subject should NOT be placed. Here is a blank copy of the form:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-46\">It is recommended that the subject <strong>NOT</strong> be entered into the following selected terrorist screening databases: [] Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS) [] Interagency Border Information System (IBIS) [] TSA No Fly List [] TSA Selectee List [] TUSCAN [] TACTICS . . . The case agent will also nominate any terrorist screening database into which the subject should <em>not</em> be entered. If no databases are selected, then the subject will be added by the TSC to all appropriate databases.</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In other words, Agent Kelley was instructed to check the boxes for the watchlists for which Dr. Ibrahim was NOT to be nominated. Here is the form as Agent Kelley completed it:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Agent Kelley, by failing to check the boxes for the No Fly list and IBIS, placed Dr. Ibrahim on those watchlists (and by checking the boxes for CLASS, the TSA Selectee list, TUSCAN, and TACTICS, Agent Kelley did not place her on those lists).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Agent Kelley's squad also was conducting a mosque outreach program. One purpose of the program was to provide a point of contact between law enforcement and mosques and Islamic associations. The outreach program included Muslim and Sikh communities and organizations in the San Francisco Bay Area. In December 2004, Agent Kelley and his colleague interviewed Dr. Ibrahim while she was still attending Stanford University.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   He asked, among other things, about her plans to attend a conference in Hawaii, her dissertation work, her plans after graduation, her involvement in the Muslim community, her husband, her travel plans, and the organization Jemaah Islamiyah, a Department of State-designated terrorist organization that Dr. Ibrahim had heard of only on the news. She was not a member.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Freedom of Information Act-produced version of Agent Kelley's interview notes with Dr. Ibrahim were designated by the FBI as \"315,\" which denotes \"International Terrorism Investigations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On January 2, 2005, when Dr. Ibrahim was detained at SFO on her way to Hawaii, a DHS aviation security inspector told her that her name had been removed from the list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Meanwhile, on January 3, 2005, in the visa office of the Department of State, one official was sitting on a stack of pending visa revocations that were based on the VGTO watchlist from which Agent Kelley had nominated Dr. Ibrahim to the No Fly list. That official e-mailed another visa official to report that although \"[t]hese revocations contain virtually no derogatory information,\" he was going to revoke them. The official wrote, because \"there is no practical way to determine the basis of the\n   investigation ... we will accept that the opening of an investigation itself is a prima facie indicator of potential ineligibility under [\u00a7 212(a)(3)(B) of the INA, relating to terrorist activities].\" One of the revocations in that stack was Dr. Ibrahim's student visa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Sure enough, on January 31, 2005, the Department of State revoked Dr. Ibrahim's F-1 student visa pursuant to \u00a7 212(a)(3)(B). In an e-mail conversation dated February 8, 2005 between the chief of the consular section at the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur and an official in the coordination division at the Department of State's visa office, designated \"VO/L/C,\" the consular chief asked about a prudential visa revocation cable he had received concerning the events Dr. Ibrahim experienced in January 2005. The Department of State official replied,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   I handle revocations in VO/L/C. The short version is that this person's visa was revoked because there is law enforcement interest in her as a potential terrorist. This is sufficient to prudentially revoke a visa but doesn't constitute a finding of ineligibility. The idea is to revoke first and resolve the issues later in the context of a new visa application .... My guess based on past experience is that she's probably issuable. However, there's no way to be sure without putting her through the interagency process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   After Dr. Ibrahim's visa was revoked, the Department of State entered a record into CLASS that notified any consular official adjudicating a future visa application on her behalf that she may be inadmissible under \u00a7 212(a)(3)(B). In December 2005, Dr. Ibrahim was removed from the TSA's Selectee list. Around this time, however, she was added to TACTICS (exports to Australia) and TUSCAN (exports to Canada). The government has never explained this placement or the effect of Dr. Ibrahim's placement on TACTICS or TUSCAN.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Two weeks later, on January 27, 2006, Dr. Ibrahim filed the underlying action. On February 10, 2006, an unidentified government agent requested that Dr. Ibrahim be \"Remove[d] From\n   <em>\n    ALL\n   </em>\n   Watchlisting Supported Systems (For terrorist subjects: due to closure of case AND no nexus to terrorism).\" Answering the question \"Is the individual qualified for placement on the no fly list?\" the \"No\" box was checked. For the question, \"If No, is the individual qualified for placement on the selectee list?\" the \"No\" box was checked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On September 18, 2006, the government removed Dr. Ibrahim from the TSDB because she did not meet the \"reasonable suspicion standard\" for placement on it, which requires that the government believe \"an individual is known or suspected to be or has been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism and terrorist activities.\" The record, however, does not indicate whether she was removed from all of the customer watchlists that subscribed to the TSDB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On March 2, 2007, Dr. Ibrahim was placed back on the TSDB. The record does not explain why she was relisted on the TSDB or which customer watchlists were to be notified. Two months later, however, on May 30, 2007, Dr. Ibrahim was again removed from the TSDB. The record does not show the extent to which Dr. Ibrahim's name was then removed from the other\n   customer watchlists, nor the reason for the removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Dr. Ibrahim's 2009 visa application to attend proceedings in this case was initially refused under \u00a7 221(g) of the INA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), because it was determined that there was insufficient information to make a final adjudication in the matter. The consular officer requested a Security Advisory Opinion from the Department of State. The consular official was concerned that Dr. Ibrahim was potentially inadmissible under \u00a7 212(a)(3)(B) of the INA, which provides nine classes of aliens ineligible for visas or admission into the United States based on terrorist activities. The Security Advisory Opinion from the Department of State, initially unavailable to Dr. Ibrahim but later produced in discovery, stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Information on this applicant surfaced during the SAO review that would support a 212(a)(3)(B) inadmissibility finding. Posts should refuse the case accordingly.

The government claims that the nature of the exception and the reasons for the nomination are state secrets. In Dr. Ibrahim's circumstance, the effect of the nomination was that Dr. Ibrahim's information was exported from the TSDB database solely to the Department of State's CLASS database and DHS's TECS database.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   From October 2009 to the present, Dr. Ibrahim has been included on the TSDB, CLASS, and TECS watchlists.

She did not pose (and has not posed) a threat of committing an act of international or domestic terrorism with respect to an aircraft, a threat to airline passenger or civil aviation security, or a threat of domestic terrorism. Despite this assessment, Dr. Ibrahim has been unable to return to the United States to this day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   On January 27, 2006, Dr. Ibrahim filed suit against DHS, TSA, the TSC, the FBI, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and individuals associated with these entities (collectively, the federal defendants); the City and County of San Francisco, the San Francisco Police Department, SFO, the County of San Mateo, and individuals associated with these entities (collectively, the city defendants); and United Airlines, UAL Corporation, and individuals associated with these entities (collectively, the private defendants). Dr. Ibrahim asserted \u00a7 1983 claims and state-law tort claims arising out of her detention at SFO, as well as several constitutional claims based on the inclusion of her name on government terrorist watchlists. On August 16, 2006, the district court dismissed her claims against the federal defendants under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2046110\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which vests exclusive original jurisdiction in the courts\n   of appeals over suits challenging security orders issued by TSA.

We reversed the district court's dismissal of the federal defendants, holding that \u00a7 46110(a) does not bar district court jurisdiction over Dr. Ibrahim's challenges to her placement on the government terrorist watchlists, including the No Fly list, because the lists are managed by the TSC rather than TSA.\n   <em>\n    Ibrahim v.

(collectively, the Non-Federal Defendants). Dr. Ibrahim requested an injunction that would require the federal government to take her name off its terrorist watchlists, including the No Fly list, or, in the alternative, to provide procedures under which she could challenge her inclusion on those lists, in addition to other non-monetary requests and damages. The SAC also sought limited relief relevant to Dr. Ibrahim's visa denial, but stopped short of attempting to force the government to issue her a visa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Both the Federal Defendants and Non-Federal Defendants filed motions to dismiss with respect to the majority of the claims. In an order dated July 27, 2009, the district court partially granted the Non-Federal Defendants' motions to dismiss. Thereafter, all of the Non-Federal Defendants entered into cash settlements with Dr. Ibrahim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In the same order, the district court again dismissed Dr. Ibrahim's claims against the Federal Defendants. These claims alleged that the inclusion of Dr. Ibrahim's name on the government's terrorist watchlists violated her First Amendment right to freedom of association and her Fifth Amendment rights to due process and equal protection. She also alleged that the Federal Defendants violated the APA, arguing that the APA waives the sovereign immunity of the United States, thereby allowing her claims under the First and Fifth Amendments and authorizing remedies for those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The district court held that while Dr. Ibrahim could seek damages for her past\n   injury at SFO (and had successfully settled that part of the case), she had voluntarily left the United States and, as a nonimmigrant alien abroad, no longer had standing to assert constitutional and statutory claims to seek prospective relief. The district court held that, although nonimmigrant aliens in the United States had standing to assert constitutional and statutory claims, a nonimmigrant alien who had voluntarily left the United States and was at large abroad had no standing to assert federal claims for prospective relief in our federal courts. Dr. Ibrahim filed a second appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We affirmed in part, but reversed as to prospective standing by holding that even a nonimmigrant alien who had voluntarily left the United States nonetheless has standing to litigate federal constitutional claims in the district courts of the United States so long as the alien had a \"substantial voluntary connection\" to the United States.\n   <em>\n    Ibrahim v.

We held that Dr. Ibrahim had such a connection because of her time at Stanford University, her continuing collaboration with professors in the United States, her membership in several professional organizations located in the United States, the invitations for her to return, and her network of close friends in the United States.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724058\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/983/#p996\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724058\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/983/#p996\">\n    at 993-94, 996\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government did not seek review by the Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Following the second remand, the government again filed a motion to dismiss, which the district court denied. Despite the unequivocal pronouncement from our court and the district court that Dr. Ibrahim had adequately pleaded Article III standing, the government argued over the next year that Dr. Ibrahim lacked standing. The government made this argument in its third motion to dismiss, its motion for summary judgment, its statements during trial, and its proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The government persisted, even though it was abundantly clear that \"the standing issue had gone the other way on appeal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   From the February 2012 remand through trial, the parties and the district court were embroiled in discovery disputes involving the state secrets privilege, the law enforcement privilege, and assertions of \"sensitive security information\" (SSI),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201520.5\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1520.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government invoked these as bases for withholding classified and otherwise allegedly sensitive government information from Dr. Ibrahim and her counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   On April 19, 2013, after years of litigation, the district court finally issued two orders granting in part and denying in part Dr. Ibrahim's motions to compel discovery. Resolving these disputes required the district court judge to review individually each of the documents Dr. Ibrahim sought. Most of this review was conducted\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    camera\n   </em>\n   due to the privileged, classified, or secret nature of the documents. The state secrets privilege was upheld as to nearly all of the classified documents in question. The government's assertion of other privileges regarding non-classified documents was overruled as to the majority of the remaining documents. The district court compelled the government to release information specifically related to Dr. Ibrahim's watchlist history, in addition to her current watchlist statuses. It also required the government to produce Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6) witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   At last, Dr. Ibrahim and her attorneys were able to learn what the government had known all along. On May 2, 2013, the government stated that Dr. Ibrahim was inadvertently placed on the No-Fly list but did not explain the details of this mistake, or who was involved. On May 2, 2013, when the government responded to Dr.\n   Ibrahim's interrogatory requests, Dr. Ibrahim learned, for the first time, her historical and current watchlist statuses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 12, 2013, again over the government's vigorous objections, Dr. Ibrahim's attorneys deposed Agent Kelley and learned that her placement on the No Fly and IBIS watchlists was, in fact, a mistake based on Agent Kelley's misreading of the form.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, the government failed to reveal that Dr. Ibrahim's placement on the No Fly list was a mistake until two months before trial, and eight years after Dr. Ibrahim filed suit. And at all times, as the government vigorously contested Dr. Ibrahim's discovery requests, and lodged over two hundred objections and instructions not to answer questions in depositions, the government was aware that she was not responsible for terrorism or any threats against the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The government's discovery games stretched up to and through trial. The government announced on at least two occasions that if it invoked the state secrets privilege to withhold information, then that evidence could not be relied upon by either side at trial. After making such representations on the record, on September 13, 2013, the district court ordered the government to confirm that neither party could use information withheld on grounds of state secrets privilege. The government affirmed it would not rely on any information withheld on grounds of privilege from Dr. Ibrahim. The government nevertheless reversed course during trial and sought to prevail by having this action dismissed due to its inability to disclose state secrets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The government also filed a motion for summary judgment. A hearing was held on the government's motion on October 31, 2013. Instead of discussing the merits of the summary judgment motion, the government used the vast majority of the hearing time to discuss whether or not the trial should be open to the public and whether certain information listed on Dr. Ibrahim's demonstratives was subject to various privileges. The district court ultimately declined to hear further argument and decided the motion on the papers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The government's motion for summary judgment was granted in limited part but mostly denied on November 4, 2013. Dr. Ibrahim's \"exchange of information\" claim based on the First Amendment was dismissed. Dr. Ibrahim's claims based on procedural and substantive due process, equal protection, and First Amendment rights of expressive association and against retaliation proceeded to trial. The government raised lack of standing, yet again, and was denied, yet again. For the first time, and contrary to what it had represented before, the government further argued that summary judgment in its favor was appropriate based on the state secrets privilege, pursuant to our court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Mohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706299\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/1070/#p1079\">\n    614 F.3d 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1079 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc) (noting that even when evidence is excluded\n   via an invocation of state secrets, the case may still need to be dismissed because \"it will become apparent during the [\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The government argued that the action should be dismissed because the core of the case had been excluded as state secrets. The motion was denied on several grounds. First, the government had failed to raise such an argument until weeks before trial. Second, it was too late and too unsettling for the government to reverse its prior position. Third, even under\n   <em>\n    Jeppesen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706299\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/1070/#p1079\">\n    614 F.3d at 1080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the district court could not say with certainty that Dr. Ibrahim would be unable to prove her case at trial or that the government would be absolutely deprived of a meritorious and complete defense. The district court planned to allow both sides to present their unclassified evidence through the \"normal\" trial procedure and then to allow the government to submit an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   and under seal submission to try to explain how its state secrets might bear on the actual trial issues. Surprisingly, although no classified information was used at trial, the government made numerous privilege assertions and motions to close the courtroom. Due to these assertions, the district judge at least ten times \"reluctantly\" asked the press and the public to leave the courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   On December 2, 2013, the first day of trial, before opening statements, Dr. Ibrahim's counsel reported that Dr. Ibrahim's daughter-a U.S. citizen born in the United States and a witness disclosed on Dr. Ibrahim's witness list-was not permitted to board her flight from Kuala Lumpur to attend trial, evidently because she too was now on the No Fly list. Consequently, Dr. Ibrahim's daughter missed her flight and was forced to reschedule. The district court concluded this was a mistake, and the government quickly remedied this error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   After a one-week bench trial, in the first No Fly list trial ever conducted, the district court found in Dr. Ibrahim's favor on her procedural due process claim and ordered the government to remove all references to the mistaken designations by Agent Kelley in 2004 on all terrorist watchlist databases and records; to inform Dr. Ibrahim of the specific subsection of the INA that rendered Dr. Ibrahim ineligible for a visa in 2009 and 2013; to inform Dr. Ibrahim she is no longer on the No Fly list and has not been since 2005; and to inform Dr. Ibrahim that she is eligible to apply for a discretionary visa waiver under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3)(D)(iv) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2041.121\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). The district court declined to reach Dr. Ibrahim's substantive due process, equal protection, First Amendment, and APA claims, because \"those arguments, even if successful, would not lead to any greater relief than already ordered.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Having won an outstanding victory, Dr. Ibrahim's lawyers petitioned for fees under the EAJA. In the district court's April 15, 2014 fee order, although the district court applauded the lawyers' commitment to this difficult and unprecedented case, it awarded only limited compensation. The court acknowledged that Dr. Ibrahim \"did not outright lose\" on her substantive due process, equal protection, First Amendment, and APA claims, but treated those claims as \"unsuccessful\" when it calculated fees under\n   <em>\n    Hensley\n   </em>\n   . The district court found that her substantive due process and APA claims were related to the procedural due process claim on which she prevailed, so it allowed fees on these claims. But the court also ruled that her First Amendment and equal protection claims were not related to the successful claim, and denied fees for work performed on those claims. The district court also concluded that Dr. Ibrahim's counsel was not entitled to fees for work performed on Dr. Ibrahim's visa issues, the settlement with the Non-Federal Defendants, litigation of standing prior to\n   <em>\n    Ibrahim II\n   </em>\n   (although it permitted fees for time after\n   <em>\n    Ibrahim II\n   </em>\n   ), litigation of privilege issues, and other miscellaneous work. The district court also found that the government did not act in bad faith, that Dr. Ibrahim's counsel was not entitled to a rate enhancement beyond the $125 per hour fee\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   stated in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202412\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(A)(ii), and that counsel was not entitled to fees as discovery sanctions pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 37 and 16. The district court appointed a special master to determine the appropriate award of fees and costs based on the district court's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Thereafter, the parties and the court engaged in a lengthy and contentious fee dispute before the special master. The district court ultimately adopted the special master's findings and reduced Dr. Ibrahim's fees for various witnesses and costs associated with those witnesses, expenses related to obtaining TSA clearance, costs that would be \"reasonably charged\" to the client, and costs for multiple copies of the same book; and rejected certain expenses for lack of supporting documentation or sufficient itemization. In total, Dr. Ibrahim sought $3,630,057.50 in market-rate attorneys' fees and $293,860.18 in expenses. On October 9, 2014, the district court ultimately awarded Dr. Ibrahim $419,987.36 in fees and $34,768.71 in expenses. Dr. Ibrahim appealed the underlying legal framework the district court utilized to determine the fees she was eligible to recover, various specific reductions to eligible fees, and the striking of her objections to the special master's recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   On appeal, in the now-withdrawn panel opinion, our court adopted a number of the district court's rulings under a different approach.\n   <em>\n    Ibrahim v.

The three-judge panel concluded that \"it was not an abuse of discretion to find that [Dr.] Ibrahim's unsuccessful claims were unrelated, because although the work done on those claims could have contributed to her ultimately successful claim, the facts and legal theories underlying [Dr.] Ibrahim's claims make that result unlikely.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1063.

The panel also held that the district court incorrectly considered\n   substantial justification at each stage of litigation; that the government did not act in bad faith; that the district court did not err in determining that Dr. Ibrahim had failed to abide by its page limits in objecting to the special master's report and recommendation; and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in striking Dr. Ibrahim's objections to the special master's report and recommendation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1052, 1065-66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   We now clarify that when a district court awards complete relief on one claim, rendering it unnecessary to reach alternative claims, the alternative claims cannot be deemed unsuccessful for the purpose of calculating a fee award.

Most fundamentally, the agency position upon which these going-on-thirteen years of litigation was based was not justified at all, much less substantially. The district court correctly recognized as much, finding: \"The original sin-Agent Kelley's mistake and that he did not learn about his error until his deposition eight years later-was not reasonable\" under the EAJA. Whether the error is attributable to the failure to train Agent Kelley, the counter-intuitive nature of the form (check the categories that do NOT apply), the lack of cross-checking or other verification procedures, or anti-Muslim animus (Agent Kelley interviewed Dr. Ibrahim on December 23, 2004, as part of an International Terrorism Investigation), the precise cause is irrelevant to, and does not mitigate, the lack of any basis to place Dr. Ibrahim on the list, nor does it justify a reduction in fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marolf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9452871\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/277/1156/\">\n    277 F.3d at 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that EAJA \"fees generally should be awarded where the government's underlying action was unreasonable even if the\n   government advanced a reasonable litigation position\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The district court correctly concluded that the government's litigation position-to defend the indefensible, its No Fly list error-was not reasonable.

She does not pose (and has not posed) a threat of committing an act of international or domestic terrorism with respect to an aircraft, a threat to airline passenger or civil aviation security, or a threat of domestic terrorism.\" But the government knew this in November 2004, when Agent Kelley completed the form; it knew it in January 2005, when the DHS agent told Dr. Ibrahim she was not on the No Fly list; and it was well aware of it two weeks after Dr. Ibrahim filed the underlying action, when a government agent ordered her \"Remove[d] from\n   <em>\n    ALL\n   </em>\n   watchlisting supported systems (For terrorist subjects: due to closure of case AND no nexus to terrorism)\" and further stated that Dr. Ibrahim was not qualified for placement on either the No Fly or TSA Selectee lists.

Related Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The district court and the original panel exacerbated this error in analyzing whether the claims the district court did not reach were related to her successful claims. The district court correctly concluded that Dr. Ibrahim's substantive due process and APA claims were related to her prevailing procedural due process claim and allowed recovery of some of those fees and expenses. Without much analysis, however, the district court also concluded that her equal protection and First Amendment claims were not related \"because they involved different evidence, different theories, and arose from a different alleged course of conduct.\" The three-judge panel stepped into the breach with its newly devised \"mutually exclusive\" rationale to determine that the claims were unrelated because, after trial, the district court found that Dr. Ibrahim was placed\n   on the No Fly list due to negligence, and her First Amendment and equal protection claims alleged intentional discrimination.

The First Amended Complaint at bottom was a challenge to \"defendants' administration, management, and implementation of the 'No-Fly List.' \" Specifically, Dr. Ibrahim alleged that the manner in which the government created, maintained, updated, and disseminated the No Fly list led to the humiliating treatment she experienced at SFO in January 2005 and afterwards, as she was unable to learn whether she was on or off the list or why she was placed there in the first place. She alleged several alternative theories for this treatment, five of which ultimately went to trial against the federal government. That the government's actions arose from negligence or unconstitutional animus could not have been known until the case was tried, and we still do not know whether, in addition to Agent Kelley's negligence in placing her on the No Fly list, the government's initial interest in Dr. Ibrahim stemmed from its allegedly heightened interest in foreign students from Muslim countries here on U.S. student visas,\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   or her husband's recent visit, or her\n   regular attendance at a mosque, or her involvement in the Islamic Society of Stanford University, which, if true, would have shown discriminatory intent. And because the district court did not reach the First Amendment and equal protection claims, we will never know whether placement on the TSDB was a result of discrimination on the basis of her race, religion, country of origin, or association with Muslims and Muslim groups.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   There is no question that all of these claims arise from the government's common course of conduct toward Dr. Ibrahim. To hold otherwise would ignore the realities of lawyering. As here, the key question in a lawsuit is often not what happened-but why. Before the litigation begins and while it is ongoing, the plaintiff and her lawyers cannot know for sure why someone else did something, but may, as here, have evidence suggesting various possibilities. So, as here, the plaintiff raises alternative claims and theories as to why something was done, some of which may be ultimately inconsistent, with regard to a single set of facts. The plaintiff's claims are then tested by dispositive motions, discovery, and perhaps (as happened here) trial. The fact that one claim or theory is eventually determined to be true does not mean that the claims were unrelated to one another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   It is common to plead that a defendant committed some act \"intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly,\" or simultaneously to bring different claims premised on distinct mental states. This widely accepted litigation strategy is accommodated by the clear standard pronounced by the Supreme Court and previously applied by our court, which focuses on whether the claims are premised on an \"entirely distinct and separate\" set of facts, not whether they are based on different \"mental states.\" The analysis in the now-withdrawn opinion shows that had it applied the correct standard, it would have recognized that all of Dr. Ibrahim's claims were based on the same set of facts-the placement of Dr. Ibrahim's name on the government's watchlists-regardless of what \"mental state\" was required to prove each particular claim.\n   <em>\n    Ibrahim III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355529\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/835/1048/\">\n    835 F.3d at 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]f the government negligently placed [Dr.] Ibrahim on its watchlists because it failed to properly fill out a form, then it could not at the same time have intentionally placed [Dr.] Ibrahim on the list based on constitutionally protected attributes [Dr.] Ibrahim possesses, and vice versa.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Allowing hindsight to creep in to fee awards also would put lawyers in an untenable ethical position.

All of Dr. Ibrahim's claims arose from her wrongful placement on the No Fly list, and are therefore related. Fees for each of these claims are thus recoverable. All of these claims derive from the government's interest in Dr. Ibrahim's activities, which led to her placement on the No Fly list, her placement on and off various other watchlists (which the district court deemed \"Kafkaesque\"), her attempts to learn why she was on the No Fly list, her attempts to get herself removed from the No Fly list, and the government's intransigence in setting the record straight for almost a decade. As the district court found, this treatment had a \"palpable impact, leading to the humiliation, cuffing, and incarceration of an innocent and incapacitated air traveler.\" Dr.\n   Ibrahim's \"litany of troubles\" flow directly from her erroneous placement on the No Fly list, as do all of the claims that went to trial.

Although this is not a class action, and thus we assess Dr. Ibrahim's individual success, the pathbreaking nature of her lawsuit underscores her achievement. Dr. Ibrahim was the first person ever to force the government to admit a terrorist watchlisting mistake; to obtain significant discovery regarding how the federal watchlisting system works; to proceed to trial regarding a watchlisting mistake; to force the government to trace and correct all erroneous records in its customer watchlists and databases; to require the government to inform a watchlisted individual of her TSDB status; and to admit that it has secret exceptions to the watchlisting reasonable suspicion standard. Dr. Ibrahim, in her first appeal to our court, established that district courts have jurisdiction over challenges to placement on terrorist watchlists, including the No Fly list.\n   <em>\n    Ibrahim I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4127794\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/538/1250/#p1254\">\n    538 F.3d at 1254-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Dr. Ibrahim-a professor and person of ordinary means-did not have the resources to pay an attorney to pursue her claims, which ultimately cost more than $3.6 million dollars to litigate. And the small seventeen-lawyer law firm that represented her, McManis Faulkner, had similarly limited resources, but, when others refused, they agreed to take on her case, uncertain whether they would ever be compensated. On the other side of the table was the government and its virtually unlimited resources. The government had a team of twenty-six lawyers-more lawyers than McManis Faulkner employed-and spent at least 13,400 hours-in other words, 558 days of one person working 24 hours a day-vigorously defending this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Accordingly, we find that Dr. Ibrahim achieved excellent results and is therefore entitled to reasonable fees consistent with that outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The court unreasonably concluded, at least with respect to Raihan, that there was no evidence that the government did so. That conclusion by the district court is \"without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in\n   the record\" and is thus clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    Crittenden v.

Dr. Ibrahim's daughter, a U.S. citizen with a U.S. passport, was flagged by the National Targeting Center (NTC) as potentially inadmissible to the United States. NTC determined that she had been listed in the TSDB database by other government entities as an individual about whom those agencies possessed \"substantive 'derogatory' information\" that \"may be relevant to an admissibility determination under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\" But, as a U.S. citizen, Dr. Ibrahim's daughter clearly was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   subject to the INA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Although Dr. Ibrahim's daughter carried a U.S. passport and U.S. Customs and Border Protection recognized that she appeared to be a U.S. citizen, NTC requested that Philippine Airlines perform additional screening of her in the following e-mail:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   [Subject line:] POSSIBLE NO BOARD REQUESTPNR WNDYJS\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   [Body:] NOTICE TO AIR CARRIER The [DHS and U.S. Customs and Border Protection] recommends the airline to contact [the carrier liaison group] when the following passenger shows up to check in ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   After Philippine Airlines received this notice, Raihan was not permitted to board her flight, causing her to miss her mother's trial, where she had been listed as a witness. The government did not update the TSDB to reflect that Dr. Ibrahim's daughter was a U.S. citizen until after it had purportedly investigated the situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The district court also disregarded the government's response to Agent Kelley's error once the error was discovered. On remand, the district court should take into account in its analysis of bad faith the government's conduct together with the consequences Dr. Ibrahim suffered as a result. For example, the district court failed to consider the February 2006 order to remove Dr. Ibrahim from all watchlist databases because she had \"no nexus to terrorism.\" Despite this order, the government continued to place Dr. Ibrahim on and off federal watchlists, providing no reasonable explanation for Dr. Ibrahim's never-ending transitions in watchlist status. Further, the only justification for her continued watchlist placement is claimed to be a state secret. This assertion begs the question: Why was Dr. Ibrahim added to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   watchlist once the government determined she was not a threat? Moreover, was there any justification for her seemingly random addition to and removal from watchlists? The district court should also consider the government's failure to remedy its own error until being ordered to do so and its failure to inform Agent Kelley of his mistake for eight years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The district court also wrongly rejected as a basis for bad faith the government's numerous requests for dismissal on standing grounds post-\n   <em>\n    Ibrahim II\n   </em>\n   , where we determined unequivocally that Dr. Ibrahim had Article III standing even though she voluntarily left the United States. The government knowingly pursued baseless standing arguments in its third motion to dismiss, its motion for summary judgment, statements during trial, and post-trial proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The district court found that the government's position was \"unreasonable,\" particularly after it \"continue[d] to seek dismissal based on lack of standing in the face of our court of appeal's decision,\" but\n   it did not account for this unreasonableness in its bad faith determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ibrahim II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724058\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/983/#p996\">\n    669 F.3d at 997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, the government refused to produce evidence designated \"sensitive security information\" (SSI), even after Dr. Ibrahim's attorneys obtained the requisite security clearance and the court ordered the government to produce discovery. Contrary to its April 2014 bad faith finding, the district court itself, in a December 20, 2012 order, admonished the government for its \"persistent and stubborn refusal to follow the statute\" that required the government to produce this information in these circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The district court's 2012 reprimand had little effect on the government's conduct. After this order, the government continued to drag its feet and refused to produce any privileged information-which Dr. Ibrahim's attorneys were cleared to review-because it wanted to renegotiate an already-in-place protective order. The district court, noting its dissatisfaction with the government's handling of this litigation in 2013, emphasized that the government had \"once again miss[ed] a deadline to produce materials in this long-pending action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The government also refused to comply with the district court's order to produce Dr. Ibrahim's current watchlist status until it was compelled to do so. Dr. Ibrahim should not have been required to pursue a motion to compel to require the government to produce this information, especially when the government's justifications for refusing to produce it were baseless. The government first argued that Dr. Ibrahim did not have standing to assert a right to learn the status of her No Fly list placement-a meritless reassertion of a settled issue. The government alternatively argued that her historical watchlist status was irrelevant to this case-a plainly frivolous contention given that Dr. Ibrahim's watchlist status is at the heart of this dispute. These actions, too, support a bad faith finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   On remand, when analyzing the government's litigation conduct through a totality of the circumstances lens, the district court must also consider other relevant conduct, including the government's abuse of the discovery process;\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   interference with the public's right of access to trial by making at least ten motions to close the courtroom,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foltz v.

Though the government may have had a legitimate basis to defend this litigation initially, whether the government's defense of this litigation was\n   <em>\n    ever\n   </em>\n   in good faith is a different question from whether it was\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   in good faith.

The district court focused primarily upon Agent Kelley's \"unknowing\" placement of Dr. Ibrahim's name on the No Fly list, which it deemed \"the original sin,\" rather than considering the \"totality\" of the government's conduct, \"including conduct\n   'prelitigation and during trial.' \"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3841375\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/542/704/#p709\">\n    542 F.3d at 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis removed) (citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rawlings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1924704\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/725/1192/#p1195\">\n    725 F.2d at 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (opining that when evaluating bad faith we must consider the \"totality of the circumstances\"). And this conduct should have included both an analysis of the government agencies' and its legal representatives' conduct. Dr. Ibrahim should not have had to endure over a decade of contentious litigation, two trips to the court of appeals, extensive discovery, over 800 docket entries amounting to many thousands of pages of record, and a weeklong trial the government precluded her (and her U.S.-citizen daughter) from attending, only to come full circle to the government's concession that she never belonged on the No Fly list at all-that she is not and never was a terrorist or threat to airline passenger or civil aviation security.

As the district court speculated, however, the government's initial interest in Dr. Ibrahim may have rested on shaky constitutional grounds because it may have been motivated by racial or religious animus. Dr. Ibrahim alleged that, at the time Agent Kelley first investigated Dr. Ibrahim for potential watchlisting placement, the government had a heightened interest in foreign students like her who were in the United States from Muslim countries on U.S. student visas. Stanford University had specifically contacted these students, warning them of the government's potential interest. However, because the district court did not reach this issue despite having more familiarity with the extensive record, we cannot conclude that the government's initial interest in Dr. Ibrahim was in bad faith.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"34\">\n   <p id=\"p-248\">\n    Even after Agent Kelley learned of his mistake, Agent Kelley never reviewed his old files to see if he had accidentally nominated others to the No Fly list in the hope it was a one-time mistake.
