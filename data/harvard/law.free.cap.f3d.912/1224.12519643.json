The two were already incarcerated for a separate joint criminal enterprise. For the second time, Hall, who is still in prison, appeals a special condition of his anticipated release restricting his relationship with his family.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Special Condition 11 provides that Hall \"is permitted to have contact with Benton [ ] only for normal familial relations but is prohibited from any contact, discussion, or communication concerning financial or investment matters except matters limited to defendant's own support.\" Hall objected at sentencing that the condition is unconstitutionally vague. We agree, and strike the offending words \"only for normal familial relations\" from the condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A supervised release condition \"violates due process of law if it either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Must relations be \"normal\" for that particular family, or \"normal\" for families in general? If the latter, as the government contended at oral argument, how is a defendant to know what a \"normal\" family is and does, in light of the tremendous diversity of family structures and family habits, customs, and activities in this country?\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Whether or not such an interpretation of the condition by a probation officer or judge is likely, \"[u]ncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to steer far wider of the unlawful zone than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.\"\n   <em>\n    Cal.

Notably, Hall is generally prohibited from engaging in illegal activities by his first condition of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED in part.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    In an earlier memorandum disposition, this court considered another version of this condition, which, without exception for relatives, prohibited Hall from \"associat[ing] with ... any person convicted of a felony unless granted permission to do so by the probation officer.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.
