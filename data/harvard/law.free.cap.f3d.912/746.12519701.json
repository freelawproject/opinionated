Environmental groups and their individual members disagreed with this certification, and they petitioned this Court to review the Board's decision. Because we conclude that the Board's Section 401 Certification for upland areas was not arbitrary and capricious, we deny the petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Atlantic Coast Pipeline (\"ACP\"), a project developed and overseen by Atlantic Coast Pipeline LLC (\"Atlantic\"), is a proposed interstate natural gas pipeline, constructed by Atlantic, that will be approximately 604 miles long and 42 inches in diameter and will carry natural gas from Harrison County, West Virginia, to the eastern portions of Virginia and North Carolina. Approximately 307 miles of the ACP would traverse the Commonwealth of Virginia. There are a total of 890 water body crossings locations in Virginia, and the route of the ACP encompasses 74 migratory fish spawning waters or their tributaries. The proposed ACP access roads will intersect 89 Virginia rivers and streams and will require the clearing of thousands of acres in Virginia. To obtain approval for construction, Atlantic had to comply with the following federal and state laws and regulations relevant to this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As an initial matter, Atlantic had to comply with the Natural Gas Act (\"NGA\"). Under the NGA, a party is required to obtain authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") in the form of a certificate of public convenience and necessity to build or operate a natural gas pipeline. Upon receipt of an application for such a certificate, FERC undertakes a review of the environmental impacts of the proposed project under the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\") and the NGA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204321\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20717\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   FERC accepts input from the public and then produces an environmental impact statement (\"EIS\").

Atlantic filed an amendment to its FERC certificate application in March 2016. In October 2017, FERC issued the certificate to Atlantic to construct and operate the pipeline. On April 7, 2017, the DEQ issued a Section 401 Certification for the wetland, river, and streams crossings as covered in the Section 404 Nationwide Permit 12. In May 2017, the DEQ explained that the Section 401 Certification for the Pipeline would entail two separate parts: (1) the certification for the Army Corps Nationwide Permit 12, issued in April, applying to the Pipeline's wetland, river, and streams crossings (the \"Wetlands and Streams Certification\"), and (2) an additional Section 401 Certification review process to evaluate the \"upland\" impacts of the Pipeline, terrestrial areas that are not\n   covered by the Army Corps Permit (the \"Upland Certification\"). Specifically, the Upland Certification would \"include all proposed upland activities associated with the construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of the pipeline, any components thereof or appurtenances thereto, and related access roads and rights-of-way as well as certain project related surface water withdrawals.\" J.A 1083.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On November 9, 2017, the DEQ recommended that the Board approve a Section 401 Upland Certification of the project. On December 20, 2017, the Board issued the Upland Certification for the ACP with conditions. This Certification was distinct from the Wetlands and Steams Certification. This Upland Certification provided that it \"shall be effective only following submission, review and final approval as required by law of the Karst Mitigation Plan, Annual Standards and Specifications, and Erosion and Sediment Control Plans and Storm Water Management Plans, and a report to the Board and the public by DEQ on the adequacy of these materials.\" J.A. 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Petitioners timely filed two petitions for review of the Certification on January 18, 2018. The petitions were consolidated by court order on January 31, 2018. We possess jurisdiction to review the Board's Section 401 Upland Certification pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The petitioners contend the Board's issuance of the Section 401 Upland Certification was arbitrary and capricious and should be vacated for four reasons: (1) the State Agencies effectively invalidated their own finding of reasonable assurance when it voted to reopen the comment period on the Section 401 Certification of the Army Corps of Engineers Nationwide Permit 12; (2) the State Agencies arbitrarily and capriciously failed to assess the combined impacts on water quality that would result from multiple areas of construction activities within individual watershed areas; (3) the State Agencies arbitrarily and capriciously failed to conduct an adequate antidegradation review; and (4) the State Agencies arbitrarily and capriciously failed to ensure that the water quality in karst geology regions would be protected. Respondents and intervenor in turn deny that the State Agencies acted arbitrarily and capriciously and argue that the petitioners lack standing to bring this petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On April 12, 2018, the Board approved a second 30-day public comment period related to the Wetlands and Steams Certification. On August 21, 2018, the Board heard a presentation from the DEQ summarizing the public comment period and denied a motion to reevaluate this contested Certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The respondents and intervenor argue as an initial matter that petitioners do not have standing to litigate this petition for review.\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v.

As the State Agencies explained, \"the conditions in the proposed additional 401 Certification are in addition to any other Federal or State permit or regulatory requirements including the expressed conditions imposed by FERC.\" J.A. 1059. The Upland Certification in question is not designed to function as a stand-alone document, comprehensively covering all pieces of relevant data and potentialities. For example, record evidence available to the State Agencies explains, \"while the impacts to jurisdictional waters authorized by the Corps under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act are separate from upland activities that are the subject of this Certification, the Corps also analyzed the cumulative effects of linear utility projects and found that the individual and cumulative adverse effects on the aquatic environment resulting from the activities authorized by the Nationwide Permit 12 will be no more than minimal and each crossing is a single and complete project.\" J.A. 999. The Army Corps examined cumulative impacts, and it would be redundant and inefficient for the State Agencies to duplicate these efforts. The Upland Certification works in conjunction with other regulatory tools and cannot be judged in a void, and it supplements other pieces of the regulatory framework. It is not required to cover combined effect analysis because other parts of the regulatory process sufficiently address that subject matter. The State Agencies in the current appeal used their resources to issue the Upland Certification to fill an information gap regarding the impact of upland activities, which were not typically covered under prior CWA certifications. The State Agencies properly made a unique contribution instead of duplicating the efforts of other regulatory bodies as petitioners' request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517969\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/898/383/#p400\">\n    898 F.3d at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, State Agencies have broad discretion when developing the criteria for their Section 401 Certification. The only requirement imposed by the regulations is that States must establish procedures for public notice when there are applications for certification, and to the extent deemed appropriate, procedures for public hearings in connection with specific applications.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Nonetheless, nothing in Section 401 restricts states to a single certificate proceeding, and Section 401 does not require states to undertake a single cumulative review of all possible impacts in a single certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Petitioners' rely on two federal regulations in arguing that a cumulative review is required,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20230.7\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20230.11\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1), but those regulations impose duties-including a duty to make factual determinations and consider cumulative effects-on the Army Corps under Section 404, not on states under Section 401. Moreover, petitioners contend that two cases require State Agencies to take into account combined effects lest their decisions be rendered arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klamath-Siskiyou Wildlands Ctr. v.

We conclude, however, that both the\n   <em>\n    Klamath-Siskiyou Wildlands\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Idaho Rivers United\n   </em>\n   cases are distinguishable and unpersuasive because in those cases the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service, respectively, faced violations under NEPA, not the CWA.\n   <em>\n    Klamath-SiskiyouWildlands Ctr\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9155232\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/989/#p993\">\n    387 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   993-94 ;\n   <em>\n    Idaho Rivers United\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2063767\">\n    2016 U.S. Dist.

Furthermore,\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association\n   </em>\n   , which deals with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, does not mention cumulative effects or the CWA, and thus the case does not stand for the proposition that the CWA should be broadened to encompass a combined impact analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Finally, the State Agencies' failure to explicitly consider the combined effects of multiple areas of construction within individual watersheds such as the Chesapeake Bay watershed and the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (\"Bay TMDL\") did not render their decision arbitrary and capricious.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As an initial matter, despite petitioners' preferences, there are no express regulations that require the State Agencies to consider the combined effects of individual watersheds. In addition, the Ninth Circuit has explained that TMDLs like the Chesapeake Bay TMDL are \"primarily informational tools that allow states to proceed from the identification of water requiring additional planning to the required plans.\"\n   <em>\n    Pronsolino v. Nastri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9434485\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/291/1123/#p1129\">\n    291 F.3d 1123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1129 (9th Cir. 2002).

Consequently, the Chesapeake TMDL does not constitute a regulatory mandate that the State Agencies were required to address before issuing the Section 401 Upland Certification. Furthermore, protection measures for the Chesapeake Bay TMDL are offered through other tools such as the FERC EIS and the Storm Water Prevention Plan. J.A. 664-665; 1138-1140.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The State Agencies more than satisfied their obligations by reviewing upland activities as well as stream and wetland crossings. The Board's decisions are not rendered arbitrary and capricious because it did not conduct an independent review of the cumulative effects on water quality within individual watersheds, even if this was petitioners' preference. To deem an agency action arbitrary and capricious their decision must be \"so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.\"\n   <em>\n    State Farm Mut.

The AS&amp;S in this case were developed over eighteen months and represent a thorough process of development, revision and refinement to ensure that the ACP meet the technical and legal requirements for Virginia. J.A. 1087. Both federal and state regulators have concluded that application of technical requirements like those in the AS&amp;S \"will not result in a lowering of water quality,\" which renders the individualized review the petitioners suggest \"unnecessary.\" J.A. 11. There is no indication that these AS&amp;S fail to protect water quality in Virginia. To the contrary, these regulations have been found as a matter of law to protect water quality in Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kelble v.

Apr. 10, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Second, State Agencies did not have to conduct a separate antidegradation review because the impact on sediment on the water would only be temporary. Under FERC's final EIS, it was determined that any water quality impacts stemming from construction would be temporary. J.A. 623. Even with respect to Tier 3 waters, the policy states that \"[a]ctivities causing temporary sources of pollution may be allowed in [Tier 3] waters ... even if degradation may be expected to occur provided that after a minimal period of time the waters are returned or restored to conditions equal to or better that those existing just prior to the temporary source of pollution.\" 9 Va. Admin. Code 25-260-30A(3)(b)(3). Even in the most protected state waters, Virginia does not consider temporary sources of pollution, such as the construction of the ACP, to violate antidegradation policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Thus, nothing was arbitrary and capricious about the State Agencies' decision not to conduct a separate antidegradation review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Turning to the final challenge raised by petitioners, we find that the State Agencies' treatment of karst terrain was not arbitrary or capricious because of the conditions imposed on the Section 401 Upland Certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Karst geology refers to geological formations of soluble limestone bedrock that creates underground water flow systems where the rocks have dissolved and created sinkholes, caves and underground springs and rivers. J.A. 669. The constitution of these areas presents additional environmental considerations for pipeline construction including, sinkhole collapse, sinkhole flooding and associated groundwater contamination. J.A. 904-905.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The record demonstrates that the State Agencies took petitioners' concerns regarding karst geology into consideration. J.A. 31. Virginia's Section 401 Upland Certification contains five specific requirements concerning the protection of karst terrain. J.A. 31-32. First, Atlantic must provide the State an addendum to a 51-page Karst Survey Report prior to any land disturbing activities. J.A. 212-237; J.A. 31. Second, Atlantic must follow the Karst Terrain Assessment, Construction, Monitoring, and Mitigation Plan. J.A. 31. This plan allows for route adjustments to avoid karst terrain. J.A. 1001. Third, based on the conditions in the Section 401 Upland Certification, Atlantic must conduct contingency planning in order to address any accidental spills or releases during construction on karst terrain. Fourth, water surveys regarding drinkable water in karst regions are required under the Section 401 Upland Certification. J.A. 31. Finally, Atlantic has a liability of five million dollars to cover the cost of any impacts to private water supplies, which encompasses karst regions. J.A. 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Reliance on these conditions, even the prospective ones, does not render the State Agencies' issuance of the Section 401 Upland Certification arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Port of Seattle v.

Based on the information in the record, this Court finds that the State Agencies had reasonable assurance that\n   karst regions would be protected given the conditions imposed on the Section 401 Upland Certification. We \"see no purpose we would serve by stepping in and second-guessing the analytical methods Virginia deemed appropriate to provide it with reasonable assurance that its water quality would be protected.\"\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517969\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/898/383/#p400\">\n    898 F.3d at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Governmental agencies can always take additional steps to increase the protection of the environment. But that is not the applicable legal standard this Court utilizes when reviewing a state agency's issuance of a Section 401 Certification. We must determine \"whether the agency considered the relevant factors and whether a clear error of judgment was made.\"\n   <em>\n    Ohio Valley Envtl.

There is no indication that the State Agencies did not consider relevant factors or that they clearly made an error of judgment. In conclusion, because we find that the State Agencies did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in issuing the Section 401 Upland Certification, we deny the petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Asserting that the APA is not applicable to actions by State Agencies, respondents argue that Va.
