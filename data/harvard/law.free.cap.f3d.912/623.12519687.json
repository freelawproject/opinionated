But did Congress, through the same Act, tell us how to handle claims for immunity in criminal cases as well? That question looms large over this litigation concerning a subpoena issued by a grand jury, but we find it unnecessary to supply a definitive answer. Assuming the Act's immunity applies, we hold that it leaves intact the district courts' subject-matter jurisdiction over federal criminal cases involving foreign sovereigns, and that there is a reasonable probability the information sought through the subpoena here concerns a\n   commercial activity that caused a direct effect in the United States. Because the Act-even where it applies-allows courts to exercise jurisdiction over such activities, and because the ancillary challenges in this appeal lack merit, we affirm the district court's order holding the subpoena's target, a corporation owned by a foreign sovereign, in contempt for failure to comply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The grand jury seeks information from a corporation (\"the Corporation\") owned by Country A and issued a subpoena directing the Corporation to produce that information. [Redacted] The Corporation moved to quash the subpoena, arguing that it is immune under the Act, or, alternatively, that the subpoena is unreasonable or oppressive (and therefore unenforceable under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 17(c)(2) ) because it would require the Corporation to violate Country A's domestic law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The district court denied the motion to quash. The Corporation took an immediate appeal, which an earlier panel of this court dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. Per Curiam Order,\n   <em>\n    In re Grand Jury Subpoena,\n   </em>\n   No. 18-3068 (October 3, 2018). The district court then held the Corporation in contempt, imposing a fine of $50,000 per day until the Corporation complies with the subpoena, but stayed accrual and execution of the penalty pending appeal. The Corporation then filed this appeal of the contempt order. Because this appeal involves exclusively legal questions, our review is de novo.\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3714355,11818764\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/146/881/\">\n    146 F.3d 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 883 (D.C.

Mindful of our obligation to avoid sweeping more broadly than we must to decide the case in front of us, we need not weigh in on this dispute. As we explain below, even assuming section 1604 's grant of immunity applies to criminal proceedings, the Corporation still lacks immunity from this particular subpoena.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Taking section 1604 's grant of immunity as a given, the government must check three boxes for the contempt order to stand. First, there must be a valid grant of subject-matter jurisdiction. Second, one of the Act's exceptions to immunity must apply. And third, the contempt sanctions must be a permissible remedy. According to the district court, the government satisfies all three. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We start, as we must, with subject-matter jurisdiction. The district court purported to exercise its inherent contempt power in aid of its criminal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FG Hemisphere Associates, LLC v. Democratic Republic of Congo,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196937,3554855\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/637/373/\">\n    637 F.3d 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 377 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (explaining that \"federal courts enjoy inherent contempt power\" that \"runs with a court's jurisdiction\"). The problem, according to the Corporation, is that the Act eliminated all criminal subject-matter jurisdiction over foreign sovereigns, taking the contempt power with it. The text of the relevant statutes, however, cuts against the Corporation's position. Section 3231 of title 18 gives federal courts original jurisdiction over \"all offenses against the laws of the United States.\" It is hard to imagine a clearer textual grant of subject-matter jurisdiction. \"All\" means \"all\"; the provision contains no carve-out for criminal process served on foreign defendants. And nothing in the Act's text expressly displaces section 3231's jurisdictional grant. True, section 1604 grants immunity \"from the jurisdiction of the courts,\" but that is no help to the Corporation. Linguistically, granting a particular class of defendants \"immunity\" from jurisdiction has no effect on the scope of the underlying jurisdiction, any more than a vaccine conferring immunity from a virus affects the biological properties of the virus itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To be sure, we have often referred to the Act's immunity provisions as affecting \"subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Odhiambo v. Republic of Kenya,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183378,4111111\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/31/\">\n    764 F.3d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 34 (D.C. Cir. 2014). But in offering that characterization, we are not referring to section 1604. The provision that usually gives the exceptions to immunity their jurisdictional status is the Act's provision\n   <em>\n    conferring\n   </em>\n   subject-matter jurisdiction over foreign states in civil actions, codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201330\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). That section authorizes jurisdiction over certain nonjury civil actions \"with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity.\" Thus, establishing that an exception to immunity applies is one element of invoking subject-matter jurisdiction under section 1330(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Verlinden,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298818\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/480/#p486\">\n    461 U.S. at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298818\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/480/#p486\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (using section 1330(a) to link the immunity exceptions to subject-matter jurisdiction). This feature of section 1330(a) does not transmute the entirely separate section 1604 into a provision about subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With no textual provision purporting to eliminate section 3231's grant of subject-matter jurisdiction, the Corporation instead focuses on section 1330(a). Although that provision by its terms merely\n   <em>\n    confers\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over an unrelated set of civil cases, the Corporation assures us that, as with an iceberg, much hides beneath the surface. Specifically, the Corporation reads the provision to silently and simultaneously\n   <em>\n    revoke\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction over any case not falling within its terms, including any criminal proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ordinarily, that argument would be a tough sell. We are usually reluctant to view one statute as implying a limited repeal of another where the two are capable of coexisting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morton v. Mancari,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1519969\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/535/#p550\">\n    417 U.S. 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 550,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1519969\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/535/#p550\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1519969\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/417/535/#p550\">\n    41 L.Ed.2d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974) (\"In the absence of some affirmative showing of an intention to repeal, the only permissible justification for a repeal by implication is when the earlier and later statutes are irreconcilable.\").

The lack of reported cases-before and after the Act-considering criminal process served on sovereign-owned corporations only highlights this uncertainty. From that paucity, the Corporation would have us infer that such corporations are universally understood to possess absolute immunity, but that notion strikes us as highly speculative.

Section 3231's text, however, contradicts that argument, as it authorizes jurisdiction over \"all offenses against the laws of the United States.\" The Corporation's underdeveloped position appears to rest on language from pre-Act judicial opinions stating that, under the former regime of complete immunity, a court lacked \"jurisdiction\" over a case against a foreign sovereign.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schooner Exchange,\n   </em>\n   11 U.S. (7 Cranch) at 135 (warship owned by foreign sovereign is \"exempt from the jurisdiction of the country\").

Just how we apply this test in the context of a subpoena is not immediately obvious. The \"gravamen\" of a subpoena may be the mere fact that an entity possesses the documents in question.

Adhering to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.1, we treat \"[i]ssues of foreign law\" as \"questions of law.\" But, as the party who \"relies on foreign law,\" the Corporation \"assumes the burden of showing that such law prevents compliance with the court's order.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331628,10546679\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/825/494/\">\n    825 F.2d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 498 (D.C.

The declarations are quite cursory, and they contain no citations to authority or Country A's case law. Moreover, the statements come from the retained counsel of a party with a direct stake in this litigation, and they were plainly prepared with this particular proceeding in mind. Under those circumstances, our careful consideration of the declarations leads us to conclude that they shed little light on the meaning of Country A's law as it would be interpreted by that nation's courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Following similar criticisms from the district court and the government, and after briefing was complete in this court, the Corporation submitted a\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   declaration, this time from a regulatory body of Country A. The government urges us to strike this filing as untimely. Although that position is not without merit, exercising an abundance of caution and giving due deference to Country A's sovereign status, we will consider the filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Unfortunately for the Corporation, however, the filing fails to cure the crucial deficiencies of the original declarations. The new filing still fails to cite a single Country A court case articulating the Corporation's preferred interpretation of the law. [Redacted] These omissions, combined with the fact that the statement was clearly prepared in response to this litigation and at a very late hour, leave us unpersuaded that the statement accurately reflects how Country A's courts would interpret the relevant provision.

It claims that, out of respect for its foreign sovereign status, we should not have adhered to our usual rule requiring a contempt order before taking appellate jurisdiction over denial of a motion to quash. Even if we had the power to undo a prior panel's work in some circumstances, we could not do so here. Because the district court has now held the Corporation in contempt, any opinion by us on whether that procedure was necessary would be entirely advisory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Preiser v.

Republic of Kenya,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183378,4111111\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/764/31/\">\n    764 F.3d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 35-36 (D.C. Cir. 2014). And it would violate notions of sovereign dignity and international comity to strip a foreign sovereign of its immunity based on\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   filings that the sovereign cannot contest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Appellant's Br. 27-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   But the argument that the Corporation \"does not have\" responsive documents in the United States,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 28, does nothing to refute the government's actual argument-that the Corporation's \"considerable business\" in the United States subjected it (and all its documents, worldwide) to the jurisdiction of the district court, Br. of United States 32. And even if the Corporation's words arose from some intuition that the government had failed to meet the requirements for general personal jurisdiction, its \"skeletal\" treatment of such an argument, \"leaving the court to do counsel's work,\" was hardly sufficient.\n   <em>\n    Masias v. EPA,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518843\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/906/1069/#p1077\">\n    906 F.3d 1069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1077 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Schneider v. Kissinger,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3440903,8968279\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/412/190/\">\n    412 F.3d 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2005) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   What of the objection based on the international impropriety of stripping \"a foreign sovereign of its immunity based on\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   filings that the sovereign cannot contest\"? This is completely inapposite on the issue of general jurisdiction. The government's argument under clause 1 was made \"without resort to\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   material,\" Br. for United States 32. And this opinion relies on no redacted material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Like any subpoenaed party, of course, the Corporation has a potential right to try to quash the subpoena on grounds of relevance, and that potential right may have been theoretically impaired by the secrecy of grand jury investigations. But given that secrecy and the extraordinary latitude for assessing relevance, the rights of a garden-variety party subpoenaed by a grand jury to challenge relevance are well-nigh negligible. Any incremental impact due to the Corporation's foreign character inflicts no injury on \"notions of sovereign\n   dignity and international comity,\" Appellant's Br. 28-certainly no injury to call for a restricted reading of \u00a7 1605(a)(2), clause 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Corporation has known of the government's broad claim to personal jurisdiction (based on the Corporation's general commercial activity in the U.S.) from day one-during pre-court negotiations, at the district court, and, now, on appeal. See Letter from Government to Corporation's Counsel 2 (July 30, 2018), J.A. 32; Gov't's Resp. in Opp'n 10-11,\n   <em>\n    Grand Jury Subpoena No. 7409,\n   </em>\n   No. 18-gj-041 (D.D.C. Aug. 24, 2018), J.A. 115-16; Br. for United States 32-33. Its failure to respond, then, is attributable to it alone. And where, as here, arguments as to the scope of personal jurisdiction are forfeited, no more is needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In this case, then, denial of immunity and affirmance of the contempt order can rest on the ground that the subpoena was \"based upon\" the general \"commercial activity carried on in the United States\" by a U.S. office of the Corporation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201605\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    NOTE: Portions of this opinion contain sealed information, which has been redacted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
