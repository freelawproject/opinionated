Like most rules, however, AEDPA has an exception: It does not bar successive petitions when a prisoner challenges a new judgment. Turner now files this application for authorization to file a second or successive petition under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the title of his application is deceiving: Turner's argument is that his petition is not a second or successive, but rather a first petition challenging a new judgment that added credit for the time he served before sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We recently held that, under California law, a state court's amended judgment awarding a defendant credit for time served constitutes a new judgment.\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez v. Sherman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265902\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/763/#p769\">\n    873 F.3d 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 769 (9th Cir. 2017). We reach the same conclusion today as to Nevada law. Turner's habeas petition, therefore, is the first petition challenging his amended judgment. So we deny his application as unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following a jury trial in Clark County, Nevada, Turner was convicted of, among other counts, sexual assault while possessing a deadly weapon (Count 5). For Count 5, the Clark County District Court sentenced Turner to life with the possibility of parole after 10 years, plus a consecutive life sentence, with the possibility of parole after 10 years, for the deadly weapon enhancement. The court's judgment, however, contained a mistake. It stated that, as to Count 5, Turner was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole after ten years, plus an enhancement of \"ten (20) years minimum\" for use of a deadly weapon. Moreover, the judgment of conviction listed no credit for time served by Turner before sentencing. On direct appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed Turner's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Turner filed a federal petition for writ of habeas corpus. That petition was denied without prejudice. Turner then filed a state petition for postconviction relief. It was also denied, and Turner did not appeal. Turner filed another federal habeas petition. It was denied again-this time with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Turner later moved to amend his judgment of conviction in the Clark County District Court. Turner argued that his sentence for Count 5 contained a clerical error-the enhancement for use of a deadly weapon should have stated \"Ten (10) Years\" instead of \"Ten (20) Years.\" Turner also argued that he was entitled to credit for 154 days of jail time that he served before he was sentenced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court granted the motion and issued Turner's amended judgment. The amended judgment revised the deadly weapon enhancement on Count 5 to \"Ten (10) Years.\" The amended judgment also gave Turner credit for 154 days of time served. The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed Turner's amended judgment on June 10, 2015, and remittitur issued on July 6, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 17, 2017, Turner filed a third federal habeas petition challenging his conviction and sentence. The district court dismissed the petition without prejudice as an unauthorized successive petition. The court reasoned that because Turner had previously filed two federal habeas petitions challenging his judgment of conviction, the current petition was a successive petition that required the authorization of this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Turner then filed an application for leave to file a second or successive petition pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In so ruling, the Nevada Supreme Court adopted the reasoning of the California Supreme Court, which held that courts must award prisoners credit for time served.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kuykendall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11824444\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/112/1285/\">\n    926 P.2d at 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To be sure, California and Nevada law are not identical.

Nevada courts have not made such a definitive pronouncement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Nevertheless, the Nevada Supreme Court has twice remanded cases to the trial court with instructions that it amend the defendant's judgment to include credit for time served,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Derijk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=373%20P.3d%20909\">\n    373 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   909 ;\n   <em>\n    Kuykendall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11824444\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/112/1285/\">\n    926 P.2d at 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and appellate courts do not remand cases unless the lower court's ruling is erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Zivotofsky ex rel.

Thus, those decisions implicitly demonstrate that judgments that do not include a defendant's credit for time served are invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   , although based on California law, applies to amended judgments awarding defendants credit for time served in Nevada.
