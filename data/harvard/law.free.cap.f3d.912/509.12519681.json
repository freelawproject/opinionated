Relying on this statute, local authorities in California impounded two vehicles because their drivers had not been issued California driver's licenses. The drivers then sued the municipalities under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and state civil rights law, contending that the impounds violated the Fourth Amendment. The district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on plaintiffs' state law claims, denied class certification, and granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs on their section 1983 claims. The defendants now appeal from the district court's summary judgment on the section 1983 claims; the plaintiffs cross-appeal from the denial of class certification and summary judgment on the state law claims.

The County impounded drivers' vehicles for 30 days-pursuant to the statute-when they had never been issued a California driver's license, even if they had a license from another jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 27, 2011, a County deputy sheriff stopped a truck driven by Rafael Mateos Sandoval for a minor traffic infraction. Upon learning that Sandoval did not have a California driver's license, the deputy sheriff decided to impound his truck under section 14602.6, even though Sandoval had a valid driver's license from Mexico and his friend had a California driver's license and offered to take possession of the vehicle. Sandoval sought to regain possession of his truck, but the officer conducting the storage hearing denied Sandoval's request, on the basis that his license was invalid for California residents and that the tow and storage was authorized by state law and local policy. Sandoval appealed, but County officials again denied his request, stating that \"the tow and impound ... were done legally and within policy.\" Sandoval then filed a complaint with the Sheriff's office, and that office again affirmed that \"the deputies acted properly, in accordance with state laws and our [Sonoma County Sheriff's Office] policies.\" Sandoval did not regain possession of his vehicle until the 30 days expired, when he paid the storage fees and a friend with a California driver's license took possession of the truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Officials in the City of Santa Rosa adopted the same interpretation as the County, and impounded vehicles when the drivers had never been issued a California driver's license. On September 1, 2011, Santa Rosa police officers stopped Simeon Ruiz at a checkpoint, where they learned that he did not have a California driver's license. Although Ruiz had an expired Mexico driver's license and a friend with a valid California driver's license who could have taken possession of the vehicle, the officers decided to impound Ruiz's vehicle under section 14602.6. Ruiz unsuccessfully attempted to have his truck returned the following day, and the official conducting his storage hearing later denied his request after being shown Ruiz's Mexico driver's license. Ruiz did not regain possession of his vehicle until the 30 days expired and he paid the storage fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sandoval and Ruiz sued the County and City asserting claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the California Bane Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2052.1\">\n    Cal. Civil Code \u00a7 52.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for the alleged violation of their Fourth Amendment rights. Early in the case, the parties stipulated to a determination of whether the City's actions violated Ruiz's Fourth Amendment rights, assuming the initial seizure was lawful. The district court granted summary judgment to Ruiz, holding that the 30-day impound of his vehicle was unreasonable and therefore unconstitutional. The district court held in a later order that the impound of Sandoval's vehicle was also unreasonable, and granted summary judgment to him as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Sandoval and Ruiz then sought to certify a class, with themselves as class representatives, for all individuals who had their vehicles impounded without a warrant by the County and City for driving without having been issued a California driver's license. They also sought to certify subclasses for individuals who had been issued foreign licenses. The district court denied class certification, holding that the classes were numerous but the subclasses were not, and that the plaintiffs had failed to show commonality and typicality for their proposed classes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sandoval and Ruiz also sought to hold the County and City liable for money damages as the final policymakers who caused the constitutional violations. The defendants opposed, arguing that section 14602.6 permits impoundment when the driver has never been issued a California driver's license, and that they could not be liable for enforcing state law. The district court concluded that section 14602.6 did not permit impoundment for drivers who had previously been issued foreign driver's licenses, and that the municipalities' policies interpreting section 14602.6 to do so-contrary to the law-thus caused the constitutional violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Sandoval and Ruiz also sought summary judgment on their state law claims, arguing that the Fourth Amendment violations established Bane Act liability. The County and City also moved for summary judgment, arguing that the constitutional violations were not sufficiently egregious for liability to attach. The district court concluded that the Bane Act requires threats, intimidation, or coercion apart from that inherent in the seizure, and, finding none in this case, granted summary judgment to the defendants. The district court entered final judgment against the County and City for approximately $4,000 each.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The County appeals, arguing that the district court erred by concluding that it violated the Fourth Amendment and by holding it liable as a final policymaker. The City appeals, asserting the same arguments. The plaintiffs cross-appeal, asserting that the district court abused its discretion by denying class certification and\n   erred by granting summary judgment to the defendants on their Bane Act claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We review summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Szajer v.

The County and City argue that the district court erred in both decisions because the warrantless impounds did not violate the Fourth Amendment and, even if they did, because the municipalities were only enforcing state law.

The parties do not dispute that neither the County nor City officials who impounded the plaintiffs' vehicles had warrants authorizing the impound, so we begin from the premise that the impounds were unreasonable.

But as explained in\n   <em>\n    Brewster\n   </em>\n   , the state's interest in keeping unlicensed drivers off the road is governed by the \"community caretaking\" exception, which permits government officials to remove vehicles from the streets when they \"jeopardize public safety and the efficient movement of vehicular traffic.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11102101\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/249/867/#p872\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, California Vehicle Code \u00a7 310 defines \"driver's license\" as \"a valid license to drive the type of motor vehicle or combination of vehicles for which a person is licensed under this code or by a foreign jurisdiction.\" California Vehicle Code \u00a7 100 provides: \"Unless the provision or context otherwise requires, these definitions shall govern the construction of this code.\" Accordingly, a driver who has been issued a driver's license in a foreign jurisdiction for the type of vehicle seized has not driven that vehicle \"without ever having been issued a driver's license,\" and section 14602.6 does not authorize impounding their vehicles.

Under the circumstances of this case, it was legally unclear whether the 30-day impounds were \"seizures\" at all within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment until we issued our decision in\n   <em>\n    Brewster\n   </em>\n   in 2017. The plaintiffs' vehicles were impounded in 2011, well before this date, and at that point the County and City could not have had the requisite specific intent to violate the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alviso v.

After giving the matter further consideration, I am now of the view that we reached the right result in\n   <em>\n    Brewster\n   </em>\n   but for the wrong reason. California Vehicle Code \u00a7 14602.6 is constitutionally deficient not because it runs afoul of the Fourth Amendment, as we held in\n   <em>\n    Brewster\n   </em>\n   , but because the post-seizure hearing it affords does not comply with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Fourth Amendment does, of course, have something to say about the government's ability to seize your car without a warrant and keep it for 30 days. As we noted in\n   <em>\n    Brewster\n   </em>\n   , however, the initial warrantless seizure authorized under \u00a7 14602.6 will seldom raise any Fourth Amendment concerns on its own.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276614\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1194/#p1196\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276614\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1194/#p1196\">\n    at 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The statute is typically invoked when a police officer pulls a car over and arrests the driver for driving on a suspended or revoked license, or without having been licensed at all. In that scenario, the officer will usually be justified in seizing the vehicle without a warrant under the community caretaking exception because the vehicle must be removed from the roadway and the driver obviously can't drive it back home himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The doctrinal leap we took in\n   <em>\n    Brewster\n   </em>\n   was to hold that a vehicle remains \"seized,\" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, even after being impounded. That meant the city had to offer a valid Fourth Amendment justification both for its decision to impound the vehicle in the first place and for its continued retention of the vehicle without a warrant. We held that the community caretaking exception justified the initial warrantless impoundment, but once the vehicle had been removed from the roadway, that exception no longer sufficed. The city therefore had to offer a \"new justification\" for holding onto the vehicle, which it simply failed to do.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276614\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1194/#p1196\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276614\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1194/#p1196\">\n    at 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   I no longer view\n   <em>\n    Brewster\n   </em>\n   's holding that the Fourth Amendment seizure continued throughout the 30-day impoundment period as correct. Under certain circumstances, the concept of a continuing seizure may fairly describe the government's retention of property. But a seizure requires \"some meaningful interference with an individual's possessory interests in that property.\"\n   <em>\n    Soldal v. Cook County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11924920\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/56/#p61\">\n    506 U.S. 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 61,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11924920,6520087\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/113/538/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11924920\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/56/#p61\">\n    121 L.Ed.2d 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). So if you don't have a valid possessory interest in property, it can't be seized from you for Fourth Amendment purposes. In my view, that is the effect of \u00a7 14602.6 : It deprives the owner of a valid possessory interest in her vehicle by authorizing a temporary 30-day civil forfeiture of that interest. A valid forfeiture of one's possessory interest in property ends a Fourth Amendment seizure, just as a criminal conviction ends a Fourth Amendment seizure of the person.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manuel v. City of Joliet\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609962\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/911/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 920 n.8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609962\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/911/\">\n    197 L.Ed.2d 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). Once the forfeiture imposed by \u00a7 14602.6 is upheld, the government does not need to obtain a warrant authorizing the continued retention of the vehicle. The forfeiture determination itself grants such authorization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The real question, which we did not address in\n   <em>\n    Brewster\n   </em>\n   , is whether the forfeiture authorized by \u00a7 14602.6 is constitutionally valid.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276614\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/859/1194/#p1196\">\n    859 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1196 n.2, 1197. I think it is. Deterring unlawful conduct is a permissible objective of forfeiture statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bennis v. Michigan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"324233\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/442/#p452\">\n    516 U.S. 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 452,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"324233\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/442/#p452\">\n    116 S.Ct. 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"324233\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/442/#p452\">\n    134 L.Ed.2d 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). Section 14602.6 is designed to deter those who are caught driving without a license from engaging in that conduct again, and to\n   deter others who lack a valid license from driving in the first place. A state legislature could rationally conclude that you will be less likely to drive without a license if you know that, in addition to any other penalties that may be imposed, you can lose possession of your car for 30 days if you get caught.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Section 14602.6 appears to withstand the principal constitutional objections that might be interposed. There is a tight nexus between the property to be forfeited and the underlying wrongdoing involved (driving without a valid license), so we need not confront the outer limits of the government's authority to impound property as a means of deterring misconduct unrelated to that property. The nature of the deprivation (dispossession for 30 days) is not disproportionate to the seriousness of the underlying wrongdoing, so we don't face the concerns that might be raised if the statute authorized permanent forfeiture of title to the vehicle. And the statute has built-in protections that allow \"innocent owners\" to reclaim their vehicles without having to suffer the 30-day impound.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2014602.6\">\n    Cal. Vehicle Code \u00a7 14602.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), (f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   If \u00a7 14602.6 clears these constitutional hurdles, no work remains for the Fourth Amendment to do. So long as there is probable cause to believe the vehicle is subject to forfeiture, it may be impounded without a warrant, whether or not the community caretaking exception applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Florida v. White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133490\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/559/#p561\">\n    526 U.S. 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 561,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133490\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/559/#p561\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133490\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/559/#p561\">\n    143 L.Ed.2d 748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999). Fourth Amendment concerns could arise if an owner were not afforded a prompt hearing at which to contest the validity of the temporary forfeiture, given the relatively brief impoundment period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Krimstock v. Kelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11437531\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/40/#p54\">\n    306 F.3d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 54 (2d Cir. 2002). But the statute addresses those concerns by requiring prompt notice to the owner and by providing the right to a hearing within two days of making the request.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2014602.6\">\n    Cal. Vehicle Code \u00a7\u00a7 14602.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), (b), 22852(b), (c). Because that time frame is sufficiently short, little would be accomplished by requiring the government to obtain a warrant pending the final forfeiture decision. The owner will know within a matter of days whether the vehicle is subject to forfeiture, and that determination will be made following an adversarial hearing at which she can contest the government's evidentiary showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Section 14602.6 does suffer from one constitutional deficiency, which I alluded to at the outset. When the government seeks to obtain property through forfeiture, it must comply not only with the demands of the Fourth Amendment but also with those of the Due Process Clause.\n   <em>\n    United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230623\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/43/#p52\">\n    510 U.S. 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 52,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230623\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/43/#p52\">\n    114 S.Ct. 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230623\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/43/#p52\">\n    126 L.Ed.2d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). Section 14602.6 provides the right to a prompt hearing to contest the impoundment, but this hearing may be conducted by an officer or employee of the police department responsible for seizing the vehicle.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022852\">\n    Cal. Vehicle Code \u00a7 22852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Due process does not demand a full-blown jury trial in this context, but it surely entitles an owner to a hearing before a neutral decision-maker.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goldberg v. Kelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052726\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/254/#p271\">\n    397 U.S. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 271,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052726\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/254/#p271\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052726\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/254/#p271\">\n    25 L.Ed.2d 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970). The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Brewster\n   </em>\n   did not receive such a hearing, and neither did the plaintiffs in this case. That fact alone renders the impoundment of their vehicles unlawful.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
