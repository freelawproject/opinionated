Thomas Anthony Hammond contends that the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender, in part based on his prior conviction for that offense. Among other things, Hammond argues that the crime of first-degree robbery under New York law does not qualify as a crime of violence under the Guidelines' \"force clause.\" We disagree and, upon our review, conclude that New York statutory robbery, irrespective of the degree of the offense, is a crime of violence, because it necessarily involves the \"use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1). Accordingly, we affirm the district court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2017, Hammond pleaded guilty to one count of attempted bank robbery and one count of bank robbery, both in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Before sentencing, the probation officer prepared a presentence report, which included a summary of Hammond's criminal history. The criminal history showed that Hammond previously had been convicted of North Carolina common law robbery, and of New York first-degree robbery, in violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7 160.15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on these convictions, the probation officer recommended that the district court impose the career offender sentencing enhancement under Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1(a). Applying this enhancement, the probation officer calculated a Guidelines range of between 151 and 188 months' imprisonment. Hammond contends that without the career offender enhancement, his advisory sentencing range would have been between 84 and 105 months' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Hammond objected to his classification as a career offender, arguing that his conviction for New York first-degree robbery did not qualify as a crime of violence under the Guidelines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court rejected\n   Hammond's argument and imposed a sentence of 168 months' imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release. Hammond now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hammond advances the same argument on appeal that he raised in the district court. Thus, we consider whether the offense of New York first-degree robbery, in violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7 160.15, qualifies as a crime of violence within the meaning of Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1. This question presents an issue of law, which we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jenkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085129\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/680/#p682\">\n    631 F.3d 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 682 (4th Cir. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before addressing Hammond's arguments, we begin with an overview of the Guidelines' career offender enhancement. Under Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1, a defendant qualifies as a career offender if he has \"at least two prior felony convictions for either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a)(3). A \"crime of violence\" is defined as any state or federal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another [the force clause], or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (2) is murder, voluntary manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, a forcible sex offense, robbery, arson, extortion or the use or unlawful possession of a firearm ... or explosive material [the enumerated offense clause].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085129\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/680/#p682\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4B1.2(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We focus our analysis on the force clause of subparagraph (1) set forth above, because that clause provides the most direct route to answering the question before us. To determine whether a conviction for a state offense is a crime of violence under the force clause, we apply the \"categorical approach.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gardner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5917339\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/793/#p802\">\n    823 F.3d 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 802 (4th Cir. 2016). Under that approach, the state crime necessarily must have as an element the \"use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\" to qualify as a crime of violence under the force clause. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1). The Supreme Court has interpreted the term \"physical force\" as \"\n   <em>\n    violent\n   </em>\n   force-that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    559 U.S. 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 140,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581927,12446767\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1265/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581927,12446767\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1265/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). If the elements of the state offense can be satisfied by \"de minimis physical contact,\" the offense does not qualify categorically as a crime of violence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To determine the \"minimum conduct\" required for the state offense, this Court must ensure that there is \"a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that a state would actually punish that conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

With this framework in mind, we turn to consider Hammond's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Hammond raises two arguments in support of his contention that New York first-degree\n   robbery does not constitute a crime of violence. He contends (1) that New York robbery, regardless of degree, does not include as an element the use of violent physical force as defined by the Supreme Court, and (2) that New York first-degree robbery in particular can be committed without the use of any force. We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Hammond first argues that New York robbery does not qualify categorically as a crime of violence, because the offense does not require the use of violent physical force \"capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    559 U.S. at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581927,12446767\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1265/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He contends that New York courts have interpreted New York's robbery statutes to require only de minimis force, such as \"mere snatching.\" We disagree with Hammond's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the outset, we note that this Court, in an unpublished decision, recently concluded that New York second- and third-degree robbery constitute violent felonies under the identically-worded force clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\n   <em>\n    United States v.
