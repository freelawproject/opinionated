B &amp; B manufactures fasteners for the aerospace industry, while Hargis manufactures fasteners for use in the construction trade. Although there are obvious differences between space shuttles and A-frame buildings, both aerospace and construction engineers prefer fasteners that seal things tightly. Accordingly, both B &amp; B and Hargis want their wares associated with tight seals. A feud of nearly two decades has sprung from this seemingly commonplace set of facts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   In 1993 B &amp; B registered SEALTIGHT for \"threaded or unthreaded metal fasteners and other related hardwar[e]; namely, self-sealing nuts, bolts, screws, rivets and washers, all having a captive o-ring, for use in the aerospace industry.\" In 1996, Hargis sought to register SEALTITE for \"self-piercing and self-drilling metal screws for use in the manufacture of metal and post-frame buildings.\" B &amp; B opposed Hargis' registration because, although the two companies sell different products, it believes that SEALTITE is confusingly similar to SEALTIGHT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The twists and turns in the SEALTIGHT versus SEALTITE controversy are labyrinthine. The question whether either of these marks should be registered, and if so, which one, has bounced around within the [Patent and Trademark Office] for about two decades; related infringement litigation has been before the Eighth Circuit three times; and two separate juries have been empaneled and returned verdicts. The full story could fill a long, unhappy book.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    B&amp;B Hardware, Inc. v.

We affirmed.\n   <em>\n    Hargis I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11090202\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/252/1010/\">\n    252 F.3d at 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In June 2006, B&amp;B filed for incontestability status for its trademark with the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). The PTO issued a Notice of Acknowledgment in September 2006, concluding that B&amp;B's affidavit of incontestability met the statutory requirements. Incontestability provided B&amp;B with a presumption that its \"Sealtight\" mark carried secondary meaning. This constituted a significant intervening factual change from the 2000 jury trial, which resulted in the finding that \"Sealtight\" was merely descriptive, and B&amp;B could thus escape the collateral estoppel bar that the 2000 jury verdict imposed on the issue of secondary meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hargis III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3660508\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/383/\">\n    569 F.3d at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Immediately after its 2006 filing for incontestability, B&amp;B brought suit against Hargis again for trademark infringement, unfair competition, trademark dilution, and false designation of origin. The case currently before us arises out of this second suit. However, only the period between June 2006, when B&amp;B overcame collateral estoppel by filing for incontestability,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dist. Ct.

Hargis Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Hargis II\n   </em>\n   ), No. 4:06CV01654 SWW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202711647\">\n    2007 WL 2711647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12-13 (E.D. Ark. Sept. 13, 2007). B&amp;B appealed and this Court reversed and remanded, finding that incontestability was a significant factual change precluding application of collateral estoppel.\n   <em>\n    Hargis III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3660508\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/383/\">\n    569 F.3d at 389-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court then conducted a jury trial and the jury found against B&amp;B on all claims.\n   <em>\n    B&amp;B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Hargis IV\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4217327\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/736/1212/#p1214\">\n    736 F. Supp. 2d 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1214 (E.D. Ark. 2010). B&amp;B again appealed to this Court, which upheld the jury's verdict.\n   <em>\n    Hargis V\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3570883\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/1020/\">\n    716 F.3d at 1022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . B&amp;B then appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which found that the district court should have given preclusive effect to a decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) finding that there was a likelihood of confusion between \"Sealtight\" and \"Sealtite.\"\n   <em>\n    Hargis VI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587403\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1293/#p1301\">\n    135 S. Ct. at 1299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court remanded the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We subsequently vacated the district court's judgment and remanded.\n   <em>\n    B&amp;B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Hargis VII\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340877\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/800/427/#p427\">\n    800 F.3d 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 427 (8th Cir. 2015) (per curiam). Following our remand, the case proceeded in the district court on B&amp;B's claim that Hargis committed trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, false designation of origin, and unfair competition. B&amp;B sought disgorgement of Hargis's profits beginning in June 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Hargis counterclaimed for false advertising and false designation of origin. A five-day jury trial ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At trial, Hargis argued that B&amp;B obtained its incontestability status through fraud, presenting evidence that B&amp;B failed to inform the PTO about the 2000 jury verdict that B&amp;B's \"Sealtight\" mark was merely descriptive. Hargis also presented evidence that all of its profits stemmed from its personal relationships with its customers, exemplary customer service, and the quality of its products, rather than the \"Sealtite\" name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the close of evidence, B&amp;B moved for judgment as a matter of law on Hargis's counterclaims but failed to do so on its own claims. The jury found that Hargis infringed on B&amp;B's trademark but did not do so willfully, awarded B&amp;B none of Hargis's profits, and found for Hargis on its counterclaims and its affirmative defense of fraud. Based on the jury's fraud finding, the district court found that \"Sealtight\" was not entitled to incontestability status, and that B&amp;B therefore had not pled an intervening change in circumstances allowing it to relitigate claims raised in the 2000 jury trial. The district court therefore entered judgment for Hargis on all claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In determining that B&amp;B was not entitled to any of Hargis's profits, the district court recognized that, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201117\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), it retained discretion to reduce or increase the jury's profit award or to award profits itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Masters v. UHS of Del., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085874\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/464/#p474\">\n    631 F.3d 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 474-75 (8th Cir. 2011). Rather than basing its ruling solely on the jury's refusal to award profits, it treated that refusal as advisory, considering it together with the six factors used by the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Circuits in balancing the equities.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Synergistic Int'l, LLC v. Korman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5666902\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/470/162/#p175\">\n    470 F.3d 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 175 (4th Cir. 2006). The district court concluded that, because B&amp;B did not lose sales, Hargis did not represent that its products were B&amp;B's products, and Hargis's infringement was not willful, it would be inequitable to award B&amp;B any of Hargis's profits. It therefore refused to disgorge Hargis of its profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Hargis then filed a motion seeking attorneys' fees, nontaxable litigation costs, and an injunction as sanctions against B&amp;B. The district court awarded Hargis taxable litigation costs but otherwise denied Hargis's motion, finding that protracted litigation, on its own, does not make a case an exceptional case justifying fee-shifting under the Lanham Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B&amp;B appeals to this Court, arguing (1) the jury verdict finding fraud and a lack of willfulness was clearly erroneous; and (2) the district court abused its discretion in refusing to disgorge Hargis of its profits. On cross-appeal, Hargis argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying Hargis's motion for fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   B&amp;B challenges the jury's fraud finding, arguing that the verdict was not supported by sufficient evidence. Because B&amp;B failed to file a Rule 50(b) motion as to the sufficiency of the evidence at the close of evidence, \"our review is strictly limited. We cannot test the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury's verdict beyond application of the 'plain error' doctrine in order to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Karjala v.

However, in its August 28, 2007 decision refusing to register Hargis's \"Sealtite\" mark, the TTAB, a separate division of the PTO from that which handles incontestability affidavits, explicitly stated that the 2000 jury verdict was an adverse decision that extinguished B&amp;B's common-law rights in the \"Sealtight\" name.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    B&amp;B Hardware, Inc. v.

It claims that the Lanham Act prevents any review of descriptiveness after the mark has become incontestable. However, it fails to acknowledge that its mark was not incontestable in 2000. It also points out that no governmental body attempted to cancel the \"Sealtight\" mark's registration after the 2000 trial, but it cites no authority implying that this failure indicates the 2000 district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In any event, we find that the 2000 district court had jurisdiction to consider the issue of secondary meaning. B&amp;B does not dispute that, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the 2000 court had jurisdiction over its trademark infringement claim, which arose under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given this unrefuted fact, B&amp;B offers nothing to support its claim that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction in that proceeding, and we therefore reject its contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We further agree with the district court that, without incontestability, B&amp;B is collaterally estopped from pursuing its claims. There is no dispute that B&amp;B was a party to the 2000 litigation. In\n   <em>\n    Hargis III\n   </em>\n   , we explicitly noted that the 2000 jury verdict considered secondary meaning-the same issue in question here.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3660508\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/383/\">\n    569 F.3d at 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We also noted that the 2000 district court's decision-a valid and final judgment-hinged solely on the jury's finding that the \"Sealtight\" mark had no secondary meaning.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3660508\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/383/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We thus found there that the elements of collateral estoppel were satisfied as to the issue of secondary meaning, and we again so conclude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   There, however, we refused to apply collateral estoppel because B&amp;B had\n   shown an intervening factual change-incontestability-that allowed it to overcome issue preclusion on secondary meaning.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3660508\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/383/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3660508\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/383/\">\n    at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There, we referenced with approval the Fifth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Test Masters Educational Services v.

Here, other than incontestability and the passage of time, B&amp;B has failed to allege\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   intervening factual change that would allow it to escape the application of collateral estoppel. Absent any evidence that B&amp;B's mark has developed secondary meaning since the 2000 trial, we decline to allow B&amp;B to relitigate that issue.
