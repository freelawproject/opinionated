He alleges that they failed to protect him from other prisoners and punitively detained him in the FDC's Special Housing Unit (\"SHU\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The District Court granted qualified immunity to some defendants on some claims, but denied summary judgment on Bistrian's constitutional claims, which were brought pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    403 U.S. 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    29 L.Ed.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971). For the reasons that follow, we will affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   From August 2005 until March 2008, Bistrian was a detainee at the FDC while he awaited trial, was tried, convicted, and finally sentenced on charges related to wire fraud. During that time, prison officials placed him in the SHU on four occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   They first placed him in the SHU on November 18, 2005, following allegations that he had violated telephone use rules. He stayed there for approximately seven\n   weeks, until January 9, 2006. Three weeks later, on January 25, 2006, prison officials again put him in the SHU, this time because of \"[s]ecurity [c]oncerns.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (App. at 94.) He remained there for nearly a year, from January 25, 2006, to December 8, 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   During that second round of intensive detention, Bistrian earned some privileges and became an orderly, a prison job that provided him the opportunity to interact with other inmates housed in the SHU. Knowing of Bistrian's access to others in the SHU, a fellow inmate, Steven Northington, asked him to pass notes between inmates. In particular, Northington wanted to facilitate communication for another prisoner, his friend and criminal confederate Kaboni Savage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bistrian told Officers Gibbs and Bowns of that request, rightfully believing they would be interested. That led to the formation of a surveillance operation in which Bistrian secretly passed inmate notes to prison officials. Prison officials photocopied the notes, and gave Bistrian the original to pass along. All went as planned until Bistrian accidentally gave a photocopy of a note, instead of the original, to an inmate, thereby tipping off the SHU's residents to Bistrian's cooperation with prison officials. After his cooperation became known, he received multiple threats and made prison officials aware of them, including defendants Bowns, Gibbs, Jezior, and Warden Levi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Despite their knowledge of the threats against Bistrian, on June 30, 2006, prison officials placed him in the recreation yard where Northington and two other inmates were also present. In what, for ease of reference, we will call \"the Northington attack,\" Northington and the two others proceeded to brutally beat Bistrian. Jezior and other officials yelled for the attack to stop, but they did not enter the yard. Instead, they waited until a larger number of guards (12 to 15) were present to intervene. By then, the damage was done. Bistrian suffered severe physical and psychological injuries, and that is the basis of his claim under the Fifth Amendment that the prison officials failed to protect him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In December 2006, less than a month after Bistrian had completed his nearly yearlong second detention, prison officials again placed him in the SHU. They cited his safety as the reason for doing so. According to the defendants, there had been death threats against him. Shortly after that placement, Bistrian's counsel sent a letter to Warden Levi asking why his client was there. The Warden replied that records indicated it was due to an investigation. Bistrian was released two days after that response, having spent approximately a month in the SHU.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In August 2007, at a sentencing hearing, Bistrian objected to his treatment in prison and the time and circumstances of his administrative detentions. After the hearing, the government provided Bistrian's\n   counsel with evidence of the telephone infractions they relied on as the justification for Bistrian's confinement in the SHU. That prompted an email exchange in which Bistrian's counsel asked for an explanation of how Bistrian had violated prison policies. Counsel for the government promptly forwarded that request to the FDC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Two days after Bistrian's counsel pressed for an explanation, Bistrian was put in the SHU for the fourth time. Officer Jezior wrote an incident report stating that Bistrian had again violated telephone use rules.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Using available administrative procedures, Bistrian contested the placement but his grievance and appeal were denied. Bistrian alleges that, after Warden Levi denied the appeal, the Warden said Bistrian \"would never see the light of day again.\" (App. at 22 (citation omitted).) Bistrian was in the SHU for about three months, until early December 2007. That final stay forms the basis of his First Amendment retaliation claim and his Fifth Amendment punitive detention claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Bistrian was ultimately sentenced to 57 months' imprisonment and sent to a correctional facility in New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This lawsuit began over a decade ago. The operative pleading is an amended complaint asserting various First, Fifth, and Eighth Amendment claims against FDC prison officials and medical staff, and claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\") against the United States. The defendants filed motions to dismiss all nineteen claims in the amended complaint, saying there had been a failure to exhaust administrative remedies and a failure to plead sufficient facts to overcome the defense of qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    Bistrian v. Levi\n   </em>\n   , Civ.

The District Court granted those motions in part.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. It dismissed thirteen claims but found that six were sufficiently pled to survive dismissal, including Bistrian's\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims for violations of the First Amendment and Fifth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The defendants involved in this appeal, with others, then asked us to review the District Court's denial of their assertion of qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    Bistrian v.

We affirmed in part, but dismissed the claims against some defendants and limited the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims to a Fifth Amendment procedural due process claim, a Fifth Amendment substantive due process claim for failure to protect and another for punitive detention, and a First Amendment claim for retaliation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5865162\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/352/#p364\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5865162\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/352/#p364\">\n    at 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The prisoner-on-prisoner violence is not a new context for\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims, and no special factors counsel against allowing a failure-to-protect cause of action. We will therefore affirm the District Court's denial of summary judgment with respect to that claim. We must, however, reverse the denial of summary judgment on Bistrian's claims for punitive detention and retaliation because they are novel and special factors counsel against extending\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   coverage to such claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Waiver\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Before turning to the merits, though, there is a preliminary question: whether the defendants waived their arguments against the availability of\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   is the short-hand name given to causes of action against federal officials for alleged constitutional violations. In the eponymous case, the Supreme Court considered whether a \"violation of [the Fourth Amendment] by a federal agent acting under color of his authority gives rise to a cause of action for damages consequent upon his unconstitutional conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    403 U.S. at 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court held that such a claim was cognizable and that the plaintiff was \"entitled to recover money damages for any injuries he has suffered as a result of the agents' violation of the [Fourth] Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    at 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We conclude, however, that the cognizability of the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims is a question inherent in the qualified immunity defenses.

Here, Bistrian alleges that his fourth placement in the SHU was punishment for complaining about his treatment by prison officials. Like a punitive detention claim, retaliation claims like this one are grounded in administrative detention decisions. Whether to place an inmate in more restrictive detention involves real-time and often difficult judgment calls about disciplining inmates, maintaining order, and promoting prison officials' safety and security.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sewell v.

That strongly counsels restraint, just as in the punitive-detention context. For the same reasons we reject an extension of\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   to that latter context, we reject it here as well. Such claims must be approached \"with skepticism and particular care\" because they are \"easily fabricated and ... may cause unwarranted judicial interference with prison administration.\"\n   <em>\n    Holmes v.
