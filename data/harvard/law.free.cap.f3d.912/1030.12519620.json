Even after his release from prison, he continued to assert his innocence. Thirty-eight years after his conviction, the governor of Illinois pardoned Savory. Nearly two years after the pardon, Savory filed a civil rights suit against the City of Peoria (\"City\") and a number of Peoria police officers alleging that they framed him. The district court dismissed the suit as untimely. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In January 1977, Peoria police officers arrested fourteen-year-old Savory for the rape and murder of nineteen-year-old\n   Connie Cooper and the murder of her fourteen-year-old brother, James Robinson. According to Savory's complaint, which we must credit when assessing a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), these officers subjected Savory to an abusive thirty-one hour interrogation over a two-day period.\n   <em>\n    Tobey v. Chibucos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516977\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/634/#p645\">\n    890 F.3d 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 645 (7th Cir. 2018) (in reviewing a district court's decision on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), we accept as true all well-pleaded facts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party). The officers fabricated evidence, wrongfully coerced a false confession from the teen, suppressed and destroyed evidence that would have exonerated him, fabricated incriminating statements from alleged witnesses, and ignored ample evidence pointing to other suspects. No legitimate evidence implicated Savory. His arrest, prosecution and conviction were based entirely on the officers' fabricated evidence and illegally extracted false confession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Savory was tried as an adult in 1977 and convicted of first degree murder. After that conviction was overturned on appeal, he was convicted again in 1981. He was sentenced to a term of forty to eighty years in prison. After Savory exhausted direct appeals and post-conviction remedies in state court, he unsuccessfully sought federal habeas corpus relief. He repeatedly petitioned for clemency and also sought DNA testing. After thirty years in prison, he was paroled in December 2006. Five years later, in December 2011, the governor of Illinois commuted the remainder of Savory's sentence. That action terminated his parole (and therefore his custody) but left his conviction intact. On January 12, 2015, the governor issued a pardon that \"acquitted and discharged\" Savory's conviction. On January 11, 2017, less than two years after the pardon, Savory filed suit against the City and the police officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   That suit asserted six claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , five against the individual defendants and one against the City. The five counts against the individual defendants alleged that they: (1) coerced a false confession from Savory in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments; (2) coerced a false confession from Savory in violation of his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment; (3) maliciously prosecuted Savory, depriving him of liberty without probable cause in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments; (4) violated his right to be free of involuntary confinement and servitude under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments; and (5) failed to intervene as their fellow officers violated Savory's civil rights. In the sixth count, Savory alleged that the City's unlawful policies, practices and customs led to his wrongful conviction and imprisonment in violation of section 1983. Savory also brought state law claims against the defendants but later conceded that those claims were untimely under the state's one-year statute of limitations. Those claims are not part of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendants moved to dismiss Savory's section 1983 claims on several grounds but the district court addressed only one: the statute of limitations. The court recognized that, under\n   <em>\n    Heck v. Humphrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    512 U.S. 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    129 L.Ed.2d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994), Savory could not bring his section 1983 claims unless and until he obtained a favorable termination of a challenge to his conviction. The parties agreed that the relevant statute of limitations required Savory to bring his claims within two years of accrual but the parties disagreed on when the\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   bar lifted. Savory asserted that his claims did not accrue until he received a pardon from the Illinois governor on January 12, 2015, which would make his January 11, 2017 suit timely. The defendants asserted that the\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   bar lifted when Savory's parole was terminated\n   on December 6, 2011, making his claims untimely. The district court concluded that the defendants had the better view of\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   and dismissed the claims with prejudice. Savory appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal on statute of limitations grounds.\n   <em>\n    Tobey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516977\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/634/#p645\">\n    890 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   645 ;\n   <em>\n    Amin Ijbara Equity Corp. v.

Our analysis begins and ends with\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   , the controlling case.\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   addressed whether and when a state prisoner may challenge the constitutionality of his conviction in a suit for damages under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    512 U.S. at 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While Heck was serving a fifteen-year sentence for manslaughter, he brought a section 1983 action against two prosecutors and a state police inspector asserting that they engaged in an unlawful investigation that led to his arrest, that they knowingly destroyed exculpatory evidence, and that they caused an unlawful voice identification procedure to be used at his trial.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    512 U.S. at 478-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court noted that such a case lies at the intersection of federal prisoner litigation under section 1983 and the federal habeas corpus statute.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    512 U.S. at 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In analyzing the claim, the Court first found that Heck's section 1983 claim most closely resembled the common law tort of malicious prosecution, which allows damages for confinement imposed pursuant to legal process, including compensation for arrest and imprisonment, discomfort or injury to health, and loss of time and deprivation of society.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    512 U.S. at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . An element that must be pleaded and proved in a malicious prosecution case is termination of the prior criminal proceeding in favor of the accused. This requirement avoids creating two conflicting resolutions arising out of the same transaction, steering clear of parallel litigation over the issue of guilt. The requirement also prevents a convicted criminal from collaterally attacking the conviction through a civil suit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   We think the hoary principle that civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments applies to \u00a7 1983 damages actions that necessarily require the plaintiff to prove the unlawfulness of his conviction or confinement, just as it has always applied to actions for malicious prosecution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   We hold that, in order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court's issuance of a writ of habeas corpus,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A claim for damages bearing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that has\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   been so invalidated is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. Thus, when a state prisoner seeks damages in a \u00a7 1983 suit, the district court must consider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated. But if the district court determines that the plaintiff's action, even if successful, will\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment against the plaintiff, the action should be allowed to proceed, in the absence of some other bar to the suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    512 U.S. at 486-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes omitted; emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court made pellucid the broad consequences of its plainly stated rule:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   We do not engraft an exhaustion requirement upon \u00a7 1983, but rather deny the existence of a cause of action. Even a prisoner who has fully exhausted available state remedies has no cause of action under \u00a7 1983 unless and until the conviction or sentence is reversed, expunged, invalidated, or impugned by the grant of a writ of habeas corpus.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    512 U.S. at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Returning to its comparison to common law torts, the Court concluded that, just as a claim for malicious prosecution does not accrue until the criminal proceedings have terminated in the plaintiff's favor, \"so also a \u00a7 1983 cause of action for damages attributable to an unconstitutional conviction or sentence does not accrue until the conviction or sentence has been invalidated.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    512 U.S. at 489-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wallace v.

Indeed, Savory's claims largely echo Heck's complaint, asserting the suppression of exculpatory evidence and the fabrication of false evidence in order to effect a wrongful conviction. The statute of limitations for such claims in Illinois is two years.\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   supplies the rule for accrual of the claim. Because Savory's claims \"would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence,\" his section 1983 claims could not accrue until \"the conviction or sentence ha[d] been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court's issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\"\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    512 U.S. at 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In Savory's case, that occurred on January 12, 2015, when the governor of Illinois pardoned him. Until that moment, his conviction was intact and he had no cause of action under section 1983.\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    512 U.S. at 489-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . His January 11, 2017 lawsuit was therefore timely under\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   , and we must reverse the district court's judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We said that our analysis began and ended with\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   but for the sake of clarity, we must address the defendant's arguments that concurring and dissenting opinions of certain Supreme Court justices cobbled together into a seeming majority or the opinions of this court may somehow override the prime directive of\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   . The misunderstanding that led to the erroneous result here originated in a concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   filed by Justice Souter and joined by Justices Blackmun, Stevens and O'Connor. In that concurrence, Justice Souter agreed that reference to the common law tort of malicious prosecution was a useful starting point but he asserted that it could not alone provide the answer to the conundrum found at the intersection between section 1983 and the federal habeas statute. Ultimately, Justice Souter suggested a slightly different rule that he submitted would avoid any collision between section 1983 and the habeas statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A state prisoner may seek federal-court \u00a7 1983 damages for unconstitutional conviction or confinement, but only if he has previously established the unlawfulness of his conviction or confinement, as\n   on appeal or on habeas. This has the effect of requiring a state prisoner challenging the lawfulness of his confinement to follow habeas's rules before seeking \u00a7 1983 damages for unlawful confinement in federal court[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    512 U.S. at 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Souter, J., concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For persons\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   in custody for the purposes of the habeas statute, \"people who were merely fined, for example, or who have completed short terms of imprisonment, probation, or parole, or who discover (through no fault of their own) a constitutional violation after full expiration of their sentences,\" there would be no requirement to show \"the prior invalidation of their convictions or sentences in order to obtain \u00a7 1983 damages for unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment\" because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   the result would be to deny any federal forum for claiming a deprivation of federal rights to those who cannot first obtain a favorable state ruling.

Read out of context, we understand how this passage and other passages in\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   confused the issue in the district court.

But\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   itself rejected that position and\n   <em>\n    Muhammad\n   </em>\n   made clear that the Court had not yet had an occasion to settle the minority views expressed in\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Neither\n   <em>\n    Burd\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Whitfield\n   </em>\n   support a contrary result.

Whitfield, in contrast, is arguing that the hearings should never have taken place at all, because they were acts of retaliation for his exercise of rights protected by the First Amendment. He has no quarrel with the procedures used in the prison disciplinary system. He could just as well be saying that a prison official maliciously calculated an improper release date, or \"lost\" the order authorizing his release in retaliation for protected activity. In short, the essence of Whitfield's complaint is the link between retaliation and his delayed release; the fact that disciplinary proceedings were the mechanism is not essential.\n   <em>\n    Balisok\n   </em>\n   also took care to be precise, when it held that the petitioner's claim for prospective injunctive relief could go forward under section 1983, since it did not necessarily imply anything about the loss of good-time credits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Whitfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277500\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/852/656/\">\n    852 F.3d at 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike Balisok, Whitfield was not seeking to set aside the result of a process but rather was claiming that the process should not have occurred at all. And unlike Burd, Whitfield had pursued collateral relief to the degree possible, until he was released from custody and the district court dismissed his habeas petition as moot. In\n   <em>\n    Whitfield\n   </em>\n   , we thus addressed a fact scenario at the outer edges of\n   <em>\n    Balisok\n   </em>\n   . It has little bearing on Savory's claims, which lie at the core of\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We end where we began:\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   controls the result here. Savory's claims, which necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction, did not accrue until he was pardoned by the governor of Illinois. His section 1983 action was therefore timely filed, and\n   we reverse the district court's judgment and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
