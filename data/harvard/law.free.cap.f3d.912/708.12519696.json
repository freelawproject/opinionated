When a prisoner filed this action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   after exhausting those remedies, the district court held the statute of limitations barred his suit. For the reasons that follow, we vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   William D. Battle, III, entered Wallens Ridge State Prison in Roanoke, Virginia, on December 6, 2013. After Battle completed the inmate intake process, corrections officers J. Ledford and R. Edwards (collectively, \"the officers\") escorted him to his assigned housing unit. A physical altercation between Battle and the officers occurred along the way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The officers subsequently filed a disciplinary report against Battle. They charged that Battle, who was restrained in handcuffs and leg irons during the transfer, used his body to push one of the officers into a food cart. According to the officers, they subdued Battle by \"plac[ing]\" him on the ground. Battle disputed this account before a prison hearing administrator. He denied shoving any officer and instead claimed that a pain in his ankle caused him to trip. He stated that the officers responded with unnecessary violence: pulling his hair and slamming his head into the concrete floor, causing \"bruising, lacerations, [and] swelling of the face.\" Battle requested that the hearing administrator examine video footage of the incident to corroborate his account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The hearing administrator declined to do so; instead, he simply credited the officers' version of the incident. After unsuccessfully appealing this decision to the prison's chief warden, Battle submitted a second appeal to the regional corrections\n   administrator. On February 27, 2014, the regional administrator rejected Battle's claim and issued a form confirming that Battle had reached the \"last level of appeal for this grievance.\" A total of 83 days had passed since the altercation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 11, 2016 - two years and 36 days after the altercation - Battle completed a postage request for a pro se \u00a7 1983 complaint alleging the officers used excessive force against him, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties accept that this postage request establishes the filing date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The officers moved for summary judgment, arguing that Battle filed outside Virginia's two-year statute of limitations applicable to \u00a7 1983 claims filed within the jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208.01-243\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 8.01-243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A) (setting limitations for personal injury actions). Battle countered that his complaint was timely because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\") required him to exhaust available administrative remedies before bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim. He argued that the 83 days during which he participated in the required exhaustion should be tolled under two Virginia statutes and federal law, thus extending his filing deadline to February 27, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The first state statute on which Battle relied, Va. Code \u00a7 8.01-229(K), suspends the statute of limitations for personal injury actions during criminal proceedings. The second, Va. Code \u00a7 8.01-195.3(7), governs actions brought under the Virginia Tort Claims Act (\"VTCA\") and tolls the time for filing a claim notice during the pendency of a prison grievance process. Additionally, Battle relied on federal equitable tolling law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court considered only Battle's argument as to Va. Code \u00a7 8.01-229(K). It held that statute could not be used to toll Battle's limitations period because a \"prison disciplinary proceeding is not a criminal prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    Battle v.

First, the VTCA operates on a tighter schedule than \u00a7 1983. It gives a plaintiff only one year to assert his rights, plus exhaustion. The VTCA's tolling provision would thus afford Battle one year and 83 days to take legal action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, and more fundamentally, the VTCA does not govern suits against state employees like the one Battle brings here. Rather, it provides a limited waiver of sovereign immunity that \"applies to one type of litigation, tort actions against the Commonwealth.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Ogunde v.

Under Virginia regulations - as implemented by state officials - as much as seven months could be subtracted from the period in which a prisoner can file a federal claim. This inevitable and indeterminate reduction in limitations would be wholly contingent on the efficiency of administrators and the complexity of the case. And as other circuits have noted and common sense suggests, a state's grievance process may extend beyond the state's regulatory deadlines.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

[I]t is certainly possible that a full three years could pass while an inmate exhausts his administrative remedies.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Far from advancing compensation, a no-tolling rule would amount to a penalty in which incarcerated persons - subject to severe state control and often limited in access to legal resources - would receive less time to vindicate \u00a7 1983 claims than all other litigants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Application of a no-tolling rule here would also fail to serve \u00a7 1983 's second primary goal - deterrence. Instead, this rule would enable state officials to shrink a prisoner's filing window and so limit his opportunity to bring a claim. In this way, a no-tolling rule would even create perverse incentives for prison commissioners to extend regulatory deadlines and for wardens and investigators to stall in their review of individual grievances, for doing so might limit government officials' legal exposure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Seventh Circuit has observed, no-tolling rules thus encourage prison officials to run out the clock and \"exploit the exhaustion requirement through indefinite delay in responding to grievances.\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

Of course, Virginia's rule would set a consistent two-year period between accrual and the limitations deadline across claims, furthering uniformity in this formalistic respect. But a rule that calculates the limitations deadline from the date of exhaustion is just as \"firmly defined\" and \"easily applied.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , 471 U.S. at 270,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201048\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/261/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Chardon v.

Moreover, a no-tolling rule would destroy any semblance of meaningful uniformity by creating dramatic claim-to-claim variance in the actual filing time available to different \u00a7 1983 litigants. Between prisoners, a no-tolling rule would afford a prisoner whose grievance was processed with delay less time to file than one whose grievance received speedy resolution. It would also create a disparity between those who are incarcerated and those who are not. For example, if the injuries claimed here had occurred in the context of an arrest rather than a prison escort, Battle would have been guaranteed a full two years to file his \u00a7 1983 suit, rather than the abbreviated period he would receive under a no-tolling rule. Such sweeping and arbitrary deviations in procedural rights would hardly advance a policy of uniformity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, we also cannot even say that accepting Virginia's no-tolling rule would foster federalism interests. This is so because the Commonwealth itself has adopted two statutes, the VTCA and VPLRA, that toll prisoner exhaustion periods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208.01-195.7\">\n    Va.

Although neither provides relief to prisoners seeking to bring \u00a7 1983 claims, their enactment demonstrates that Virginia otherwise has adopted a policy of tolling limitations while prison administrators review inmate claims. These statutes also make clear that an exhaustion reprieve does not conflict with Virginia's \"important and salutary purpose\" in strictly construing statutes of limitations, which is to protect defendants from \"unscrupulous plaintiffs who hoard evidence that supports their position while waiting for their prospective opponents to discard evidence that would help make a defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Burns v.

Administrative exhaustion does the opposite: it notifies defendants of a potential claim and allows both parties to develop a record before coming to court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In sum, because Virginia's no-tolling rule is inconsistent with federal law and policy, we cannot apply it here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Notwithstanding this analysis, the officers contend that Virginia's no-tolling rule necessarily comports with federal policies because a separate federal law - the PLRA - imposes the relevant exhaustion requirement. But by enacting the PLRA, Congress did not endorse such a no-tolling rule or diminish the interests underlying \u00a7 1983. To so conclude would be to overread the PLRA's silence on tolling, misread the PLRA's purpose, and ignore the text of \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1988.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   First, the silence in the PLRA.

Nothing in the text of the PLRA suggests that Congress sought to limit or modify \u00a7 1988(a) 's express command that borrowed provisions of state law must be consistent with important, long-recognized federal policies. The PLRA's legislative history is also silent as to \u00a7 1988(a) 's borrowing framework and the Court's interpretation thereof.

If defendants are correct that Virginia's administrative grievance process will never exceed 180 days from the time a grievance is filed, then Virginia's officials will never be subject to a tolling period exceeding seven months. A maximum extension of seven months will not prejudice these officials, given that the grievance process will put them on notice of a potential civil rights claim and allow the parties to develop a contemporaneous \"administrative record that clarifies the contours of the controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108401\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/516/#p524\">\n    534 U.S. at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108401\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/516/#p524\">\n    122 S.Ct. 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   A clear rule that tolls limitations during the grievance process also avoids any risk of \"loose[ning] the rule of law to whims about the adequacy of excuses, divergent responses to claims of hardship, and subjective notions of fair accommodation.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , 209 F.3d at 330.

Battle's limitations period must be tolled for the 83 days in which he exhausted his administrative remedies, as he was required to do before bringing suit. This satisfies the goals of \u00a7 1983 and the PLRA while also comporting with principles of equity: it gives Battle the benefit of the full limitations period applicable to other litigants, no more and no less.
