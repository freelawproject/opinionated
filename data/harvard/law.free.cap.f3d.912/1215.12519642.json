At sentencing, the district court applied a four-level increase to the total offense level, under United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2, because the court concluded that Defendant had been convicted of a \"felony\" under Washington law. The commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 defines \"felony\" as \"any federal, state, or local offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n.2. Defendant's conviction under Washington law carried a general statutory maximum term of imprisonment of five years. The district court faithfully applied our precedent and stopped its analysis there: Because the general statutory maximum exceeded one year, the enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2 applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   But the\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   maximum term that Defendant could have received was only six months, because Washington law imposed a mandatory sentencing range. Our precedent required the district court to disregard the maximum term that Defendant actually could have received under state law, in favor of the maximum term that Defendant theoretically could have received if different factual circumstances were present. Reviewing de novo the interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275482\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/1163/#p1165\">\n    870 F.3d 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1165 (9th Cir. 2017), we conclude that later Supreme Court decisions are clearly irreconcilable with our precedent on this point. Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2007, Defendant was convicted in Washington state court of possession of cocaine, in violation of Revised Code of Washington (\"RCW\") section 69.50.4013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant's conviction was for a \"class C felony punishable under chapter 9A.20 RCW.\" RCW \u00a7 69.50.4013(2). Section 9A.20.021 provided, in turn:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Unless a different maximum sentence for a classified felony is specifically established by a statute, no person convicted of a classified felony shall be punished by confinement or fine exceeding the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (c) For a class C felony, by confinement in a state correctional institution for five years, or by a fine in an amount fixed by the court of ten thousand dollars, or by both such confinement and fine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The general statutory maximum term of imprisonment for Defendant's crime was, therefore, five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   But, in addition to providing statutory maximum terms, Washington law specified\n   <em>\n    mandatory\n   </em>\n   limits on criminal sentences. RCW section 9.94A.505 provided, at the relevant time: \"Unless another term of confinement applies, the court\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   impose a sentence within the standard sentence range established in RCW 9.94A.510 or 9.94A.517.\" (Emphasis added.) Section 9.94A.517 applied to drug convictions and provided a two-dimensional \"[d]rug offense sentencing grid.\" The grid defined the\n   \"standard sentence range[ ]\" for an offense, depending on the \"seriousness level\" and the \"offender score.\" RCW \u00a7 9.94A.517(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant's crime had a \"seriousness level\" of \"I.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW \u00a7 9.94A.520 (\"The offense seriousness level is determined by the offense of conviction.\"); RCW \u00a7 9.94A.518 (defining convictions under section 69.50.4013 as having a seriousness level of \"I\"). The state court calculated Defendant's \"offender score\" as 0.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW \u00a7 9.94A.525 (providing detailed calculation of \"offender score\"). Turning back to the drug offense sentencing grid, the \"standard sentence range\" for seriousness level I and offender level 0 was \"0 to 6 months.\" RCW \u00a7 9.94A.517(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   If certain aggravating circumstances were present, the statutes contained adjustments to that range. RCW \u00a7 9.94A.533. For example, the presence or use of a firearm could have resulted in a standard range that exceeded the sentencing range described in the two-dimensional chart. RCW \u00a7 9.94A.533(3) - (5). But none of those circumstances was found to be present, so Defendant's final standard range was zero to six months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant's state criminal judgment summarized the available sentence in a tidy table reproduced below.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-20\">COUNT NO. OFFENDER SERIOUSNESS LEVEL STANDARD Plus Enhancements Total STANDARD MAXIMUM TERM SCORE RANGE (not for Firearm (F), RANGE (including including other deadly enhancements) enhancements) weapon finding (D), VUCSA (V) in a protected zone, Veh.

Washington law allowed the sentencing court to deviate from the standard range-but only if certain statutorily permitted findings were made. Section 9.94A.535, titled \"[d]epartures from the guidelines,\" provided that \"[t]he court may impose a sentence outside the standard sentence range for an offense if it finds, considering the purpose of this chapter, that there are substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence.\" It further provided that \"[w]henever a sentence outside the standard sentence range is imposed, the court shall set forth the reasons for its decision in written findings of fact and conclusions of law.\" RCW \u00a7 9.94A.535. (By contrast, sentences within the standard range could be imposed without special descriptions. RCW \u00a7 9.94A.530(1).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Critically, whether \"substantial and compelling reasons\" exist was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   an open-ended inquiry. The statute specified two\n   categories of aggravating circumstances that permitted departure from the guidelines: findings by the sentencing court and findings by a jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW \u00a7 9.94A.535(2) (listing the four aggravating circumstances that could be found by the sentencing court); RCW \u00a7 9.94A.535(3) (listing the 26 aggravating circumstances that could be found by the jury). If an aggravating circumstance was found, then the sentencing court could impose a sentence up to the statutory maximum term. RCW \u00a7 9.94A.537(6). But unless one of the statutorily specified aggravated circumstances was found, the sentencing court was\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to impose a sentence within the standard range. RCW \u00a7 9.94A.505.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In Defendant's case, as reflected on the face of the criminal judgment, neither the court nor the jury found an aggravating circumstance. Accordingly, Washington law required the sentencing court to impose a sentence within the final standard sentence range of zero to six months. The state court selected 30 days in jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Following that conviction, Defendant was removed from the United States. In 2016, the government indicted Defendant for unlawfully reentering the United States after having been removed, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Defendant pleaded guilty, without a plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At sentencing, the district court applied a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. The relevant Guideline\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   If, before the defendant was ordered deported or ordered removed from the United States for the first time, the defendant sustained-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (D) a conviction for any other felony offense (other than an illegal reentry offense), increase by 4 levels.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(2) (2016) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(D) (2015) (using similar text).

The court concluded that Defendant had sustained a felony conviction in Washington because the statutory maximum term of imprisonment for the drug conviction was five years. The court sentenced Defendant to 24 months of imprisonment. Defendant timely appeals, challenging only the four-level enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We must decide whether Defendant's state conviction was a \"felony\" for purposes of the federal Sentencing Guideline. According to the government, the statutory maximum punishment for Defendant's state offense was five years, so he was convicted of an \"offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n.2. Defendant acknowledges the statutory maximum but argues that, because the maximum sentence that he\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   could have received was only six months, he was not convicted of an \"offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A number of years ago, we sided with the government's argument.

First, unlike the statutory question at issue there-what is the \"maximum term of imprisonment ... prescribed by law\"-the question at issue here is whether Defendant was convicted of an offense \"punishable\" by more than one year. \"Punishable\" suggests a realistic look at what a particular defendant actually could receive, whereas \"maximum term of imprisonment ... prescribed by law\" suggests a mechanistic examination of the highest possible term in the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Second, Washington law is now materially more restrictive than it was at the time of the relevant events in\n   <em>\n    Rodriquez\n   </em>\n   . Under Washington law when Defendant was convicted, the sentencing court could not deviate from the statutory sentencing range unless it found that one of four specific factual circumstances was present. It is plain from the state criminal judgment that the sentencing court did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   find any of those circumstances, so the sentencing court was bound by the statutory sentencing range. In other words, the top sentence of the guidelines range\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   the maximum possible\n   <em>\n    statutory\n   </em>\n   punishment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Therefore, the 'maximum term of imprisonment' that he could have received was [the maximum term defined by the statutory sentencing guidelines].\"). That distinction-between (as here) statutorily defined factual circumstances and (as in\n   <em>\n    Rodriquez\n   </em>\n   ) an open-ended inquiry into any potential factual circumstance-is important because it defines the maximum possible punishment\n   <em>\n    assigned by the legislature\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519261\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/167/#p172\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519261\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/167/#p172\">\n    at 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that, to determine the maximum term of imprisonment under Tennessee law and\n   <em>\n    Rodriquez\n   </em>\n   , the court must look to the mandatory sentencing scheme, including the \"offender-based\" attributes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Our holding today accords with decisions by several sister circuits. Both the Eighth and Tenth Circuits have held that, when determining whether a Kansas offense is \"punishable\" by more than one year in prison, the Supreme Court's recent cases require an examination of the maximum sentence possible under the state's mandatory sentencing guidelines.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Similarly, the Fourth Circuit has held that, when determining whether a North Carolina offense is \"punishable\" by a prison term of more than one year, the Supreme Court's recent cases require the court to consider the maximum sentence possible under the state's mandatory sentencing guidelines.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Simmons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5714656\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/237/\">\n    649 F.3d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2011) (en banc).

Here, we are called on to decide whether Defendant's earlier offense was punishable under Washington law by more than one year, and we can no longer follow our earlier precedents that eschewed consideration of mandatory sentencing factors. As noted, Washington statutes prescribe a required sentencing range that binds the sentencing court. The sentencing range can be modified, or rendered inapplicable altogether, if but only if the judge or the jury makes certain factual findings. In this case, no such finding was made, so the court was bound to adhere to the statutory sentencing range. Defendant's offense-as actually prosecuted and adjudicated-was punishable under Washington law by no more than six months in prison. The district court therefore erred by concluding that his offense was punishable by more than one year in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    Sentence VACATED; REMANDED for resentencing.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    All citations to the RCW are to the version in effect in late 2007, when Defendant was indicted, convicted, and sentenced.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    In most cases, the statutory maximum term of imprisonment acted as an absolute cap on the adjustments that could apply to the standard sentence range.
