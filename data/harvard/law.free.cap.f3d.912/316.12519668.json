STRANCH, Circuit Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Some years ago, Plaintiff Innovation Ventures (Innovation), manufacturer of 5-Hour Energy, settled a lawsuit with the now-defunct Custom Nutrition Laboratories (Custom Nutrition) by entering into a noncompete agreement. When Nutrition Science Laboratories (NSL) subsequently purchased Custom Nutrition's assets, it did not abide by the restrictive covenants in that noncompete agreement. Innovation\n   initially sued Custom Nutrition; NSL; and Alan Jones, an officer of both Custom Nutrition and NSL, and later added a suit against a related company, Lily of the Desert (collectively, Defendants). After protracted litigation, Innovation was awarded nominal damages for its core breach of contract claim. For the reasons explained below, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   in part,\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   in part, and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The story of the parties' business relationship and its subsequent deterioration is lengthy and complex, and many of its details are hotly disputed. The district court ably described the relevant events in some detail in one of its summary judgment orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Innovation Ventures, LLC v. Custom Nutrition Labs., LLC\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Innovation Ventures II\n   </em>\n   ), No. 12-13850,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205679879\">\n    2015 WL 5679879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-7 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 28, 2015). The following is a summary of the critical facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Breakdown of the Manufacturing Relationship\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff Innovation is the maker and distributor of 5-Hour Energy, a well-known \"energy shot.\" In 2004, when Innovation was doing business as Living Essentials, it contracted with Custom Nutrition to manufacture and package 5-Hour Energy. Defendant Alan Jones was the President and CEO of Custom Nutrition at the time and had previously manufactured a two-ounce energy shot called \"Shotz.\" When Living Essentials ended the business relationship some years later-abruptly and unfairly, according to Defendants-Custom Nutrition had a surplus of ingredients and packaging. Jones used the surplus to continue manufacturing 5-Hour Energy for an unspecified amount of time after the relationship ended. Jones averred that his use of the surplus was mitigation of damages protected by the Uniform Commercial Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The companies then sued one another, with each claiming that the other had breached the contract, stolen trade secrets or intellectual property, and committed assorted torts. The protracted litigation came to an end almost two years later when, according to Jones, Custom Nutrition was on the verge of bankruptcy. The companies then entered into the Settlement Agreement that is at the center of this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Agreement contains an admission that Custom Nutrition and Jones \"wrongfully manufactured\" products bearing the 5-Hour Energy label, provides that Living Essentials owns the 5-Hour Energy formula, and forbids Custom Nutrition from manufacturing any new \"Energy Liquid\" that \"contain[s] anything in the Choline Family.\" According to Innovation, ingesting choline and related substances improves focus, and including them in the 5-Hour Energy recipe was a critical innovation. In return for these restrictions and admissions, Living Essentials paid Custom Nutrition $1.85 million. Specific provisions of the Settlement Agreement are discussed in more detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    NSL Purchases Custom Nutrition's Assets\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the words of the district court, Custom Nutrition was \"in a precarious financial condition,\" and the cash infusion was insufficient \"to enable the company to regain its financial footing.\"\n   <em>\n    Innovation Ventures II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205679879\">\n    2015 WL 5679879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Jones therefore spoke with Don Lovelace, owner of Lily of the Desert, about the possibility of Lily acquiring Custom Nutrition. Lovelace\n   instead agreed to purchase Custom Nutrition's assets and formed a new corporation, Defendant NSL, which entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Custom Nutrition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Asset Purchase Agreement provides that NSL acquires Custom Nutrition's listed assets but is not \"responsible for any liabilities, liens, security interests, claims, obligations, or encumbrances\" of Custom Nutrition except for those listed on an attached schedule-principally, debt Custom Nutrition owed to a bank. The Asset Purchase Agreement includes one reference to the Settlement Agreement: \"[T]he formula for energy drinks manufactured by [Custom Nutrition] and certain related trademark and copyright matters are limited by the settlement agreement between [Custom Nutrition] and Living Essentials.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the execution of the Asset Purchase Agreement, NSL went into the energy shot business. Jones became an employee of Lily and represented himself as President of NSL. NSL marketed itself as a continuation of Custom Nutrition and took on Custom Nutrition's old orders and customers. Over the next few years, NSL produced and distributed energy shots containing choline citrate, choline bitartrate, betaine, and alpha glycerolphosphorylcholine (alpha GPC). The first two substances are listed in the Choline Family definition in the Settlement Agreement; the latter two are, according to Innovation, chemical equivalents to choline covered by the definition's catch-all clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Proceedings Below\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Lead Case (Nos. 17-1734/1771)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Innovation sued Custom Nutrition,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   NSL, and Jones for breaching the Settlement Agreement and for tortious interference. Proceedings in the district court were protracted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After rejecting two motions to dismiss raising objections to personal jurisdiction, the district court addressed whether NSL had violated the Choline Family restrictions. It granted partial summary judgment to Innovation based on Defendants' admitted production of energy shots containing choline bitartrate and choline citrate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Innovation Ventures, LLC v. Custom Nutrition Labs., LLC\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Innovation Ventures I\n   </em>\n   ), No. 12-13850,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204829582\">\n    2014 WL 4829582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 29, 2014). The court concluded that whether betaine and alpha GPC (which Defendants also admitted to using) were included in the catch-all clause in the Choline Family definition was ambiguous as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3. A jury trial was convened to determine whether the two ingredients were included in the clause's scope; the jury concluded that both were.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The district court then turned to issues related to liability under the Settlement Agreement. The court concluded that: (1) NSL was bound by the Choline Family restrictions in the Settlement Agreement by virtue of their incorporation into the Asset Purchase Agreement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Innovation Ventures II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205679879\">\n    2015 WL 5679879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16-19 ; (2) Jones was bound by the Settlement Agreement because he signed it,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205679879\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *20-21 ; and (3) the twenty-year duration of the Settlement Agreement was unreasonable under Michigan law, necessitating reformation of the contract to last only three years,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *24-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After another round of briefing, the district court turned to the remaining issues, concluding that: (1) Innovation was not entitled to summary judgment as to liability on its main breach of contract claim because NSL's affirmative defense of laches\n   raised factual disputes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Innovation Ventures, LLC v. Custom Nutrition Labs., LLC\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Innovation Ventures III\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273709\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/696/#p704\">\n    256 F.Supp.3d 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 704 (E.D. Mich. 2017) ; and (2) Innovation's three proposed methodologies for calculating damages were impermissible, although Innovation could \"still recover lost profits under a non-patent-infringement specific method of calculation,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273709\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/696/#p704\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 710-12 &amp; n.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   That order was handed down about one month before the final jury trial was scheduled to begin. According to Innovation, the order left it \"without any theory of actual damages to present to the jury, leaving only the theory of nominal damages\" on which it could recover with regard to its primary claim. Count III, alleging that Jones breached the Settlement Agreement by cooperating with adverse parties, had yet to be resolved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273709\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/696/#p704\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273709\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/696/#p704\">\n    at 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The parties therefore entered four stipulations \"[f]or the purpose of expediting appeal of the previous orders and judgment\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   1. The parties stipulate to the dismissal of Count III of Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint with prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   2. The parties stipulate that the meaning of \"any successful order\" as used in Section 20 of the Settlement Agreement does not encompass a judgment or order for nominal damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   3. The parties stipulate that, if awarded, nominal damages are $1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   4. The parties stipulate that nominal damages in the amount of $1 do not constitute sufficient prejudice to support the affirmative defense of laches under Michigan law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The parties submitted a proposed judgment awarding nominal damages to Innovation. Counsel for both parties signed the proposed judgment, indicating that it was \"Approved as to Form Only and Preserving All Rights of Appeal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The district court had reservations about this resolution, explaining that it was \"not certain that entering this proposed judgment will actually preserve\" either party's right to appeal. It nonetheless entered judgment in Innovation's favor on Count I and awarded nominal damages. Innovation appealed, and NSL cross-appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Secondary Case (No. 17-1911)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As the Lead Case was proceeding in the district court, Innovation brought a new suit against NSL, adding a new defendant: Lily of the Desert. According to the complaint, discovery in the Lead Case revealed that Lily was also liable under the Settlement Agreement because of its relationship with NSL. Innovation brought the Secondary Case to prevent NSL from \"play[ing] shell games to avoid liability and any potential judgment.\" All claims in the Secondary Case relate to the same nucleus of fact as in the Lead Case, and Innovation concedes that the claims in the Secondary Case \"rise or fall with the rulings in the lead case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   All parties agreed the judgment in the Lead Case rendered the claims in the Secondary Case \"effectively moot,\" so the district court entered judgment in favor of Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Innovation Ventures, LLC v. Nutrition Sci. Labs., LLC\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Innovation Ventures IV\n   </em>\n   ), No. 16-11179,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204553429\">\n    2017 WL 4553429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2 (E.D. Mich. July 17, 2017). Innovation appealed. The two cases were consolidated on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants raise two jurisdictional objections: lack of appellate jurisdiction and lack of personal jurisdiction over both Jones and NSL. We may review jurisdictional objections in any order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133504\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/574/#p578\">\n    526 U.S. 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 578,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133504\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/574/#p578\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133504\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/574/#p578\">\n    143 L.Ed.2d 760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999) (explaining that \"there is no unyielding jurisdictional hierarchy\" as between subject-matter and personal jurisdiction).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Appellate Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendants argue that the judgment pursuant to stipulations in the Lead Case was not a final appealable decision for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants did not raise this argument before the district court. To the contrary, when the district court questioned Defendants' counsel-the same counsel representing them on appeal-about whether the stipulations could result in a \"final resolution,\" counsel responded that \"there is Sixth Circuit case law for the proposition that a plaintiff can dismiss with prejudice the remaining claims if they feel that the main thrust of their case has been already decided\" and that \"the Sixth Circuit does actually authorize a procedure just very much like this in order to finalize a case, resolve all the issues, and make it ripe for appeal.\" The inconsistency between the representations made to the district court and those included in the motion to dismiss is concerning but does not change our approach to the jurisdictional question at hand. We must satisfy ourselves that appellate jurisdiction exists even when neither party raises the issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Trs. of Plumbers, Local Union No. 392 v.

Despite these open questions, the parties agreed that only one outcome was possible: judgment in favor of Innovation for nominal damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The parties' logic was this.

The logic underpinning these cases is obvious: It is a rare defendant indeed who would pay to appeal a case in which she lost a trivial amount of money. A rule forbidding a plaintiff to appeal an award of nominal damages would, in the vast majority of suits awarding nominal damages, be a rule barring any appeal at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Third, like the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Bogorad\n   </em>\n   who was not required to pursue a negligence theory, Innovation is not required to pursue theories it has not prepared and does not wish to pursue.

The first line of the stipulations indicated that they were being entered into \"[f]or the purpose of expediting appeal of the previous orders and judgment in this case.\" At a status conference, Innovation explained to the district court that \"what we're trying to accomplish here with the stipulations, is to resolve the liability and all the remaining issues, and then the parties can choose, you know, what they are going to take up on appeal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   For all these reasons, this appeal fits within the boundaries of\n   <em>\n    Raceway\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Microsoft\n   </em>\n   , and jurisdiction is proper under \u00a7 1291.

By failing to object to personal jurisdiction in its initial Rule 12 motion, NSL waived the defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Means\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355710\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/643/#p648\">\n    836 F.3d at 648-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   NSL argues that its failure to raise personal jurisdiction was excused because the defense was not \"available\" at the time NSL made its Rule 12 motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(g)(2). We will accept for purposes of argument the Federal Circuit's rule that an objection is not \"available\" within the meaning of Rule 12(g)(2) when the objection \"is futile in the sense that the law bars the district court from adopting it to dismiss.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Micron Tech., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266696\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/1091/#p1097\">\n    875 F.3d 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1097 (Fed. Cir. 2017). NSL argues that a personal jurisdiction objection was futile because the district court made clear in hearings that the rulings in the Lead Case-presumably including those rulings related to personal jurisdiction-controlled in the Secondary Case as well. But the hearing in which the district court expressed that position took place approximately six months after NSL filed its motion to dismiss. So at the time the Rule 12 motion was made, Defendants did not know it was futile. Indeed, the inclusion of Rule 12(b)(2) -dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction-in the motion's header, if not its substance, acknowledges the possibility that it could be raised. NSL's objection to personal jurisdiction was therefore waived in the Secondary Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In the Lead Case, by contrast, Defendants filed the Rule 12 motions that would ordinarily suffice to preserve the objection to personal jurisdiction. On appeal, however, they challenge the district court's conclusion as to personal jurisdiction if and only if we reverse those findings by the district court that favored them. Defendants cite no authority for the proposition that it is possible to consent to jurisdiction only on the condition that the court finds in its favor, and we are aware of none. Defendants consented to this court's jurisdiction so long as we found in their favor and so waived the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Because the decision below was final for purposes of \u00a7 1291 and because the objection to lack of personal jurisdiction was waived in both the Lead and the Secondary Cases, we proceed to the merits of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants' Dismissed Antitrust Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   We begin with an issue that logically precedes the primary issues on appeal: Defendants' challenge to the district court's dismissal of their antitrust counterclaim as barred by the statute of limitations.

Jones was asked, \"Well, you are a party-and you are a party to the settlement agreement, right? You are a CNL party.\" He responded, \"Right.\" Jones is not an attorney. His statement is more properly viewed as a concession that he is listed as a CNL party in the text of the Settlement Agreement than as an admission that he is bound in his personal capacity. We therefore turn to the merits of the capacity issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Michigan statute of frauds provides that any contract that, \"by its terms, is not to be performed within 1 year\" is void unless it is \"in writing and signed with an authorized signature by the party to be charged with the agreement.\" Mich.

That practice was not followed here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   When the signatory signed only once, Michigan courts apply normal contract law principles to discern the parties' intent. Michigan courts presume that when \"appropriate words added to the signature of [the individual] indicated that he signed on behalf of the corporation in the representative capacity designated,\" the individual is not bound in his personal capacity.\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

The Michigan Court of Appeals concluded that, because \"the signature blocks in the Agreement provide no place for additional signatures for individuals to signal they accept personal liability apart from the corporation, which explicitly conflicts with the previously cited provisions that call for such liability,\" the contract was ambiguous and summary disposition was inappropriate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Perhaps the most helpful example is a recent Michigan case involving very similar facts to the case at hand, including one of the same parties.

The Michigan Court of Appeals made quick work of the argument that the individual defendant was personally liable, citing\n   <em>\n    Livonia\n   </em>\n   and explaining that the defendant had signed \"in his capacity as a corporate officer, and not as an individual.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. When that case was appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court and partially overturned, this holding was left undisturbed: \"Since the plaintiff has not challenged\n   the Court of Appeals' holding [that Paisley is not individually liable], we do not upset its decision.

The Settlement Agreement mentions Jones by name, and the signature block provides that Jones signs \"for [Custom Nutrition] and all of the CNL Parties.\" However, unlike the contract in\n   <em>\n    Employees Only\n   </em>\n   , this Agreement is centrally concerned with business negotiations and does not explicitly provide for personal liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201687626\">\n    2011 WL 1687626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Liquid Manufacturing I\n   </em>\n   , which decided this precise issue when interpreting a noncompete contract being enforced by this precise plaintiff, we cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that the Agreement binds Jones in his individual capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   We therefore reverse the district court's holding on this issue and conclude that the Settlement Agreement does not bind Jones in his personal capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Whether NSL Is Bound\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   NSL was not a party to the Settlement Agreement and so would not ordinarily be bound by its terms.

The Texas Court of Appeals had no trouble concluding that \"the agreement incorporates, by reference, portions of the employee handbook into the agreement\"-in particular, the section labeled \"Mutual Arbitration Policy/Procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9261741\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/133/642/#p645\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The acknowledgment in the Asset Purchase Agreement that NSL's rights to the formula were \"limited by the settlement agreement\" cannot reasonably be read to indicate that the Settlement Agreement \"contain[s] informative material only.\"\n   <em>\n    Bob Montgomery Chevrolet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7087128\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/409/181/#p189\">\n    409 S.W.3d at 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike\n   <em>\n    Bob Montgomery\n   </em>\n   's boilerplate, nonspecific reference to \"additional\" details, \u00a7 4.2(r) is a tailored description of intellectual property rights in a negotiated contract between sophisticated, counseled parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   As to the portion of the Settlement Agreement that this language incorporates, we agree with the district court that \u00a7 4.2(r) incorporates the Choline Family restrictions in \u00a7 5.c specifically. These restrictive covenants directly and meaningfully impact \"the formula for energy drinks manufactured by [Custom Nutrition]\" because they explain what ingredients Custom Nutrition's formula cannot include. In addition, the parties to the Settlement Agreement signaled the importance of the restrictive covenants by allocating $1.8 million of the $1.85 million settlement to that section. It would be illogical to conclude that one of the same parties overlooked the existence of that key section only a few months after the Settlement Agreement was executed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Defendants' main counterargument is that other sections of the Asset Purchase Agreement limit the obligations that NSL incurred on behalf of Custom Nutrition. They point to, for example, \u00a7 1.2, which provides that NSL is not responsible for \"any liabilities, obligations, or costs resulting from any claim or lawsuit,\" except for those described in \u00a7 1.3-which does not include the Settlement Agreement. Defendants are correct that the language of \u00a7 4.2(r) should, if possible, be read to \"harmonize\" with the limitations on liability found elsewhere in the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    C&amp;H News\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9261741\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/133/642/#p645\">\n    133 S.W.3d at 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But those limitations should not be read to render \u00a7 4.2(r) a nullity; rather, \u00a7 4.2(r) should be read as an exception to the limitations. In other words, boilerplate denunciations of obligations do not trump \u00a7 4.2(r)'s specific reference to the \"limit[ ]\" on the \"formula for energy drinks.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   We therefore affirm the district court's conclusion that NSL is bound by \u00a7 5.c of\n   the Settlement Agreement by virtue of its incorporation into the Asset Purchase Agreement. As a result, we do not reach Innovation's conditional argument that, if NSL is not bound by the Settlement Agreement, the tortious interference claim should be reinstated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Ambiguity of the Catch-All Clause\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Defendants next challenge the district court's conclusion that whether betaine and alpha GPC are covered by the catch-all clause in the Choline Family definition (which prohibits use of listed chemicals' \"equivalents in all forms, derivatives, constituents, and synthetic equivalents or substitutes\") is ambiguous as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Defendants argue that the district court failed to construe the catch-all clause narrowly and against the party seeking restraint, as is required by Michigan law in contracts involving noncompete agreements. Neither proposition requires a court to unilaterally disregard reasonable readings of a noncompete agreement.

According to Innovation, the district court should have applied a different test, the \"rule of reason.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Defendants argue that Innovation waived its rule-of-reason argument as well as any objection to the three-year reformed duration of the agreement. Both arguments are incorrect. Innovation consistently argued that the district court should apply the rule of reason. When a new Michigan Supreme Court case on the issue was decided, Innovation cited the new decision repeatedly for propositions directly related to the rule-of-reason analysis. Innovation was not obliged to also move for reconsideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

I know you told me that there were various reasons that you believe that the 20-year time limit was reasonable.... But as I asked Mr. Banowsky, do you agree that if the Court believed or found that that was too long and that it wasn't reasonable, that the next step would be to reform the contract in some way?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    MS.

Defendants' laches defense is therefore not necessarily barred merely because the case was brought within the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Turning to the merits, the parties dispute whether there was \"an unexcused or unexplained delay in commencing\" this suit.\n   <em>\n    Gomez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=896%20N.W.2d%2039\">\n    896 N.W.2d at 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the one hand, in September 2012, less than two weeks after this suit was filed, an Innovation officer stated that Innovation had \"[r]ecently\" discovered that NSL was using Choline Family ingredients. On the other hand, Innovation knew that Custom Nutrition was manufacturing at least one energy shot containing Choline Family ingredients (\"Rock On\") when the Settlement Agreement was executed; Rock On is the first product listed in the Agreement's appendix. Because NSL manufactured Rock On from its inception in 2009, this creates a dispute of material fact. A jury could reasonably infer that Innovation knew or should have known that NSL was manufacturing shots containing Choline Family ingredients almost three years before it filed suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   A jury might also conclude that NSL was prejudiced by the delay,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gomez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=896%20N.W.2d%2039\">\n    896 N.W.2d at 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because the liability that NSL faced increased with each violative energy shot sold and so with each day that Innovation delayed filing suit. Of course, NSL's decision to continue manufacturing shots containing Choline Family ingredients after the suit was filed could counsel against a finding of prejudice, because a jury could infer from that course of conduct that NSL would have run up the same potential damages regardless of when Innovation sued. But the available evidence does not require that conclusion. As the district court summarized it, \"the entire point of Defendants' argument is that they would have reacted differently because they could have designed the products differently from the outset.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <em>\n    Innovation Ventures III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273709\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/256/696/#p704\">\n    256 F.Supp.3d at 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, too, there is a dispute of material fact. The district court, therefore, did not err in deciding to submit these subsidiary factual disputes to a jury before making its ultimate determination on Defendants' laches defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Finally, Innovation invokes the unclean hands doctrine.

The manufacturer decided not to license the technology and, instead, \"assigned the same engineers who had learned of Celeritas's technology under the NDA to work on\" a project to develop the same technology.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1540694\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/150/1354/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Celeritas sued for breach of the NDA, misappropriation of trade secrets, and patent infringement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1540694\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/150/1354/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The jury awarded the same damages figure on both the patent and contract claims, calculated based on a hypothetical license fee.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1540694\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/150/1354/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On appeal, the patent was deemed invalid because it had been anticipated by a published article.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1540694\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/150/1354/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1540694\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/150/1354/\">\n    at 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the Federal Circuit determined that Celeritas could nonetheless recover a reasonable royalty as damages for the manufacturer's breach of the NDA: \"To compensate Celeritas for the breach, the jury properly determined the license fee Rockwell would have paid had it not breached the agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1540694\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/150/1354/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1540694\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/150/1354/\">\n    at 1359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   In this case, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Celeritas\n   </em>\n   , there are no patent infringement or misappropriation claims. The Settlement Agreement was not part of licensing negotiations. And, as Innovation's own expert stated in his report, \"Innovation Ventures has no history of licensing its intellectual property to any competitor.\" So even assuming Michigan law might allow for assessment of royalty-based damages in certain, unusual breach of contract cases, the circumstances that rendered that assessment reasonable in\n   <em>\n    Celeritas\n   </em>\n   are not present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The remaining cases-all from out-of-circuit district courts, and largely unpublished-are similarly inapposite. In some, the contract claim was paired with a misappropriation or patent infringement claim, so the court simply allowed the use of the reasonable royalty methodology across both types of claims, or after one had been dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Veritas Operating Corp. v.

Even the non-binding authority depended on circumstances not present here. An estimated reasonable royalty is not an appropriate theory for proof of damages in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Disgorgement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Finally, Innovation argues that, pursuant to \u00a7 5.d of the Settlement Agreement, it should be allowed to seek disgorgement of Defendants' proceeds from selling energy shots that violated the Choline Family restrictions. We therefore must decide whether Defendant NSL is bound by \u00a7 5.d because it is incorporated by reference into either \u00a7 5.c of the Settlement Agreement (which, for the reasons explained above,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part II.C.2, binds NSL) or the Asset Purchase Agreement (to which NSL is a party).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   First, we ask whether \u00a7 5.c.i incorporates \u00a7 5.d. Michigan courts, like their Texas counterparts, distinguish between contractual terms that merely \"mention\" another document and those that are \"made for the purpose of making such writing a part of the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Forge v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"574282\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/458/198/\">\n    458 Mich. 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=580%20N.W.2d%20876\">\n    580 N.W.2d 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 881 &amp; n.21 (1998) (citation omitted). In so doing, courts \"must look for the party's intent within the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=580%20N.W.2d%20876\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=580%20N.W.2d%20876\">\n    at 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The Choline Family restrictions are found in \u00a7 5.c.i of the Settlement Agreement. The key sentence provides that \"[n]o Energy Liquid shall contain anything in the Choline Family (defined below) (subject to the Sell-Through Period described in Subsection 5.d. below).\" The cross-referenced subsection, \u00a7 5.d, titled \"Sell-Through Period,\" has two key terms. First, it provides for three- and six-month grace periods in which Custom Nutrition can continue to produce and sell, respectively, energy shots containing Choline Family ingredients. Second, it provides for damages: \"Remedy for violation is injunctive relief and disgorgement of proceeds plus provable damages, attorneys' fees and indemnification for each such violation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   No Michigan cases have been cited involving the situation where one clause of a contract incorporates another clause by reference. Even if we assume that clause-by-clause incorporation is possible, \u00a7 5.c.i refers to the \"Sell-Through Period\n   <em>\n    described\n   </em>\n   in Subsection 5.d\" (emphasis added) rather than \u00a7 5.d in its entirety. The limited reference points more naturally to the grace period in \u00a7 5.d than to its damages language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   We turn next to Innovation's argument that the Asset Purchase Agreement incorporates \u00a7 5.d. Innovation asserts, without analysis or citation, that \"[s]ince \u00a7 5.d. (setting forth the formula-restriction grace period and remedies for breach) is part and parcel of \u00a7 5.c.i., there is no way to isolate \u00a7 5.c. from \u00a7 5.d.\" We disagree. Section 5.c describes the prohibited conduct, and \u00a7 5.d describes the resulting penalty; these two provisions are logically distinct. The Asset Purchase Agreement describes limitations on \"the formula for energy drinks,\" which, as explained above, most naturally refers to the ingredient-specific\n   restrictive covenants in \u00a7 5.c that would change the formula itself. The proposed remedy, on the other hand, does not \"limit[ ]\" the formula.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   We therefore affirm the district court's conclusion that Innovation may not seek disgorgement of Defendants' proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   ; the district court's conclusions as to personal jurisdiction, Defendants' antitrust counterclaim, whether NSL is bound by the Settlement Agreement, the ambiguity of the catch-all clause, laches, reasonable royalty, and disgorgement are\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   ; and the district court's conclusions as to whether Jones is bound by the Settlement Agreement, the enforceability and reformation of the restrictive covenant, and lost profits are\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED\n   </strong>\n   . The district court's dismissal of the Secondary Case based on preclusion is therefore also\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED\n   </strong>\n   .
