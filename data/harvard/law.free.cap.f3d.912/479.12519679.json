Rev. Stat.\") \u00a7\u00a7 13-1203 and 13-3601. The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") adopted the Immigration Judge's (\"IJ\") reasoning that Petitioner was removable, finding that although categorically not a crime of violence, Cornejo's offense fit the federal generic definition of \"crime of domestic violence\" under the modified categorical approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We agree that Petitioner is removable on the basis of his class one misdemeanor domestic violence assault conviction under Arizona law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Cornejo, a native and citizen of Mexico, entered the United States without inspection in 1994. On January 30, 2008, he adjusted his status to lawful permanent resident. On October 3, 2008, Cornejo pleaded guilty to \"Assault-Domestic Violence Offense,\" a \"Class 1 Misdemeanor\" under Arizona law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Cornejo had been charged with Aggravated Assault, a \"Class 6 Felony and a Domestic Violence Offense,\" committed by knowingly touching his spouse \"with the intent to injure, insult, or provoke\" while \"in violation of an order of protection....\" However, Petitioner entered a guilty plea to \"Count 2 (Amended) Assault, a Domestic Violence Offense Class 1 misdemeanor.\" There is no amended complaint in the administrative record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the plea transcript, Cornejo's defense attorney on his behalf stated as the factual basis for the plea that he and his wife were fighting, and that as she was \"going down the hallway,\" he \"either punched or pushed her in the back of the head ... with the intention to insult or provoke her....\" The superior court judge found that the factual basis supported Cornejo's admission to the class one misdemeanor domestic violence charge and accepted the plea. The superior court imposed a 12-month term of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In December 2008, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") served Petitioner with a Notice to Appear, Form I-862 (\"NTA\"), in the Immigration Court in Eloy, Arizona. DHS alleged that Petitioner was removable under the INA as an alien who had committed a crime of domestic violence.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(E)(i). The NTA alleged that Cornejo was convicted of \"a class 1 misdemeanor\" domestic violence assault against his spouse, making him\n   removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(E)(i),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(E)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The IJ initially terminated Petitioner's removal proceedings. DHS moved the BIA to remand the matter to the IJ, seeking an opportunity to provide the plea transcript that the agency had secured after the initial proceedings were terminated. The BIA granted the motion and remanded to the IJ in December 2010. In August 2012, the IJ determined that Cornejo's conviction qualified as a crime of domestic violence under the modified categorical approach and sustained the charge of removability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal, the BIA affirmed the IJ's determination that Cornejo was removable based on a crime of domestic violence and ineligible because of insufficient continuous presence for cancellation of removal pursuant to INA \u00a7 240A(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a).

The only class one misdemeanor in that statute is in paragraph one and requires that a person intentionally or knowingly cause physical injury to another person.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-1203\">\n    Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A)(1). Moreover, Cornejo admitted that he acted \"with the intention to insult or provoke\" his wife, and that he \"either punched or pushed\" his wife in the back of the head.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00a7 13-1203(A)(3), (B) (defining the class 3 misdemeanor as \"[k]nowingly touching another person with the intent to injure, insult or provoke such person\"). These admissions form a sufficient factual basis to support that Cornejo \"intentionally [or] knowingly ... caus[ed] any physical injury\" to his spouse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00a7 13-1203(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Cornejo argues that the factual basis of the plea shows that he did not intend to use violent force because his intention was to insult or provoke his wife, which follows the language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-1203\">\n    Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A)(3). Subsection (B) of the Arizona statute requires us to reject this argument. That subsection says in relevant part: \"Assault committed intentionally or knowingly pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 is a class 1 misdemeanor. Assault committed recklessly pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 ... is a class 2 misdemeanor\" not a class 1 misdemeanor. Thus Cornejo's plea to a class 1 misdemeanor, as well as his admission at his plea colloquy, establishes that he committed the assault intentionally, not recklessly. We therefore need not address any putative tension between\n   <em>\n    Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Voisine v. United States\n   </em>\n   , regarding the sufficiency of recklessness in this statutory context for a crime of violence. And he necessarily admitted \"causing physical injury,\" because subsection (A)(1), to which he pleaded requires physical injury as an element. Since Cornejo does not dispute that the crime was domestic, that he assaulted his wife intentionally, and that she was injured by his assault, the misdemeanor was a crime of domestic violence. The statute is plainly divisible on its face, and the Arizona courts have so held,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   so application of this modified categorical analysis is appropriate, even though other assaults under section 1203 would not be crimes of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Moreover, Cornejo's attempt to have us review the underlying facts for his conviction goes beyond the scope of the modified categorical approach. In\n   <em>\n    Descamps v. United States\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court admonished courts for using the modified categorical approach to \"try to discern what a trial showed, or a plea proceeding revealed, about the defendant's underlying conduct.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    570 U.S. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2288,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).
