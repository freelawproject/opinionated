Palestinian Auth.,\n   </em>\n   No. 15-7034 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 3, 2019). The order in that case is inapposite.\n   <em>\n    Klieman\n   </em>\n   is a case in which the Government is not a party. The Government's motion in\n   <em>\n    Klieman\n   </em>\n   was to extend the time to file an amicus brief that the court had invited\n   <em>\n    sua sponte.\n   </em>\n   The Government was not even required to respond to the invitation (and unlike in this case, neither of the litigants opposed the Government's motion). Hence, the\n   <em>\n    Klieman\n   </em>\n   order is not a precedent for how panels should respond to motions in cases in which the Government is a party and is compelled by the court to adhere to filing requirements. The request for an extension in a case in which the Government has been invited to file an amicus brief is quite different from a request in a case in which the Government is a party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Randolph, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Constitution states that \"no money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.\" U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7. The treasury is also protected by the Anti-Deficiency Act, which prohibits employing federal personnel in advance of appropriations except in emergencies, unless otherwise authorized by law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In light of the current government \"shutdown,\" the Federal Aviation Administration moved for a stay of the oral argument scheduled for January 11, 2019. The FAA explained that under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201342\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   its attorneys \"are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including 'emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.' \" Mot. Stay Oral Arg. 2 (quoting\n   <em>\n    id.).\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   What then is the rationale for denying the FAA's motion?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   It cannot be that having oral argument in this case on January 11, 2019, will avert some emergency within the meaning of \u00a7 1342. An opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel concludes, correctly I believe, that \"the emergencies exception applies only to cases of threat to human life or property where the threat can be reasonably said to be near at hand and demanding of immediate response.\" Government Operations in the Event of a Lapse in Appropriations,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995%20WL%2017216091\">\n    1995 WL 17216091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (O.L.C. Aug. 16, 1995). Holding oral argument January 11 is not a necessary response to some imminent threat to human life or property. (There may have been an emergency at the administrative stage of this case regarding the safety of equipment petitioner repaired, but that emergency passed when the FAA revoked petitioner's certificate.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Perhaps the idea is that the Judiciary is free to disregard the restrictions of \u00a7 1342. But it seems to me that a federal court may refuse to comply with this statute only if it is unconstitutional. Given the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution, the constitutionality of \u00a7 1342 is beyond doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Or perhaps the idea is that because \u00a7 1342 contains the clause \"exceeding that authorized by law,\" judges may circumvent the statutory restriction by authorizing federal officers and employees to show up in court. This, of course, is blatant bootstrapping. A court order requiring or authorizing a government attorney's presence may immunize the attorney from the sanctions for violating \u00a7 1342.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201349\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But it does not relieve the court from its responsibility to comply with the law. The \"authorized-by-law\" clause has been on the statute books for nearly 200 years, and it has a settled meaning. Authority for the Continuance of Government Functions During a Temporary Lapse in Appropriations, 43 U.S. Op. Att'y Gen. 293, 296 &amp; n.5 (1981). It does not confer a license on the Judiciary. Instead, the clause requires legal authority for the obligation of public funds, either from appropriations or other relevant statutes, or-in the case of Executive authority-from the Constitution itself.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201349\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201349\">\n    at 295-301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The majority opinion, which itself contains no legal analysis, relies on orders denying stays during shutdowns.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   But\n   those orders also contain no legal analysis. The majority's argument must be that because we have denied these stay motions in the past we should do so again.
