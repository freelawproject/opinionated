BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   These consolidated appeals arise from the government's efforts to execute long-standing final removal orders of Iraqi nationals that the United States had, for many years, been unable to execute. The district court entered two preliminary injunctions: one to halt the removal of Iraqi nationals (removal-based claims) and one to order bond hearings for those Iraqi nationals who continued to be detained after the district court halted their removals (detention-based claims). Because we find the district court lacked the jurisdiction to enter both the removal-based and the detention-based claims, we\n   <strong>\n    VACATE\n   </strong>\n   the preliminary injunctions for both the removal-based and the detention-based\n   claims, and we\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   with directions to dismiss the removal-based claims for lack of jurisdiction, and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Petitioners-Appellees (\"Petitioners\") are Iraqi nationals, the vast majority of whom were ordered removed to Iraq years (and some decades) ago because of criminal offenses they committed in the United States. For many years Iraq refused to repatriate Iraqi nationals who, like Petitioners, had been ordered removed from the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the United States was unable to execute the removal of Iraqi nationals to Iraq, Petitioners remained in the United States under orders of supervision by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"). Their removal orders remained final and active.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Things changed in 2017. Iraq began to cooperate with repatriation efforts and the removal of Iraqi nationals to Iraq quickly resumed. Iraqi nationals such as Petitioners, with final orders of removal that had been long-stalled, were faced with an unpleasant reality-their removals were now imminent. Though many of these Iraqi nationals had come to expect that the execution of their removals would never materialize, they had been living in the United States on borrowed time. Iraq's agreement to cooperate with repatriation efforts meant that time was up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The reality of Iraq's resuming cooperation in repatriating its nationals hit in April 2017 when ICE conducted its first removal by charter flight to Iraq since 2010, removing eight Iraqi nationals and scheduling a second charter for late June 2017. In preparation for the second charter, ICE arrested and held in custody more than 200 Iraqi nationals in mid-June 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   These arrests prompted the cases now before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 15, 2017, Petitioners filed a putative class action habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on behalf of \"all Iraqi nationals in the United States with final orders of removal, who have been, or will be, arrested and detained by ICE as a result of Iraq's recent decision to issue travel documents to facilitate U.S. removal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Petitioners also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and/or stay of removal, asking the district court to halt their removal to Iraq and to hear the Petitioners' arguments of allegedly changed country conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Petitioners' choice to file this action before the district court was undoubtedly outside the norm for removal proceedings, over which immigration courts hold exclusive jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) (\"[N]o court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien ....\"). So before making any determination on the preliminary injunction, the district court had to determine whether it had jurisdiction to hear Petitioners' case. Pending its jurisdictional decision, the district court stayed the purported class's final removal orders-first in the Eastern District of Michigan and then nationwide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court eventually concluded that it had jurisdiction to hear Petitioners' claims. Acknowledging that \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) applies to divest this Court of subject-matter jurisdiction,\" the district court found that the circumstances in the case presented an as-applied constitutional violation of the Suspension Clause, allowing it to exercise jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Specifically, the district court explained that \"[t]he mechanism provided by [Congress through] the REAL ID Act for judicial review of removal orders-filing motions to reopen proceedings in immigration courts and subsequent review in the courts of appeals-does not take into account the compelling confluence of grave real-world circumstances present in [this] case.\" The district court, in July 2017, granted Petitioners a nationwide preliminary injunction preventing the government from enforcing final removal orders against Iraqi nationals and requiring the government to produce extensive discovery. The government appealed the preliminary injunction on September 21, 2017. That appeal is before us as Case No. 17-2171.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The second appeal stems from Petitioners' continued detention during the pendency of these cases. The government has kept Petitioners detained, as relevant to the appeal before us, under the authority provided in two statutes. The first grants authority to detain aliens who are subject to final removal orders because they have not moved to reopen their immigration proceedings or have not prevailed in a motion to reopen their proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6). The second grants authority to detain certain aliens who have succeeded in having their removal orders reopened (and are not subject to a final removal order and detention authority under \u00a7 1231 ) but have criminal convictions or qualifying terrorist activities that render them subject to mandatory detention pending a decision on removal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In October 2017, nearly three months after the district court granted Petitioners' removal-based preliminary injunction, Petitioners amended their habeas petition and class action complaint to add claims challenging their continued detentions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1226(c) while the courts resolve their removal-based claims based on due process principles and the Immigration and Nationality Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et seq.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioners moved for a\n   preliminary injunction seeking relief on these detention-based claims, which the district court granted, ordering an injunction requiring bond hearings on a class-wide basis.

The district court did not err by finding that \u00a7 1252(g) divested it of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   But our agreement with the district court's reasoning ends there. After correctly concluding that \u00a7 1252(g) divested it of jurisdiction as a matter of federal statutory law, the court then erred by finding that it could still exercise jurisdiction because \"extraordinary circumstances\" created an as-applied constitutional violation of the Suspension Clause. This is a broad, novel, and incorrect application of the Suspension Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   There are at least two reasons why \u00a7 1252(g)'s jurisdictional limitations do not violate the Suspension Clause. First, because Petitioners are not seeking habeas relief in the first instance. And second, because even if they were, Congress's petition-for-review process provides an adequate alternative to an action in habeas as applied to Petitioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To begin with, the type of relief Petitioners seek is not protected by the Suspension Clause.

We agree. As the government states, \"[t]he claims and relief requested here are fundamentally different from a traditional habeas claim.\" Petitioners' removal-based claims did not challenge any detention and did not seek release from custody. Rather, they sought \"a stay of removal until they ... had a reasonable period of time to locate immigration counsel, file a motion to reopen in the appropriate administrative immigration forum, and have that motion adjudicated to completion in the administrative system, with time to file a petition for review and request a stay of removal in a federal court of appeals.\" \"[T]he nature of the relief sought by the habeas petitioners suggests that habeas is not appropriate in these cases\" because \"the last thing petitioners want is simple release\" but instead a \"court order requiring the United States to shelter them.\"\n   <em>\n    Munaf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674149\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/674/#p693\">\n    553 U.S. at 693-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674149\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/674/#p693\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the relief ordered by the district court-a stay of removal-did not result in Petitioners' release from custody.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the common-law writ could not have granted\n   Petitioners' requested relief, the Suspension Clause is not triggered here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The dissent claims we misrepresent\n   <em>\n    St. Cyr\n   </em>\n   because\n   <em>\n    St. Cyr\n   </em>\n   requires some \"judicial intervention in deportation cases.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313153\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/289/#p301\">\n    533 U.S. at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313153\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/289/#p301\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

They are wrong. Petitioners had years to file their motions to reopen; they cannot now argue that the system gave them too little time.

In our view,\n   <em>\n    Reno\n   </em>\n   unambiguously strips federal courts of jurisdiction to enter class-wide injunctive relief for the detention-based claims. Petitioners disagree and raise three objections. We address each of these objections below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Objection # 1: The plain text of the statute does not bar class actions.\n   </em>\n   According to Petitioners, \" \u00a7 1252(f)'s language bars injunctions that purport to protect persons\n   <em>\n    not yet in immigration proceedings\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added). Petitioners come to this conclusion by focusing on the language in \u00a7 1252(f)(1) that reads \"other than ... an ... alien ... against whom\n   <em>\n    proceedings under such part have been initiated\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added). According to Petitioners, \u00a7 1252(f)(1)\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a bar on injunctions\n   <em>\n    but\n   </em>\n   there is a carveout for those aliens who are already in immigration proceedings. Since everyone in the current litigation is currently in immigration proceedings, Petitioners argue that \u00a7 1252(f)(1) is inapplicable to the current class action litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This argument does violence to the text of the statute. The only way Petitioners can come to the conclusion they do is by reading out the word \"individual\" before \"alien\" in the last sentence of the statute. In other words, they argue that a class action is not barred by this statute because all the members of the proposed subclasses are already in immigration proceedings. But although Petitioners are correct that the statute provides a carveout for those already in immigration proceedings, that carveout applies only to an \"individual.\" There is no way to square the concept of a class action lawsuit with the wording \"individual\" in the statute. \"It is 'a cardinal principle of statutory construction' that 'a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous,\n   void, or insignificant.' \"\n   <em>\n    TRW Inc. v. Andrews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107958\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/19/#p31\">\n    534 U.S. 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107958\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/19/#p31\">\n    122 S.Ct. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107958\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/19/#p31\">\n    151 L.Ed.2d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) (citation omitted). The only way to permit a class action or class-based lawsuit without running awry of \u00a7 1252(f)(1) would be if the statute, instead of using the phrase \"an individual alien,\" used a phrase such as \"aliens\" or \"any alien.\" By giving no meaning to the word \"individual,\" Petitioners are arguing for a version of the statute that Congress simply did not write.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Indeed, elsewhere in the statute Congress made it very clear that it knew how to distinguish when it wanted a statute to apply not to \"individual\" aliens, but rather to \"any alien.\" For example, the phrase \"any alien\" appears in the very next subsection of the statute-\"Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall enjoin the removal of\n   <em>\n    any alien\n   </em>\n   ...\" \u00a7 1252(f)(2) (emphasis added)-as well as in other subsections of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1252(e)(4)(B) (\"\n   <em>\n    Any alien\n   </em>\n   who is provided a hearing ...\") (emphasis added); \u00a7 1252(g) (\"[N]o court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of\n   <em>\n    any alien\n   </em>\n   ... or execute removal orders against\n   <em>\n    any alien\n   </em>\n   under this chapter.\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Petitioners argue that if Congress had wanted to ban class certification under Rule 23 it would have just said that. In fact, it did elsewhere in the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1252(e)(1)(B) (\"[N]o court may ... certify a class under Rule 23 ....\"). But there is a big difference between barring the certification of a class under Rule 23 and barring all injunctive relief. The former bars a\n   <em>\n    class action\n   </em>\n   regarding\n   <em>\n    anything\n   </em>\n   ; the latter only bars\n   <em>\n    injunctive relief\n   </em>\n   for anyone other than\n   <em>\n    individuals.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Petitioners next argue that \"[t]he use of the term 'individual alien' does not withdraw a court's power to grant class relief.\" In support of their position, Petitioners cite\n   <em>\n    Califano v.

Indeed, a wide variety of federal jurisdictional provisions speak in terms of individual plaintiffs, but class relief has never been thought to be unavailable under them.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531947\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/682/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531947\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/682/\">\n    at 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531947\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/682/\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Petitioners go on to point out that the lack of reference to habeas jurisdiction in \u00a7 1252(f)(1) is especially notable given that in other parts of \u00a7 1252, Congress chose to specifically mention habeas using the phrase: \"Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), including section 2241 of Title 28, or any other habeas corpus provision.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(A), (B), (C), 1252(a)(4), (5), 1252(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   But Petitioners' argument fails because there is nothing in \u00a7 1252(f)(1) that suspends the writ of habeas corpus. It is true that habeas is barred as to\n   <em>\n    injunctive relief\n   </em>\n   for\n   <em>\n    class actions\n   </em>\n   , but there is nothing barring a class from seeking a traditional writ of habeas corpus (which is distinct from injunctive relief,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 858 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) ), or an individual from seeking habeas relief, whether injunctive or otherwise. There was therefore no reason for Congress to explicitly call attention to habeas jurisdiction in \u00a7 1252(f)(1). Additionally,\n   <em>\n    St. Cyr\n   </em>\n   is not properly invoked by Petitioners because the animating principle behind\n   <em>\n    St. Cyr\n   </em>\n   was that courts needed to tread carefully when interpreting a statute that \"invokes the outer limits of Congress' power.\"\n   <em>\n    St. Cyr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313153\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/289/#p301\">\n    533 U.S. at 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313153\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/289/#p301\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First,\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   foreclosed any statutory interpretation that would lead to what Petitioners want. The\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   Court chastised the Ninth Circuit for \"erroneously conclud[ing] that periodic bond hearings are required under the immigration provisions at issue here,\" a conclusion the Ninth Circuit came to by \"adopt[ing] implausible constructions of the ... immigration provisions at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Jennings,\n   </em>\n   138 S.Ct. at 850, 836. Similarly, Petitioners' argument here cannot succeed to the extent that Petitioners are arguing the district court was\n   <em>\n    interpreting\n   </em>\n   the statute to find a statutory basis for the injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Second, the claim that \"the district court was not enjoining or restraining the statutes\" is implausible on its face. The district court, among other things, ordered release of detainees held \"for six months or more, unless a bond hearing for any such detainee is conducted\"; created out of thin air a requirement for bond hearings that does not exist in the statute; and adopted new\n   standards that the government must meet at the bond hearings (\"shall release ... unless the immigration judge finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the detainee is either a flight risk or a public safety risk\"). If these limitations on what the government can and cannot do under the removal and detention provisions are not \"restraints,\" it is not at all clear what would qualify as a restraint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The district court did not have jurisdiction to enter class-wide injunctive relief on Petitioners' detention-based claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The district court lacked jurisdiction to enter its preliminary injunction both with regard to the removal-based and the detention-based claims. It lacked jurisdiction over the removal-based claims because \u00a7 1252(g) plainly reserves for the Attorney General the authority to execute removal orders. These orders are not subject to judicial review. There is no Suspension Clause violation because the Suspension Clause can only be triggered when a petitioner is requesting release from custody. That is not what Petitioners request in the instant case. Instead, they seek additional time to have their petitions heard in the immigration courts. Additionally, the district court lacked jurisdiction over the detention-based claims because \u00a7 1252(f)(1) unambiguously strips federal courts of the authority to enter class-wide injunctive relief, as the district court did in this case. We accordingly\n   <strong>\n    VACATE\n   </strong>\n   the preliminary injunctions for both the removal-based and the detention-based claims, and we\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   with directions to dismiss the removal-based claims for lack of jurisdiction, and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   HELENE N. WHITE, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The majority vacates the preliminary injunctions relative to both types of claims-the removal-based claims and the detention-based claims-on the basis that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter the injunctions, and remands with instructions to dismiss the claims. The removal-based relief must be vacated, says the majority, because the Suspension Clause, on which the district court relied, \"can only be triggered when a petitioner is requesting relief from custody\" (Maj. Op. at 880), and, in any event, Congress's petition-for-review procedure provides an adequate substitute for habeas as applied to Petitioners (Maj. Op. at 876). The detention-based relief must be vacated and the claims dismissed, according to the majority, because \" \u00a7 1252(f)(1) unambiguously strips federal courts of the authority to\n   enter class-wide injunctive relief.\" (Maj. Op. at 880.) Although the majority remands for further proceedings, it rejects the avenues left open by\n   <em>\n    Jennings v. Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), which was decided after the injunctions were entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Although I agree with the majority that Jennings forecloses Petitioners' argument that the district court did not enjoin the operation of the provisions, but rather enforced them after interpreting them to require bond hearings, I disagree with the remainder of the majority's conclusions. Regarding the removal-based claims, protection against the executive action of removal is within the recognized scope of habeas, and the petition-for-review procedure provides an inadequate substitute for habeas under the circumstances presented here. Thus, the district court properly exercised jurisdiction over that claim. Regarding the detention-based claims, the district court had jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241, and \u00a7 1252(f)(1) does not purport to bar class-wide declaratory relief or individual injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Removal-Based Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   I dissent from the majority's determination that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter the preliminary injunction staying removal until Petitioners have the opportunity to file motions to reopen and pursue their available avenues for administrative relief and judicial review. Petitioners do not challenge the orders of removal; they claim that country conditions have changed since those orders were entered and that they face persecution, torture, and possibly death if removed to Iraq. They do not ask the courts to make this determination in the first instance; they seek only to pursue their statutory rights to reopen their cases and make the requisite showing before the administrative agency. In short, they seek time to pursue Congress's mandated avenues for relief before they are deported, which, they plausibly assert, will render any relief granted pursuant to those procedures meaningless. The district court determined that Congress's withdrawal of habeas jurisdiction under these circumstances constitutes an as-applied violation of the Suspension Clause. I agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    Scope of Habeas and the Suspension Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The United States Constitution states: \"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\" U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 2.

In its order granting the preliminary injunction, the district court considered the relevant case law and correctly noted that \"in none of the many cases cited by the parties and by the Court regarding habeas jurisdiction in immigration cases has a court refused to consider a petitioner's argument on the grounds that the challenge to the removal order was not cognizable for failure to challenge detention.\" (R. 87, PID 2336-37 (collecting cases).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The majority opinion sweeps broadly, finding that the Suspension Clause only protects the \"core\" remedy of release from detention and that protection from removal is not included.

Like\n   <em>\n    St. Cyr\n   </em>\n   , the present case involves aliens subject to federal removal orders who seek habeas review on a question of law related to their immigration proceedings, specifically, whether a district court has jurisdiction to stay removal proceedings for aliens at risk of immediate deportation where the available relief in the immigration courts is not an adequate and effective alternative. The majority focuses on the relief sought-cancellation of removal, which would leave St. Cyr free to remain in the U.S., as opposed to withholding of removal, which would entitle Petitioners\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to be released into Iraq. The majority then notes that an alien who shows he will suffer torture is not automatically entitled to stay in the U.S. and may be removed to some other safe place.

Petitioners do not dispute that the petition-for-review process generally provides an adequate alternative to habeas.

The majority gives short shrift to the district court's core finding, simply asserting that \"Petitioners had years to file their motions to reopen; they cannot now argue that the system gave them too little time. The administrative scheme established by Congress even provided multiple avenues to stay removal while pursuing relief.\" (Maj. Op. at 876-77.) The majority plainly ignores the facts on the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Aliens seeking to challenge their removal based on changed country conditions can file a motion to reopen, which is a request for redetermination of a prior decision to remove the alien.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201003.2\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) and 1003.23(b)(3). A motion to reopen does not automatically stay removal. Once a motion to reopen has been filed, the alien may also file a motion to stay, although there is no guarantee that an alien will not be deported during the pendency of the motion to stay removal. A motion to reopen based on changed country conditions must establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7), which means the motion and supporting documentation must (1) set forth a complete description of the new circumstances, (2) articulate how those new circumstances affect the party's eligibility for relief, and (3) include evidence of the changed circumstances,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201003.2\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ; 1003.23(b)(3) and (4)(i); Immigration Court Practice Manual, Chapter 5.7(e)(i) (June 10, 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In this case, Petitioners' grounds for relief from removal based on changed\n   country conditions in Iraq arose\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   (in some cases, many years after) Petitioners' removal proceedings had ended. Petitioners presented the district court with evidence that because they were likely to be killed or tortured if deported, their impending removal would be in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and the Convention Against Torture (CAT), and that without a stay they would be deported before they could seek relief under these acts. The government did not contest this evidence, and the majority does not find fault with the district court's findings that without a stay, deportations would commence immediately, with death, torture, and persecution probably resulting. Instead, the majority faults Petitioners for failing to file motions to reopen earlier. Yet there are good reasons for Petitioners' failure to do so. The government was unable to deport Petitioners to Iraq until 2017 when a diplomatic agreement resulted in the resumption of removals. Petitioners were living for years (or decades) under removal orders but with no actual prospect of being deported. Susan Reed, Petitioners' witness and the Managing Attorney of the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, explained that stays of removal are not typically sought until removal is imminent because they are rarely granted when removal is not imminent. Although Petitioners could have filed motions to reopen and to stay removal, it was not reasonable to expect them to do so because there was no real possibility of removal and it was unclear what country conditions might be at some hypothetical future time when removal might be possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   There is abundant evidence in the record that motions to reopen are complicated, time-consuming, and expensive. These motions require the applicant to compile files, affidavits, and \"hundreds of pages of supporting evidence,\" fill out all sections of the application, and include an original signature. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 77-2, R. 77-26, R. 77-27, R. 30-3 \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201003.2\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) (noting that a motion to reopen \"must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation\").) Amicus Curiae American Immigration Lawyers Association's (AILA) explains that \"[t]he mechanics of filing a Motion to Reopen with either the immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals can be a highly-complex and time-consuming process even for the most-seasoned immigration attorney.\" (AILA Br. at 3.) Here, attorneys faced difficulties preparing the applications because Petitioners were transferred to out-of-state facilities and even when attorneys did visit the out-of-state facilities, they were often denied the opportunity to meet with their clients. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 77-22 \u00b6\u00b6 7-9 (attorney who drove four hours to meet with client was denied the opportunity to visit on two separate occasions, despite prior assurances that they would be able to meet); R. 77-7 (attorney stating that it is \"nearly impossible\" for her to meet with her clients \"because they were all transferred ... approximately 4 hours away\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Petitioners additionally note that their Alien files (A-files)-which document their immigration history-and Records of Proceedings (ROP)-which document past proceedings before the immigration courts and BIA-are ordinarily attainable only through a FOIA request and can take months to obtain. (R. 77-28 \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7; R. 77-26 \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9; AILA Br. at 2 (explaining that the motion to reopen \"takes time, in large part due to the government's own bureaucratic weight, the difficulty in obtaining and reviewing records and evidence particularized to each individual respondent, and the sudden strain on a community affected by mass round-up of its members\").) Under normal circumstances, preparing a motion to reopen can take between three and six months. (R. 77-26 \u00b6 12; R. 77-27 \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The majority's assertion that \"[t]he administrative scheme established by Congress even provided multiple avenues to stay removal while pursuing relief\" would carry weight if the Petitioners had had time to pursue the \"multiple avenues,\" or indeed\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   avenue. (Maj. Op. at 876-77.) But when the ICE raids began, Petitioners were faced with the very real possibility that they would be deported before they could reopen their immigration cases and then be imprisoned, tortured, or killed upon removal to Iraq. If the district court had not granted a stay of removal, Petitioners would have quickly been deported far beyond the reach of habeas and the court's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boumediene\n   </em>\n   , 553 U.S. at 787,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674039\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/723/#p745\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"when the judicial power to issue habeas corpus properly is invoked the judicial officer must have adequate authority to make a determination in light of the relevant law and facts and to formulate and issue appropriate orders for relief, including, if necessary, an order directing the prisoner's release\"). The circumstances were such that recourse to the immigration courts, the BIA, and the courts of appeal would not have been an adequate or effective substitute for habeas relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Nor is the district court's application of the Suspension Clause under these circumstances novel or unusual.

We recognize that the Court in\n    <em>\n     Jennings\n    </em>\n    did not rule on whether a court may issue class-wide injunctive relief on the basis of constitutional claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n     138 S.Ct. at 851\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . However, in declining to rule on this issue,\n    <em>\n     Jennings\n    </em>\n    leaves in place the holding from\n    <em>\n     Reno\n    </em>\n    that \u00a7 1252(f)(1) bars injunctive relief-period. Absent an explicit holding otherwise, we see no way to interpret\n    <em>\n     Reno\n    </em>\n    to allow injunctive relief on\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    basis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    The dissent claims also that \u00a7 1252(f)(1) does not bar declaratory relief. Be that as it may, both parties agree in their letter briefs that the issue of declaratory relief is not before us. Even if it were before us, we are skeptical Petitioners would prevail. It is true that \"declaratory relief will not always be the functional equivalent of injunctive relief.\"\n    <em>\n     Alli v.

But in this case, it is the functional equivalent. The practical effect of a grant of declaratory relief as to Petitioners' detention would be a class-wide injunction against the detention provisions, which is barred by \u00a7 1252(f)(1).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    <em>\n     Reno\n    </em>\n    expressly rejected the view that \u00a7 1252(f)(1) provides \"an affirmative grant of jurisdiction\" over class-based challenges to removal decisions.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 482,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p482\">\n     119 S.Ct. 936\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Jennings\n    </em>\n    , the Court rejected the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that the doctrine of constitutional avoidance requires that \u00a7 1225(b) and \u00a7 1226(c) be interpreted to include a 6-month limit on mandatory detentions and to require bond hearings after that point,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n     138 S.Ct. at 846\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , explaining that the sections are unambiguous as to the permissible length of detention and do not authorize bond hearings.
