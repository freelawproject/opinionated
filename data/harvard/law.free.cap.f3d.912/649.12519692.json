The district court granted the Credit Union's Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss. Because we agree that appellant lacks constitutional standing, we now affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Department of Labor Federal Credit Union, the appellee, is a federal credit union that, under the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934, accepts as members only those who share the \"common bond\" of being current and former employees of the Department of Labor and their immediate families and households.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201759\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Only members can take advantage of the Credit Union's products or services; only members may open an account or take out a loan or enjoy in any way the benefits of the Credit Union. The Credit Union maintains a website that describes its services and products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Clarence Griffin, the appellant, is a blind resident of Virginia. Because of his visual impairment, Griffin uses a screen reader to access the Internet. As he explains in his complaint, screen readers help the blind access the Internet by reading aloud the text that appears on a website. Website operators often take special care to ensure their sites are legible to screen readers. Many visually impaired people like Griffin also rely more heavily on keyboards than mouses to navigate the Internet. Because of this, it is recommended that website operators avoid \"redundant links,\" which can be tedious and time-consuming for keyboard users to navigate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Griffin is not eligible for membership in the Credit Union. He does not work for the Department of Labor and never has in the past. No one in his immediate family has ever worked for the Department of Labor, nor has any member of his household. He makes no allegation in his complaint that he is legally permitted to make use of the Credit Union's benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to his complaint, Griffin tried to access the Credit Union's website in October of 2017. He alleges his attempt was stymied in three ways. First, there were linked images that lacked \"alternative text.\" As a consequence, Griffin's screen reader could not describe those images to him and he could not navigate to the linked content. Second, there were \"redundant links.\" This meant Griffin had to take additional, unnecessary steps to make full use of the site. And third, \"form labels\" were missing. Griffin could not tell when the website wanted him to input information that is often necessary to access the site further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Griffin sued, arguing that the Credit Union's failure to make reasonable modifications to its policies and practices that would make its site accessible to the disabled violated the Americans with Disabilities Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . The complaint sought injunctive relief as well as costs and attorney's fees. The Credit Union moved to dismiss for lack of standing, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), which the district court granted. Griffin now appeals this dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Griffin puts his case in broad terms, claiming that the rights generally of people with disabilities to sue for Internet-based harms under the ADA are at stake. But that question is not before us. This case concerns the application of standing doctrine in an electronic age and it is important that we move narrowly in exploring this new territory. Accordingly, we address only whether this plaintiff\n   <em>\n    who is barred by law from making use of defendant's services\n   </em>\n   may sue under the ADA for an allegedly deficient website. The answer to this narrow question here is no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Article III limits the judicial power of the United States to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\" Embedded in this limitation is a \"set of requirements that together make up the 'irreducible constitutional minimum of standing.' \"\n   <em>\n    Lexmark Intern., Inc. v.

But, a person who, as a vocation,\n   <em>\n    studies\n   </em>\n   Asian elephants in the part of the world in question \"plausib[ly]\" has enough of a connection to convert the general harm to the species into a particular harm to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Griffin has not pointed to any connection between the defendant and himself that transforms the general harms he alleges into particularized ones.

Those staff privileges supplied the requisite connection between plaintiff and defendant that converted an otherwise general harm into a particular one. Likewise, visits to a physical location may supply a particularizing connection, as they differentiate the plaintiff from the general public who are barred by distance from ever making such a visit.

The first requirement, a past injury that is concrete and particular, is not met for reasons explained above. And the second requirement is unmet because, unlike the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Nanni\n   </em>\n   , Griffin has not demonstrated that his intent to return to the Credit Union's website is plausible. Indeed, there are reasons to think it is objectively implausible: why would an individual with no hope of ever making use of the Credit Union's services want to visit a website describing those services? In short, Nanni could take advantage of the store's wares and accommodations. Griffin, by contrast, is ineligible for perfectly neutral reasons to utilize the Credit Union's services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Griffin points to his status as an ADA tester.

But by the same token it cannot create standing in the absence of an otherwise plausible assertion that a return to the website would allow Griffin to avail himself of its services. Even in\n   <em>\n    Houston v. Marod Supermarkets\n   </em>\n   , a case relied on heavily by Griffin, tester status, while a factor in favor of the plaintiff, was insufficient to show a threat of future injury without more.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3714027\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/1323/#p1326\">\n    733 F.3d 1323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1334 (11th Cir. 2013). The Eleventh Circuit explained that the tester-plaintiff's assertion that he would return to the ADA-noncompliant supermarket was plausible only because, even though it was not the closest market to his home, the plaintiff passed the store \"regularly\" on his trips to Miami-Dade County.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3714027\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/1323/#p1326\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3714027\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/1323/#p1326\">\n    at 1336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff does mention ATMs in his complaint, stating that they are \"available to Defendant's members,\" J.A. 15, which, as noted, Griffin plainly is not.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
