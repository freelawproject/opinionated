But the text of Title VII, as well as the\n   legislative context and purpose, plainly states that a claimant may commence a civil action 180 days from \"the filing of the\n   <em>\n    initial charge\n   </em>\n   .\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) (emphasis added). We, therefore, reverse the district court and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Stewart worked as a patent examiner for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\"). He suffers from bulging discs in his lower back and radiculopathy, resulting from compression of his sciatic nerve, as well as post- and continuous-traumatic stress disorder. Because of these medical conditions, Stewart filed a reasonable accommodation request with the PTO in April 2014. Specifically, he requested that he not be required to (1) come into work at a specified, mandatory time; (2) report his work schedule to his supervisor; and (3) schedule his meetings before 12:00 p.m., as his pain medications caused morning grogginess. In addition, Stewart requested an ergonomic chair and keyboard, a standing desk, and a foot stool.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 19, 2014, the PTO granted Stewart's requests for the keyboard, standing desk, and foot stool. Stewart had already received an ergonomic chair by that point. Regarding his work schedule, the PTO determined that Stewart was already on the Increased Flexitime Program work schedule, which permitted him sufficient flexibility to \"work around any difficulties\" and that Stewart's supervisor, when possible, would schedule meetings specifically designed for Stewart after 12:00 pm. However, the PTO denied Stewart's request not to report his work schedule to his supervisor, as such a request would unduly burden his supervisor and the agency's ability to oversee and administer Stewart's work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Stewart filed a formal complaint with the PTO's Office of Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity on July 14, 2015, challenging the PTO's denial of his request for accommodations, asserting a hostile work environment and discrimination, and alleging various claims of retaliation. Stewart amended this administrative complaint eight times. After each of these amendments, the PTO's Office of Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity responded with a notice advising Stewart that (1) he may amend his formal complaint at any time before the investigation is complete, and any new claims \"must be like or related to the claims raised\" in the original complaint; and (2) he may \"file a civil action in an appropriate United States District Court at any time after 180 days have passed from the date [he] filed [his] original complaint.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.407\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\" J.A. 114.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 29, 2016-more than 180 days after the filing of his original administrative complaint, but less than 180 days after the filing of several of the amendments-Stewart filed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   a civil action in the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging numerous violations of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Stewart's claims rested on the PTO's alleged failure to accommodate his disabilities; a hostile work environment; reprisal for participating in protected Equal Employment Opportunity activity; disparate treatment discrimination on the basis of disability and failure to accommodate; and retaliation for requesting reasonable accommodation. Stewart later amended the complaint in April 2016, adding two counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The PTO filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Stewart's suit was premature under both 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.407\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) because he had not exhausted his administrative remedies. According to the PTO, Stewart was required to wait to file a civil action until the conclusion of the agency's investigation period. That investigation period is extended when employees amend their administrative complaint to the earlier of 180 days after the last amendment or 360 days after the filing of the initial complaint.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201614.106\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1614.106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2) ; 1614.108(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 17, 2017, the district court dismissed Stewart's case without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court held that Stewart had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies because under Section 1614.407(b), he was required to wait until July 8, 2016, the earlier of 180 days after Stewart's last amendment or 360 days after the filing of his initial complaint, to file a civil action in federal court. Stewart timely appealed the district court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Stewart alleges violations of both the Rehabilitation Act and Title VII. Rehabilitation Act claims \"must comply with the same administrative procedures that govern federal employee Title VII claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson v.

App'x 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 157 (4th Cir. 2004). Section 717, codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16, amended Title VII to permit federal employees to file a civil action for employment discrimination under certain circumstances. Federal employees may file a civil action based upon their administrative complaint (1) within 90 days of receipt of notice of final agency action or (2) after 180 days from \"the filing of the initial charge\" with the agency, if there has been no final agency action on the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In addition to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16, federal regulations govern the process for filing a civil action based on employment discrimination. Congress has delegated to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") the authority to promulgate regulations to implement Title VII.\n   <em>\n    E.E.O.C. v. Randstad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3901604\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/433/#p444\">\n    685 F.3d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 444 (4th Cir. 2012). Accordingly, the EEOC has enacted regulations regarding individuals' ability to (1) amend their administrative complaint and (2) file suit in federal court under Title VII. These regulations reinforce Section 2000e-16. A federal employee may amend a complaint \"at any time prior to the conclusion of the investigation to include issues or claims like or related to those raised in the complaint.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201614.106\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Echoing the language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c), the EEOC's regulations also state that federal employees seeking relief under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act may file a civil action in federal district court \"[a]fter 180 days from the date of filing an individual or class complaint if an appeal has not been filed and final action has not been taken.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.407\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We begin with the threshold question of whether Title VII's 180-day waiting period found in Section 2000e-16(c) is a jurisdictional bar, a question of first impression in this circuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the PTO\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   filed its motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the district court dismissed Stewart's case under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, stating that the \"administrative exhaustion requirements for the Rehabilitation Act and Title VII claims are jurisdictional,\" and Stewart failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. J.A. 234 n.4. For the following reasons, we conclude that the district court incorrectly held that Section 2000e-16(c) 's 180-day waiting period is jurisdictional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Title VII directs federal employees to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit.\n   <em>\n    Pueschel v.

Requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies serves twin objectives: protecting agency authority in the administrative process and \"promot[ing] efficiency\" in the resolution of claims.\n   <em>\n    Woodford v. Ngo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500482\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/81/#p89\">\n    548 U.S. 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 89,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500482\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/81/#p89\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500482\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/81/#p89\">\n    165 L.Ed.2d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). By avoiding the \"premature interruption of the administrative process,\" exhaustion requirements ensure that agencies are provided the first opportunity to \"exercise [ ] discretion\" or \"apply [ ] expertise.\"\n   <em>\n    McKart v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1771532\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/185/#p193\">\n    395 U.S. 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 193-94,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1771532\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/185/#p193\">\n    89 S.Ct. 1657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1771532\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/395/185/#p193\">\n    23 L.Ed.2d 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1969). The 180-day waiting period serves these purposes: it ensures that the employer is \"put on notice of the alleged violations\" to facilitate out-of-court resolution and permits sufficient, but finite, time for the agency to address the discrimination charges in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    Miles v. Dell, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1554055\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/429/480/#p491\">\n    429 F.3d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 491 (4th Cir. 2005). Indeed, courts have regularly characterized Section 2000e-16(c) 's 180-day waiting period as an exhaustion requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murthy v. Vilsack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3551306,3692084\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/609/460/\">\n    609 F.3d 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 465 (D.C.

Unlike most administrative exhaustion requirements premised on agency action, after which injured parties may \"seek review of an adverse decision and obtain a remedy\" if warranted, the 180-day waiting period is satisfied by agency\n   <em>\n    inaction\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Darby v. Cisneros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355960\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/137/#p144\">\n    509 U.S. 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 144,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355960\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/137/#p144\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355960\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/137/#p144\">\n    125 L.Ed.2d 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993) (citation omitted). Indeed, Congress passed Section 2000e-16(c) of Title VII in 1972 precisely because of its recognition that federal employees frequently encountered an \"administrative quagmire\" in filing charges of discrimination. H.R. Rep. 92-238, at 12 (June 2, 1971). The 180-day waiting period therefore \"confines agencies and the EEOC to a tight schedule\" and signals congressional recognition that \"the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies ... had become [a] barrier to meaningful court review.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. Pena,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692103,9046447\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/79/154/\">\n    79 F.3d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 167 (D.C.

In light of this legislative context, the 180-day waiting period functions more like a mandatory procedural hurdle for litigants than an affirmative agency step potentially giving rise to a remedy on review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This distinction informs our consideration of whether Section 2000e-16(c) 's 180-day waiting period requirement is\n   also a jurisdictional requirement. Not all exhaustion requirements are jurisdictional. Rather, we have recognized that certain exhaustion requirements may be jurisdictional while others are not. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Davis v. North Carolina Department of Correction\n   </em>\n   , we specifically distinguished one exhaustion requirement as jurisdictional-the entitlement to a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC-from Title VII's \"timely filing requirements,\" which the Supreme Court has held are not jurisdictional.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7407528\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/48/134/#p140\">\n    48 F.3d 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 140 (4th Cir. 1995) (citing\n   <em>\n    Zipes v.

Here, each of these factors indicates that Stewart's amendments of his complaint did not restart the 180-day clock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We begin with the plain language of the statute. In relevant part, Section 2000e-16(c) permits aggrieved federal employees to file a civil action 180 days \"from the filing of the\n   <em>\n    initial charge\n   </em>\n   with the department, agency, or unit\" if the agency has \"fail[ed] to take final action on his complaint.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) (emphasis added). Given the ordinary meaning of the word \"initial,\" Section 2000e-16(c) requires that the 180-day waiting period begin upon the filing of the\n   <em>\n    first, original\n   </em>\n   charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 1163 (3d ed. 1976) (defining \"initial\" as \"of or relating to the beginning; marking the commencement\"); American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 902 (4th ed. 2009) (defining \"initial\" as \"of, relating to, or occurring at the beginning; first\"). Therefore, in Stewart's case, the 180-day waiting period began on July 14, 2015, the date he filed his \"initial,\" formal administrative complaint of discrimination and retaliation before the PTO's Office of Equal Employment and Diversity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The statute's use of the modifier \"initial\" also implicitly allows for the possibility of subsequent amendments-that there may well be additional \"charge[s]\" that follow the \"initial charge.\" Accordingly, the 180-day waiting period does not reset upon subsequent amendments to the administrative complaint. Had Congress not contemplated the possibility of amendments to the complaint, there would have been no reason to use the word \"initial.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alaska Dep't of Envtl.

First, the PTO argues that Section 2000e-16(c) 's statutory text is \"ambiguous\" because it uses two different terms, \"complaint\" and \"charge.\" Second, the PTO argues that the EEOC's regulations support tethering the 180-day waiting period to the agency's extended investigation period for amended complaints. Third, the PTO argues that should we reverse the district court's holding, we would incentivize gamesmanship in Title VII claims. Each of these arguments is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In support of its first argument-that Section 2000e-16(c) 's statutory text is ambiguous\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   -the PTO emphasizes Congress's use of two terms within the statute: \"complaint\" and \"charge.\" The PTO argues that the term \"complaint\" in Section 2000e-16(c) references \"an employee's general use of the administrative process\" to allege unlawful discrimination, while the phrase \"initial charge\" is \"the first 'statement' \" through which an employee identifies this discrimination. Appellee's Br. at 25-26. To the PTO, it bears significance that Congress did not use the phrase \"initial\n   <em>\n    complaint\n   </em>\n   \" in Section 2000e-16(c) but rather \"initial\n   <em>\n    charge,\n   </em>\n   \" thus indicating that \"Congress did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   seek to trigger the 180-day period upon the commencement of the EEO process generally.\" Appellee's Br. at 26 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Even if we were to accept the PTO's proposed distinction between these two terms, such a distinction does not aid the PTO's position. If we treat \"initial charge\" as the first, informal \"statement\" through which an employee alleges unlawful discrimination, then the 180-day waiting period would be satisfied at the same time or\n   <em>\n    earlier\n   </em>\n   than under the reading we adopt because a \"charge,\" so conceived, never temporally follows a \"complaint.\" Under the PTO's construction, Stewart's \"initial charge\" occurred on April 30, 2015, when he submitted a document to the PTO's Office of Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity alleging harassment and discrimination on the basis of disability. Accepting the PTO's position, then, would only hasten the date upon which Stewart could file a civil action. More significantly, PTO's position in no way explains Congress's express use of the word \"initial,\" which serves as the crux of our construction of Section 2000e-16(c) 's 180-day waiting period. The term \"initial\" makes clear that Congress intended to begin the 180-day waiting period from the filing of the original complaint, regardless of whether subsequent amendments to that complaint are filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, we conclude that these regulations only reinforce our interpretation of Section 2000e-16(c).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.407\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) mirrors the language found in Section 2000e-16(c), providing in relevant part that a complainant is authorized under Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act to file a civil action in federal district court \"[a]fter 180 days from the date of filing an individual or class complaint if an appeal has not been filed and final action has not been taken.\" Given the regulation's use of the term \"individual ...\n   <em>\n    complaint\n   </em>\n   ,\" the PTO cannot dispute that the 180-day waiting period begins upon filing of the individual complaint. Instead, the PTO attempts to wave away the regulation as a \"generic rule,\" but this perfunctory argument is not persuasive. Appellee's Br. at 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The district court, and the PTO, wrongly tether Section 1614.407(b) 's 180-day waiting period to other EEOC regulations extending the agency investigation period when a complaint has been amended to \"within the earlier of 180 days after the last amendment to the complaint or 360 days after the filing of the original complaint.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201614.106\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1614.106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2), 1614.108(f).

We disagree for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   First, as discussed above, the district court's holding is contrary to the plain language of both Section 2000e-16(c) of Title VII and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.407\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Further, Section 1614.407(b) lacks any textual distinction between filing an initial complaint and filing an amendment, which is particularly telling given that other regulations in the same part, such as those governing the agency investigation period,\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   make such a distinction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201614.106\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1614.106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2), 1614.108(f). Section 1614.407(b) does not hinge employees' ability to file a civil action on the conclusion of the agency investigation; rather, it establishes a bright-line 180-day waiting period after which the employee can be \"assured of having reasonably prompt access to the courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3692103,9046447\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/79/154/\">\n    79 F.3d at 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C.

In\n   <em>\n    Hill v. Western Electric Company, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , we recognized the \"generally accepted principle\" that the \"scope of a Title VII lawsuit may extend to 'any kind of discrimination like or related to allegations contained in the charge and growing out of such allegations during the pendency of the case' \" before the agency.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142335\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/672/381/\">\n    672 F.2d 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 390 n.6 (4th Cir. 1982). Put otherwise, an \"administrative charge of discrimination does not strictly limit a Title VII suit which may follow,\" and federal courts may still hear claims that the employee did not raise before the agency, as long as they are \"like or related\" and grow out of the allegations during the pendency of the case before the agency.\n   <em>\n    Sydnor\n   </em>\n   , 681 F.3d at 594.

We have reasoned that retaliation claims constitute a subset of the general rule noted in\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , because \"retaliation claims almost always relate back to previously filed EEO charges, and, therefore, may be raised for the first time in district court without the requirement that a plaintiff have exhausted his administrative remedies.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=139%20F.3d%20888\">\n    139 F.3d at 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, retaliation claims represent the \"inevitable corollary,\" but not the exclusive application, of the \"generally accepted principle\" articulated in\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

We join these circuits today in reiterating our decision in\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Chacko\n   </em>\n   that plaintiffs may bring Title VII claims for the first time before a district court, so long as they are like or reasonably related to charges in the original administrative complaint, and if they reasonably could have developed from the agency's investigation of the original complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142335\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/672/381/\">\n    672 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   390 n.6 ;\n   <em>\n    Chacko\n   </em>\n   , 429 F.3d at 506.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Crucially, this \"like or related\" limitation also allays the PTO's third argument regarding gamesmanship. The PTO argues that should we reverse the district court, a federal employee could file a \"perfunctory\n   initial 'charge,' seek to add new claims immediately before the 180-day 'mark,' and then file a civil action immediately following that same 'mark.' \" Appellee's Br. at 28. First, as discussed above, we already permit courts to adjudicate reasonably related claims not heard in the first instance by agencies. The \"like or related\" limitation limits the universe of charges that the litigant may bring and guards against the gamesmanship concern that litigants will raise wholly unrelated claims for the first time before a district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, as Stewart correctly points out, existing procedural guardrails further protect against such gamesmanship. When amending a complaint before the agency, the employee must file a letter with the agency's Office of Equal Employment Director \"describing the new incident(s) and stating that s/he wishes to amend his/her complaint to include the new incident(s).\" EEOC Mgmt. Directive 110, Ch. 5.B. The Director must then review this request to determine if the claims are like or related, and \"whether a fair and impartial investigation of the new claims can be accomplished within 360 days of the original filed complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . If not, then the individual must start a new administrative process with respect to the new claim. Accordingly, employees cannot game the administrative process in the way suggested by the PTO. Indeed, if we were to accept the district court's holding, we may even risk disincentivizing plaintiffs from bringing a \"like or related\" claim before the agency, as each amendment would only further delay the plaintiff's access to court. Under the district court's reading of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.407\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), a plaintiff might be better served by holding onto their \"like or related\" claims until the filing of a civil action.

Contrary to the district court's holding, Section 2000e-16(c) 's 180-day waiting period operates independently of the agency's extended investigation window for amended complaints.

The record includes no indication that the EEOC concurs in the PTO's construction of Section 2000e-16(c).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
