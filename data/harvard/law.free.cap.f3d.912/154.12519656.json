Put succinctly, Williamson maintains that, as a result of actions of the defendant officials, he suffered in solitary confinement for three-and-a-half years while in pretrial detention, in violation of his Fourteenth Amendment rights. Williamson contends that the district court erred in ruling that his period of solitary confinement was not unconstitutionally punitive and that, if he was deprived of any due process protections, the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williamson v. Sterling\n   </em>\n   , No. 0:15-cv-4755,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201329130\">\n    2017 WL 1329130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.S.C. Apr. 10, 2017), ECF No. 143. As explained below, we affirm the summary judgment awards made by the district court to two officials who were not sufficiently involved in any constitutional deprivations. We vacate the summary judgment awards in favor of two other officials, however, because the court erred in granting them. We therefore affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In November 2015, Williamson - then a twenty-year-old pretrial detainee in one of SCDC's restrictive detention facilities - filed a verified pro se complaint in the District of South Carolina, initiating the lawsuit underlying this appeal. Williamson's initial complaint challenged his conditions of confinement - including their duration - and named as defendants SCDC Director Bryan Stirling, Barnwell County\n   Sheriff Ed Carroll, Deloris Charlton, the Barnwell County jail administrator, and other unidentified officials.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In May 2016, Williamson filed his verified pro se first amended complaint, which added as defendants two Deputy Circuit Solicitors, David Miller and Jack Hammack.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williamson v. Sterling\n   </em>\n   , No. 0:15-cv-4755 (D.S.C. May 2, 2016), ECF No. 41 (the \"Complaint\"). That Complaint constitutes the operative complaint in these proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Complaint alleges, inter alia, that the defendants contravened various constitutional rights and is pursued under \u00a7 1983 of Title 42. Williamson's Fourteenth Amendment claims underlie this appeal and, construed in the proper light, allege substantive and procedural due process claims. On April 10, 2017, the district court awarded summary judgment to the defendant officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In assessing summary judgment awards, we view the facts \"in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Bauer v. Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087262\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/340/#p347\">\n    812 F.3d 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 347 (4th Cir. 2016). The facts recited below are viewed in that light and drawn from the record on appeal, which includes the Complaint and various submissions of the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Griffin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1867581\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/952/820/#p823\">\n    952 F.2d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 823 (4th Cir. 1991) (explaining that a verified complaint is \"the equivalent of an opposing affidavit for summary judgment purposes, when the allegations contained therein are based on personal knowledge\"). Notably, the factual allegations of the Complaint are substantially unchallenged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In August 2013, at the age of seventeen, Williamson was arrested in Barnwell County for murder, armed robbery, and related offenses. Following his arrest, he was denied bail and held in custody at the Barnwell County Detention Center to await trial. Because of the serious nature of the charges, Williamson was assigned to the Detention Center's maximum security unit. While there, Williamson had only an hour a day of recreation - instead of the three hours accorded those in the general population - but otherwise had the same privileges as other pretrial detainees. During the three months he spent at the Detention Center, Williamson was charged with three infractions of the rules of confinement. More specifically, Williamson fought once with an inmate, and he was twice disciplined for placing his spare mattress on the cell floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 22, 2013, Williamson gave Barnwell County correctional officers a letter addressed to Sheriff Carroll. Carroll was then out of town, but asked Chief Deputy David Deering to open the letter. Williamson's letter ranted against several individuals, confessed to murder, and proclaimed the innocence of another man. It also threatened violence against ten law enforcement officers and Judge Early of the State's Second Judicial Circuit, which includes Barnwell County.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 324, 326-27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The letter named three persons that Williamson would talk to regarding his threats, including Agent Croft of the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division (\"SLED\"). Chief Deputy Deering thus contacted Agent Croft, who - with others - interviewed Williamson later that very day. During the interview, Williamson became \"combative\" with the officers,\n   repeated his threats, and struck a correctional officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 324.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Shortly thereafter, a series of phone calls took place involving various officials, including Judge Early and personnel of SLED, the Sheriff's Office, and the Solicitor's Office.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Deputy Solicitor Miller, it was then decided \"that Mr. Williamson needed to be placed in 'safekeeper' status\" in SCDC custody.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 201.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   South Carolina maintains a \"safekeeper\" program that derives from a statutory provision that has been implemented by various state regulations. The relevant statutory provision states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The director of the prison system shall admit and detain in [SCDC] for safekeeping any prisoner tendered by any law enforcement officer in this State by commitment duly authorized by the Governor, provided, a warrant in due form for the arrest of the person so committed shall be issued within forty-eight hours after such commitment and detention.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.C. Code \u00a7 24-3-80. The primary state regulation that implements the safekeeper statutory provision is South Carolina Executive Order 2000-11 (the \"Executive Order\"). It was promulgated in 2000 by then-Governor Hodges and spells out the \"criteria and procedures\" for a pretrial detainee's transfer to \"safekeeper status\" and for his subsequent detention in SCDC custody. Pursuant to the Executive Order, a pretrial detainee may be designated as a safekeeper if he: \"(1) is a high escape risk; (2) exhibits extremely violent and uncontrollable behavior; and/or (3) must be removed from the county facility\" for his own protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To transfer a pretrial detainee to safekeeper status in SCDC custody, the county holding the detainee must prepare and pursue an application that includes the following: (1) an arrest warrant for the detainee; (2) an affidavit of the chief county law enforcement officer explaining the basis for the requested transfer; (3) a certification from the circuit solicitor concurring in the transfer; (4) and a certification that notice of the safekeeping application was given to the detainee's attorney.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Executive Order \u00a7 2. The county submits its safekeeping application to the SCDC Director, who reviews it and makes a recommendation to the Governor. If the Director recommends approval of the application, he provides the Governor with a proposed order. Upon receiving the Director's recommendation, the Governor determines whether to grant the safekeeping application and issue an appropriate order.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 3. If the Governor approves, the county delivers the pretrial detainee into SCDC custody. The county must provide SCDC with \"all appropriate documentation and relevant records,\" including information about any \"special medical\" needs of the transferred detainee.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 4. Pursuant to the Executive Order, the initial safekeeper order is valid for up to 120 days.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 5. The safekeeper order may thereafter be renewed \"for up to ninety (90) days upon a showing of good cause and/or no material change in circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   SCDC has promulgated additional procedures that govern the handling of pretrial detainees who have been designated as safekeepers (the \"SK Policy\"). According to the SK Policy, male safekeepers are to \"be received and processed at Lee Correctional Institution.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 319. The SK Policy confirms that a safekeeper order \"may be renewed for up to 90 days at a\n   time\" and provides that safekeeper pretrial detainees will be housed in a Special Management Unit (\"SMU\") and segregated from other SCDC inmates in the SMU.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 319-21. Safekeeper pretrial detainees are assigned to confinement classification \"SD Level II,\" the second-most restrictive of five confinement classifications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 321, 421.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following Williamson's problematic behavior on November 22, 2013, Barnwell County officials promptly prepared a safekeeper application for him. Chief Deputy Deering - acting for Sheriff Carroll - executed an affidavit recounting the threats made in Williamson's letter and in his interview with Agent Croft. Deputy Solicitor Miller certified that he had served notice of the safekeeper application on Williamson's defense attorney. The safekeeper application included copies of the warrants for Williamson's arrest, plus medical and mental health screening forms for Williamson recently completed by Barnwell County officials. Finally, Judge Early signed a \"safekeeping order,\" prepared by Miller, finding that Williamson had exhibited \"extremely violent and uncontrollable behavior\" and qualified for safekeeper status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 211. In fact, however, such a court order was not a required component of the safekeeper application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Executive Order \u00a7 2. As a result, the court's \"safekeeping order\" was \"never acted upon or served on anyone.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 201.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On November 22, 2013, SCDC Director Stirling received Barnwell County's safekeeper application for Williamson. Stirling recommended approval thereof to then-Governor Haley, who approved the safekeeper order. On November 25, 2013, Williamson was delivered into SCDC custody. Although SCDC normally housed male safekeepers at the Lee Correctional Institution under the SK Policy, SCDC instead placed Williamson in another facility, that is, the Maximum Security Unit (\"MSU\") at Kirkland Correctional Institution. Director Stirling attested that the Kirkland MSU has \"more security staff,\" which was appropriate in light of Williamson's threats.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 312.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   According to the Complaint, pretrial detainee Williamson was, as a safekeeper, subjected to solitary confinement, with no outdoor exercise and limited access to books and other materials. Other than leaving his cell about twice a week to shower, Williamson was \"on lockdown 24 hours a day.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 68. Williamson's defense counsel had difficulty communicating with Williamson under those conditions and sought his transfer to less restrictive custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In August 2015 - nearly two years after Williamson's transfer to the Kirkland MSU - SCDC transferred him to the Restricted Housing Unit (\"RHU\") at Lee Correctional Institution. Williamson's conditions of confinement at the Lee RHU, however, largely replicated the conditions imposed on him at the Kirkland MSU.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At a bond hearing conducted in the Second Circuit on November 3, 2015 - more than 700 days after Williamson's transfer to safekeeper status - Williamson's counsel advised the court that Williamson had been \"on lock down, 24 hours a day\" at the Kirkland MSU, that he remained \"locked down 24 hours a day\" at the Lee RHU,\n   and that he had limited access to the law library and phones.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 530-31.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clarence Rogers, the Unit Manager at the Lee RHU, attested that safekeepers only leave their cells to shower three times a week, for recreation twice a week, and for an occasional haircut. The SCDC policies reflect that safekeepers receive recreation time in \"outdoor cages,\" separate from other inmates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 307, 321, 423. Safekeepers can only access an automated law library upon request. Additional restrictions at the Lee RHU included the following: no canteen privileges; limited reading materials; no visiting privileges with family and friends; no personal phone calls; and no interactions with other inmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In sum, while in safekeeper status, Williamson was solitarily confined in his cell approximately twenty-three hours a day five days a week, and twenty-four hours a day two days a week. He spent those hours in isolation, with almost no human contact other than interactions with prison staff and communications with his lawyer. According to Williamson, he was so confined until June 2017, when he was transferred from the Lee RHU to the Barnwell County Detention Center for trial - approximately 1300 days after his placement in solitary confinement as a safekeeper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Br. of Appellant 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   To maintain Williamson in solitary confinement as a safekeeper, Barnwell County officials and SCDC Director Stirling were obliged to obtain renewal safekeeping orders every ninety days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Executive Order \u00a7 5. The record, however, does not include all the renewal orders necessary to sustain Williamson's safekeeper status for the prolonged period he was so held. It contains certain memoranda from Director Stirling to Governor Haley recommending renewals and several of the Governor's final approval orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 547-63. The record does not, however, contain any requests from Barnwell County for renewal of Williamson's safekeeper status. Director Stirling's memoranda to Governor Haley recite - in boilerplate language - that he \"received appropriate documentation from Barnwell County\" in support of renewals.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 550. And Stirling has attested that he regularly received such renewal requests from Barnwell County and found each to be \"in order.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 312-13. No such documentations, however, are in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In sum, despite the Executive Order's requirement that safekeeper renewal requests be based upon \"good cause and/or\" a showing of \"no material change in circumstances,\" the record does not fully disclose the bases for Williamson's continuing safekeeper designation. The evidence regarding Williamson's conduct while he remained in safekeeper status as a pretrial detainee consists solely of correspondence from the Kirkland MSU staff affirming that, as of May 28, 2015, Williamson had committed no disciplinary infractions while in SCDC custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At some point during his solitary confinement as a safekeeper, Williamson began\n   experiencing significant mental health symptoms. His medical records show that SCDC began treating him in May 2015 for \"unspecified psychosis, grief, nightmares, [and] depression.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 166. The record also shows that Williamson advised SCDC medical personnel that he previously \"had ADHD and bipolar,\" but that he stopped taking medications in high school.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 165. By April 14, 2016 - after about two-and-a-half years of solitary confinement - Williamson was taking anti-psychotic medications, which he had never before used. He continued to receive mental health services - including various prescriptions - from SCDC through at least November 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The record does not reveal the state of Williamson's mental health at the time of his transfer to safekeeper status in November 2013. Section 6 of the Executive Order provides, however, that mentally-ill detainees \"are not eligible for safekeeping.\" The Mental Health Screening Form for Williamson that Barnwell County submitted with his initial safekeeper application does not flag any existing mental health issues. That Form, however, consists only of twelve yes or no questions aimed at evaluating a detainee's risk of suicide. And Director Stirling's memorandum recommending the Governor's approval of Williamson's initial safekeeper application confirms the Executive Order's exclusion of mentally-ill detainees from the safekeeping program, and may indicate its potential applicability to Williamson. Stirling wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   This is to advise you that the documentation [from Barnwell County] is sufficient to grant the [safekeeper] transfer for Detainee Williamson. However, as you are aware, Executive Order 2000-11 specifically states that 'Mentally ill or retarded individuals are not eligible for safekeeping at the Department of Corrections.' Therefore, SCDC reserves the right to return Detainee Williams [sic] to Barnwell County Detention Center.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 204. Director Stirling did not, however, comment on Williamson's mental health condition at that time. Despite Williamson's emerging mental health symptoms and problems while he remained in safekeeper status, there is no indication in the record that they were considered when that status was repeatedly renewed every ninety days - approximately thirteen times - for three-and-a-half years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As noted, on June 15, 2017, a jury acquitted Williamson of the murder charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Williamson\n   </em>\n   , No. 2013A0610400187 (S.C. 2d Cir. Ct. Gen. Sess.). In February 2018, Williamson pleaded guilty to armed robbery and was sentenced to time served plus five years of probation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Williamson\n   </em>\n   , No. 2013A0620100094 (S.C. 2d Cir. Ct. Gen. Sess.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The remaining charges against him were dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The pro se verified Complaint alleged, inter alia, that the defendants had erroneously designated Williamson as a safekeeper, imposed punitive conditions on him without notice and hearing, and thereby denied his due process rights. Supporting the due process claims, the Complaint included the following allegations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 Williamson was not granted \"a hearing or a notice\" before his \"punitive\" removal from the Barnwell County Detention Center,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 10;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 Williamson did not receive notice or a hearing before his transfer to SCDC custody and the SCDC MSU \"for punitive reasons,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 11;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \u2022 While in SCDC custody, Williamson wrote various corrections officials seeking information regarding the basis for his designation as a safekeeper,\n   <em>\n    see id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 13-21;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \u2022 Williamson's conditions at both the Lee and Kirkland Correctional Institutions were \"punitive,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, 25-30; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 Williamson was a pretrial detainee protected from \"any punishment\" but he nevertheless remained \"on lockdown 24 hours a day,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 26.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Complaint included additional allegations setting forth Williamson's \"Legal Claims,\" though it did not identify separate causes of action. Williamson invoked the \"14th Amendment Due Process Clause\" in discussing the lack of notice or hearing prior to his transfer to SCDC as a safekeeper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 38. He identified two \"liberty interest[s]\" that had been infringed.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Williamson characterized the first liberty interest as arising from his \"substantive due process\" right to be free from \"any type of punishment\" as a pretrial detainee, as established in 1979 by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Bell v. Wolfish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780223\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/520/\">\n    441 U.S. 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780223\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/520/\">\n    99 S.Ct. 1861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780223\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/520/\">\n    60 L.Ed.2d 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . He asserted a separate liberty interest arising from South Carolina's safekeeper regulations.\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 39-41. Thus, Williamson raised, inter alia, two distinct theories of liability: one theory - the substantive due process claim - derived from the punitive conditions imposed on him as a safekeeper; and the second theory - the procedural due process claim - arose from lack of notice and hearing regarding his safekeeper status. Based upon those due process claims and supporting allegations, his pro se Complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, punitive damages, and such \"additional relief\" as the court deemed \"just, proper, equitable.\"\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 46-57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In September 2016, the defendants each moved for summary judgment, asserting, among other defenses, that they were not personally responsible for the challenged conduct and the conditions of Williamson's solitary confinement, that Williamson's safekeeper status was not punitive, and that - in any event - they were entitled to qualified immunity. Deputy Solicitor Miller also contended that he was entitled to prosecutorial immunity. The district court referred the defendants' summary judgment motions to a magistrate judge for proposed findings and recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In March 2017, the magistrate judge recommended that each of the defendants' motions be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   , No. 0:15-cv-4755 (D.S.C.

The Magistrate Report determined that, as to Williamson's First, Fourth, and Sixth Amendment claims, he failed to show personal responsibility by any of the defendants for any violations of those rights, as required for a \u00a7 1983 claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   With respect to his Fourteenth Amendment due process allegations - the only claims Williamson pursues in this appeal - the Magistrate Report recommended awarding summary judgment to each of the defendants, for two reasons. First, the Report concluded that Williamson had not been unconstitutionally punished. Although it recognized that the Due Process Clause protects pretrial detainees from restrictions that amount to punishment, the Report determined that Williamson's prolonged conditions of solitary confinement did not constitute punishment. The Report concluded that Williamson's confinement was not punishment, explaining as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Williamson has provided no evidence of an \"express intent to punish\" by the defendants, and the defendants' assertion that Williamson's transfer was necessary for security purposes provides an unrefuted nonpunitive government objective that precludes a reasonable inference of punitive intent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Magistrate Report 6. According to the Report, the defendants' assertion of necessity predicated on security purposes sufficed to prove that, despite his prolonged period of solitary confinement, Williamson had not been unconstitutionally punished as a pretrial detainee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Second, the Magistrate Report determined that the controlling law was unsettled on whether pretrial detainees transferred into \"more restrictive housing for administrative purposes\" are \"owed any level of process under the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Magistrate Report 7. The Report thus recommended that each defendant be granted qualified immunity. Because the Report concluded that its analysis disposed of Williamson's claims, it did not address any issues concerning the defendants' personal involvement in due process violations or Deputy Solicitor Miller's assertion of prosecutorial immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In April 2017, the district court adopted the Magistrate Report - over Williamson's objections - and awarded summary judgment to each of the defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   , No. 0:15-cv-4755 (D.S.C. Apr. 10, 2017), ECF No. 143 (the \"Summary Judgment Order\"). In response to one of Williamson's objections, however, that Order authorized Williamson to amend the Complaint and name additional defendants. Nevertheless, the court simultaneously notified Williamson of his \"right to appeal this Order\" within thirty days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Soon thereafter, Williamson filed a second amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   , No. 0:15-cv-4755 (D.S.C. May 2, 2017), ECF No. 150. That revised pro se pleading contained substantially the same allegations as the operative Complaint that was disposed of by the Summary Judgment Order, but it added two new defendants: RHU manager Clarence Rogers and Debra Eastridge, an SCDC mailroom clerk. During the following week, Williamson noted his appeal from the Summary Judgment Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In response to the second amended complaint, the previously named defendants - Director Stirling, Barnwell County jail administrator Charlton, Sheriff Carroll, Deputy Solicitor Miller, and Deputy Solicitor Hammack - filed new motions to dismiss, which were also referred to the magistrate judge. In June 2017, the magistrate judge recommended the dismissal of the second amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780223\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/520/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 166 (the \"Second Magistrate Report\"). The\n   Second Magistrate Report concluded that, because the district court had already awarded summary judgment to the previously named defendants, Williamson's claims against Stirling, Charlton, Carroll, Miller, and Hammack were \"no longer before the Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 2 n.2. The Second Magistrate Report therefore recommended denying their motions to dismiss as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The substance of the Second Magistrate Report focused on Williamson's Fourteenth Amendment claims against the two defendants newly named in the second amended complaint, Rogers and Eastridge (neither of whom had made an appearance). Applying the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, the magistrate judge determined that - as to Rogers and Eastridge - Williamson failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The Second Magistrate Report thus recommended dismissal of the second amended complaint as to Rogers and Eastridge \"without prejudice and without issuance and service of process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Later that month, the district court adopted the Second Magistrate Report. The court thus dismissed the second amended complaint against Rogers and Eastridge without prejudice and without issuance and service of process. The court also denied as moot the pending motions to dismiss of the five defendants that had already been awarded summary judgment. On the same day, the court entered summary judgment in favor of defendants Stirling, Charlton, Carroll, Miller, and Hammack, and dismissed them with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   ., ECF No. 172. On the other hand, the judgment dismissed Rogers and Eastridge without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Soon thereafter, on June 29, 2017, Williamson's objections to the Second Magistrate Report arrived at the district court. On July 19, 2017, Williamson - who had been proceeding pro se - obtained counsel. That same day, he filed a new notice of appeal, in that his initial notice of appeal had been dismissed. On the following day, the district court entered an \"amended order\" that again adopted the Second Magistrate Report and again dismissed the second amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   , No. 0:15-cv-4755 (D.S.C. July 20, 2017), ECF No. 182 (the \"Amended Final Order\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Amended Final Order correctly observed that Williamson's second notice of appeal transferred jurisdiction to the court of appeals.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1 (citing\n   <em>\n    Grand Jury Proceedings Under Seal v.

With that caveat, the Order identified an exception to the jurisdictional transfer that authorizes a district court to exercise jurisdiction over \"matters in aid of the appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Proceeding \"in aid of\" Williamson's appeal and in \"the interest of justice,\" the district court then considered and rejected Williamson's objections to the Second Magistrate Report.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court then - for the second time - dismissed the second amended complaint as to the two new defendants (Rogers and Eastridge) without prejudice and without issuance and service of process. It also again denied the pending motions to dismiss as moot. On July 20, 2017, the court entered an amended judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williamson\n   </em>\n   , No. 0:15-cv-4755 (D.S.C. July 20, 2017), ECF No. 183 (the \"Amended Judgment\"). The Amended Judgment again awarded summary judgment to defendants Stirling, Charlton, Carroll, Miller, and Hammack, and it again\n   dismissed the claims against them with prejudice. The Amended Judgment also dismissed the claims against Rogers and Eastridge without prejudice. On July 25, 2017, Williamson again noticed an appeal - his third such notice - from the judgments and all rulings related thereto. During the pendency of his appeal, Williamson voluntarily dismissed his claims against Hammack (in September 2017), and his claims against Eastridge (in November 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   We heard argument in this appeal on September 25, 2018.

In the alternative, Williamson asserts that, if the Amended Judgment was not an appealable final decision when entered, his dismissals with prejudice of Rogers and Eastridge have conclusively established the existence of \u00a7 1291 jurisdiction.

Before we can address those questions, however, we must resolve two threshold issues: whether we possess appellate jurisdiction and whether Williamson's \u00a7 1983 claims for due process violations are moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The jurisdiction of a court of appeals is generally limited to the review of final decisions made by the district courts, within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and to the review of certain interlocutory orders, as provided for in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goode v.

Because this appeal does not fall under any of the narrow categories identified in \u00a7 1292, we must assess whether the district court rendered a final decision within the meaning of \u00a7 1291.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   This jurisdictional issue arises for the most part from the fact that two defendant officials - newly named in Williamson's second amended complaint - were initially dismissed without prejudice. Generally, a plaintiff \"may not appeal the dismissal of his complaint without prejudice unless the grounds for dismissal clearly indicate that no amendment in the complaint could cure the defects in the plaintiff's case.\"\n   <em>\n    Domino Sugar Corp. v.

Lastly, an order is generally not a final decision until the court \"has resolved\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   claims as to all parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346837\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/694/#p696\">\n    803 F.3d at 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The procedural circumstances of this litigation - although unusual - show that the Amended Judgment of July 20, 2017, constitutes an appealable final decision. On the one hand, a dismissal without prejudice \"for failure to plead sufficient facts\" generally is not deemed to be final.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goode\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362892\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/807/619/#p623\">\n    807 F.3d at 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Importantly, as related in the Amended Final Order, the district court was acting \"in aid of\" Williamson's appeal,\n   recognizing an exception to our assumption of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Final Order 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Regardless of such legal distinctions, however, we need not predicate appellate jurisdiction solely on the finality of the Amended Judgment at the time it was entered.

As our distinguished former colleague Judge Sprouse carefully explained, the doctrine of \"cumulative finality\" authorizes us to exercise appellate jurisdiction where all claims as to all parties are disposed of while the appeal is pending, and where the district court could have certified the challenged order for immediate appeal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 345-47 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Houck v.

Thus, all of Williamson's claims in the district court have been finally resolved. In these circumstances, the doctrine of cumulative finality applies, and we possess \u00a7 1291 jurisdiction in this appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Houck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275368,5917484\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/473/\">\n    791 F.3d at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Turning to the second threshold issue, the defendants contend on appeal that Williamson's \u00a7 1983 due process claims are now moot because the relief he sought in his pro se complaints is no longer available. Because \"we do not have jurisdiction over a case if an actual controversy does not exist at the time of appeal,\" we are obliged to resolve the defendants' mootness contention before assessing the merits of Williamson's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cent.

The defendants then emphasize that punitive damages are unavailable when compensatory damages are neither sought nor awarded. And although Williamson sought injunctive relief to secure his release from SCDC custody, the defendants argue, he has now been released from such custody. Because the defendants' contention of mootness construes Williamson's lawsuit too narrowly and the doctrine of mootness too broadly, their mootness contention fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   First, the defendants misapprehend Williamson's requests for relief. Williamson's pro se Complaint seeks any \"additional relief this court deems just, proper, equitable.\" Complaint \u00b6 57.

Their involvement\n   began with Barnwell County's initial application for Williamson's transfer to safekeeper status in November 2013 and continued through the renewals of that status for three-and-a-half years. Throughout that period, Stirling and Carroll authorized and secured Williamson's safekeeper status by seeking and recommending approval by the Governor of the relevant safekeeping orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Executive Order \u00a7\u00a7 2, 5; J.A. 311-13, 547-63, 608. Thus, Williamson has sufficiently demonstrated Director Stirling's and Sheriff Carroll's personal involvement in his extended period of solitary confinement and the related events underlying his \u00a7 1983 due process claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343713\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/766/841/#p850\">\n    766 F.2d at 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   By contrast, Williamson has failed to demonstrate that Charlton and Miller were personally involved in any deprivations of his due process rights. Charlton is the jail administrator for Barnwell County.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 55. She signed off on the handling of Williamson's infractions while he was in Barnwell County's custody.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 47-51. Williamson alleges that Charlton, along with Sheriff Carroll, failed to provide Williamson with notice or a hearing regarding his transfer from Barnwell County custody to safekeeper status.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 70. We are unable to infer, however, that this allegation is based on any personal knowledge by Williamson of the Detention Center's hierarchy or divisions of responsibility. As a result, we are unable to accept that allegation as probative evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1867581\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/952/820/#p823\">\n    952 F.2d at 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the other hand, Charlton has personally attested that she had \"no involvement in the request or execution of placing\" Williamson in SCDC custody as a safekeeper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 271. And there is no evidence to contradict her sworn statement. Williamson thus falls short of establishing Charlton's personal involvement in the alleged due process violations and his claims against her must be rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The issue of Deputy Solicitor Miller's personal involvement in the due process violations presents a closer question. Miller knew of Williamson's problematic conduct on November 22, 2013, but the record fails to show that he sought or secured Williamson's transfer to safekeeper status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 200-01. Miller participated in Williamson's initial safekeeper application in three minor ways. Acting on a request, he prepared an order for Judge Early. Miller later discovered, however, that the order was not required for the safekeeper application, and it \"was never acted upon or served on\" any relevant party.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 201. Miller also served a copy of the safekeeping application on Williamson's defense counsel. And the record suggests that Miller helped deliver some of Williamson's paperwork to the SCDC officials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 201, 214-25. On this record, those events are insufficient to show that Miller was personally involved in any due process deprivations. In these circumstances, no reasonable trier of fact could find that Miller's \"own individual actions\" violated the Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p676\">\n    556 U.S. at 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p676\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Accordingly, defendants Charlton and Miller were entitled to summary judgment on each of the due process claims because they lacked sufficient personal involvement in the alleged constitutional deprivations.

Although the Complaint alleges both substantive and procedural due process violations, the Magistrate Report and the district court failed to properly distinguish and analyze those claims.

Evaluating those allegations in context, the Complaint sufficiently states a substantive due process claim. The Complaint also identifies two \"liberty interest[s]\" that were allegedly violated, and it asserts that Williamson \"should have been given a trial type hearing\" before being transferred to safekeeper status.\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 38-42. Liberally construed, those contentions and the related allegations are sufficient to also state a viable procedural due process claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   We are therefore satisfied that the Complaint alleges substantive and procedural due process claims arising from Williamson's solitary confinement as a safekeeper. In the district court, however, neither the parties nor the court differentiated those claims. The Magistrate Report impliedly considered both claims, but failed to explicitly distinguish them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Magistrate Report 5-9. And neither that Report nor the Summary Judgment Order properly applied the legal principles that control substantive and procedural due process claims being pursued by a pretrial detainee.

Director Stirling and Sheriff Carroll respond by arguing that protecting the targets of Williamson's threats constituted a legitimate, nonpunitive basis for his prolonged conditions of solitary confinement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   After considering those contentions, the Magistrate Report accepted the defendants' asserted purpose for Williamson's three-and-a-half years of solitary confinement as \"an unrefuted nonpunitive government objective that precludes a reasonable inference of punitive intent.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Magistrate Report 6.

And the record shows no additional infractions or threats during the time Williamson was in SCDC custody. A jury could decide that this lack of subsequent misconduct undermines the proffered rationale for Williamson's period of solitary confinement for two good reasons. First, it would support a jury finding that three-and-a-half years of solitary confinement was excessive for an isolated incident, and was therefore punitive within the meaning of\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   . Second, Williamson's good behavior casts substantial doubt on the propriety of the renewals of his safekeeper status. Pursuant to the Executive Order, such safekeeper orders could only be renewed \"upon a showing of good cause and/or no material change in circumstances.\" Although an improved disciplinary record could obviously be a material change in circumstances, it was not a change that was ever considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The record fails to shed any further light on the decisionmaking process underlying the multitude of renewals of Williamson's safekeeper status. Although Sheriff Carroll may have offered Director Stirling some asserted \"good cause\" for Williamson's continued detention - as required by the Executive Order - the district court lacked documentation to support Stirling's renewal recommendations. And Stirling's memoranda - at least those of record - were perfunctory, containing the same boilerplate language over three-and-a-half years.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 552, 556. None even mentions Williamson's improved disciplinary record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Nor did Director Stirling ever address Williamson's worsening mental health symptoms - a striking omission in view of the exclusion of mentally-ill pretrial detainees from South Carolina's safekeeper program. Put simply, the fact that Williamson's safekeeper status and his solitary confinement conditions remained unchanged,\n   despite demonstrable differences in his circumstances, leads to an inference of rote renewals. Such \"rubber-stamp[ing]\" not only ignores the mandates of the Executive Order, it constitutes compelling evidence of \"arbitrary decisionmaking.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Incumaa\n   </em>\n   , 791 F.3d at 534.

That is, they urge us to examine only whether Williamson's initial designation as a safekeeper was reasonably related to the security concerns raised by his threatening letter.

The\n   <em>\n    Incumaa\n   </em>\n   record was also fuzzy as to whether the prisoner was accorded an opportunity to secure his release from those conditions (Incumaa had been confined for twenty years, rather than\n   three).\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 519, 532.

In support of the inquiry examining the relationship between the condition imposed and its purported rationale, the\n    <em>\n     Bell\n    </em>\n    Court considered, inter alia: whether the conditions constituted \"an affirmative disability or restraint,\" whether they have \"historically been regarded as a punishment,\" whether they promote \"the traditional aims of punishment,\" such as retribution and deterrence, and the conditions of detention viewed as a whole, including the duration for which they were imposed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780223\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/520/\">\n     441 U.S. at 536-38, 543\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780223\" index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/520/\">\n     99 S.Ct. 1861\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"25\">\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    As explained herein,\n    <em>\n     Bell\n    </em>\n    established the relevant inquiry for identifying \"punitive\" actions that contravene the substantive due process rights of pretrial detainees. It also guides the distinction between \"disciplinary\" and \"administrative\" actions taken against such detainees for purposes of procedural due process. Accordingly, where - as here - the allegations underlying the due process claims are \"coextensive,\" a determination that a restriction is \"punitive\" may also confirm that the restriction was \"disciplinary.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Stevenson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3563789\" index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/62/#p70\">\n     495 F.3d at 69\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Nevertheless, we recognize that the two claims are distinct, and preserve the possibility that, for example, a jail official might have provided sufficient process in connection with a disciplinary measure to avoid liability on a procedural due process claim, while the discipline itself was so excessive or arbitrary that the detainee could yet prevail on a substantive due process claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Surprenant\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8922127\" index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/424/5/#p17\">\n     424 F.3d at 13\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Importantly, the\n    <em>\n     Bell\n    </em>\n    factors could also show that a restriction imposed on a pretrial detainee was \"disciplinary\" but - if it was reasonably related and proportional to the detainee's misconduct during detention - that restriction would not be \"punitive\" for purposes of a substantive due process claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780223\" index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/520/\">\n     441 U.S. at 540\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780223\" index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/520/\">\n     99 S.Ct. 1861\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    Although\n    <em>\n     Wilkinson\n    </em>\n    is an important precedent in the body of law providing the defendants with fair notice of their due process obligations to pretrial detainees, that decision alone was not sufficient notice to bar the defendants' claims of qualified immunity.
