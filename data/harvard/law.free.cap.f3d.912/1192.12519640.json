The district court, on cross-motions for summary judgment, held that Fannie Mae was a \"consumer reporting agency\" within the meaning of the FCRA. We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Fannie Mae is a government-sponsored entity created by Congress in 1938. Its mission is to provide liquidity and \"stability in the secondary market for residential mortgages.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201716\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To fulfill its mission, Fannie Mae purchases mortgage loans from certain lenders. Specific guidelines and requirements, detailed in a publicly available manual known as the \"Selling Guide,\" dictate which loans Fannie Mae will purchase. Lenders can use the Selling Guide to determine whether Fannie Mae will purchase the loans that they originate. Using the Selling Guide to evaluate a loan's eligibility for purchase is called \"manual underwriting.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Lenders also have the option to automate the underwriting process through Fannie Mae's proprietary software, called Desktop Underwriter (DU). DU automatically applies the guidelines and requirements dictated in the Selling Guide. Fannie Mae licenses DU to many different lenders. DU allows a lender to enter information about the borrower and the property that is the subject of the loan. The lender can also contract with credit bureaus-like Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian-to pay for and import the borrower's credit report into DU. The lender then uses DU to underwrite the loan. DU analyzes all the inputted or imported information, and it provides a report, called DU Findings, on a loan's eligibility for purchase by Fannie Mae. Besides initially creating and then updating the computer code comprising DU, no individual or entity at Fannie Mae is involved in the process of generating DU Findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Relevant to the Zabriskies, the Selling Guide states that Fannie Mae will not purchase a loan for a certain period after a borrower experiences a \"significant derogatory event,\" such as a foreclosure. For example, Fannie Mae will not purchase a loan if the borrower experienced a foreclosure within the past seven years. It will not purchase a loan if the borrower experienced a preforeclosure or short sale within the past two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Zabriskies had a \"significant derogatory event\"-a short sale after defaulting on their prior mortgage. After waiting two years, they attempted to refinance their current mortgage, and a number of lenders used DU to ascertain whether a loan to them would be eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae. Three of the eight DU Findings created in evaluating the Zabriskies' prospective loan stated that the loan was ineligible due to a foreclosure reported within the last seven years. It is undisputed that the Zabriskies did not have a prior foreclosure within the last seven years before the DU Findings were generated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Zabriskies sued Fannie Mae, arguing that it \"falsely communicated to multiple of the Zabriskies' potential mortgage lenders through its electronic platform that they had a prior foreclosure on a mortgage account.\" They sued under the FCRA, which requires a consumer reporting agency to follow \"reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy\" of consumer information. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681e(b). On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court held that Fannie Mae acts as a consumer reporting agency when it licenses DU to lenders and that it is therefore subject to the FCRA. The case went to trial, and the jury was instructed that \"[i]n connection with its actions in this case Fannie Mae is a 'consumer reporting agency,' [and] the DU findings are 'consumer reports.' \" The jury returned a verdict for the Zabriskies, awarding $30,000 in damages. The district court also awarded the Zabriskies $652,711.72 in attorney's fees and $68,312.18 in costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201716\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1681o(a)(2) (shifting fees and costs to the plaintiff \"in the case of any successful action to enforce any liability under\" the FCRA).

Here, Fannie Mae does not assemble or evaluate information when a lender uses DU. Lenders assemble the consumer information by inputting it into DU or electronically importing reports from credit bureaus. Lenders contract with and pay the credit bureaus for the reports. Lenders decide if and when to evaluate the information to create DU Findings. In the process of creating, licensing, and updating DU, Fannie Mae does not assemble or evaluate consumer information. DU is merely a tool for lenders to do so. Indeed, counsel for the Zabriskies agreed at oral argument that had another entity-like Google or Microsoft-created DU, that entity would not be considered a consumer reporting agency. The fact that Fannie Mae, not another entity, created DU is a distinction without a difference. The same commonsense principle applies in either case: when a person uses a tool to perform an act, the person is engaging in the act; the tool's maker is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This interpretation of the FCRA aligns with guidelines issued by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which opined that \"[a] seller of software to a company that uses the software product to process credit report information is not a [consumer reporting agency] because it is not 'assembling or evaluating' any information.\" FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION ,\n   <em>\n    40 Years of Experience with the Fair Credit Reporting Act: An FTC Staff Report with Summary of Interpretations\n   </em>\n   , at 29 (2011). Although the FTC is no longer charged with the FCRA's interpretation, we find the FTC's reasoning persuasive for its reliance on the plain meaning of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

They misinterpret\n   <em>\n    Safeco\n   </em>\n   . That case addressed whether Safeco had willfully violated the FCRA. Holding that it had not, the Court pointed to the absence of \"guidance from the courts of appeals or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that might have warned [Safeco] away from the view it took\" of the \"less than-pellucid statutory text.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573430\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/47/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573430\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/47/\">\n    at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573430\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/47/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Besides, the FTC guidelines here\n   merely corroborate our independent interpretation based on the text of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Zabriskies make other arguments that we determine unconvincing. First, they argue that Fannie Mae is a consumer reporting agency by citing evidence of what DU does when lenders use it. This argument implicitly assumes that functions performed by DU are actions performed by Fannie Mae. For example, the Zabriskies highlight the proprietary algorithm created for DU that processes consumer information and that determines whether a loan is eligible for purchase. But what\n   <em>\n    lenders\n   </em>\n   do through DU's algorithm is not probative of what\n   <em>\n    Fannie Mae\n   </em>\n   does. The only proffered evidence of Fannie Mae's actions is that Fannie Mae (1) stores backups of software-generated case files and (2) updates DU's database requirements for information imported from credit bureaus. None of this activity shows that Fannie Mae assembles or evaluates information for the purpose of furnishing a consumer report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Zabriskies next highlight evidence that Fannie Mae considers itself, not the lenders, to be processing consumer information. The licensing agreement between Fannie Mae and the lenders states: \"[a]s Licensee's agent, Fannie Mae shall, and is hereby expressly authorized by Licensee to, obtain Consumer Credit Data for the sole purpose of performing a Prequalification Analysis and/or making an underwriting recommendation.\" However, the agreement also states that it is the licensee-lender who uses DU \"to request and receive Consumer Reports and/or analyze or evaluate Consumer Credit Data in underwriting Mortgage Loan Applications.\" The licensing agreement is thus, at best, inconsistent about who Fannie Mae considers to be processing information when using DU. Furthermore, evidence of what Fannie Mae describes itself in a licensing agreement as doing is, at least in this context, not probative of what Fannie Mae\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Zabriskies next argue that Fannie Mae made a series of judicial admissions that it assembles and evaluates consumer information. The Zabriskies waived or forfeited this argument by not raising it in the district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parker v. Cmty. First Bank (In re Bakersfield Westar Ambulance, Inc.)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12012660,940575\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/123/1243/\">\n    123 F.3d 1243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1248 (9th Cir. 1997) (refusing to consider alleged judicial admissions because they were raised for the first time on appeal and otherwise considering them would be prejudicial). Considering the argument now would be prejudicial because Fannie Mae was deprived the opportunity to amend or explain the purported admission when the record was still open.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12012660,940575\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/123/1243/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, even if we were to consider this argument, the identified statements were taken out of context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In conclusion, Fannie Mae does not engage in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To be a consumer reporting agency, Fannie Mae also must assemble or evaluate consumer information with \"the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(f). \"Consumer report\" means any communication by a consumer reporting agency \"bearing on a consumer's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer's eligibility\" for credit, insurance, employment, or other statutorily enumerated purposes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12012660,940575\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/123/1243/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1681a(d)(1). Fannie Mae argues that, even if it were assembling or evaluating consumer information as a result of DU, it\n   did not do so for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties. It argues that its purpose is only to \"facilitate[e] a transaction between the lender and Fannie Mae.\" Again, we agree with Fannie Mae.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Purpose\" means \"something set up as an object or end to be attained\" or \"intention.\" MERRIAM-WEBSTER ONLINE DICTIONARY , https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/purpose (last visited Nov. 20, 2018).

They argue that these facts belie the true purpose of DU, which is to furnish a consumer report to lenders. This argument is not persuasive.

This case arose because the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) issued reports stating that the Zabriskies had a prior foreclosure when they did not. As a result of the error, they were unable to secure refinancing of the mortgage on their house between May 2012 and August 2013. This is exactly the kind of harm that the Act was designed to prevent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Eight Desktop Underwriter (DU) Findings were generated at the request of lenders who were considering making a loan to the Zabriskies. The reports were based in part on credit information generated by the consumer reporting agencies Equifax, TransUnion and Experian. The credit information contained Manner of Payment (MOP) Codes, which indicate whether an account is current or past due. There was no uniformity in the industry on how these Codes were used, however, and Fannie Mae knew this. It also knew that there was no Code for a short sale. Despite the lack of uniformity and the lack of a short sale code, Fannie Mae programmed DU so that an MOP Code 9 would always be interpreted as a \"collection or charge-off\" and would trigger a message stating that DU had identified a foreclosure or a deed-in-lieu of one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In April 2008, the Zabriskies had a successful short sale of their home, meaning that the home was sold for less than the debt secured by the property and the lien holder agreed to accept less than the full amount owed. The short sale was reported on all of the reports obtained from the consumer reporting agencies, with remarks indicating that the creditor had agreed to accept the sale amount in satisfaction of the debt. The consumer reporting agencies coded the short sale in various ways, including three uses of MOP Code 9. No report mentioned a foreclosure, and the Zabriskies never had one. Op. at 1195-96. Fannie Mae ignored the consumer reporting agencies' remarks and the known ambiguity regarding the use and meaning of MOP Codes and interpreted the three instances of MOP Code 9 as evidence of a foreclosure. Those three DU Findings correctly identified a short sale, but also stated that DU had identified a foreclosure. The DU Findings were issued to the lenders with \"Refer with Caution\" recommendations. As a result of the DU Findings, two lenders denied the Zabriskies' loan applications, even though Kristin Zabriskie had informed them that she and her husband had executed a short sale, not a foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As the district court noted, had Fannie Mae simply reviewed the relevant data and issued a recommendation on whether or not it would purchase the loan, there would likely be no plausible claim under the FCRA. But when Fannie Mae took the additional step of reporting that the Zabriskies had a prior foreclosure-i.e., reporting consumer credit information-it took on the role, and the responsibilities, of a consumer reporting agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Congress's Intention With Regard To Fannie Mae\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As the majority correctly points out, the FCRA differentiates between Fannie Mae and consumer reporting agencies in \u00a7 1681.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681g(1)(B)(ii) ; 1681(1)(C) (distinguishing between a credit score \"generated by an automated underwriting system used by [Fannie Mae]\" and one \"provided by a consumer reporting agency\"). However, this is in a section from whose application Fannie Mae and DU Findings are already expressly excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 1681g(g)(1)(G) (\"As used in this subsection, the term \"person\" does not include [Fannie Mae]\");\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 1681g(f)(2)(A) (excluding DU Findings from the definition of a \"credit score\"). Fannie Mae is referred to as something other than a consumer reporting agency because, for the purposes of this section, it is excluded from the definition of a consumer reporting agency. For all other purposes and sections, however, Fannie Mae is a \"person\" that may, depending on its activities, be subject to the FCRA.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 1681a.

On the facts of this case, I respectfully disagree. It is undisputed that DU uses reference numbers provided by lenders to reach out to consumer reporting agencies and pull credit data (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , assembling) and that it then evaluates that data using algorithms established by Fannie Mae (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , evaluating) to generate a report and recommendation for the lenders. The issue is whether these activities are attributable to Fannie Mae or whether the lenders who subscribe to DU and request DU Findings are the \"persons\" who are assembling and processing consumer information for the purposes of the FCRA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   First, it is worth noting that the FCRA itself makes reference to \"an automated underwriting system\n   <em>\n    used by\n   </em>\n   [Fannie Mae] ...\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681g(g)(1)(A)(ii) (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shaw v.

In the only Ninth Circuit decision to consider whether Fannie Mae assembles and evaluates consumer credit information through DU, this Court found, on identical facts, that the plaintiff's complaint \"contain[ed] sufficient plausible allegations to raise the reasonable inference that Fannie Mae ... qualifies as a \"consumer reporting agency.\"\n   <em>\n    McCalmont\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12393309\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/677/331/#p332\">\n    677 F. App'x at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the majority notes, Fannie Mae acknowledges that it has a continuing role in DU's operations. Op. at 1198. Fannie Mae does not simply sell or license a software program to third parties to do with as they please. Rather, Fannie Mae enters into a Software Subscription Agreement, which states that Fannie Mae is the \"Licensee's agent\" and \"shall\" obtain consumer credit data for the purpose of evaluating the data and making an underwriting recommendation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   There\n   are also several internal guides and other documents\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   that suggest that Fannie Mae considers itself to be processing the data when DU Findings are requested.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Furthermore, the assembling and evaluating takes place on Fannie Mae's network. Lenders can only access DU through a portal on www.FannieMae.com or an integrated third-party loan origination system. Consumer reporting agencies submit data over the \"Fannie Mae network.\" They pay Fannie Mae $1 for each consumer report, and a monthly fee for connectivity to the DU platform. The evidence shows that lenders essentially subscribe for a service provided by Fannie Mae rather than simply purchasing a software program. In fact, it was Fannie Mae that ultimately chose to resolve the inconsistency and ambiguity in DU's use of MOP Code 9 as indicating a foreclosure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The majority finds support in the guidelines issued by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for its conclusion that it is the lenders who assemble and evaluate credit information when they request DU Findings. The FTC opined that \"[a] seller of software to a company that uses the software product to process credit report information is not a [consumer reporting agency] because it is not 'assembling or evaluating' any information.' \" FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION ,\n   <em>\n    40 Years of Experience with the Fair Credit Reporting Act: An FTC Staff Report with Summary of Interpretations\n   </em>\n   , at 29 (2011) (FTC Guidelines). The FTC's opinion was based on a staff letter (FTC Guidelines at 12-13, 29;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Cast, FTC Informal Staff Opinion Letter (Oct. 27, 1997) (FTC Letter) ), and I assume, as did the majority, that the interpretation has some persuasive value. Op. at 1197. Nevertheless, the situation considered by the FTC is substantively different than that which gave rise to the Zabriskies' claims. First, as noted above, Fannie Mae does not sell (or license) DU outright. It retains control over the software product and, acting as the licensee's agent, uses it to assemble and evaluate credit report information upon a lender's request and pursuant to the terms of the Software Subscription Agreement. Fannie Mae is not, therefore, a \"seller of software to a company that uses the software product.\" The FTC hypothetical also assumes that the software provider would \"no longer ha[ve] any connection at all to the information.\" FTC Letter. This is in stark contrast to Fannie Mae, which retains a strong connection with the processed information. The connection is not, as appellees argue, a function of Fannie Mae's continuing role in designing and updating DU's functionality. Rather, it is because DU produces a recommendation on whether or not\n   <em>\n    Fannie Mae\n   </em>\n   -the software provider itself-will ultimately purchase the loan that its own software analyzed for eligibility. Fannie Mae's connection to and interest in the DU Findings supports the conclusion Fannie Mae itself has drawn: that it, rather than the lenders, uses DU to obtain consumer credit information and generate a lending recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The majority's tool analogy, Op. at 1196-97, is unpersuasive because it does not take into account Fannie Mae's acknowledged role in fulfilling a request for DU Findings or its interest in those Findings. To the extent DU can be analogized to a mechanical tool such as a laser measurer,\n   it would be as if Fannie Mae allowed licensees to purchase access to measurements obtained with the tool, but did the measuring itself. The subscriber would identify the gap it wanted measured, and Fannie Mae would point the laser, record the findings, and provide a report including both the raw measurements and a recommendation regarding whether the distance was appropriate or inappropriate for a given use. In this analogy, Fannie Mae has an interest in controlling the measurement and evaluation process because, unless the licensee can show error, Fannie Mae will ultimately rely on its own readings and recommendations when determining whether to, say, fund the licensee's project. A company like Google, on the other hand, does not act as a licensee's agent when its search engine is queried, nor does it have an interest in the results generated by the search engine. Had Google created DU, the district court would have had to consider whether there was evidence that Google was the one assembling and evaluating data at a customer's request (as opposed to the user independently using a program it purchased or licensed) and/or whether DU produces an output of any relevance to Google (which could give rise to an inference that Google, rather than the customer, is responsible for the evaluation on which it will ultimately rely).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Fannie Mae has characterized itself in this litigation as nothing more than a software developer providing a technological resource to lenders. It ignores its outsized role in mortgage lending and mortgage markets, its control over the use of the technology, and its keen interest in the creditworthiness of the consumers whose information DU assembles and evaluates. The characterization of Fannie Mae as a software provider is a smokescreen, akin to Uber Technologies, Inc.'s attempt to masquerade as a technology company rather than a transportation company.\n   <em>\n    O'Connor v. Uber Techs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4269421\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/82/1133/#p1141\">\n    82 F.Supp.3d 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1141 (N.D.

Cal. 2014). Fannie Mae is not a \"technology company\" in any real sense of the phrase: the realities of Fannie Mae's activities and interests related to DU cannot be so easily brushed aside or hidden behind a label.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Manual Underwriting and the Granting of a Waiver\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The majority states that DU \"automatically applies the guidelines and requirements dictated by the Selling Guide\" to determine whether a loan is eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae. Op. at 1195. As the district court observed, however, the Selling Guide directs lenders to consider certain factors, but does not direct how they should be considered. DU, on the other hand, applies Fannie Mae's proprietary algorithms to generate recommendations from the factors. The district court correctly concluded that a lender cannot\n   replicate DU's results simply by following the Selling Guide. Fannie Mae itself advises lenders that, \"[f]or a more precise or definitive recommendation for determining whether to deliver a given mortgage to Fannie Mae, the lender should submit the mortgage application to DU.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   It is for that reason that Fannie Mae treats the results of a manual underwriting and DU Findings differently. In a manual underwriting, because it is the\n   <em>\n    lender\n   </em>\n   who is engaged in the evaluation, the lender is required to make various representations and warranties to Fannie Mae. But when the lender relies on DU, Fannie Mae waives those requirements. If a lender manually underwriting a loan would always reach the same result as DU, there would be no reason to have additional requirements or to grant a waiver. The waiver mechanism further indicates that it is Fannie Mae, rather than the lender, who is engaged through DU in the \"assembling and evaluating\" of information when a lender submits a request for DU Findings. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Fannie Mae's Purpose is to Furnish Consumer Reports to Third Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The majority holds that the purpose of DU Findings is only to inform lenders of whether or not Fannie Mae will purchase a loan, so as to facilitate a transaction between the lender and itself. Op at 1199. With respect, I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In an effort to show that Fannie Mae's purpose is not to furnish a consumer report to a third party, the majority finds that the DU Findings contain no \"new information regarding the borrower's creditworthiness that wasn't already provided by the lender or credit bureau.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1199. That is inaccurate. As the district court noted, it is undisputed that DU reported a foreclosure that did not appear in any data previously submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Furthermore, DU Findings do not consist only of a recommendation on whether or not Fannie Mae will purchase a loan. The Findings are generally five or six pages long and include information about the loan, the property, the consumer's credit history and credit scores, any risk factors, existing credit and liabilities, the consumer's employment and income, a proposed monthly payment, guidance to lenders, and conditions for Fannie Mae's approval. This is far beyond a thumbs up or down indication. It is \"information ... bearing on a consumer's credit worthiness.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). And it is for that reason that DU Findings is \"used ... for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer's eligibility for ... credit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Lenders submit their requests for DU Findings prior to their decisions on whether or not to issue a loan, and use DU's extensive credit risk assessment in making that decision. The majority finds the chronology irrelevant, Op. at 1199, but even the individual responsible for DU stated that the ability \"to determine Fannie Mae's eligibility\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   a lender makes a particular loan ... encourages the making of more mortgage loans to borrowers.\" DU Findings is, in short, a consumer report.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). As Fannie Mae is the entity that furnishes it, Fannie Mae is a consumer reporting agency.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 1681(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Fannie Mae argues that even if lenders\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   use DU Findings to make decisions on whether or not to issue a loan, that is not Fannie Mae's purpose.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 1681(f). Rather, its purpose is to facilitate a transaction between the lender and potential borrower. Fannie Mae asserts that it is what the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) calls a \"joint user\" of the credit information. CFPB's Supervision and Examination Manual (Aug. 2018) (CFPB Manual) at 782. As Fannie Mae and the lender \"are jointly involved in the decision\n   to approve a consumer's request for a product or service,\" they can share consumer credit information without becoming consumer reporting agencies.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . This is unpersuasive. Fannie Mae's participation ends at the point at which it provides its consumer report to the lender. The lender certainly uses Fannie Mae's DU Findings in making a decision on whether or not to issue a loan to a borrower, but it does not in any way involve Fannie Mae as an entity in that decision. Fannie Mae is no more a joint user than Equifax or TransUnion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Nor does Fannie Mae's role as an agent of the lender,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1204-05, suggest otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FTC Guidelines at 31. Fannie Mae cites only to a single out-of-circuit case that accepted that argument.\n   <em>\n    Weidman v. Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9185399\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/338/571/#p575\">\n    338 F.Supp.2d 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 575 (E.D.

It has since been discredited.\n   <em>\n    Adams v. Nat'l Eng'g Serv.

Approve/Eligible means that the risk of the loan is acceptable, and it is eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae. Approve/Ineligible means that that the risk of the loan is acceptable, but it is not eligible for delivery to Fannie Mae. If Fannie Mae's purpose were only to communicate whether or not it will purchase a loan, or to facilitate a transaction, two recommendations, Eligible or Ineligible, would suffice. It is because Fannie Mae's purpose is to furnish consumer reports to third parties so that they may make informed lending decisions that DU Findings includes an \"Approve\" component. It is, therefore, a consumer reporting agency. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   V.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   This Court has observed that, \"given the ubiquity and importance of consumer reports in modern life-in employment decisions, in loan applications, in home purchases, and much more-the real-world implications of material inaccuracies in [the] reports seem patent on their face.\"\n   <em>\n    Robins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275543\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1108/#p1114\">\n    867 F.3d at 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As DU's recommendation is based upon an evaluation of the same credit data on which a lender bases its decision on whether or not to issue a loan, it is understandable that a lender would interpret Fannie Mae's rejection as an indication that something about the borrower or the loan makes it a risky transaction. Moreover, the recommendation means that Fannie Mae is unlikely to purchase the loan. That means that the lender's capital will be tied up, rendering it unable to issue more loans. This is why most lenders choose to simply deny a borrower's application when Fannie Mae issues a \"Refer with Caution\" rather than take a risk.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    There are references to the case file being \"used internally by Fannie Mae employees,\" but appellees have not established that any \"individual or entity is involved in the process of generating DU Findings.\" Op. at 1195.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Fannie Mae relies on two out-of-circuit cases.
