The officers questioned Wilkins\n   about his possible involvement with criminal activity. Awnings, Wilkins's companion, inserted himself into the conversation and began asking the officers why they were questioning Wilkins.

Officer Jeremy Carther from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Police Department arrived and assisted the LPD officers in placing Awnings on his back in the backseat of the cruiser. Awnings continued to resist and yell profanities. Awnings kicked Officer Carther in the chest twice. At that point, Officers Fullerton, Meyer, and Carther removed Awnings from the cruiser and called for a vehicle with a \"full backseat cage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because he was bleeding, the LPD officers called for an ambulance to transport Awnings to the Bryan West Medical Center (\"the Hospital\"). Officer Howard accompanied Awnings in the ambulance. At the Hospital, Awnings told the examining physician that he believed he had one or more fractured ribs. The doctor ordered a chest X-ray, which revealed no rib fracture. The doctor pronounced Awnings fit for incarceration, but he ordered a follow-up examination at the Hospital within one to two days. Officer Banks, who had relieved Officer Howard during Awnings's examination at the Hospital, then transported Awnings to the Lancaster County Jail. Officer Banks neglected to inform jail personnel of the doctor's request for a follow-up appointment with Awnings; he \"simply informed jail personnel that [Awnings] had been to the emergency room and had been deemed fit for confinement.\" Mem. &amp; Order at 3,\n   <em>\n    Awnings v.

Awnings also alleged that Officer Banks-because of his failure to inform jail personnel of the Hospital doctor's request for a follow-up examination-deprived him of his right to be free from unreasonable seizures under the Fourth Amendment. Awnings also claimed that Officer Banks's conduct amounted to a denial of medical care, violating his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Elizabeth Elliott, an attorney employed by the City of Lincoln Attorney's Office (CLAO), initially represented the LPD officers. In that capacity, she filed a notice of intent to serve subpoena duces tecum with the district court. Elliott previously had worked in the Lancaster County Public Defender's Office (LPDO). In fact, Elliott worked as an attorney in that office while the LPDO defended Awnings's state criminal charges. Awnings objected to the notice, and Elliott moved to withdraw from the case upon discovering the potential conflict. Awnings then moved to disqualify the entire CLAO, claiming Elliott's employment\n   at the LPDO while that office represented Awnings created a conflict of interest that could prejudice his civil suit against the officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The magistrate judge considered Awnings's motion and found that while employed with the LPDO, Elliott \"did not represent [Awnings], never appeared with [Awnings] in court, and never spoke to him about his case. She [did] not recall [Awnings] or the underlying facts of his state criminal case. She was never 'actively involved' in [Awnings's] underlying state criminal case.\" Mem. &amp; Order at 3,\n   <em>\n    Awnings v. Fullerton\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:15-cv-03078-RGK-CRZ (D. Neb.

The CLAO assured the court that \"Elliott has no confidential information regarding [Awnings] and as such, has not divulged any confidential information to [the CLAO] about [Awnings] or his criminal case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, the CLAO had screened Elliott from any further work in Awnings's case. Finding no imputed conflict of interest stemming from Elliott's prior employment at the LPDO, the magistrate judge denied Awnings's motion to disqualify the entire CLAO. The district court affirmed the magistrate judge's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Officers Banks, Duncan, and Fullerton moved to dismiss Awnings's \u00a7 1983 suit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6). The district court partially granted the motion and dismissed Officer Banks from the suit. Officers Duncan and Fullerton subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted. The court concluded that the\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   doctrine barred Awnings from claiming false arrest. But even if\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   did not foreclose Awnings's false arrest claim, the district court determined that Officers Duncan and Fullerton had probable cause to arrest Awnings. Further, the court concluded that the officers' use of force was \"objectively reasonable under the circumstances and did not violate [Awnings's] constitutional rights.\" Qualified Immunity Order at 34. The district court then granted summary judgment to the officers. The court held that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity and dismissed both the false arrest and the excessive force claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In this appeal, Awnings claims the district court erred by: (1) failing to disqualify the entire CLAO; (2) granting qualified immunity to Officers Duncan and Fullerton; and (3) granting Officer Banks's Rule 12(b)(6) motion.

Awnings pleaded no contest to the criminal charges after Elliott departed the LPDO. Aside from filing the notice of intent to serve a subpoena duces tecum, the CLAO screened Elliott from further participation in Awnings's case.

He contends that he could have called the examining physician to testify at trial. Further, he asserts that he was not required to disclose the physician's name, especially when the doctor's identity was readily discernible from the record.

Thus, in contrast to\n   <em>\n    Ziesmer\n   </em>\n   , without probative medical evidence, Awnings can establish neither severity of injury nor causation.

Awnings cites to no authority that the affidavits must expressly state they came from personal knowledge, and we decline to endorse the kind of formalism that Awnings propounds. The district court found that the officers' statements were based on personal knowledge and overruled Awnings's objections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Qualified Immunity Order at 4 n.1.

He also challenges the district court's alternative ruling-that even if\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   does not bar Awnings's claim, Officers Duncan and Fullerton had probable cause to arrest Awnings. We need not address Awnings argument that the district court misapplied\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   because the officers had probable cause to arrest him for obstruction of a peace officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Awnings argues that at the beginning of his encounter with Officers Fullerton and Duncan, he did not resist. The record, however, does not support Awnings's contention. According to Awnings, Officer Fullerton \"yelled at him to shut up and pointed to a direction behind him.\" Qualified Immunity Order at 17. Awnings averred that he could not hear Officer Fullerton and he \"yelled back at [Officer] Fullerton.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.

At that point, Officer Fullerton grabbed Awnings, and Awnings pulled away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Under Nebraska law, Awnings's admitted conduct qualified as obstruction of a peace officer and resisting arrest. \"A person commits the offense of obstructing a peace officer, when, by ... physical interference, or obstacle, he ... intentionally obstructs, impairs, or hinders ... the enforcement of the penal law or the preservation of the peace by a peace officer ... acting under color of his ... official authority.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Neb.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2028-906\">\n    Neb.

Awnings's claim against Officer Banks is a failure to provide adequate medical services-not an excessive force claim related to his arrest. Instead, Awnings claim against Officer Banks relates to the sufficiency of his post-arrest, post-medical examination, medical care. It is true that we have not as yet \"resolved whether an arrestee's claim alleging denial of medical care is analyzed under the Due Process Clause or the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Bailey v.

We need not do so here. The facts distinguish this case from those arising from an allegation of excessive force. Factually, any alleged denial of medical care incident to Awnings's arrest ended when he actually received medical attention at the hospital. Awnings's claim against Officer Banks relates to Officer Banks's omission to convey the follow-up medical appointment ordered by the doctor-not from his participation in Awnings's arrest. In fact, Officer Banks did not participate in the arrest of Awnings. Unlike the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Carpenter\n   </em>\n   , Awnings was first transported for medical treatment before being taken to jail.
