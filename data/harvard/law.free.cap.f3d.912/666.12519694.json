Randall\" Facebook page she administered. In a cross appeal, Davison principally argues that the district court erred in dismissing his procedural due process claim premised on the ban. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Randall has chaired the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors since January 1, 2016. The day before she was sworn in as chair, Randall created the \"Chair Phyllis J. Randall\" Facebook Page (the \"Chair's Facebook Page\"). According to Facebook, Inc., unlike personal Facebook profiles, which are for non-commercial use and represent individual people, Facebook \"Pages\"-like the Chair's Facebook Page-\"help businesses, organizations, and brands share their stories and connect with people.\" J.A. 403. \"Pages are managed by people who have personal profiles,\" the company explains. J.A. 403. In addition to the Chair's Facebook Page, Randall created and maintained two other Facebook profiles: a personal profile and a Page devoted to her campaign. Randall classified her campaign page as belonging to a \"politician\" and used no designation for her personal profile, but she designated the Chair's Facebook Page as a \"governmental official\" page. J.A. 209-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Randall and her Chief of Staff, Jeanine Arnett, share administrative control over the Chair's Facebook Page, although Randall almost exclusively controls the page's content. On her campaign page, Randall characterized the Chair's Facebook Page as her \"county Facebook page\" stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   I really want to hear from ANY Loudoun citizen on ANY issues, request, criticism, complement or just your thoughts. However, I really try to keep back and forth conversations (as opposed to one time information items such as road closures) on\n   <em>\n    my county Facebook page (Chair Phyllis J. Randall)\n   </em>\n   or County email (Phyllis.randall@loudoun.gov). Having back and forth constituent conversations are Foiable ( [Freedom of Information Act] ) so if you could reach out to me on these mediums that would be appreciated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   J.A. 455 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Chair's Facebook Page includes three columns. The left column, which is topped by a picture of Randall, includes several links to allow visitors to quickly navigate the contents of the Chair's Facebook Page.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The middle column, which is organized in reverse chronological order similar to a personal profile's News Feed, is composed of posts by Randall and comments by Facebook users on those posts. Randall's posts are almost always directed to \"Loudoun,\"\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 408-10, and deal with numerous aspects of Randall's official responsibilities. For example, Randall used the Chair's Facebook Page to notify the public about upcoming Loudoun Board meetings, and the subjects to be discussed during those meetings. Randall also used the page to inform Loudoun County residents about significant public safety issues.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 412 (stating that Loudoun Board had \"been informed by the Sheriff's Office about the non-legitimate threat made on social media toward Dominion High School in Sterling\"); J.A. 418 (reporting that she \"ha[d] been briefed regarding the student falling from the water tower this morning\" and advising the public to \"not make any assumptions but wait for information\"). And Randall used the Chair's Facebook Page to coordinate Loudoun County's response to a large snow storm, including to communicate with constituents\n   regarding which municipal streets required plowing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Other posts by Randall to the Chair's Facebook Page invited members of the public to apply to participate on a public commission and to participate in public meetings regarding key issues facing Loudoun County residents, such as revised flood plain zones and the Zika virus. Randall also authored posts regarding a variety of trips and meetings she had taken in furtherance of Loudoun County business.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 408 (reporting that Randall \"address[ed] the (county) role in Treatment\" at a \"regional conference on Opioid and Substance Abuse Addiction\"); J.A. 410 (stating that Randall represented Loudoun County at its \"annual credit rating presentation\" in New York); J.A. 415 (informing public of trip to Loudoun's \"Sister City\" in Germany); J.A. 426 (reporting that Randall was \"in Richmond lobbying for [Loudoun County's] legislative program\"). Finally, Randall used the page to advise the public regarding official actions taken by the Loudoun Board.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 433 (reporting that Loudoun Board \"approved funding for new breathing apparatus for our Loudoun Firefighters\"); J.A. 442 (listing several \"proclamations of note\" by the Loudoun Board); J.A. 443 (informing public that Loudoun Board \"adopted a budget for Fiscal Year 2017 totaling $2.46 billion for the general county government and schools\"). Although Randall's posts on the Chair's Facebook Page principally addressed her official responsibilities, a few posts addressed topics less closely related to her official activities such as her affection for the German language or pride in becoming an organ donor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Members of the public, including Davison, \"liked\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   or commented on several of Randall's posts on the Chair's Facebook Page. Each \"like\" or comment identified the name of the personal profile or Page of the authoring party. Many of the comments thanked Randall and the Loudoun Board for representing the public's interests. Other posts by members of the public offered feedback on various issues faced by Randall and the Loudoun Board.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 427 (stating that \"[p]utting recreation in a flood plain is not a good idea\"); J.A. 448 (stating that \"more needs to be done with the explosion of Lyme disease in Loudoun\"). And other comments dealt with constituent-specific issues.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 415 (constituent stating, in response to post by Randall regarding visit to Loudoun County's \"Sister City\" in Germany, that constituent's \"daughter is interested in exchange programs\"); J.A. 454 (stating that \"there [we]re no [snow] plows to be seen\" in a particular neighborhood). Finally, several comments, including a number authored by Davison, criticized the Loudoun Board, generally, and Randall, in particular, for actions taken in their official capacities.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 429-30 (Davison criticizing public school system budget and expenditures); J.A. 438-39 (member of public criticizing governmental entity's inspection of farm, claiming it failed to uncover animal abuse); J.A. 449 (Davison characterizing question he posed at Loudoun Board and Loudoun School Board joint town hall). On some occasions, Randall responded to these comments or criticisms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the right column of the Chair's Facebook Page, the page is identified as a \"government official\" page. It provides contact information for Randall's county office, including her office telephone number, Randall's official county email address, and the internet address for the official county website. The column also identifies how many and which Facebook\n   personal profiles and Pages \"like\" and \"follow\" the Chair's Facebook Page.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the column includes a list of personal profiles and Pages \"liked\" by the Chair's Facebook Page.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Randall publicized the Chair's Facebook Page in her official \"Chair Phyllis J. Randall\" newsletter, which is prepared by County employees, hosted on the County's website, and distributed to Loudoun citizens using Randall's official county email account. The newsletter ends with the words \"STAY CONNECTED\" and a Facebook icon that hyperlinks to the Chair's Facebook Page. Randall also highlighted the Chair's Facebook Page in \"Winter Storm Information\" notices emailed from her official county account to Loudoun County residents, advising recipients to \"Visit [the Chair's Facebook Page] for Updates.\" J.A. 341-42, 344.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Davison, an outspoken resident of Loudoun County, apparently largely focuses his civic engagement and expression on \"the funding and ... management of public schools.\" J.A. 95. To that end, he has repeatedly expressed concern about \"School Board members failing to disclose personal conflicts as required by law before voting on financial transactions before the School Board.\" J.A. 96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On February 3, 2016, Davison attended a Loudoun town hall meeting that included the Loudoun County School Board and Randall. At the meeting, Davison submitted a question implying that certain School Board members had acted unethically in approving financial transactions. Randall volunteered to answer the question but characterized it as a \"set-up question\" that she did not \"appreciate.\" J.A. 103. Shortly after Randall answered the question-and while the town hall meeting was still ongoing-Davison posted a message on Twitter in which he tagged Randall: \"@ChairRandall 'set up question'? You might want to strictly follow FOIA and the COIA as well.\" J.A. 470-71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Later that evening, Randall posted about the town hall meeting on the Chair's Facebook Page, describing \"what was generally discussed at the meeting.\" J.A. 268. In response, Davison then used one of the Facebook Pages he manages through his personal Facebook profile-\"Virginia SGP,\" which Davison frequently uses to post political commentary-to comment on Randall's post about the town hall meeting. Although neither Davison nor Randall remember the precise content of Davison's comment, Randall testified that it contained \"accusations\" regarding School Board members' and their families' putative conflicts of interest related to municipal financial transactions, suggesting, in Randall's opinion, that School Board members had been \"taking kickback money.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 268-69, 289-90. Randall stated that she \"had no idea if any of th[e] [accusations] w[ere] correct,\" but she determined that the post was \"probably not something [she] want[ed] to leave\" on the Chair's Facebook Page. J.A. 269. Randall then \"deleted the whole post,\" including her original post regarding the town hall meeting, Davison's comment and replies thereto, and all other public comments. J.A. 269. Randall also banned Davison's Virginia SGP Page from the Chair's Facebook Page, which precluded Davison from using his Virginia SGP Page from commenting on the Chair's Facebook Page.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The next morning, about twelve hours later, Randall reconsidered her actions and unbanned Davison's Virginia SGP Page.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On November 3, 2016, Davison filed an amended complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Randall, in both her official and individual capacities, and the Loudoun Board alleging that the \"banning of [Davison] from commenting on [the Chair's Facebook Page] is viewpoint discrimination.\" J.A. 31. Davison further alleged that the ban violated his procedural due process rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment because \"Randall blocked Davison's constitutionally protected speech on [the Chair's Facebook Page], a limited public forum, without prior notice and without providing an opportunity for appealing [her] decision.\" J.A. 32. Davison did not challenge Randall's deletion of his post.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 6, 2017-four days before the close of discovery and approximately two months before trial-Davison moved for leave to amend his complaint a second time to add claims under the Virginia Constitution that were materially indistinguishable from his previously asserted First and Fourteenth Amendment claims premised on the ban, as well as a separate First Amendment claim against the Loudoun Board. Davison's proposed new First Amendment claim theorized that the County violated his free speech rights by choosing to use Facebook Pages as public forums, when Facebook allows private users to restrict access to their posts, including posts to any Page a municipality designates as a limited public forum. Pl.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Leave to File Second Am. Compl. 3-9,\n   <em>\n    Davison v. Loudoun County Bd. of Supervisors\n   </em>\n   , 16-cv-932-JCC-IDD, ECF No. 68. The district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge, who granted leave to amend regarding the claims under the Virginia Constitution but denied leave as to the new First Amendment claim against the Loudoun Board. Davison lodged objections to the magistrate judge's partial denial of leave to amend, which objections the district court overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Around the same time, Randall and the Loudoun Board each moved for summary judgment. The Loudoun Board asserted that the municipality could not be held liable for Randall's banning of Davison from the Chair's Facebook Page because the Chair's Facebook Page was not an official municipal page and because Randall, not the Loudoun Board as a body, was solely responsible for creating and administering the Chair's Facebook Page. The Loudoun Board and Randall further asserted that the Chair's Facebook Page did not amount to a public forum, and therefore Randall's ban of Davison's Virginia SGP Page did not implicate his free speech or procedural due process rights. Finally, Randall asserted that she was entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On May 10, 2017, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Loudoun Board, dismissing it from the suit. But as to Randall, the district court concluded that Davison's evidence established a material dispute of fact as to whether the Chair's Facebook Page amounted to a limited public forum and whether Randall, in her individual capacity, acted under color of state law in banning Davison from the Chair's Facebook Page.\n   <em>\n    Davison v. Loudoun Cty. Bd. of Supervisors\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:16-cv-932,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201929406\">\n    2017 WL 1929406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6-9 (E.D. Va. May 10, 2017). The district court also rejected Randall's qualified immunity argument.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Following a one-day bench trial of Davison's claims against Randall, the district\n   court issued a memorandum opinion and order awarding judgment in Davison's favor on his claims under the First Amendment and the analogous free speech provision in the Virginia Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davison v. Loudoun Cty. Bd. of Supervisors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265723\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/267/702/#p714\">\n    267 F.Supp.3d 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 714-18 (E.D. Va. 2017). The district court further entered judgment in Randall's favor on Davison's federal and state procedural due process claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265723\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/267/702/#p714\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265723\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/267/702/#p714\">\n    at 719-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As to remedy, the district court denied Davison's request for injunctive relief but granted Davison's request for a declaratory judgment to resolve the \"uncertainty regarding the legal status of [the Chair's Facebook Page].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265723\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/267/702/#p714\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265723\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/267/702/#p714\">\n    at 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Randall and Davison, respectively, filed this appeal and cross appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On appeal, Randall argues that (A) Davison failed to establish standing to obtain prospective declaratory relief based on Randall's alleged First Amendment violation; (B) the district court erred in concluding that Randall acted under \"color of state law\" when she banned Davison's Virginia SGP Page from the Chair's Facebook Page; and (C) the district court erred in concluding that Randall's banning of Davison's Virginia SGP Page violated the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Notwithstanding that she did not challenge Davison's standing below-and therefore that the district court never squarely addressed his standing-Randall now argues that Davison failed to establish Article III standing to support the district court's award of prospective declaratory relief. Even though Defendants did not challenge Davison's standing below, \"standing to sue is a jurisdictional issue of constitutional dimensions, and it may be raised and addressed for the first time on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Hodges v. Abraham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11420401\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/300/432/#p443\">\n    300 F.3d 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 443 (4th Cir. 2002). This Court reviews de novo \"whether a district court possessed jurisdiction in a declaratory judgment proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Volvo Const. Equip. N. Am., Inc. v. CLM Equip.

Randall does not dispute that any injury Davison suffered is fairly traceable to her decision to ban him from the Chair's Facebook Page. Nor does Randall dispute that any such injury would be remedied by a favorable decision. Rather, Randall claims that Davison failed to adduce evidence establishing that he suffered an \"injury in fact\" sufficient to support prospective declaratory relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"Injury in fact is 'an invasion of a legally protected interest' that is 'concrete and particularized' and 'actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.' \"\n   <em>\n    Kenny v.

The court reached that conclusion for two reasons. First, it pointed to the similarities between public access channels and traditional public forums, like parks, describing \"[a] public access channel [a]s the electronic version of the public square.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515950\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/300/#p306\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515950\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/300/#p306\">\n    at 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the court emphasized the extensive government involvement with, and control over, public access channels by virtue of the federal and state regulatory schemes.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515950\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/300/#p306\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[W]here, as here, federal law authorizes setting aside channels to be 'the electronic marketplace of ideas,' state regulation requires cable operators to provide at least one public access channel, a municipal contract requires a cable operator to provide four such channels,\n   <em>\n    and a municipal official has designated a private corporation to run those channels\n   </em>\n   , those channels are public forums.\" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Although not subject to the extensive federal and state regulatory regime applicable in\n   <em>\n    Halleck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Chair's Facebook Page is in many ways analogous to the privately-operated public access channels considered by the Second Circuit. Just as the federal government sought to establish an \"electronic marketplace of ideas\" by mandating provision of public access channels, Randall expressly sought to-and did, in fact-create an \"electronic marketplace of ideas\" by inviting \"ANY\" constituent to post to the Chair Page on \"ANY issues.\" J.A. 455. Likewise, just as the City of New York chose to have a private corporation\n   operate the public access channels, Randall chose to create her electronic marketplace of ideas, the Chair's Facebook Page, on a private platform, Facebook. Indeed, the present case provides a stronger basis for treating the interactive component of the Chair's Facebook Page as a public forum because whereas the private corporation in\n   <em>\n    Halleck\n   </em>\n   , MNN, exercised control over the aspect of the public access channel giving rise to the First Amendment claim-banning the public access program producer-a public official, Randall exercised unconstrained control over the aspect of the Chair's Facebook Page giving rise to Davison's claim-banning of other Facebook profiles and Pages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Not only does case law contradict Randall's argument that public forum analysis never applies to private property, her argument also fails because it makes no legal sense to establish a bright-line rule that forum analysis applies only to government-owned property. Why, for example, should the First Amendment allow a municipality to engage in viewpoint discrimination in curating a public library branch in leased space but not allow the municipality to engage in such discrimination in a library branch on municipally owned property?\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Educ., Island Trees Union Free Sch.

As with his claims related to the Chair's Facebook Page, Davison alleged that the Facebook Pages created and maintained by the Loudoun Board constituted public forums subject to the First Amendment. Davison theorized that the Loudoun Board's decision to use Facebook as its social media forum violated his First Amendment rights because\n   <em>\n    Facebook rules\n   </em>\n   permit individual \"requesting\" users to ban other personal profiles and Pages such that the banned users can no longer see posts authored by the requesting users. In such circumstances, the banned users \"cannot see [the requesting user's] comment[s] or participate in the discussion surrounding the [requesting] party's comment.\" Davison's Br. at 59. Davison's proposed amended complaint asserted that \"this scenario violates the First Amendment because Loudoun County has effectively enabled third parties to exclude discussion within a public forum-something a government body could not permissibly do in a physical forum.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-60 (internal citation omitted). Put differently, Davison theorized that Loudoun County violated the First Amendment by choosing to use Facebook as a public forum, when\n   <em>\n    rules imposed by Facebook\n   </em>\n   allow private users to restrict access to their posts-and comments on and responses to those posts-including posts to any municipal Facebook Page.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   No court appears to have addressed that novel legal theory. And although the First Amendment constrains only government policies, not policies established by private entities, one can conceive of a colorable legal argument that a governmental actor's decision to select a private social media website for use as a public forum-and therefore select that website's suite of rules and regulations-could violate the First Amendment, if the private website included certain types of exclusionary rules. For example, if the government chose as its electronic public forum a social media site that allowed only registered members of one political party to post and comment, there would seem to be a compelling argument that the government's selection of that social media site violated the First Amendment rights of members of other political parties, even if the partisan restriction was imposed by the private company, not the governmental body. Such a restriction would be seem to be no different than a municipality choosing to hold a town hall meeting in a venue that refused admission to individuals associated with a disfavored political party or viewpoint.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeBoer v.

I agree that the central \"aspects of the Chair's Facebook Page bear the hallmarks of a public forum.\" I am particularly persuaded by the facts concerning Randall's conduct of impressing the Chair Facebook Page with the trappings of a \"government official\" Facebook Page and of inviting citizens to comment, without restriction, on matters of public concern. Accordingly, under our precedent, I agree that Randall's conduct of banning Davison's Virginia SGP Page based on the content of a comment is attributable to the government and violates the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rossignol v.

First, I question whether any and all public officials, regardless of their roles, should be treated equally in their ability to open a public forum on social media. The Supreme Court recently cited a series of decisions in which \"a\n   <em>\n    unit\n   </em>\n   of government\" had created a public forum.\n   <em>\n    Matal v.

However, it appears to be an open question whether an individual public official serving in a legislative capacity qualifies as a unit of government or a government entity for purposes of her ability to open a public forum. Instead, our precedent merely directs us to consider whether the challenged action \"bore a sufficiently close nexus\" with the government to be \"fairly treated\" as that of the government itself.\n   <em>\n    Rossignol\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9377229\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/316/516/#p523\">\n    316 F.3d at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The nature and extent of a public official's authority should have some bearing on the official's ability to open a public forum on social media. While the nine-member Loudoun County Board of Supervisors (the Board) serves to set policies, adopt ordinances, and appropriate funds, the Chair simply is empowered individually to oversee meetings and to set agendas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record before us is silent regarding the Chair's authority to take any official action on her own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In contrast, certain elected executive officials, under given circumstances, can conduct government business and set official policy unilaterally, including through the use of social media.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knight First Amendment Inst. at Columbia Univ. v.

The relevance of such distinctions to a public official's ability to create a public forum on social media is a matter that should be addressed by the Supreme Court. Because this is an open question, we are bound by current precedent and, for the reasons set forth in the majority opinion, Randall as a single board member acted under of color of law and opened a public forum on Facebook.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Second, the Supreme Court should consider further the reach of the First Amendment in the context of social media. I acknowledge that the Supreme Court has referred to social media as \"the modern public square,\"\n   <em>\n    Packingham v. North Carolina,\n   </em>\n   --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/#p1735\">\n    137 S.Ct. 1730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1737,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604756\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1730/#p1735\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), implying that First Amendment principles protecting speech from government intrusion do extend to social media. However, the interplay between private companies hosting social media sites and government actors managing those sites necessarily blurs the line regarding which party is responsible for burdens placed on a participant's speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   For example, hate speech is protected under the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matal\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 1763-64 (holding that the disparagement clause of the Lanham Act violated the First Amendment free speech clause because it prohibited hate speech). But social media companies like Facebook and others have policies forbidding hate speech on their platforms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, while a government official, who under color of law has opened a public forum on a social media platform like Facebook, could not ban a user's comment containing hate speech, that official could report the hate speech to Facebook. And Facebook personnel could ban the user's comment, arguably circumventing First Amendment protections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Admittedly, this question is not directly presented in the present case, given that the public official, not a Facebook employee, acted to restrict speech. Nonetheless, cases necessarily will arise requiring courts to consider the nuances of social media and their various roles in hosting public forums established by government officials or entities. Therefore, in my view, courts must exercise great caution when examining these issues, as we await further guidance from the Supreme Court on the First Amendment's reach into social media.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    \" 'Liking' on Facebook is a way for Facebook users to share information with each other.\"\n    <em>\n     Bland v.
