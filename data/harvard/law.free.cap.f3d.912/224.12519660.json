Elizabeth Parr Hecker, UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, Washington, D.C., for Appellee. ON BRIEF: John M. Gore, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Tovah R. Calderon, Appellate Section, Civil Rights Division, UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, Washington, D.C., for Appellee.\n </attorneys>\n <judges id=\"p-6\">\n  Before WILKINSON, WYNN, and DIAZ, Circuit Judges.\n </judges>\n <disposition id=\"p-7\">\n  Affirmed by published opinion. Judge Wynn wrote the opinion, in which Judge Wilkinson and Judge Diaz joined.\n </disposition>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   WYNN, Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendant Michael Slager (\"Defendant\"), a former officer with the North Charleston Police Department, admitted that he \"willfully\" shot and killed Walter Scott (\"Scott\"), when Scott was unarmed and fleeing arrest. Defendant further admitted that his decision to shoot Scott was \"objectively unreasonable.\" Based on those admissions, Defendant pleaded guilty to depriving Scott of his civil rights under color of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The district court sentenced Defendant to a 240-month term of imprisonment. Before this Court, Defendant argues that the district court reversibly erred in setting his sentence by: (1) using second-degree murder as the sentencing cross-reference for his offense rather than voluntary manslaughter, and (2) applying a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. Finding no reversible error, we affirm Defendant's sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In May 2016, a federal grand jury in the District of South Carolina returned an indictment alleging, among other things, that Defendant, \"while acting under color of law as an officer with the North Charleston Police Department, shot [and killed] Walter Scott without legal justification, willfully depriving him of the right ... to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a law enforcement officer.\" J.A. 13. In the meantime, Defendant was tried in state court on one count of murder. That trial resulted in a hung jury and mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thereafter, Defendant entered into a global plea agreement with the United States and the State of South Carolina. Under that agreement, in exchange for Defendant's guilty plea in federal court to one count of depriving Scott of his civil rights under color of law, the United States agreed to drop the remaining\n   counts of the indictment\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and agreed to recommend a three-level reduction in the applicable sentencing level for acceptance of responsibility. Additionally, South Carolina agreed not to retry Defendant and dismissed the murder charge against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Some of the undisputed facts that formed the basis for Defendant's plea includes evidence showing that on the morning of April 4, 2015, while on duty, Defendant stopped Scott's vehicle after observing that his center brake light was not working. After the stop, Scott fled on foot and Defendant chased him. During the chase, Defendant shot his taser probes twice, hitting and bringing Scott down with the second shot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Slager\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:16-CR-00378-DCN,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20445497\">\n    2018 WL 445497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D.S.C. Jan. 16, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At some point thereafter, Scott got up and fled. While Scott was unarmed and running away, Defendant drew his department-issued firearm and fired eight shots at Scott, five of which struck Scott in the back. Scott died on the scene from these wounds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20445497\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A bystander witnessed and testified about the incident. The bystander also filmed parts of the incident. The bystander's testimony and video of the incident directly contradicted Defendant's initial account of the incident. In conformance with the global guilty plea agreement, Defendant admitted that he \"used deadly force even though it was objectively unreasonable under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20445497\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And, Defendant acknowledged that \"his actions were done willfully, that is he acted voluntarily and intentionally and with specific intent to do something that the law forbids.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20445497\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant's sentencing hearing began on December 4, 2017, and lasted four days. Because Defendant pleaded guilty to depriving Scott of his civil rights under color of law, the district court was required during sentencing to cross-reference the offense underlying the deprivation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2H1.1(a)(1). The government contended that the proper cross-reference was second-degree murder because Defendant was acting with malice aforethought when he shot Scott. In contrast, Defendant argued that the proper cross-reference was voluntary manslaughter because he was provoked by Scott and was thus not acting with malice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Although most of the facts were undisputed at Defendant's sentencing hearing, the government and Defendant disagreed as to what occurred\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Scott fell to the ground, but\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   Scott got up and ran away from Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   i.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The government's version of events is based primarily on the only third-party eyewitness to the shooting, Feidin Santana. Santana recounted the shooting during a South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (\"SLED\") interview, and during Defendant's state and federal proceedings. Each time, Santana provided a consistent account of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   While traveling to work on the morning of the shooting, Santana saw Scott running from Defendant. Santana followed, but briefly lost sight of Scott and Defendant. When Santana next saw them, Scott was facing down, and Defendant was on top of\n   Scott and \"trying to control\" him. J.A. 971. Santana testified that it sounded like Scott was \"being hurt\" and he heard something \"electric.\" J.A. 972. According to Santana, Defendant punched Scott in the back, but Scott never flipped over. Santana did not see Scott punch back. Nor did Santana see Scott grab the taser and charge toward Defendant. Indeed, Santana never saw Scott holding the taser. Rather, according to Santana, Scott did not seem to want to \"hurt\" Defendant but was \"just trying to leave.\" J.A. 974. At some point, Scott shot up \"aggressively,\" Santana testified. J.A. 975. By this, Santana meant that Scott was \"determined to ... just leave.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20445497\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When Scott broke free and began to run, Defendant shot him. Defendant then handcuffed Scott and checked his pulse but did not treat him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Santana also recorded a portion of the encounter with his cell phone. Santana's video does not clearly show the period during which Scott and Defendant were allegedly on the ground. But the video does show that Scott stood up and was running away-not pointing a taser at Defendant or advancing toward Defendant-when Defendant fired at him. Additionally, the video shows Defendant picked up the taser approximately ten feet behind the point where Defendant was standing when he shot Scott-not between Scott and Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ii.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In contrast to Santana's consistent recollection of the encounter, Defendant provided four different accounts as to what happened on the morning of April 4, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   First, Defendant made an on-scene statement to his superior officer, Lieutenant Daniel Bowman, who arrived shortly after the shooting occurred. Defendant told Lt. Bowman that Scott continued to resist arrest after being tasered and falling to the ground. Defendant tased Scott twice more while he laid on the ground, but Scott resisted and \"was able to roll over onto his back.\" Supp. J.A. 75. Scott then \"use[d] both hands to grab the taser\" and after \"a short struggle,\" Scott \"was able to wrestle it away.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20445497\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Scott then \"stood up and pointed the taser at\" Defendant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20445497\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant told Lt. Bowman that, when faced with this alleged threat, he \"drew his weapon as he was returning to the standing position and fired multiple times.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20445497\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Several of Defendant's shots struck Scott, who then fell to the ground. According to this account, Defendant then \"rendered emergency aid until other officers arrived seconds later.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20445497\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Three days after the shooting, on April 7, 2015, Defendant gave a second account of the encounter in an unsworn interview with SLED investigators. Before giving this statement, Defendant asked his attorney to verify with the SLED investigators whether there was \"[a]ny video, surveillance video of businesses, security cameras, [or] anything\" else documenting the shooting. J.A. 702. Defendant also asked whether there were any witnesses who viewed the shooting. The SLED investigators did not apprise Defendant of Santana or his recorded video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At the start of the interview, the SLED investigators informed Defendant that the interview was part of a criminal investigation and that Defendant could decline to participate. Still, Defendant agreed to make a statement. Over the course of the interview, Defendant added new details not mentioned in his prior statement to Lt. Bowman and physically reenacted key aspects of the encounter. For example, Defendant claimed that Scott was \"coming straight at him\" holding the taser, with his \"arm extending straight out.\" J.A. 1640. Defendant told the SLED investigators that he was \"shuffle-stepping\" to avoid the\n   taser as he \"pulled his gun.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20445497\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to this account, Scott was \"turning to his left\" when Defendant fired.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20445497\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Then, \"Scott ran off, stumbled into the grass, [and] fell to the ground.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20445497\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant further told the investigators that \"Scott must have dropped\" the taser during this altercation, because he retrieved it \"between the place where he had been shooting and where Scott landed.\" J.A. 1641.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   During his state trial, Defendant provided a third description of his encounter with Scott. In this retelling, Defendant claimed that, during the alleged ground struggle, he had attempted to put Scott's left hand \"behind his back to handcuff him.\" J.A. 282. However, Scott was in a \"pushup position\" and was \"trying to get up\" at the same time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20445497\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant testified that while this was occurring, he and Scott were \"fighting\" and \"rolling around on the ground.\" J.A. 285. According to this account, Scott eventually \"overpowered\" Defendant and took his taser. J.A. 286. Defendant testified that at that point, he \"instructed Mr. Scott to turn right away and go, but he didn't.\" J.A. 288. Instead, Scott continued to approach Defendant, so Defendant \"pulled [his] firearm\" and \"fired until the threat was stopped.\" J.A. 289. Defendant's testimony made clear that he was neither \"provoked\" nor \"angry\" during the shooting. J.A. 346-47. Instead, Defendant testified that he was simply \"doing [his] job\" and acting in \"self-defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 347.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant provided his fourth description of the shooting over two days of testimony at his federal pre-trial hearings. Again, Defendant added new details. For the first time, Defendant testified that Scott \"punched [him] in the chest\" during the ground altercation. J.A. 732. And for the first time, Defendant testified that Scott was \"on top of [him] at some point.\" J.A. 727. Defendant also testified-again, for the first time-that Scott \"drive stunned\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   him during the altercation. J.A. 728. When asked why he had not previously provided these details, Defendant testified that the surrounding events were \"fuzzy\" and there were still \"some things [he did not] recall.\" J.A. 727. But \"some of [his] memory [had] come back since\" the shooting, he testified.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Still, Defendant testified that he could not \"recall\n   <em>\n    anything\n   </em>\n   [that he had] told SLED Agents\" during his prior interview. J.A. 860 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant did not testify during his sentencing hearing, but he did attempt to buttress aspects of his final account of the encounter through three expert witnesses. First, Defendant offered Eugene Liscio, an expert forensic analyst who reconstructs crime scenes. Using Santana's video, Liscio created a 3D model of the scene of the encounter in an effort to determine whether Defendant or Scott was holding the taser prior to the shooting. Based upon the final position of the taser, Liscio opined that the video was \"inconsistent\" with Defendant throwing the taser with his right arm. J.A. 1257-58. However, Liscio equivocated as to this opinion, acknowledging that there was \"no part in [the Santana video] where you can actually see the taser being held.\" J.A. 1275. Liscio also testified that, due to this limitation, the court would\n   have to \"make [its] own judgment call\" as to what in fact occurred. J.A. 1279-80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, Defendant offered David Hallimore, a forensic audio analyst, who applied \"filtration[s] to [the Santana Video] to allow the speech to become more clear.\" J.A. 1192, 1216. Through these filtrations and \"critical listening\"-a skill Hallimore purportedly learned by \"train[ing his] brain effectively to better understand certain tones\"-Hallimore testified that he heard \"fuck police\" and \"Let go of the taser or I'll shoot\" on the Santana video. J.A. 1204, 1216, 1218. But Hallimore also recognized this was his \"interpretation\" of the enhanced audio. J.A. 1220.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, Defendant introduced opinions and analyses rendered by Megan Fletcher, an agent with the SLED's Trace Evidence Unit. Fletcher did not testify at the federal sentencing, but Defendant did reference her state trial testimony and report. Fletcher identified polyester fibers in Defendant's shirt that had been melted. Fletcher analyzed these fibers and opined that a \"taser drive-stun cannot be excluded as a possible heat source which has the potential to melt polyester fibers.\" Supp. J.A. 89-90. But Fletcher averred that she was \"unable to definitively conclude whether a Taser did or did not cause the marks on the uniform.\" Supp. J.A. 89. Fletcher also acknowledged that she never determined-and therefore did not know-the melting point of the fibers in Defendant's shirt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On January 16, 2018, the district court sentenced Defendant to a 240-month term of imprisonment. In an accompanying order explaining its sentencing decision, the court first determined that second-degree murder was the appropriate sentencing cross-reference for Defendant's offense because \"malice aforethought is proven by a gross deviation from the standard of reasonable care, and [because] there is insufficient evidence that the defendant acted in heat of passion.\"\n   <em>\n    Slager\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20445497\">\n    2018 WL 445497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. To support that judgment, the district court made extensive credibility determinations and factual findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   To begin, the court assessed the credibility of the only two testifying eyewitnesses to Scott's shooting: Santana and Defendant. Recounting at length Defendant's various accounts of the encounter, the district court discredited Defendant's testimony, characterizing it as \"contradictory,\" \"self-serving, evolving, and internally inconsistent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4-6. Furthermore, the court found that Defendant's experts did not bolster the credibility of his account because each expert\n   <em>\n    admitted\n   </em>\n   that his or her respective technique provided no definitive answer as to the key aspects of Defendant's final version of the encounter. In contrast, Santana presented a \"consistent story,\" which the court found credible.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4 (\"[A] review of the statement Santana gave to SLED, Santana's state court testimony, and his federal court testimony reveals a consistent story that is at odds with [Defendant's] presentation of the sequence of events ... making Santana a more credible witness.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Based upon these credibility determinations, the district court made the following findings of fact. First, the court found that the Santana video did not provide any grounds to support a finding of provocation. Second, the court found that the portion of the encounter not covered by the video-when Defendant and Scott were on the ground-also did not support a finding of provocation. In particular, the court found that Scott \"yelled 'Fuck the police,' [and] that Scott ran away from [Defendant] during the initial traffic stop and disobeyed commands to stop.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. But the court further found that-contrary\n   to Defendant's statements-Scott was \"never on top of [Defendant].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court found that Scott did not wrestle the taser away and attempt to drive-stun Defendant because Scott \"never had the taser in his hands.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rather than coming straight at Defendant with a taser, Scott got \"up from the ground [and] ran away from [Defendant],\" the court found.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Instead \"of giving chase once again, [Defendant] shot at Scott eight times\" and \"five of those shots hit Scott in the back.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, at \"no point after [Defendant] fired the first shot-when Scott was nearly fifteen feet away-to when [Defendant] fired the eighth shot-when Scott was nearly forty feet away-did Scott turn around.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Emphasizing that \"[w]ords alone will not suffice for a 'heat of passion' finding,\" the court concluded that these facts, \"taken together,\" \"did not constitute adequate provocation to apply the 'heat of passion' mitigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In determining Defendant's sentence, the district court also applied a two-level sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice based upon Defendant's false statements to the SLED investigators during his unsworn interview. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. In so doing, the court recognized that Defendant was \"represented by an attorney\" and \"was aware that there was an investigation ... underway for the shooting.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *14. The court also emphasized that, before making the statement, Defendant specifically inquired \"about the presence of a video that captured the shooting.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *17. Believing that no video existed, Defendant \"used the SLED interview to advance his false narrative of being forced to fire when Scott was coming toward him with a taser,\" the court explained.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In deciding to apply the obstruction enhancement, the district court acknowledged that SLED had already obtained Santana's video when they interviewed Defendant. Still, without the video, some of Defendant's false statements would have significantly obstructed the investigation, the court determined. Specifically, if it were \"not for the Santana's video,\" Defendant's statement that \"Scott was coming toward him with a taser at the time he fired his first shot\" \"would certainly have hindered the investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This was especially true because Defendant's \"status as a [law enforcement] officer would likely have meant that his rendition of the events would not have been immediately questioned.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant timely appealed his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   When, as here, a defendant is sentenced for deprivation of civil rights under color of law, the Sentencing Guidelines require the court to cross-reference the \"offense guideline applicable to any underlying offense.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2H1.1(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendant first argues that the district court erred by determining that second-degree murder was the proper cross-reference under Section 2H1.1. Specifically, Defendant claims that when he shot Scott, he was provoked and thus acting without malice. Consequently, Defendant argues that the proper cross-reference was voluntary manslaughter, not second-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   At sentencing, the government \"has the burden to prove a cross-referenced offense by a preponderance of the evidence[.]\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Under this circumscribed standard of review, we do not find that the district court plainly erred by applying the obstruction sentencing enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   A sentencing court may apply the obstruction enhancement when a defendant: (1) \"willfully obstructed or impeded, or\n   <em>\n    attempted\n   </em>\n   to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation ... of the instant offense of conviction,\" and (2) \"the obstructive conduct related to the defendant's offense of conviction and any relevant conduct.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 (emphasis added). Defendant argues that the district court plainly erred in applying this enhancement because Defendant's false statements to the SLED investigators \"were not made under oath\" and the SLED investigators already had Santana's video when they interviewed Defendant, meaning that Defendant's false statements \"did not significantly impede the official investigation.\" Appellant's Br. at 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In support of his argument, Defendant emphasizes that the comments to the obstruction guideline state \"\n   <em>\n    [o]rdinarily\n   </em>\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   making false statements,\n   <em>\n    not under oath\n   </em>\n   to law enforcement officers\"-as was the case here-does not warrant application of the enhancement. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. n.5 (emphases added). But the comments further state that \"providing a materially false statement to a law enforcement officer that\n   <em>\n    significantly\n   </em>\n   obstructed or impeded the official investigation\" does warrant application of the enhancement, regardless of whether the materially false statement was made under oath.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3754070\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/651/388/#p392\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   cmt. n.4(G) (emphasis added).
