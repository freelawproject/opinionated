Plaintiff-Appellant DTC Energy Group, Inc., has sued two of its former employees-Adam Hirschfeld and Joseph\n   Galban-as well as one of its industry competitors-Ally Consulting, LLC-for using DTC's trade secrets to divert business from DTC to Ally. DTC moved for a preliminary injunction based on its claims for breach of contract, breach of the duty of loyalty, misappropriation of trade secrets, and unfair competition. The district court denied the motion. It found that DTC had shown a probability of irreparable harm from Hirschfeld's ongoing solicitation of DTC clients, but that DTC could not show the ongoing solicitation violated Hirschfeld's employment agreement.

App. Vol. I at 72-91. The district court found that DTC had shown a probability of irreparable harm from Hirschfeld's allegedly ongoing breach of his employment agreement, but that DTC had not met its burden with respect to its other claims. Based on the testimony and documentary evidence offered at the evidentiary hearing, the district court reasoned that the majority of conduct at issue in this case occurred before DTC moved for a preliminary injunction. According to the district court, the resulting harm to DTC is therefore identifiable and can be remedied by an award of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   DTC does not dispute the district court's finding that DTC will likely suffer irreparable harm from Hirschfeld's ongoing solicitation of DTC's customers and clients, conduct that DTC argues violates\n   Hirschfeld's employment agreement. Hirschfeld's employment agreement states that \"any breach ... of the confidentiality, non-solicitation or other restrictive covenants ... would cause irreparable injury to\" DTC. App. Vol. III at 515. \"[W]ithout more[,] [this provision] is insufficient to support an irreparable harm finding.\"\n   <em>\n    Dominion Video Satellite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"785154\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/356/1256/#p1260\">\n    356 F.3d at 1266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Hirschfeld also testified that he continues to solicit customers and consultants with whom he worked while at DTC. App. Vol. II at 329. Based on this testimony, the district court found that \"the harm likely caused by Mr. Hirschfeld's ongoing solicitation efforts, including loss of customers, loss of goodwill, and further erosion of DTC's competitive position in the oil and gas staffing industry, would be difficult to calculate in monetary terms.\" App. Vol. I at 196. These are the types of factors that district courts should consider when deciding whether a plaintiff has shown a sufficient probability of irreparable harm.\n   <em>\n    Dominion Video Satellite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"785154\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/356/1256/#p1260\">\n    356 F.3d at 1264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (factors to consider include \"the difficulty in calculating damages, the loss of a unique product, and existence of intangible harms such as loss of goodwill or competitive market position\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   What DTC does dispute on appeal is the district court's finding that DTC had not \"establish[ed] a significant risk of irreparable harm based on defendants' past misconduct.\" App. Vol. I at 195. DTC argues that this finding was erroneous because DTC continues to be irreparably harmed by Defendants' past misconduct-specifically because Defendants \"continue to profit from [their] misdeeds\" and \"harm DTC's goodwill and competitive market position.\" Aplt. Br. at 48. But not all plaintiffs who have already suffered lost customers, stolen trade secrets, or intangible injury can show a sufficient probability of future irreparable harm to warrant a preliminary injunction. For example, in\n   <em>\n    First Western Capital Management Co.\n   </em>\n   , a company was denied a preliminary injunction after it sued one of its former employees to stop his use of a detailed client list to solicit its customers.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266918\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/1136/#p1140\">\n    874 F.3d at 1139-40, 1143-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We agreed with the district court's finding that, based on the record developed at the preliminary injunction hearing, there was an insufficient risk of irreparable harm because \"money damages could be reasonably quantified.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266918\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/1136/#p1140\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266918\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/1136/#p1140\">\n    at 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And, in\n   <em>\n    Schrier\n   </em>\n   , we affirmed the denial of a preliminary injunction, even though the plaintiff alleged irreparable harm from \"loss of prestige, academic reputation[,] [and] professional opportunities,\" because the plaintiff did not point to \"evidence in the record showing actual or significant risk\" that those harms would occur in the future.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1241096\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/427/1253/#p1258\">\n    427 F.3d at 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The same is true here. Based on our review of the evidence presented at the preliminary injunction hearing in this case, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it found that DTC had not shown a sufficient probability of irreparable harm from Defendants' past misconduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   First, DTC has not established a probability of irreparable harm from Hirschfeld's and Galban's work for Ally while they were employed by DTC. As\n   discussed previously, Hirschfeld's employment agreement prohibited him from soliciting DTC's customers and consultants while he was employed by DTC. App. Vol. III at 514. And as DTC employees, Hirschfeld and Galban also owed DTC a duty of loyalty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court found that DTC had failed to show how Hirschfeld's and Galban's work on behalf of Ally, while they were employed by DTC, gave rise to future irreparable harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   App. Vol. I at 195 &amp; n.2. This conclusion is supported by the record. At the preliminary injunction hearing, DTC identified twelve contracts that Hirschfeld diverted from DTC to Ally, App. Vol. II at 295, suggesting that DTC will be able to offer expert testimony about damages it suffered while Hirschfeld and Galban were DTC employees. Moreover, DTC's owners hired experts to value the company when Clausen purchased Sylar's equity in DTC, further suggesting that damages (as measured by a change in DTC's value) can be calculated. App. Vol. II at 443. Therefore, both the prior loss of DTC's customers and consultants and the general decline of DTC's value as a business can be quantified in money damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Second, DTC has not offered sufficient evidence that Defendants currently possess DTC trade secrets. DTC has sued Defendants under the federal DTSA and Colorado's CUTSA, which authorize a district court to grant a preliminary injunction \"to prevent any actual or threatened misappropriation\" of a trade secret.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201836\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%207-74-103\">\n    Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 7-74-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (injunction permitted \"to prevent or restrain actual or threatened misappropriation of a trade secret\"). No testimony elicited at the preliminary injunction hearing indicates that Defendants retain access to DTC's confidential information or trade secrets. Hirschfeld testified that, in July 2017, he turned over all DTC information to Ally, who then turned over the information to a third-party computer forensics company. App. Vol. II at 323-24. An Ally manager testified to this as well.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%207-74-103\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%207-74-103\">\n    at 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

DTC argues that the forensics company might return DTC's information to Defendants, but this is mere speculation and does not cast doubt on the district court's finding that DTC's trade secret claims do not establish a probability of irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Third, DTC has not shown that confusion about the relationship between DTC and Ally persists. \"To constitute unfair competition in respect to a trade name, ... [t]he name must have acquired a secondary meaning or significance that identifies the plaintiff ... [and] the defendant must have unfairly used the name or a simulation of it against the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Swart v.

The district court found that DTC \"presented no evidence that Ally ... continue[s] to appropriate DTC's name or resources to solicit business.\" App. Vol. I at 195. \"Nor is there evidence demonstrating ongoing confusion within the industry as to the relationship between the two companies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1943051\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/colo/145/600/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   DTC elicited limited testimony about marketplace confusion, and that testimony only addressed time when Hirschfeld was still employed at DTC. App. Vol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   II at 307-08. Therefore, the district court did not err when it found that DTC's unfair competition claim did not establish a probability of future irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    V\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Having concluded that DTC has only shown a probability of future irreparable harm from Hirschfeld's ongoing solicitation of DTC's customers and consultants, we assess DTC's likelihood of success on its claim that Hirschfeld's ongoing solicitation violates his employment agreement.\n   <em>\n    First W.

App. Vol. I at 199. Hirschfeld's employment agreement prohibited him from soliciting DTC's customers, consultants, and employees for one year after his resignation, unless he resigned \"because there has been a change in the current equity ownership of\" DTC. App. Vol. III at 514. In April 2017, there was a change in DTC's ownership when Clausen purchased his partner's equity and became the sole owner of DTC. App. Vol. II at 237, 436-37. Hirschfeld cited the \"change in ownership\" clause when he resigned in May 2017. App. Vol. III at 558.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \"It is axiomatic that [courts] ... must enforce an unambiguous contract in accordance with the plain and ordinary meaning of its terms.\"\n   <em>\n    USI Props.

DTC does not argue that the employment agreement is ambiguous. Moreover, DTC conceded at the preliminary injunction hearing that the \"change in ownership\" clause was triggered by Clausen's purchase of Sylar's equity in DTC. App. Vol. II at 483. Therefore, by operation of the \"change in ownership\" clause, Hirschfeld was not bound by his employment agreement's non-solicitation provisions after he resigned. Accordingly, the district court did not err in finding that DTC would not succeed on its breach of contract claim, as it pertains to Hirschfeld's ongoing solicitation of DTC's customers and consultants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W.

But DTC does not seek to use the \"prior breach\" doctrine as a shield against a demand for specific performance.

Therefore, the district court did not err when it found that the \"prior breach\" doctrine was inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Moreover, even if Hirschfeld was bound by his employment agreement's nonsolicitation provisions after he resigned, the provisions expired one year after his resignation, at the end of May 2018.

According to DTC, the district court erred by inappropriately\n   conflating the issue of irreparable harm with the likelihood of success on the merits of future claims. That is, DTC argues the district court applied the wrong legal standard when it focused on whether the Defendants would engage in future unlawful conduct, rather than analyzing whether the Defendants' past breaches were continuing to cause DTC irreparable harm.

Retzlaff Grain Co.,\n    </em>\n    the district court granted an injunction based on claims of past breaches of the duty of loyalty and continuing misappropriation of trade secrets because there was irreparable harm in the defendants' use of the confidential information to \"compete immediately\" and the defendants had \"successfully shifted\" business through use of confidential information and breaches of loyalty.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4036465\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/927/776/#p785\">\n     927 F.Supp.2d 776\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 785-86 (D. Neb. 2013). While both cases involved evidence of continued use of confidential information, the district courts focused on the irreparable harm caused by prior breaches of the duty of loyalty when granting the injunction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    But I reject DTC's assertion that the substantial likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm analysis are completely disjunctive. Harm is irreparable \"[o]nly when the threatened harm would impair the court's ability to grant an effective remedy,\" Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. \u00a7 2948.1, because the harm \"cannot be compensated after the fact by monetary damages,\"\n    <em>\n     Greater Yellowstone Coal. v. Flowers\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9366942\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/321/1250/#p1258\">\n     321 F.3d 1250\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1258 (10th Cir. 2003) (quoting\n    <em>\n     Adams v.

The substantial likelihood of success requirement necessitates \"showing a reasonable probability that [the plaintiff] will ultimately be entitled to the relief sought.\"\n    <em>\n     Crowther v. Seaborg\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2176463\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/415/437/#p439\">\n     415 F.2d 437\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 439 (10th Cir. 1969). Therefore, the irreparable harm and substantial likelihood of success elements are interrelated in the sense that they require (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits that would entitle the plaintiff to recover for the alleged future harm (if it were calculable) and (2) the future harm is irreparable. Therefore, I reject DTC's arguments that the future irreparable harm the district court found significantly likely-\"loss of customers, loss of goodwill, and further erosion of DTC's competitive position in the oil and gas staffing industry,\" App. Vol. I at 196-can be disjunctively supported by a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of any of its claims. Importantly, DTC makes no attempt to tie that irreparable harm to any of the claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Although I agree with the majority that much of the \"prior loss of DTC's customers and consultants ... can be quantified in money damages,\" I would not view that as the end of the inquiry if DTC had met its evidentiary burden. Maj. Op. at 1272. Under our precedent, irreparable harm can be shown by \"harm to goodwill [and] diminishment of competitive positions in marketplace.\"\n    <em>\n     Dominion Video Satellite, Inc. v.

Thus, even if DTC can calculate and recover the specific amount diverted to Ally, other damage to its reputation and market position may be incalculable. But DTC has made no attempt to show future irreparable harm based on the past breaches that could be prevented by a preliminary injunction, and a preliminary injunction is not appropriate as punishment for past irreparable harm.\n    <em>\n     Schrier v.
