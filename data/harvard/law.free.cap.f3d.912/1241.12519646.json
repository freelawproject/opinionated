Before fleeing, Petitioner knowingly gave money to a member of the terrorist organization at least once. After arriving in the United States, Petitioner sought asylum, statutory withholding of removal, withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"), and deferral of removal under CAT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   An immigration judge (\"IJ\") granted Petitioner deferral of removal under CAT, but denied him asylum and both forms of withholding of removal. The IJ found Petitioner ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal because Petitioner provided \"material support\" to a terrorist organization, as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(B)(iv)(VI).

Petitioner seeks review of the BIA's decision.

In 2003, he took an administrative position with Doctors Without Borders, an international nongovernmental organization. During the early stages of his work for Doctors Without Borders, Petitioner became a target of a Nepali terrorist organization called the Maoists. The Secretary of State designated\n   the Maoists as a \"terrorist organization\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(B)(vi)(II) in 2004, but revoked that designation in 2012.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2054%2C944\">\n    77 Fed.

In February 2009, a Maoist approached Petitioner at a taxi stand and demanded money. Petitioner recognized the Maoist as one of the men who had beaten him in the past. Fearing what the Maoist might do to him if he did not comply, Petitioner gave the man the equivalent of about $50.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioner left Nepal soon after that incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Petitioner entered the United States in June 2009 on a visitor's visa. He applied for asylum and withholding of removal in December 2009. An IJ found that, even considering only the 2009 \"donation,\" Petitioner gave material support to the Maoists in the form of money. Thus, the IJ ruled that the Immigration and Nationality Act's (\"INA\") \"material support bar\" rendered Petitioner ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal. The IJ also held that she lacked jurisdiction to grant an exception on the ground of duress. The IJ ordered Petitioner removed to Nepal, but deferred his removal under CAT because he likely would suffer torture if sent back to Nepal. The material support bar does not apply to deferral of removal under CAT.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201208.17\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Petitioner appealed the denial of asylum and withholding of removal, and the government appealed the grant of deferral of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, the BIA rejected Petitioner's argument that the material support bar did not apply to him, holding: \"There is no de minimis exception to the material support bar\" and \"no duress exception to the material support bar.\" The BIA also concluded that the IJ had not properly considered the country condition evidence in the record as it pertained to CAT deferral. Accordingly, the BIA remanded the case to the IJ solely for further consideration of Petitioner's claim for CAT deferral. On remand, the IJ incorporated the facts and procedural history of her prior decision and the BIA's prior decision. She again granted Petitioner CAT deferral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Petitioner again appealed to the BIA and contested the IJ's denials of asylum and withholding of removal under the material support bar. In 2016, the BIA issued its second decision, reaffirming its dismissal of Petitioner's asylum and withholding claims. The government did not appeal the IJ's second grant of CAT deferral, so that portion of the ruling remains in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Petitioner timely seeks our review. He argues that the BIA and the IJ erred by denying him asylum and withholding of removal under the material support bar, because he gave money to the Maoists under duress and gave only de minimis support.

In relevant part, \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(iv)(VI) defines engaging in terrorist activity as giving something that \"affords\n   <em>\n    material support, including\n   </em>\n   a safe house, transportation, communications,\n   <em>\n    funds\n   </em>\n   , transfer of funds or other material financial benefit, false documentation or identification, weapons (including chemical, biological, or\n   radiological weapons), explosives, or training,\" to a terrorist organization. (Emphases added.) The statute provides a list of things that constitute \"material support.\" \"Funds\" fall under this category, and the statute does not establish any numerical threshold for money to qualify as material support. The inclusion in the list of the phrase \"other material financial benefit\" does not assist Petitioner. Grammatically, that phrase relates only to \"transfer of funds\" and suggests that \"funds\" are material per se, because a person affords material support by transferring funds\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   some \"\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   material financial benefit.\" Under the plain text of \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(iv)(VI), \"funds\" knowingly given to a terrorist organization are \"material support,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   regardless of the amount given.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   If \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(iv)(VI) is ambiguous as to whether it contains an exception for de minimis funds, the BIA's interpretation merits\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference even though it post-dates the BIA's decision on Petitioner's claims.\n   <em>\n    Pauly v.

So too, when a statute uses an illustrative term that is overly broad, courts should adopt a narrowing construction of that illustrative term so that it fits the meaning of the term it illustrates.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277503\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/1324/#p1333\">\n    854 F.3d at 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (construing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(c)(1)(A)(ii) such that the illustrative phrase \"including any offense committed by fraud or deceit\" refers only to an \"offense against property\").

On the one hand, this phrase suggests that funds per se constitute a \"material financial benefit,\" as the majority points out. Maj. Op. at 1244-45. On the other hand, under the majority's interpretation, the word \"material\" as used this second time is entirely superfluous, as under the majority's interpretation,\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   financial benefit is necessarily material. If Congress did not intend \"material\" to be superfluous when used this second time, then \"material\" cannot be read as anything other than a quantitative term that excludes from its reach the transfer of de minimis (i.e.,\n   <em>\n    non\n   </em>\n   -material) financial benefits.
