Elwell\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-1160,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519688\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/912/637/\">\n    912 F.3d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20138710\">\n    2019 WL 138710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-3 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 9, 2019) (Randolph, J., dissenting), I dissent from the panel's denial of the motion for a stay. The majority's order\n   in effect directs a government attorney to perform work unrelated to any \"emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property\" and not otherwise \"authorized by law\" in violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201342\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After we published the opinions in\n   <em>\n    Kornitzky\n   </em>\n   , it came to my attention that several days earlier a different panel, in response to the government's \u00a7 1342 motion, granted an extension of the briefing schedule in a case in which the government is a party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Vasquez-Benitez\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-3076 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 3, 2018) (per curiam order). We now have another panel's grant of a similar extension, albeit in a case that will be submitted without oral argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Franklin-Mason v. Spencer\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-5135 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 10, 2018) (per curiam order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   It is obvious that our circuit has not settled upon any principled way of deciding these stay motions. There is no analytical difference between a motion to stay a briefing schedule (as in this case) and a motion to postpone oral argument (as in\n   <em>\n    Kornitzky\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
