Discussion.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Viewed from a political scientist's perspective, this landscape is rather easy to describe. In December 2016, the outgoing USDA administrators left their successors a time bomb -- published proposed agency actions promulgating USDA's longstanding interpretation of the PSA that would increase its regulatory authority, an interpretation that had been consistently rejected by numerous courts of appeals for over 75 years, without congressional intervention. Not surprisingly, USDA's incoming Secretary, acting on a promise to reduce regulation, took action to postpone and then cancel these proposals. In ruling on this petition for review, our task is limited to applying established, neutral legal principles to determine whether that was valid agency action. Whether prior court of appeals decisions have correctly interpreted the PSA is a task for the Supreme Court, or for each of those courts acting en banc. Whether the PSA should be amended to reflect USDA's view of what it\n   <em>\n    ought\n   </em>\n   to provide is the task of Congress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The parties agree those provisions apply to the USDA actions at issue. Section 706(2)(A) provides that a reviewing court shall \"(2) hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be (A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" This is a highly deferential standard: \"Under what we have called this 'narrow' standard of review, we insist that an agency 'examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action.' \"\n   <em>\n    FCC v.

First, surveying at length prior decisions of seven courts of appeals regarding the need to show harm to competition, 82 Fed. Reg. at 48,596 -98, USDA concluded that the interim final rule would conflict with decisions in at least four circuits, and that \"a regulation conflicting with relevant Circuit precedent will inevitably lead to more litigation in the livestock and poultry industries [which] serves neither the interests of the livestock and poultry industries nor [USDA].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48,597. Second, USDA concluded there was no \"good cause\" that warranted issuing the interim final rule without additional notice and public comment, because of the six-year delay between the initial comment period and publication of an interim final rule that was\n   not contained in the 2010 proposal; the substantial public interest in the proposal; and \"no evidence that the public would suffer harm following the normal notice and comment procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   48,598 -99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the other action at issue, USDA explained that it was taking no further action on proposed regulations\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20201.210\">\n    9 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 201.210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 201.211 because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   In the past, [USDA] has approached the elimination of specific unfair and deceptive practices on a case-by-case basis.

But the merits of the underlying debate are not the issue. An agency \"need not demonstrate to a court's satisfaction that the reasons for the new policy are\n   <em>\n    better\n   </em>\n   than the reasons for the old one; it suffices that the new policy is permissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency\n   <em>\n    believes\n   </em>\n   it to be better, which the conscious change of course adequately indicates.\"\n   <em>\n    Fox Television\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653713\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/502/#p513\">\n    556 U.S. at 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653713\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/502/#p513\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, USDA's \"new policy\" was to return to the enforcement policy it had pursued for decades. Thus, it is self-evident \"that the new policy is permissible under the statute.\" USDA's conclusion that the interim final rule and proposed regulations would result in protracted litigation that \"serves neither the interests of the livestock and poultry industries\" nor USDA is a rational reason\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to adopt a proposed change of course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Petitioners further argue that USDA \"was legally correct\" in December 2016 when it determined it could publish the interim final rule without invoking the APA's \"good cause\" exception to notice and comment rulemaking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), (c). Again, this attack on the merits of the agency's decision that more public notice and comment was needed is not the issue.

We conclude this is not an extraordinary situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In the first place, we cannot conclude that USDA has \"unlawfully withheld\" action by failing to comply with an absolute congressional deadline in Section 11006 of the 2008 Farm Bill. Congress directed USDA to \"promulgate regulations.\" That\n   directive is subject to different interpretations. With regard to administrative agencies, Black's Law Dictionary defines \"promulgate\" as \"to carry out the formal process of rulemaking by publishing the proposed regulation, inviting public comments, and approving or rejecting the proposal.\" (9th ed. 2009)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In response, USDA proposed rules responsive to all four subjects Congress identified. On subjects of this complexity, promulgating proposed regulations in the two years specified is likely all Congress expected. It would be unreasonable to assume that Congress expected final regulations within two years, regardless of the public comments. USDA held public meetings and workshops and considered 61,000 public comments. 81 Fed. Reg. at 92,566 -67. It then issued final regulations on three of the four subjects in December 2011.

Arguably, this was full compliance with the 2008 Farm Bill. That Congress attached appropriations riders for the next four years precluding USDA from finalizing its proposed regulation on the fourth subject is powerful if not conclusive evidence that USDA's failure to complete a controversial part of the task was not \"agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Irshad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055928\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/604/#p607\">\n    754 F.3d at 607-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying a writ of mandamus to compel an agency to make a hasty decision \"based upon a high-level analysis of complex, sensitive factors\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This is not a case where an agency has failed to take action in the face of multiple unambiguous commands.
