The tax authorities decided as a question of fact that it was entirely independent of his business. Sueh being the ease, it follows the taxpayer was not entitled to have- his loss on sueh stock deducted as a business loss, and the Commissioner rightly so held. The appeal of the taxpayer is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
