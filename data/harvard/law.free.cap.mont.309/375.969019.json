We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b62 The following issue is dispositive of this appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err by including weekends and holidays when it calculated the ten-day, statutory appeal time set forth in \u00a7 25-35-803, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">\u00b64 The relevant facts in this case are few and undisputed. Stephen G. Allen and Cynthia A. Allen (collectively, the \u201cAllens\u201d) sued Hubbard to recover land survey costs. On December 12, 2000, Justice of the Peace Karen A. Orzech of the Justice Court, Missoula County, Small Claims Division, entered a judgment in Allen\u2019s favor. Hubbard filed a Notice of Appeal on December 27, 2000. Judge Edward McLean dismissed Hubbard\u2019s appeal as untimely and awarded fees and costs to the Allens on May 21, 2001. Hubbard appeals the District Court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">\u00b65 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>to determine whether they are correct. <em>See Babcock v. Farmers Ins. </em>Exch., 2000 MT 114, \u00b6 5, 299 Mont. 407, \u00b6 5, 999 P.2d 347, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">\u00b66 Did the District Court err by including weekends and holidays when it calculated the ten-day, statutory appeal time set forth in \u00a7 25-35-803, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b400-14\">\u00b67 A party has ten days to file a notice of appeal with the district court if dissatisfied with the judgment of a small claims court. <em>See </em>\u00a7 25-35-803, MCA. Here, Hubbard waited fifteen calendar days to file his notice of appeal to the District Court. He argues, however, that when calculating the statutory time limit, a court should not include weekends or holidays in its calculations. Under such a calculation, Hubbard would have filed his notice of appeal exactly ten days after the date of the small claims court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-15\">\u00b68 When interpreting a statute, we look to the plain meaning of the words. <em>See State v. Fauque, </em>2000 MT 168, \u00b6 10, 300 Mont. 307, \u00b6 10, 4 P.3d 651, \u00b6 10. Our aim is \u201csimply to ascertain and declare what is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. If the language is clear and unambiguous, we do not need to conduct further interpretations. <em>See Fauque, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b69 The language of \u00a7 25-35-803, MCA, is clear concerning the length of time a party has to file an appeal. It states that, \u201c[a]n appeal shall be commenced by giving written notice to the small claims court and serving a copy of the notice of appeal on the adverse party within 10 days after entry of judgment.\u201d Section 25-35-803(1), MCA. Hubbard, however, urges us to look at two other statutory provisions to conclude that we should not include weekends or holidays in our calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"AhE\">\u00b610 Hubbard first directs us to the Montana Uniform Rules for the Justice and City Courts (the \u201cUniform Rules\u201d). Rule 21 of the Uniform Rules states that \u201c[w]hen the period of time prescribed or allowed is ten days or less, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be excluded.\u201d Hubbard argues that Rule 21 applies because Rule 1(a) of the Uniform Rules states that \u201c[t]hese rules, together with the Montana Justice and City Court Rules of Civil Procedure, govern the practice in all justice and city courts of the State of Montana.\u201d Contrasting the language of the Uniform Rules with that of the Montana Justice and City Court Rules of Civil Procedure, the latter of which specifically excludes small claims actions from its scope, Hubbard maintains that the Legislature clearly intended the Uniform Rules to apply to small claims actions. <em>Compare </em>Rule 1, Mont. Justice and City Court R.Civ.P. (stating that \u201c[t]hese rules govern the procedure in the justice and city courts ... <em>except in small claims actions.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)) <em>with </em>Rule 1(a) Mont. Unif. R. for the Justice and City Courts (stating that \u201c[tjhese rules ... govern the practice in all justice and city courts,\u201d without mentioning small claims actions). Examining the language of both the Small Claims Procedure and the Uniform Rules, however, we cannot agree that the Uniform Rules apply to \u00a7 25-35-803, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b611 The rules for Small Claims Procedure vary in several significant ways from the Uniform Rules. For instance, Small Claims Procedure rules do not allow for a form of pleadings other than a complaint or counterclaim. <em>See </em>\u00a7 25-35-607, MCA. The Uniform Rules, on the other hand, allow for answers and motions for orders. <em>See </em>Rules 8 &amp; 9, Mont. Justice and City Court R.Civ.P. Additionally, Small Claims Procedure rules limit the use of counsel, while the Uniform Rules specifically allow counsel to represent a party. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 25-35-505, MCA, <em>with </em>Rule 14, Uniform Rules. Given these differences, we cannot agree that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>the Uniform Rules necessarily apply to all procedures in small claims actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u00b612 Alternatively, Hubbard suggests we apply Rule 6(a), M.R.Civ.P., when calculating the time allowed in \u00a7 25-35-803, MCA. Rule 6(a) states that \u201c[w]hen the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than 11 days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays and holidays shall be excluded in the computation.\u201d In support of his argument, Hubbard directs us to several of our prior decisions for the proposition that Rule 6 applies to appeals to the District Court. None of these cases, however, deals with an appeal from a small claims court. <em>See In re Adoption of S.E. </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 31, 755 P.2d 27 (applying Rule 2 of the Uniform Rules, which specifically cites Rule 6(a), to a post-hearing motion in district court); <em>DeTienne </em>Assoc. <em>Ltd. Partnership v. Montana Rail Link, Inc. </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 238, 862 P.2d 1106 (interpreting Rule 6(a) in context of a motion for a new trial in district court); <em>State, By and Through Dept. of Highways v. Helehan </em>(1977), 171 Mont. 473, 559 P.2d 817 (applying Rule 6(a) to Rule 6(e) in context of an appeal from a commissioners\u2019 award).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u00b613 Hubbard also relies on Rule 1, M.R.Civ.P, which defines the scope of the Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 1 states that the Rules \u201cgovern the procedure in the district courts of the state of Montana... with the exceptions stated in Rule 81.\u201d In turn, Rule 81(b) states that \u201c[t]hese rules do not supersede the provisions of statutes relating to appeals to or review by the district courts, but shall govern procedure and practice relating thereto insofar as these rules are not inconsistent with such statutes.\u201d We do not dispute that situations will arise where these three provisions must work in concert to complement each other. Nevertheless, we find Hubbard\u2019s arguments unpersuasive in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AIA\">\u00b614 The language of \u00a7 25-35-803, MCA, is unambiguous. It clearly states that a party has ten days in which to file a notice of appeal, without mentioning the exclusion of weekends and holidays. The fact that other chapters of the code make such an exclusion is notable. In general, the Montana Unified Rules for the Justice and City Courts govern justice and city courts, the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure govern district courts and the Small Claims Procedure governs small claims courts. <em>See generally, </em>Rule 1, M.R.Civ.P.; Rule 1 Mont. Unif. R. for the Justice and City Courts; \u00a7 25-35-501, MCA. Two of the three statutory regimes provide that courts should not count weekends and holidays when calculating times. The rules of Small Claims Procedure, however, offer no such provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u00b615  We will not ignore such a noticeable absence from the Small <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Claims Procedure\u2019s language. If the Legislature wished to exclude weekends and holidays from the calculation in \u00a7 25-35-803, MCA, they could easily have done so, as Rule 21 of the Uniform Rules and Rule 6(a), M.R.Civ.P., do. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court was correct when it included holidays and weekends when calculating the ten-day limit in \u00a7 25-35-803, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\u00b616  As a final matter, the Allens request attorney\u2019s fees and costs under \u00a7 24-35-806, MCA. The section they cite, however, applies only to appeals from a small claims court to a district court. The Allens thus cite no authority that supports their request for an award of attorney's fees on appeal from the District Court. Therefore, we will not grant the Allens their request for attorney\u2019s fees incurred in this appeal. We note only that, as the prevailing party, the Allens are automatically entitled to costs under Rule 33, M.R.App.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b403-6\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b403-7\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"A7y\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">\u00b618 I dissent. As the Court points out at \u00b6 4 of its Opinion, Hubbard filed a notice of appeal from a decision entered in favor of Allen in \u201cJustice Court, Missoula County, Small Claims Division.\u201d The Montana Uniform Rules for the Justice and City Courts (\u201cUniform Rules\u201d) apply by their own language to Justice and City courts. Small Claims Court is a division of Justice Court. As the majority acknowledges in \u00b6 10 of its Opinion, Rule 21 of the Uniform Rules clearly provides that, \u201cwhen the period of time prescribed or allowed is ten days or less, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be excluded.\u201d The rule is clear and unequivocal. Nonetheless, the majority has concluded that Hubbard should have gone beyond this Uniform Rule and performed an analysis of other rules, including the Montana Justice and City Court Rules of Civil Procedure, before determining whether Uniform Rule 21 actually applied to his case. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">\u00b619 The Uniform Rules do not exclude from their purview actions which take place in the Small Claims division of the Justice Court. Hubbard was therefore entitled to rely on those rules, and should not lose his appellate rights because another set of rules contradicts the Uniform Rules which, on their face, appeared to apply squarely to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">\u00b620 Rule 81(b), M.R.Civ.P., also supports Hubbard\u2019s position. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-11\">These rules [The Montana Rules of Civil Procedure] do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>supersede the provisions of statutes relating to appeals to or review by the district courts, but shall govern procedure and practice relating thereto insofar as these rules are not inconsistent with such statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">The majority has cited no statute which specifies that intervening weekends and holidays are <em>not to be included </em>in the ten-day time frame set forth in \u00a7 25-35-803, MCA. Therefore, the application of Rule 6(a), M.R.Civ.P., to Hubbard\u2019s notice of appeal would not be inconsistent with any statutes governing Small Claims procedures. So, under Rule 81, Rule 6(a) ought to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\u00b621 It seems to me that we should apply statutes in a manner consistent with Hubbard\u2019s right to appeal, instead of seeking statutory interpretations which defeat it. I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
