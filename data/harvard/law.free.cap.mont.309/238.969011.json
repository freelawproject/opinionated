The District Court dismissed Yorek\u2019s petition, concluding that it had jurisdiction to impose the persistent felony offender designation, and that Yorek waived his claim that the court lacked jurisdiction to do so when he pled guilty. Yorek appeals from the dismissal of his petition for postconviction relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b62 The dispositive question presented is whether a district court possesses subject matter jurisdiction to impose a persistent felony offender designation upon a defendant being sentenced for felony DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">\u00b63 On October 26, 1999, Yorek was charged by Information with Count I, DUI (seventh offense), a felony; Count II, driving with suspended or revoked license (second offense), a misdemeanor; Count III, disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor; and Count IV, criminal mischief, a misdemeanor. The following day, Yorek entered pleas of not guilty to all four counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">\u00b64 On November 22,1999, the State filed a Notice of Intent to Seek Persistent Felony Offender Status, based on Yorek\u2019s April 4, 1997 felony conviction in Texas for driving while intoxicated. Following plea negotiations, on December 22, 1999, Yorek signed an Open Plea Agreement with the State. The agreement provided that the State intended to recommend Yorek \u201cbe sentenced to 15 years with 10 suspended for being a persistent felony offender, to run consecutively to the sentence received for crimes contained in the Information,\u201d and added that the State could also \u201crecommend any conditions it deems appropriate for the Persistent Felony Offender sentence.\u201d On that same day, Yorek signed a Guilty Plea and Waiver of Rights form, and the District Court accepted his guilty pleas to all four counts as knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">\u00b65 On February 2, 2000, the District Court sentenced Yorek. The court designated Yorek a persistent felony offender, sentencing him to Montana State Prison (MSP) for a period of fifteen years, with ten suspended. The court also sentenced Yorek to MSP for a period of thirteen months, followed by four years supervised probation for Count I, DUI, seventh offense. Yorek was sentenced to the Ravalli County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Detention Center for six months on Count II, ten days on Count III, and six months for Count IV. The sentences were to run consecutive for a total of twelve months, ten days in the Ravalli County Detention Center, followed by six years and one month in MSP, followed by fourteen years of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b66 Yorek filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for postconviction relief on January 2,2001, wherein he asserted claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to impose a persistent felony offender sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b67 Although the State responded that Yorek\u2019s petition for postconviction relief was based on claims that were waived as a result of his guilty plea, it also acknowledged that a jurisdictional defect is not waived by a guilty plea. However, the State contended that the District Court had jurisdiction to designate Yorek a persistent felony offender because the State satisfied the statutory requirements by filing notice of its intent to seek persistent felony offender status and providing the court with the relevant information concerning Yorek\u2019s previous April, 1997 felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b68 The District Court concluded that sentencing for DUI felonies is not solely governed by \u00a7\u00a7 61-8-731 and 61-8-734, MCA, and noted there is nothing in the persistent felony offender statute, \u00a7 46-18-501, MCA, that excludes from its application offenders convicted of DUI violations. The court found the State properly satisfied its statutory burden by giving Yorek notice of its intent to seek the persistent felony offender status based on his 1997 felony conviction. The court concluded that it therefore possessed jurisdiction to sentence Yorek as a persistent felony offender, and that because Yorek\u2019s claim was nonjurisdictional, Yorek effectively waived the claim by pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u00b69 Yorek appeals the District Court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for postconviction relief. Although Yorek raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel in his petition to the District Court, on appeal he challenges only the District Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction to declare him a persistent felony offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether its findings of fact are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law correct. <em>State v. Charlo, </em>2000 MT 192, \u00b6 7, 300 Mont. 435, \u00b6 7, 4 P.3d 1201, \u00b6 7 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">\u00b611 Does a district court possess subject matter jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>impose a persistent felony offender designation upon a defendant being sentenced for felony DUI?</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b612 Yorek contends the District Court lacked the authority to designate him as a persistent felony offender following his felony DUI conviction because \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA, the felony DUI statute, contains no reference to the persistent felony offender provisions found at Title 46, Chapter 18, Part 5, Montana Code Annotated. The State argues that the District Court possessed subject matter jurisdiction to designate Yorek a persistent felony offender, based on \u00a7 46-18-501, MCA, which defines persistent felony offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b613 The State also argues that Yorek\u2019s claims are procedurally barred under \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, contending that Yorek\u2019s guilty plea waived his right to direct appeal on his subject matter jurisdiction claim, thus barring him from raising the issue on postconviction relief. Yorek disagrees that he was procedurally barred, citing <em>State v. Moorman </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 330, 336, 928 P.2d 145, 149, where we concluded a defendant\u2019s designation as a dangerous offender was an issue of subject matter jurisdiction, and that the procedural bar under \u00a7 46-21-105, MCA, does not apply when the issue at hand is whether the sentencing court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to impose a particular sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b614 However, because the issue of whether the District Court possessed subject matter jurisdiction to impose the persistent felony offender designation on Yorek is dispositive, we need not address the District Court\u2019s ruling that Yorek\u2019s guilty plea procedurally barred him from bringing his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\u00b615 The question of whether a district court possesses the authority to impose a sentence is a jurisdictional issue. <em>Moorman, </em>279 Mont. at 336, 928 P.2d at 149 (court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to impose a sentence without statutory authority, and a sentence imposed in absence of subject matter jurisdiction is void). It is well-established that a district court\u2019s authority to impose sentences in criminal cases is defined and constrained by statute. <em>State v. Nelson, </em>1998 MT 227, \u00b6 24, 291 Mont. 15, \u00b6 24, 966 P.2d 133, \u00b6 24 (citation omitted). Moreover, \u201ca district court has no power to impose a sentence in the absence of specific statutory authority.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>\u00b6 24 (citing <em>State v. Hatfield </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 340, 346, 846 P.2d 1025, 1029; and <em>State v. Wilson, </em>279 Mont. 34, 37, 926 P.2d 712, 714).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">\u00b616 Yorek contends \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA, does not provide specific statutory authority for a district court to impose a persistent felony offender sentence on a defendant convicted of felony DUI. However, Yorek relies on the incorrect statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">\u00b617 A district court derives specific statutory authority for designation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>of persistent felony offender status from \u00a7 46-18-502, MCA. Section 46-18-501, MCA, defines \u201cpersistent felony offender\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-4\">an offender who has previously been convicted of a felony and who is presently being sentenced for a second felony committed on a different occasion than the first. An offender is considered to have been previously convicted of a felony if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">(1) the previous felony conviction was for an offense committed in this state or any other jurisdiction for which a sentence to a term of imprisonment in excess of 1 year could have been imposed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">(2) less than 5 years have elapsed between the commission of the present offense and either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">(a) the previous felony conviction; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-8\">(b) the offender\u2019s release on parole or otherwise from prison or other commitment imposed as a result of the previous felony conviction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">(3) the offender has not been pardoned on the ground of innocence and the conviction has not been set aside in a postconviction hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">\u00b618  The persistent felony offender provision makes no distinction between or among the types of felonies to which it applies, nor does it exclude offenders convicted of DUI violations. Rather, if the underlying charge meets the definition of a felony, and the State has provided proper notice of its intent to seek persistent felony offender status under \u00a7 46-13-108, MCA, a district court possesses the statutory authority to designate and sentence a defendant as a persistent felony offender pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-502, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">\u00b619 A felony is defined as \u201can offense in which the sentence imposed upon conviction is death or imprisonment in a state prison for a term exceeding 1 year.\u201d Section 45-2-101(22), MCA. Pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA (1999), on the fourth or subsequent DUI conviction, a \u201cperson is guilty of a <em>felony\u201d </em>and shall be imprisoned for a term of not less than six months or more than thirteen months (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">\u00b620  Following his felony DUI conviction, Yorek was sentenced to MSP for thirteen months, with four years probation to follow. Thus Yorek\u2019s DUI conviction meets the definition of a felony, and the District Court therefore had the statutory authority to impose the persistent felony offender sentence upon Yorek.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">\u00b621 We conclude Yorek falls squarely within the persistent offender statute, \u00a7 46-18-501, MCA. Yorek was, within the past five years, convicted of a felony and was currently being sentenced for a second felony committed on a different occasion than the first. Moreover, the State met its burden of providing notice of its intentions to Yorek, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>well as supplying the necessary information to the District Court to enable it to designate Yorek as a persistent felony offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\u00b622  We conclude the District Court possessed the subject matter jurisdiction to sentence Yorek as a persistent felony offender. Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Yorek\u2019s petition for postconviction relief is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b267-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, TRIEWEILER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
