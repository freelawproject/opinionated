We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">\u00b62 Krause raises three issues on appeal which we have restated for clarity as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred in its determination that a private driveway is a way of this State open to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in denying Krause\u2019s motion to exclude statements he made in response to questioning by Officer Heinecke before Officer Heinecke identified himself as a law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court erred in denying Krause\u2019s motion to exclude the results of Krause\u2019s blood test.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">\u00b66 On October 27, 1999, at about 11:40 p.m., Mark and Dee Boka\u2019s daughter woke them to tell them that someone was parked in their driveway and that the person had been there for ten or fifteen minutes. When the Bokas got up to investigate, they saw a vehicle in their driveway with its headlights shining on their house. Mark Boka testified that they did not know whose vehicle it was and that they had not given anyone permission to park there.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-15\">\u00b67 Dee Boka contacted the Beaverhead County Sheriffs Office and reported a suspicious person on their property. She reported that a vehicle was parked in their driveway with its engine running and its headlights shining on their house.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-16\">\u00b68 Officer Jake Heinecke was dispatched to the Boka residence to investigate. When Officer Heinecke arrived at the residence shortly before midnight, he noticed a newer model black GMC truck parked in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>the driveway which was just off of Highway 278. Officer Heinecke got out of his vehicle and approached the driver\u2019s side door. As he did so, he noticed that a man, who appeared to be asleep, was lying on the seat of the truck with his feet resting on the floor under the steering wheel. Two dogs were also inside the cab of the truck. The truck was running and the driver\u2019s side window was rolled down approximately one quarter of the way.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b69 Officer Heinecke knocked on the driver\u2019s side window in an attempt to wake the man. The man did not respond to the first knock but, after the second knock, he sat up and looked around. Officer Heinecke recognized the man as Kade George Krause. Krause rolled down the window at Officer Heinecke\u2019s request and, when he did so, Officer Heinecke detected the odor of alcohol on Krause\u2019s breath and he observed that Krause\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and glassy. Officer Heinecke asked Krause for his driver\u2019s license, registration and proof of insurance. Krause produced those items, but Officer Heinecke noticed that Krause had some difficulty getting his driver\u2019s license out of his wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u00b6 10 Officer Heinecke began to question Krause about where he\u2019d been, where he was going and whether he\u2019d had anything to drink. Krause responded that he had had \u201ca few beers\u201d and that he\u2019d been at \u201cthe old Watering Hole\u201d in Dillon. As Krause spoke, Officer Heinecke observed that his speech was slow and that he slurred his words.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u00b611 Officer Heinecke asked Krause to step out of the truck and Krause complied, but, as he did so Krause\u2019s two dogs also jumped out. Krause attempted to whistle for the dogs to return them to the truck, but finding himself unable to whistle, Krause resorted to calling the dogs. Thereafter, Officer Heinecke had Krause perform the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test. The test results were consistent with Officer Heinecke\u2019s belief that Krause was under the influence of alcohol. Hence, Officer Heinecke took Krause into custody and advised him that he was under arrest for driving under the influence (DUI).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u00b612 Before transporting Krause to the Sheriffs office, Officer Heinecke asked the Bokas for permission to leave Krause\u2019s truck and the dogs on their property and they consented. Mark Boka drove the truck to the back of his property with Krause in the truck alongside him so that Mark would be safe from the dogs. Mark later testified that it appeared to him that Krause was intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">\u00b613 At the station, Officer Heinecke had Krause perform another HGN test and the walk-and-turn test, both of which indicated that Krause was under the influence. Krause declined to submit to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>breathalyser test, thus his driver\u2019s license was seized and suspended pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-402(4), MCA. After the booking process was completed, Officer Heinecke allowed Krause to call his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b614 A short while after Krause\u2019s father came to pick him up, Paul Craft, Dillon Assistant Police Chief, was making a routine patrol of Barrett Memorial Hospital when he saw Krause and his father enter the building. Aware that Krause had been charged with DUI earlier that night, Craft reported his observation to Officer Heinecke. At the hospital, Krause requested a blood alcohol test. The State subsequently obtained the results of the blood test by investigative subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u00b615 On November 29,1999, Krause petitioned the District Court for reinstatement of his driver\u2019s license. A hearing on his petition was held on February 11, 2000. At the hearing, statements made by Krause prior to his arrest were admitted over his objection. Additionally, the results of the blood alcohol test which Krause had taken after his release from jail were also admitted over his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u00b616 On March 10,2000, the District Court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order denying Krause\u2019s petition for reinstatement. Krause appeals from the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">\u00b617 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact on the denial of a petition for reinstatement of a driver\u2019s license to determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Kleinsasser v. State, </em>2002 MT 36, \u00b6 9, 308 Mont. 325, \u00b6 9, 42 P.3d 801, \u00b6 9 (citing <em>Anderson v. State, Dept. of Justice </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 259, 262, 912 P.2d 212, 214; <em>Bauer v. State </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 119, 122, 910 P.2d 886, 888). We then review the court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Kleinsasser, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">\u00b618 \u201cBecause a presumption of correctness attaches to the State\u2019s act of suspending or revoking a driver\u2019s license, the driver bears the burden of proving that the suspension or revocation of a driver\u2019s license was improper.\u201d <em>Kleinsasser, </em>\u00b6 10 (quoting <em>Hulse v. State, Dept. of Justice, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 14, 289 Mont. 1, \u00b6 14, 961 P.2d 75, \u00b6 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">\u00b619 <em>Whether the District Court erred in its determination that a private driveway is a way of this State open to the public.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">\u00b620 In its March 10, 2000 order denying Krause\u2019s petition for reinstatement of his driver\u2019s license, the District Court determined that the \u201clane or access road providing access from Highway 278 into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>the residence of Mark and Dee Boka is a \u2018way [of this State] open to the public\u2019 as contemplated and defined under applicable Montana law.\u201d Thus, the court concluded that under Montana\u2019s implied consent statute (\u00a7 61-8-402, MCA) Officer Heinecke \u201cacted properly and appropriately\u201d in seizing Krause\u2019s driver\u2019s license when Krause refused to submit to a breathalyser test.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b621 Krause argues that the District Court erred in concluding that the Bokas\u2019 driveway is a way of this State open to the public. Hence, he maintains that the revocation of his license pursuant to the implied consent statute cannot stand because he was not on a way of this State open to the public at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b622 However, despite Krause\u2019s contentions to the contrary, the implied consent statute does not require that a defendant be <em>found and arrested </em>upon a way of this State open to the public. It only requires that an officer have <em>reasonable grounds to believe </em>that a defendant <em>had been driving </em>or <em>had been in actual physical control </em>of a vehicle upon ways of this State open to the public. More specifically, the implied consent statute provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">Blood or breath tests for alcohol, drugs, or both. (1) A person who operates or is in actual physical control of a vehicle upon ways of this state open to the public is considered to have given consent to a test or tests of the person\u2019s blood or breath for the purpose of determining any measured amount or detected presence of alcohol or drugs in the person\u2019s body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">(2) (a) The test or tests must be administered at the direction of a peace officer when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">(i) <em>the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person has been driving or has been in actual physical control of a vehicle upon ways of this state open to the public </em>while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of the two and the person has been placed under arrest for a violation of 61-8-401;...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-H-\">Section 61-8-402, MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">\u00b623 In addition, even though the District Court concluded that the Bokas\u2019 driveway is a way of this State open to the public, that conclusion is irrelevant to our determination here as there is ample evidence to support the conclusion that Krause had been driving upon a way of this State open to the public other than the Bokas\u2019 driveway. We have repeatedly stated that we will uphold a correct decision of a district court regardless of the lower court\u2019s reasoning in reaching its decision. <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing Hagan <em>v. State </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 31, 35, 873 P.2d 1385, 1387).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>\u00b624 In this case, Krause\u2019s truck did not suddenly materialize out of thin air in the Bokas\u2019 driveway. Krause had to have driven it there and to do so he had to have driven upon Highway 278 which is only 20 or 30 feet from the Bokas\u2019 driveway. There is no question that Highway 278 is a way of this State open to the public. Furthermore, since Krause had been parked in the Bokas\u2019 driveway for only a few minutes, Krause\u2019s intoxicated condition (evidenced, even before he responded to any of Officer Heinecke\u2019s questions, by the smell of alcohol on his breath and his bloodshot and glassy eyes) occurred prior to his arriving at the Boka residence. Consequently, Officer Heinecke had reasonable grounds to believe that Krause had been driving upon Highway 278-a way of this State open to the public-while under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b625 Krause cites <em>State v. Haws </em>(Okla. Crim. App. 1994), 869 P.2d 849, to support his proposition that the revocation of his driver\u2019s license was improper because the Bokas\u2019 driveway was not a way of this State open to the public. However, besides being of no precedential value to this Court, <em>Haws </em>is distinguishable from the case <em>subjudiee. </em>Like Krause, Haws was discovered asleep in his vehicle in someone else\u2019s driveway. However, the Court in <em>Haws </em>dismissed the charges against him because Oklahoma\u2019s DUI statute (47 O.S. \u00a7 11-902) required that Haws \u201chave been on the streets, highways, turnpikes or public parking lots that have been dedicated to the public.\u201d <em>Haws, </em>869 P.2d at 850.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahq\">\u00b626 Unlike the defendant <em>in Haws, </em>Krause is not challenging his DUI conviction. He is appealing the denial of his petition to reinstate his driver\u2019s license. In Montana, a district court may consider only a limited number of issues in a driver\u2019s license reinstatement proceeding. Section 61-8-403(4)(a), MCA. Unlike Oklahoma, a district court in Montana may consider <em>whether the officer had reasonable grounds to believe </em>that the person had been driving or was in actual physical control of a vehicle upon ways of this State open to the public while under the influence of alcohol. Section 61-8-403(4)(a)(i), MCA. Officer Heinecke had such reasonable grounds in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b627 Moreover, as we previously noted, \u201c[b]ecause a presumption of correctness attaches to the State\u2019s act of suspending or revoking a driver\u2019s license, the driver bears the burden of proving that the suspension or revocation of a driver\u2019s license was improper.\u201d <em>Kleinsasser, </em>\u00b6 10. Krause has not met his burden here.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u00b628 Incidentally, the version of the Oklahoma statute provided to this Court by Krause in the appendix to his reply brief, actually states: \u201cIt is unlawful and punishable as provided in this section for any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>to drive, operate, or be in actual physical control of a motor vehicle <em>within this state </em>who ... is under the influence of alcohol.\u201d Obviously, Oklahoma\u2019s legislators have toughened their laws since the court\u2019s decision in <em>Haws. </em>Now, according to 47 O.S. \u00a7 11-902 (OSCN 2000), driving under the influence is prohibited everywhere in the state of Oklahoma no matter what type of road or driveway one is on.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b629  Accordingly, without determining whether the Bokas\u2019 driveway is a way of this State open to the public, we affirm the decision of the District Court because there was ample evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s conclusion that Krause had been driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle upon a way of this State open to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\u00b630 <em>Whether the District Court erred in denying Krause\u2019s motion to exclude statements he made in response to questioning by Officer Heinecke before Officer Heinecke identified himself as a law enforcement officer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">\u00b631 Prior to the hearing on his petition for reinstatement of his driver\u2019s license, Krause filed a motion in limine to suppress various statements he made to Officer Heinecke. The District Court denied Krause\u2019s motion and the statements were admitted into evidence over Krause\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">\u00b632 We have previously stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-9\">\u201cThe purpose of a motion in limine is to prevent the introduction of evidence which is irrelevant, immaterial, or unfairly prejudicial.\u201d Accordingly, the authority to grant or deny a motion in limine \u201crests in the inherent power of the court to admit or exclude evidence and to take such precautions as are necessary to afford a fair trial for all parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-10\"><em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting <em>City of Helena v. Lewis </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 421, 425-26, 860 P.2d 698, 700). Hence, we will not overturn a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion in limine absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">\u00b633 Krause argues that pursuant to Montana\u2019s stop and frisk statute (\u00a7 46-5-402(4), MCA), before asking him where he had been and if he had been drinking, Officer Heinecke was required to inform Krause that he was a peace officer; that the stop was not an arrest, but rather a temporary detention for an investigation; and that, upon completion of the investigation, Krause would be released if not arrested. Thus, Krause asserts that since he was not provided with the pertinent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>information before questioning, his statements to Officer Heinecke should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\u00b634 The State argues on the other hand that Krause\u2019s contention would be true only if Officer Heinecke had reason to suspect that Krause was armed and presently dangerous as provided by subsection (1) of \u00a7 46-5-402, MCA. The State maintains that under this subsection of the statute, since Officer Heinecke had no reason to suspect that Krause was armed and dangerous, subsection (4) is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"AKg\">\u00b635 -The State also argues that this was an \u201cinvestigative stop\u201d not a \u201cstop and frisk\u201d and that Montana\u2019s investigative stop statute (\u00a7 46-5-401, MCA), contains no requirements similar to those found in \u00a7 46-5-402(4), MCA. Thus, the State asserts that, under \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA, Officer Heinecke had the authority to obtain or verify an account of Krause\u2019s presence or conduct or to determine whether to arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"ANM\">\u00b636 However, \u00a7 46-5-402, MCA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">Stop and. frisk. A peace officer who has lawfully stopped a person <em>under 46-5-401 or this section:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">(1) may frisk the person and take other reasonably necessary steps for protection if the officer has reasonable cause to suspect that the person is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or another person present;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">(2) may take possession of any object that is discovered during the course of the frisk if the officer has probable cause to believe the object is a deadly weapon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">(3) may demand the name and present address of the person; <em>and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-10\">(4) <em>shall inform the person, as promptly as possible under the circumstances and in any case before questioning the person, that the officer is a peace officer, that the stop is not an arrest but rather a temporary detention for an investigation, and that upon completion of the investigation, the person will be released if not arrested. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">Therefore, \u00a7 46-5-402, MCA, by its terms, clearly and unambiguously applies to a stop made pursuant to \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA. Moreover, because subsection (4) of \u00a7 46-5-402, MCA, begins with the term \u201cshall\u201d it is mandatory whether the stop is an \u201cinvestigative stop\u201d under \u00a7 46-5-401, MCA, or a \u201cstop and frisk\u201d under \u00a7 46-5-402, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">\u00b637 While we suspect that the Legislature may not have intended to require that peace officers give the warning contemplated in \u00a7 46-5-402(4), MCA, when a person is stopped for a DUI investigation where there is no intention to frisk, that is not how the statute reads. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>However, in the construction of a statute our job \u201cis simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u00b638  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred by not suppressing the statements Krause made to Officer Heinecke prior to Officer Heinecke giving the warning as set forth in \u00a7 46-5-402(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u00b639 <em>Whether the District Court erred in denying Krause\u2019s motion to exclude the results of Krause\u2019s blood test.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">\u00b640 After he was released from custody, Krause went to a local hospital for an independent blood alcohol test. The State obtained the results of that blood test through an investigative subpoena. Prior to the hearing on his petition for reinstatement of his driver\u2019s license, Krause filed a motion in limine to exclude the results of that blood test from the hearing. The District Court denied Krause\u2019s motion and the test results were admitted into evidence over Krause\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">\u00b641 On appeal, Krause argues that the District Court erred in admitting the results of his blood test on the basis that it was not relevant to any issue in the case. He points out that a valid arrest is necessary <em>prior </em>to the time an officer requests a blood or breath test and that an arrest cannot be justified based on evidence that is obtained after the fact. The decision as to the validity of the arrest and, thus, the officer\u2019s request must be based on the information he had at the time. It cannot be bolstered by information obtained after the fact. Rules 401 and 402, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">\u00b642 The State argues that the evidence of Krause\u2019s blood alcohol test was introduced to substantiate the credibility of Officer Heinecke\u2019s observations and opinion. The State maintains that the evidence was introduced to \u201cshore up\u201d Officer Heinecke\u2019s credibility as a witness, not to retrospectively validate Officer Heinecke\u2019s belief that Krause had committed the offense of driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">\u00b643  However, as Krause points out :in his reply brief, under Rule 608(a), M.R.Evid.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">The credibility of a witness may be attacked or supported by evidence in the form of opinion or reputation, but <em>subject to these limitations\u2019. </em>(1) the evidence may refer only to character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, and (2) evidence of truthful character is admissible only after the character of the witness for truthfulness has been attacked by opinion or reputation evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-4\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Here, Officer Heinecke\u2019s character for truthfulness had not been attacked, nor did the evidence of Krause\u2019s blood alcohol test refer to Officer Heinecke\u2019s character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. There was no legitimate purpose for the introduction of the blood test evidence, thus the District Court should have excluded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u00b644 Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred by not excluding the results of Krause\u2019s blood alcohol test.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">\u00b645 We hold that it is irrelevant whether the Bokas\u2019 driveway is a way of this State open to the public. There was sufficient evidence in the record to conclude that Krause had been driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle upon the ways of this State open to the public prior to his arrival at the Boka residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">\u00b646 Moreover, because we hold that the District Court erred by not suppressing the statements Krause made to Officer Heinecke and by not excluding the results of Krause\u2019s blood alcohol test, we reverse and remand to the District Court for a new hearing. We further hold that on remand the District Court should not consider any statements made by Krause prior to the time when the warning under \u00a7 46-5-402(4), MCA, was given (if indeed it was), nor should the court consider the results of Krause\u2019s blood alcohol test.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">\u00b647 Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b207-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
