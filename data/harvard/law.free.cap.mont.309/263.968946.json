Ohms filed a motion to dismiss which argued that the Ravalli County Justice Court retained original jurisdiction over the matter, as the allegedly stolen property was worth less than the statutory minimum required of felony theft. The District Court denied Ohms\u2019 motion and a jury found Ohms guilty of felony theft. Ohms appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the State presented sufficient evidence regarding the value of a masonry saw to convict Ohms of felony theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">\u00b63 On April 28, 2000, the State charged Ohms by information with one count of felony theft and one count of misdemeanor theft in violation of \u00a7 45-6-301, MCA. As to the felony charge, the State alleged that \u201c[o]n or about March 13, 1999, [Ohms] purposely or knowingly obtained unauthorized control\u201d of a masonry saw, valued at over $1,000. As to the misdemeanor charge, the State alleged that \u201c[o]n or about April 12, 1999, [Ohms] purposely or knowingly obtained or exerted unauthorized control over property belonging to tenants of a butcher shop ....\u201d The State valued the stolen butcher shop property, consisting of butcher knives and a portable stereo, at less than $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"ADXS\">\u00b64 Ohms plead not guilty to both offenses and filed motions to dismiss both charges on jurisdictional grounds. Ohms argued that the saw was worth less than the statutory minimum required to obtain a felony conviction. Further, Ohms asserted that a district court maintains original jurisdiction over misdemeanor offenses only upon the existence of certain statutorily defined circumstances. Ohms claimed that none of those circumstances existed. Therefore, Ohms insisted that the Ravalli County Justice Court retained original jurisdiction over both of the alleged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>\u00b65 On June 28, 2000, the District Court denied Ohms\u2019 motion to dismiss the felony charge. The State subsequently conceded that the District Court lacked original jurisdiction over the misdemeanor charge, and on September 21, 2000, the District Court dismissed the same. On October 6, 2000, the State filed an amended information to reflect the dismissal of the misdemeanor offense and the case proceeded to trial on the felony allegation. On October 19, 2000, the jury found Ohms guilty of felony theft in violation of \u00a7 45-6-301, MCA. On January 30,2001, the District Court sentenced Ohms to five years in the Montana State Prison, all suspended, so long as Ohms complied with certain delineated conditions. Ohms filed a notice of appeal which challenges his conviction for felony theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b66 We review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a jury verdict to determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Merrick, </em>2000 MT 124, \u00b6 7, 299 Mont. 472, \u00b6 7, 2 P.3d 242, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u00b67 Did the State present sufficient evidence regarding the value of a masonry saw to convict Ohms of felony theft?</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">\u00b68 Ohms indicates that, for purposes of his case, the State was required to value the stolen property in excess of $500 to sustain a conviction for felony theft. Ohms insists that the State failed to establish a market value or reasonable replacement value for the masonry saw at trial. In the absence of this valuation, Ohms maintains that the statutory presumption valuing stolen property at less than the felony threshold must prevail. Accordingly, Ohms contends that the evidence did not support a felony theft conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">\u00b69 In 1999, the Legislature amended the felony theft statute to require that the stolen property\u2019s value exceed $1000 to effect a felony charge. However, the amendments did not take effect until October 1, 1999. The information filed by the State alleged that Ohms committed felony theft on March 13, 1999. Consequently, the provisions of the felony theft statute in effect on that date, \u00a7 45-6-301, MCA (1997), apply to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">\u00b610 Section 45-6-301(7)(b), MCA (1997), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-11\">A person convicted of the offense of theft of property exceeding $500 in value ... shall be fined not to exceed $50,000 or be imprisoned in the state prison for any term not to exceed 10 years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>In a felony theft case, the value of the property taken is an essential element which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Sunday </em>(1980), 187 Mont. 292, 300, 609 P.2d 1188, 1193. Section 45-2-101(74)(a), MCA (1997), defines value as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-4\">\u201cValue\u201d means the market value of the property at the time and place of the crime or, if the market value cannot be satisfactorily ascertained, the cost of the replacement of the property within a reasonable time after the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Finally, \u00a7 45-2-101(74)(b), MCA (1997), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">When it cannot be determined if the value of the property is more or less than $500 by the standards set forth in subsection (74)(a), its value is considered to be an amount less than $500.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdQ\">\u00b611 At trial, the aggrieved owner, Todd Bruhnke, testified that he purchased the used saw approximately nine years prior to the theft for $400. Bruhnke also testified that after the purchase he had the motor rebuilt for $600. Subsequently, the State elicited expert testimony from a salesman within the masonry industry to establish the value of the stolen property. On direct examination, the State and the expert engaged in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">Q: Have you become familiar ... with the market values of masonry saws?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">A: Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">Q: At some point in time, did you become familiar with the specifications of a masonry saw that had been owned by Todd Bruhnke?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-10\">A: Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-11\">Q: Do you know what kind of a motor that we\u2019re talking about ... here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-12\">A: That motor, new, is going for right around $800. You can get a replacement motor for about $700. If you wanted to go high efficient, about $850. That\u2019s just for the motor. It\u2019s not counting the arm, the housing,... or the wafer portion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-13\">Q: [Wjhat are we talking about for an entirely new unit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-14\">A: An entire new saw, full list price is $3,924.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-15\">However, on cross-examination, the expert testified to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuO\">Q: The price (sic) that you were quoting, those are for new parts like a new motor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-16\">A: Replacement parts, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-17\">Q: Is it possible to get used parts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-18\">A: It\u2019s possible to get used parts. My sources would be new.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-19\">Q: So, if [this saw has] been used for nine years and rebuilt once, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>how much do you think it\u2019s worth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\">A: I couldn\u2019t say, not for used. I can only give you my prices on new parts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u00b612  In convicting Ohms of felony theft, the jury presumably found that the value of the masonry saw exceeded $500 based on the expert\u2019s replacement valuation. However, \u00a7 45-2-101(74)(a), MCA (1997), clearly and unambiguously provides that evidence of replacement value is to be considered only when the market value \u201ccannot be satisfactorily ascertained.\u201d In other words, if the State is unable to present evidence of the stolen item\u2019s market value, it must establish that the market value of the stolen item cannot be ascertained before it resorts to the alternative of establishing value by proof of replacement value alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u00b613  Clearly, the State\u2019s expert could not provide a market value for the stolen saw at the time and place of the crime, nor was he asked by the State to do so. Further, the State failed to establish that the market value could not be satisfactorily ascertained. Instead, the State chose to rely exclusively on the replacement value to meet its burden of proof. The State failed to establish the necessary predicate to the use of replacement value for purposes of determining \u201cvalue\u201d under \u00a7 45-2-101(74)(a), MCA (1997). Accordingly, no rational finder of fact could have found the essential elements of felony theft, as defined by statute, beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\u00b614 Our holding here is in accord with our decision in <em>State v. Martin, </em>2001 MT 83,305 Mont. 123,23 P.3d 216. In <em>Martin, </em>we interpreted the statutory definition of \u201cvalue\u201d to place the burden of proof on the State to establish the market value for stolen property or, in the alternative, that the market value cannot be satisfactorily ascertained, prior to proceeding to a replacement valuation. We recognize that <em>Martin </em>was decided in May of 2001. The case at bar proceeded to trial in October of 2000 and Ohms filed his notice of appeal on December 29, 2000. Nevertheless, <em>Martin </em>governs the disposition of this case pursuant to the principles discussed in <em>State v. Goebel </em>and <em>State v. Giddings, </em>2001 MT 155, 306 Mont. 83, 31 P.3d 340, <em>limited by Gundrum v. Mahoney, </em>2001 MT 246, 307 Mont. 96, 36 P.3d 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">\u00b615 In <em>Goebel </em>and <em>Giddings, </em>\u00b6 20, we cited <em>Bouie v. Columbia </em>(1964), 378 U.S. 347, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 12 L.Ed.2d 894, for the proposition that if a judicial construction of a criminal statute is \u201cunexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue,\u201d it must not be applied retroactively. However, <em>Martin\u2019s </em>interpretation of the \u201cvalue\u201d definition did not represent a construction that was \u201cunexpected and indefensible by reference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue,\u201d because this Court had not previously interpreted the statutory \u201cvalue\u201d definition for purposes of the issues raised in this case and <em>Martin. </em>Further, in <em>Goebel </em>and <em>Giddings, </em>\u00b6 23, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">[A] judicial construction of a statute is an authoritative statement of what the statute meant before as well as after the decision of the case giving rise to that construction. Thus, a court\u2019s interpretation of a statute is never new law because the decision declares what the statute meant from the day of its enactment, not from the date of the decision. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah\">Accordingly, for purposes of this appeal, <em>Martin </em>should be given retroactive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b616  Pursuant to <em>Martin, </em>the State failed to carry its burden of proof. The State had the opportunity to offer to the jury an instruction on the lesser included offense of misdemeanor theft. It initially proposed such an instruction but elected to withdraw it prior to trial. Therefore, the only charge before the jury was that of felony theft. Accordingly, the felony theft conviction is reversed, the charge is dismissed, and the sentence entered pursuant to the conviction for felony theft is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b617 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b292-7\">JUSTICES REGNIER, LEAPHART, RICE and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
