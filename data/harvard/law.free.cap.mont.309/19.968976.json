After the federal violation was charged, Liefert sought to withdraw his guilty plea to the partner assault in Justice Court, arguing good cause to withdraw his plea because the Justice Court did not inform him of the federal prohibition on possessing a firearm as a result of his plea under state law. The Justice Court denied the motion, and Liefert appealed the denial to the First Judicial District Court, Broadwater County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court also denied his motion, concluding Liefert did not have to be advised of the federal prohibition because it is a collateral consequence of Liefert\u2019s sentence. Liefert followed with this appeal, again arguing that his guilty plea was not voluntary because he was not informed of the federal limitations on possessing a gun upon conviction for domestic violence under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal: Did the District Court err in denying Liefert\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea because Liefert was entitled to be informed of the federal firearms prohibition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>that could result from a state conviction for partner assault?</p>\n<p id=\"ALd\">\u00b63 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">L FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\u00b64 On August 25,1999, Liefert plead guilty to partner assault under \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA, in Justice Court No. 1, Broadwater County. The facts underlying the plea are not part of the record because justice courts are not courts of record. However, the briefs of the parties indicate that law enforcement responded to a 911 call regarding an argument between Liefert and his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u00b65 On May 18, 2000, Liefert was charged with violations of federal laws that prohibit possession of a firearm when someone receives qualifying state convictions. One charge arose under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9) due to Liefert\u2019s guilty plea for domestic assault. The other charge arose under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) due to Liefert\u2019s Minnesota conviction for third degree assault. We are only concerned here with the federal charge arising from Liefert\u2019s guilty plea to partner assault in Montana. The facts that gave rise to Liefert\u2019s possession of a firearm are also not part of the record. However the briefs of the parties indicate that Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks authorities discovered Liefert\u2019s gun possession during a hunting investigation and reported this possession to the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Montana after learning of his prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">\u00b66 After Liefert was charged with the federal violations, he sought to withdraw his guilty plea in Justice Court. The Justice Court denied the motion. The basis for the Justice Court\u2019s decision is not part of the record because justice courts are not courts of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">\u00b67 Liefert then appealed to the District Court. The District Court held that the Justice Court did not have to inform Liefert of the federal gun prohibition because under <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 386, 833 P.2d 153, judges are not required to inform defendants of the collateral consequences of a guilty plea. Therefore, the District Court held that there was no good cause for Liefert to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">\u00b68 We have held that there is no appeal to a District Court from the denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea in Justice Court. <em>State v. Feight, </em>2001 MT 205, \u00b6 22, 306 Mont. 312, \u00b6 22, 33 P.3d 623, \u00b6 22. Further, lack of proper jurisdiction can always be raised at any point in a proceeding. <em>State v. LaPier </em>(1998), 289 Mont. 392, 395, 961 P.2d 1274, 1276; \u00a7 46-13-101(3), MCA. The State asserts here that jurisdiction was not proper in District Court and that Liefert\u2019s appeal should therefore be dismissed. However, the State also suggests that Liefert\u2019s appeal could be deemed as one for post conviction relief, which is an alternative not addressed in <em>Feight. See State v. Feight, </em>2001 MT 205, \u00b6 16 n.2, 306 Mont. 312, \u00b6 16 n.2, 33 P.3d 623, \u00b6 16 n.2. Without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>deciding the issue of whether a petition for post conviction relief is proper in all similarly situated cases, we accept the State\u2019s suggestion to deem this case a request for post conviction relief for purposes of this case only. Accordingly, we address the issue of whether Liefert had good cause to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b69  In order for a guilty plea to validly waive constitutional protections, the defendant\u2019s guilty plea must be a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent choice among options. <em>State v. Radi </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 155, 159, 818 P.2d 1203, 1206 (citing <em>North Carolina v. Alford </em>(1970), 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162); <em>see </em>\u00a7 46-12-210, MCA. The defendant must be aware of the rights waived including such rights as the right to a jury trial, to counsel, or the right against self incrimination. <em>State v. Yother </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 128, 130, 831 P.2d 1347, 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u00b610  A district court may permit the withdrawal of a guilty plea for good cause. Section 46-16-105(2), MCA. \u201cThe fundamental purpose of allowing the withdrawal of a guilty plea is to prevent the possibility of convicting an innocent [person].\u201d <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 124, 127, 907 P.2d 150, 152. This Court reviews denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Bowley </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 298, 304, 938 P.2d 592, 595. We consider three factors in this review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">1. the adequacy of the court\u2019s interrogation at the time the plea was entered regarding the defendant\u2019s understanding of the consequences of the plea;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">2. the promptness with which the defendant attempts to withdraw the plea;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\">3. the fact that the plea was the result of a plea bargain in which the guilty plea was given in exchange for dismissal of another charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-10\"><em>Bowley, </em>282 Mont. at 304, 938 P.2d at 595. In this case, there was no plea agreement and the State does not dispute that Liefert\u2019s attempt to withdraw his plea was prompt. Therefore, the only factor at issue is whether the Justice Court\u2019s plea colloquy was adequate even though it did not inform Liefert of the consequence of the federal prohibition on possession of firearms as a result of a state conviction for domestic violence, in this case, partner assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">\n<em>A. Issues Not Addressed in this Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b46-13\">\u00b611 Before we turn to the issue presented to this Court, it is important that we clarify the issues this Opinion does not address. These issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>were noted by the parties in briefs and at oral argument, but were not otherwise presented to the Justice Court, District Court, or this Court for decision. First, we do not address whether, under Montana state law, Liefert\u2019s civil rights were restored when he completed his sentence for partner assault. Liefert noted that he presented different issues in disputing his charges in federal court. In federal court, Liefert argued that under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20) and (a)(33)(B)(ii), a defendant should no longer be subject to the federal prohibition if that defendant\u2019s civil rights were restored by state law, i.e., if the state considered the punishment complete. Liefert argued in federal court that the determination of when rights are restored is a matter of state law and that Liefert\u2019s rights should be considered restored under Montana law because he completed his sentence. However, Liefert did not present the issue of the restoration of his rights in state court. Therefore, we do not address whether under state law, Liefert\u2019s rights were restored<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"ALOu\">\u00b612 Second, the State noted that under <em>United States v. Akins </em>(9th Cir. 2002), 276 F.3d 1141, 2002 WL 24358, Liefert\u2019s plea might not be adequate for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) in part because it was not taken in a court of record with the consequence that the plea colloquy was not detailed in a record. However, Liefert noted that the federal charges against him have not been dismissed. Accordingly, we assume for purposes of this appeal that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9) applies to Liefert, regardless of the <em>Akins </em>issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b613 Third, the State noted that it believed there was a possible issue that Congress exceeded its power in enacting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9) by imposing such a restriction on firearms when a gun is not used in the underlying domestic violence case. Again, this issue was not presented here and it would not be within the purview of this Court\u2019s power to decide this issue, in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u00b614 Finally, regarding the adequacy of the plea colloquy, Liefert did not assert that gun possession is such that every defendant in every case is entitled to be informed that as a result of a conviction, the defendant\u2019s possession of firearms may be limited. In other words, Liefert did not assert that a judge must inform every defendant of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>affect of a guilty plea on gun possession, the same as a judge must inform a defendant of trial related rights such as the right to trial by jury, to be represented by counsel, the right against self incrimination, or other like rights. <em>See Yother, </em>253 Mont. at 130, 831 P.2d at 1348; <em>Boykin v. Alabama </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274. Rather, Liefert only presented the issue of whether a trial court must inform a defendant during its plea colloquy of the federal limitations on gun possession in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) when a defendant is charged with partner assault under \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA. We now turn to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">\n<em>B. The Parties\u2019 Positions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b615 In support of his argument that the Justice Court\u2019s plea colloquy was inadequate and that his resultant guilty plea was not voluntary, Liefert notes that a trial court is required to inform a defendant of the maximum penalty allowed by law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-12-210(a)(iii) and \u00a7 46-16-105(1), MCA. He also cites <em>United States v. Batchelder </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 114, 123, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 2204, 60 L.Ed.2d 755, observing that a sentencing statute, like any other punitive statute, must give fair warning of the punishment that can result from a violation. Further, Liefert points out that under the state statutes, \u00a7 45-5-206(7) and \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(b), MCA, the gun restriction is discretionary, whereas in the federal statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), the gun restriction is not discretionary, but mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b616 Based on these uncontroverted points, Liefert asserts that by reading the state statute, \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA, and the federal statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9), together, the federal law preempts the state law such that there is a mandatory restriction on firearms. He further asserts that by reading the state and federal statutes together, due process requires that the Justice Court should have informed Liefert of the federal prohibition in order to give him fair warning regarding gun restrictions. By reading the state statute alone, Liefert argues a defendant is given a \u201cnegative implication\u201d that the defendant\u2019s gun rights are completely at the discretion of the state court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u00b617 Liefert also points out that under \u00a7 46-12-210(f), MCA, courts are required to inform defendants in Montana that a guilty plea may have consequences under federal immigration law. Liefert asserts that defendants should similarly be informed of the federal consequences and restrictions on gun possession when pleading guilty to partner assault under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">\u00b618 In contrast, the State asserts that judges are not required to inform defendants of the collateral consequences of a plea. The State argues that under our precedent, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is a collateral consequence. Further, the State asserts that the requirement regarding federal immigration law was a policy determination made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>by the Legislature and that any similar requirements regarding gun possession must also be based on legislative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">C. <em>The Federal Restrictions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) are Collateral Consequences.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b619 In Montana, if a defendant is convicted of partner assault under \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA, the trial court \u201cmay prohibit an offender convicted under this section from possession or use of the firearm used in the assault.\u201d Section 45-5-206(7), MCA; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 46-18-202(1)(b), MCA (providing judges with the general discretion to restrict gun possession for any state crimes). The federal statute at issue, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9), reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">It shall be unlawful for any person ... who has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-7\"><em>See also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(8), (d)(8) and (d)(9).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The federal law also provides for its effect on state law as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">No provision of this chapter shall be construed as indicating an intent on the part of the Congress to occupy the field in which such provision operates to the exclusion of the law of any State on the same subject matter, unless there is a direct and positive conflict between such provision and the law of the State so that the two cannot be reconciled or consistently stand together.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Title 18, U.S.C. 927. These statutes serve as the basis of Liefert\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">\u00b620 Under the age old maxim that people are presumed to know the law, Liefert is of course presumed to be aware of both the state and federal statutes. <em>State v. Lynn </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 430, 435-36, 795 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>429, 433. Therefore, his actual knowledge is not at issue. Rather, the issue is whether the state trial court had a duty to inform Liefert of the federal consequences of a state guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b621  Because it is impossible for a judge to inform a defendant of every possible consequence of a guilty plea, most courts have adopted the prevailing rule that judges are only required to inform defendants regarding the <em>direct </em>consequences of a guilty plea and are not required to inform defendants regarding the <em>collateral </em>consequences. <em>See Torrey v. Estelle </em>(9th Cir. 1988), 842 F.2d 234, 235. While we have not explicitly adopted this rule in Montana, we have actually applied this rule on a case by case basis by analyzing specific consequences to determine whether a district court must inform a defendant of that consequence before accepting a guilty plea. <em>See State v. Buckman </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 37, 43, 768 P.2d 1361, 1365 (court not required to inform defendant of all implications regarding parole eligibility); <em>State v. Skroch </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 349, 357, 883 P.2d 1256, 1262 (court not required to inform defendant of requirement to register as a sex offender until sentencing hearing); <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 112, 122, 946 P.2d 140, 146 (\u00a7 46-12-210, MCA, is modeled after Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c); defendant not entitled to be informed of all conceivable consequences regarding parole eligibility). We now explicitly adopt the rule that under \u00a7 46-12-210, MCA, and related statutes, district courts are only required to inform defendants of the direct, rather than the collateral, consequences of a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b622 The question presented in this appeal thus turns on whether the federal consequences of Liefert\u2019s plea are direct or collateral. A consequence is direct if it has a \u201cdefinite, immediate, and largely automatic effect\u201d on the defendant. <em>United States v. Bouthot </em>(1st Cir. 1989), 878 F.2d 1506, 1511. In contrast, a consequence is collateral if a defendant has control over whether or not the consequence occurs. <em>Torrey, </em>842 F.2d at 236. In addition, a consequence is collateral if it is not under the control of the sentencing judge or it is a procedure under the control of a different sovereign or different agency. <em>United States v. Long </em>(7th Cir. 1988), 852 F.2d 975, 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">\u00b623 <em>Long </em>addressed the same general issue presented here, but from the perspective of a federal court. In <em>Long, </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">[T]he state and federal systems are separate and distinct, and the defendant need only be informed of the direct consequences he may face within the particular system. Therefore, the state court, even if knowledgeable about federal criminal law, need not undertake to inform the defendant of his potential federal criminal liability: the nature of the state sentence was unaffected by the federal prosecution and sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-8\"><em>See also United States v. Maestas </em>(5th Cir. 1991), 941 F.2d 273, 279; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number><em>United States v. Jordan </em>(7th Cir. 1989), 870 F.2d 1310, 1317 (\u201cfederal prosecution was only a possibility, over which the State\u2019s Attorney had no control\u201d); <em>Bouthot, </em>878 F.2d at 1511 (\u201cfederal firearms prosecution [under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922] was not a largely automatic, definite, or immediate consequence of the state guilty pleas\u201d); <em>United States v. Campusano </em>(1st Cir. 1991), 947 F.2d 1, 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\u00b624 We have previously briefly addressed the issue of whether trial courts must bring federal consequences to the attention of a defendant. In <em>Reynolds, </em>a case closely analogous to the case at bar, the defendant attempted to withdraw his guilty plea in state court after being charged with illegal possession of a weapon in federal court under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). <em>Reynolds, </em>253 Mont. at 390, 833 P.2d at 154. The defendant attempted to withdraw his plea in part on the grounds that his plea was involuntary because he was not informed of the federal consequences of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), which prohibits anyone convicted of a state felony from possessing a weapon. Reynolds had pled guilty in state court to issuing a bad check, a felony, and to forgery, a misdemeanor. <em>Reynolds, </em>253 Mont. at 387, 833 P.2d at 154. We held that trial courts do not have to inform defendants of \u201cevery illegal action that could affect the defendant upon entering a guilty plea\u201d and we agreed with the trial court that there was no specific affirmative requirement to inform the defendant of the federal ramifications in that case. <em>Reynolds, </em>253 Mont. at 392, 833 P.2d at 156-57; <em>see also State v. Miller </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 194, 196-98, 810 P.2d 308, 309-10 (failure to inform client regarding federal consequences of guilty plea does not constitute fundamental mistake in plea agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u00b625  Turning to this case, Liefert had discretionary control over whether he would be in violation of federal law upon entry of his guilty plea. He would be in violation of federal law if he chose to possess a weapon; he would not be in violation of federal law if he made the opposite choice. Further, Liefert\u2019s federal prosecution is under the control of a different sovereign entity. Therefore, we hold that the consequence of a potential federal firearms prosecution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 is a collateral consequence because the consequence is not an automatic, definite, or immediate consequence of a state guilty plea and because the consequence is under the control of the federal government. <em>See also Saadiq v. Iowa </em>(Iowa 1986), 387 N.W.2d 315, 325 (holding that restriction on firearms under a different section of Iowa law was a collateral consequence); <em>Reponte v. State </em>(Haw. 1976), 556 P.2d 577, 584 (restriction on holding a gun is a collateral consequence). Accordingly, the trial court was not required to inform Liefert of this collateral consequence, and Liefert\u2019s guilty plea was properly accepted as a voluntary and knowing plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>\u00b626  Regarding Liefert\u2019s due process/federal preemptionAiegative implication\u201d argument, Liefert cites <em>Batchelder </em>in support of the proposition that statutes must give fair warning. However, he does not cite authority for the proposition that federal and state statutes, when taken and read together, must give fair warning. While we agree that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 applies here, <em>see Caron v. United States </em>(1998), 524 U.S. 308, 316, 118 S.Ct. 2007, 2012, 141 L.Ed.2d 303 (applying 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 to state convictions and citing other similar federal cases), we do not agree that federal prohibitions contingent on a state conviction or any other predicate offense requires reading those statutes together in the context of accepting guilty pleas. In fact, <em>Batchelder </em>explicitly dealt with the notice given by two <em>federal </em>statutes when read together, and held that the plain language of <em>each </em>is considered on its own:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\">The provisions in issue here, however, unambiguously specify the activity proscribed and the penalties available upon conviction.... That this particular conduct may violate both Titles does not detract from the notice afforded by each. Although the statutes create uncertainty as to which crime may be charged and therefore what penalties may be imposed, they do so to no greater extent than would a single statute authorizing various alternative punishments. So long as overlapping criminal provisions clearly define the conduct prohibited and the punishment authorized, the notice requirements of the Due Process Clause are satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay\"><em>Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. at 123, 99 S.Ct. at 2204, 60 L.Ed.2d 755. <em>Batchelder </em>also found the rule of lenity, requiring ambiguous statutes to be interpreted in favor of a defendant, unavailing because the rule does not overcome unambiguous statutory readings. <em>See State v. Turner </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 39, 49-50, 864 P.2d 235, 241 (\u00a7 45-1-102(2), MCA, provides that penal statutes are not strictly construed, leniency only applies when statutes create an ambiguity). In this case, the state and federal statutes each unambiguously specify the punishment that may be brought by each entity. Therefore, we hold that Liefert\u2019s due process rights of fair warning were not violated. We note in making this holding, that neither Liefert nor the dissent cite any authority in support of the \u201cnegative implication\u201d argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b627 In making the \u201cnegative implication\u201d argument, Liefert attempts to distinguish <em>Reynolds </em>by noting that the state statute on partner assault specifically mentions that a judge has the discretion to limit gun possession, while the statute regarding issuing bad checks does not. However, as Liefert himself concedes, this distinction is meaningless in light of the fact that trial courts can generally limit gun possession for any crime under \u00a7 46-18-202(1)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\u00b628 As to Liefert\u2019s argument that Montana courts must inform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>defendants of federal restrictions on gun possession because \u00a7 46-12-210(f), MCA, requires these courts to notify defendants of the federal consequences of deportation, we note that currently under .federal law, federal courts are <em>not </em>required to inform defendants regarding deportation. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c). To the contrary, federal circuit courts generally hold that the consequences of deportation are collateral. <em>United States v. Gonzalez </em>(1st Cir. 2000), 202 F.3d 20, 28. This indicates that Montana\u2019s requirement under \u00a7 46-12-210(1), MCA, is a purely statutory requirement. Consequently, if Montana\u2019s courts are to inform defendants of other collateral consequences of a state guilty plea, such as the possibility of federal gun restrictions, such a requirement is properly left to the Legislature as a policy decision.</p>\n<p id=\"AmK4_\">\u00b629 Finally, we briefly note that Liefert cites no authority for his equitable argument that trial courts should inform defendants of the federal restrictions because possessing a gun is more important in this state than it would be in other states. We decline to establish a precedent based on no legal authority whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b630 Further, we will not consider his equitable argument that he pled guilty because he could not afford bail and he needed to get out of jail in order to timely harvest his wheat. We have held that a plea is not involuntary simply because it was entered to avoid the possibility of a greater punishment at trial. <em>State v. Milinovich </em>(1994), 269 Mont. 68, 71, 887 P.2d 214, 216 (citing <em>Brady v. United States </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 742, 751, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 1470, 25 L.Ed.2d 747). Likewise, a plea is not involuntary simply because a defendant views its punishment as lesser than his immediate personal consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u00b631 The District Court did not err in denying Liefert\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b53-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b44-13\"> There is no appeal to a District Court from a denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea in Justice Court. <em>State v.

Here, as in <em>Feight, </em>Liefert simply filed a notice of appeal with the District Court challenging the Justice Court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw the guilty plea. This was the identical mechanism for appeal employed by the defendants in <em>Feight </em>to challenge the validity of their guilty pleas. Yet the Court in <em>Feight </em>curiously chose not to pursue the \u201cpostconviction relief\u2019 jurisdictional analysis. The logic in treating these indistinct appeals altogether differently eludes me.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u00b633 Although Liefert did not file a petition for postconviction relief, in my view the Court deems his appeal as such simply to rectify the jurisdictional quandary created by <em>Feight. </em>The Court\u2019s effort to craft such a subjective solution to the <em>Feight </em>dilemma necessarily results in arbitrary and unfair treatment of the litigants who appear before us. Rather than construing Liefert\u2019s notice of appeal as a petition for postconviction relief, I would simply treat it as a notice of appeal and hold that the District Court had jurisdiction to consider the appeal pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 3-5-303 and 46-20-104, MECA, as outlined in my dissent in <em>Feight.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b54-4\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"ATs\">specially concurs,</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b634 I concur with Justice Regnier. As long as <em>Feight </em>is the law of the land for those who seek to appeal from a justice court\u2019s order denying a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, it should be consistently and unfailingly applied to everyone who attempts to appeal from such an order. If on the other hand, we have so little confidence in its correctness that we must devise methods to avoid its consequences, as we do here, then we should say so. I would re-examine our holding in <em>Feight, </em>and correct the error we made in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u00b635 In Justice Regnier\u2019s dissent in <em>Feight, </em>in which Justice Trieweiler and I joined, Justice Regnier concluded that the general right to appeal found in \u00a7 46-20-104, MCA, and \u00a7 3-5-303, MCA, should have controlled the disposition of that case, in light of the fact that none of the statutes limiting appeals from the justice court to the district court applied to the situation before the Court. <em>Feight, </em>\u00b6 34 (Regnier, J., dissenting). Justice Regnier argued that the inquiry is not, as the majority in <em>Feight </em>concluded, whether any specific statute authorizes an appeal. Rather, the inquiry should be whether any statute precludes such an appeal. I agree. There is additional statutory authority for this proposition, cited by Leifert, that was not addressed by either the majority or the dissent in <em>Feight.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\u00b636 Leifert argued that, absent any specific statute precluding an appeal from an order denying a motion to withdraw a guilty plea in justice court (and we agreed in <em>Feight </em>that there was none), he was entitled to the benefit of \u00a7 46-1-103(1), MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">This title governs the practice and procedure in all criminal proceedings in the courts of Montana except where provision for a different procedure is specifically provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">The meaning of this language is clear. The rights afforded under Title 46 apply in all criminal proceedings, except where a specific provision provides a countervailing procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">\u00b637 In <em>Feight, </em>we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-11\">Accordingly, \u00a7\u00a7 3-5-303, 46-17-203, 46-17-311 and 46-12-204, MCA, being the specific legislative scheme defining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>jurisdiction of district courts to hear appeals from justice courts, these statutes control over \u00a7 46-20-104, MCA, which only generally defines the scope of criminal appeals by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au\"><em>Feight, </em>\u00b6 21. Significantly, none of these listed statutes specifically strips from a justice court defendant the right to appeal from a denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea. This being so, then the general right of appeal found at \u00a7 46-20-104, MCA, is not displaced or superseded, and cannot, if \u00a7 46-1-103, MCA, is to be given its clear meaning, be abrogated by the type of statutory construction in which the majority engaged in <em>Feight.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ag-I\">\u00b638 Contrary to our holding in <em>Feight, </em>the fact that \u00a7 46-20-104, MCA, is a general criminal statute does not mean it is displaced by specific justice court statutes. In <em>State v. Tweedy </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 313, 922 P.2d 1134, we were confronted with the question of whether the provisions of \u00a7 46-18-116, MCA (dealing with the requirement of a signed judgment), should apply to proceedings in justice court, which were prescribed by the provisions of Chapter 17 of Title 46. Citing \u00a7 46-1-103(1), MCA, as our authority, we concluded that unless a different procedure for justice court was specifically outlined, the requisites of other chapters of Title 46 should be applied to criminal proceedings in justice court. <em>Tweedy, </em>277 Mont. at 317, 922 P.2d at 1136. The same result is compelled here.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u00b639 When the majority faulted Feight for his inability to point to any statutory authority for a right to appeal to the District Court from a denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea <em>(Feight, </em>\u00b6 17, emphasis mine), the majority imposed upon Feight a burden that was not his, or that of any other defendant in a similar situation, to carry. Simply put, the right of appeal from a final order exists unless abrogated by specific statute. No such statute being found, it was error for this Court to judicially eliminate Feight\u2019s statutory right under \u00a7 46-20-104(1), MCA, to appeal from a final order affecting his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u00b640 Finally, we also held in <em>Tweedy </em>that a party cannot consent to subject matter jurisdiction that is lacking, or waive a want of jurisdiction. <em>Tweedy, </em>277 Mont. at 315, 922 P.2d at 1135. Yet, this is what occurred here when-contrary to our holding in <em>Feight </em>\u2014 we accepted jurisdiction pursuant to the State\u2019s creative (and, I submit erroneous) interpretation of our postconviction statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u00b641 As Justice Regnier urges, I would accept Leifert\u2019s notice of appeal for just what it is, and would hold the District Court had jurisdiction to consider it. In the process, I would overrule <em>Feight.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b55-8\">JUSTICE REGNIER, concurs in the foregoing special concurrence,</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b55-9\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"A9\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u00b642 I dissent. There is merit to Liefert\u2019s \u201cnegative implication\u201d argument. We engage in the legal fiction that citizens such as Liefert are aware of the law, both at the federal and state level. However, in the context of this case, awareness of the state and federal law, at best, results in a state of confusion. Liefert appeared before a state court judge to be sentenced for the offense of partner assault. Section 45-5-206, MCA. The Montana statute setting forth the possible punishment for partner assault specifically provides that the court \u201cmay\u201d prohibit an offender from possession or use of the firearm used in the assault. Section 45-5-206(7), MCA. Thus, the imposition of a firearm restriction appears to be discretionary with the state court judge. Here, the state court judge exercised his discretion and chose not to impose a firearm restriction. By negative implication, Liefert was free to possess a firearm. We assume however, as we must, that Liefert is also aware of the federal law, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(9), which makes a firearm restriction mandatory upon a state court conviction for domestic abuse. Must we assume, however, that Liefert is aware that, if there is a conflict between federal and state law, the federal law controls and that, despite the wording of the state statute, the state court judge has no discretion in the matter? If we are to assume that Liefert is aware of these jurisprudential nuances, should not Liefert, in turn, be able to assume that the sentencing judge, who is certainly more schooled than Liefert in these matters, would advise and warn Liefert that, regardless of what the state court does or does not do with regard to firearm restriction, the federal law controls?</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u00b643 Liefert has a due process right to fair warning of conduct which would be considered criminal. Art. II, Sec. 17, Mont. Const.; \u00a7 45-1-102(1)(c), MCA. Montana law specifically states that the common law rule that penal statutes are to be strictly construed has no application to the Montana criminal law code. Section 45-1-102(2), MCA. The Court acknowledges that ambiguous statutes are to be interpreted in favor of a defendant. However, the Court concludes that this rule does not pertain here since the statutes at issue each unambiguously specify the punishment that may be brought by each entity. While that may be true if you look at each statute in a vacuum, the fact is that the federal sanction is contingent upon the state conviction and, thus, the two statutes must be read in conjunction with one another. When they are read together, to say there is an ambiguity is an understatement.</p>\n<p id=\"A4k\">\u00b644 In my view, even if we assume Liefert was aware of state and federal law, we have merely attributed to him a state of confusion. The federal sanction is triggered by a conviction under state law. The state law, in turn, purports to give the state judge some discretion to impose firearm restrictions. It is one thing to assume that Liefert is aware of the federal and state law. It is quite another to assume that he has the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>legal acumen to discern that the state judge, before whom he appeared for sentencing, despite the clear implication of the state statutory scheme, actually had no say in the matter of firearm restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\u00b645 I conclude that Liefert was denied his due process right to fair warning.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
