We reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">\u00b62 Appellant presents the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in concluding that sufficient evidence was presented to terminate Appellant\u2019s parental rights without a treatment plan pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(4)(b), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b73-13\">\u00b64 C.R.O. was born on October 18,2000, to Ross and A.O., father and mother respectively. The District Court terminated the parental rights of Ross and A.O. on August 1, 2001. A.O. does not appeal the termination of her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-14\">\u00b65 Due to its previous involvement with Ross and A.O., the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services, Division of Child and Family Services (Department), petitioned for Temporary Legal Custody and Protective Services on the day of C.R.O.\u2019s birth, and the District Court granted the petition that same day. C.R.O. was placed in foster care upon discharge from the hospital. The District Court held a hearing on the petition on November 8, 2000, adjudicated C.R.O. a youth in need of care, and granted temporary legal custody to the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-15\">\u00b66 At the request of the Department, psychological examinations of Ross were conducted by Dr. Ned Tranel and Dr. Robert N. Page. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>March 22, 2001, the Department petitioned for termination of Ross\u2019 parental rights without implementation of a treatment plan, pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(4)(b), MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-4\">Criteria for Termination. (4) A treatment plan is not required under this part upon a finding by the court following hearing if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">(b) two medical doctors or clinical psychologists submit testimony that the parent cannot assume the role of parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\u00b67 This statute authorizes the district court to terminate the parental rights of an individual without establishing a court-approved treatment plan if two medical doctors or clinical psychologists testify that the individual cannot assume the role of parent. Pursuant to this provision, the Department asserted, based upon the two psychological evaluations, that Ross was unable to parent a child and that his condition was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. After the termination hearing on May 16, 2001, the District Court entered its order on August 1, 2001, terminating Ross\u2019 parental rights to C.R.O.</p>\n<p id=\"AJP\">\u00b68  In <em>In re Baby Boy Scott </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 253, 255, 767 P.2d 298, 299-300, this Court addressed the termination of parental rights without a treatment plan under the statutory scheme then in effect. The Court there grafted the additional requirement that termination of parental rights without the benefit of a treatment plan required that the doctors \u201cmust also testify that the ... condition of the parent is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d <em>In re Baby Boy Scott, </em>253 Mont. at 255, 767 P.2d at 299-300. We continue to acknowledge that this is an appropriate requirement under the current statute. If the Department is to bypass an attempt to rehabilitate the parent and reunite parent and child, it must demonstrate that the parent\u2019s inability to assume the role of parent cannot be remedied within a reasonable time. Section 41-3-609(1)(f)(ii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">\u00b69 Ross contends that the District Court erred in determining that the statutory criteria for termination of his parental rights under \u00a7 41-3-609(4)(b), MCA, were established by clear and convincing evidence. Ross does not challenge the testimony of Dr. Tranel as conclusive that Ross could not assume the role of parent, but argues that the testimony of Dr. Page is not in agreement with the testimony of Dr. Tranel. Ross argues that the combined testimony of the two psychologists does not support the District Court\u2019s conclusion that clear and convincing evidence existed to waive the treatment plan pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(4)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">\u00b610  In reviewing a decision to terminate parental rights, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Court determines whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact supporting termination are clearly erroneous and whether the district court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. <em>In re A.C., </em>2001 MT 126, \u00b6 20, 305 Mont. 404, \u00b6 20, 27 P.3d 960, \u00b6 20 (citation omitted). A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence; if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence; or if, after reviewing the record, this Court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. <em>In re J.N., </em>1999 MT 64, \u00b6 11, 293 Mont. 524, \u00b6 11, 977 P.2d 317, \u00b611 (citations omitted). It is well-established that a natural parent\u2019s right to care and custody of his or her child is a fundamental liberty interest which must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures. <em>In re A.C., </em>\u00b6 20. Accordingly, in regard to the statutorily-required findings supporting termination of parental rights, we have stated that the burden is on the party seeking termination to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that every requirement set forth in the statute has been satisfied. <em>In re A.C., </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\u00b6 11 Dr. Tranel based his testimony upon review of voluminous records generated from the time Ross was a young child, himself adjudicated a youth in need of care, and from an independent psychological evaluation. Dr. Tranel testified that Ross had been given more psychiatric labels than anybody he has ever seen, including ADHD, a major depressive disorder, learning disability, paraphilia, oppositional defiant disorder, gender identity disorder and sexual addiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">\u00b612 After his independent evaluation, Dr. Tranel concluded that his findings were consistent with the previous psychological test data. Dr. Tranel testified he was particularly concerned with Ross\u2019 antisocial personality disorder, which \u201csuggests that he could become aggressive and harmful to a non-retaliatory capable victim.\u201d He concluded that it would not be in C.R.O.\u2019s best interest if Ross were to be the custodial parent. Ultimately, when asked how much time he thought it would take with intensive support therapy for Ross to have the ability to successfully parent a young child, Dr. Tranel responded, \u201c[y]ears, perhaps decades would be more accurate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u00b613 Ross contends that the conclusions of Dr. Page do not agree with Dr. Tranel\u2019s conclusions. He argues that, contrary to the requirements of the termination statute, Dr. Page believed that Ross should have been given the opportunity to acquire parenting skills and become a productive parent with the help of an intensive and supervised treatment plan and further believed that it was possible for Ross to complete the treatment plan within fifteen months. Ross points to Dr. Page\u2019s following testimony upon cross-examination to support his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-4\">Q: Dr. Page, you\u2019re not saying that my client can not learn, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">A: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">Q: In fact you stated I believe, in your report that he\u2019s in the average range of intelligent functioning, intellectual functioning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcM\">A: That would be based on reviewing Dr. Tranel\u2019s results that indicated he was in the average range, intellectually.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">Q: So that means he can process information, learn new skills, and apply those skills when it comes to parenting a child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">A: Cognitively, you know Dr. Tranel can get more specific on scale score, the meaning of the breakdown on the scale scores. But basically with the full scale IQ in the average range it doesn\u2019t suggest any deficits necessary in his ability to obtain the knowledge and skills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-9\">Q: And I believe Dr. Tranel didn\u2019t find any specific learning disabilities, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-10\">A: I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-11\">Q: Okay. So Ross would be able to process new information, learn and acquire new parenting skills and abilities when it comes to parenting a child?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-12\">A: Theoretically. I don\u2019t know that there are any specific other neurological problems Dr. Tranel might be able to identify. Theoretically, there should be nothing, nothing stands out that would stop him from being able to learn, to acquire knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai-\">Q: And is it your opinion that he would benefit from a treatment program?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-13\">A: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-14\">Q: At this time. Do you believe that-that your report concluded that given the opportunity with strict supervision and an on-going treatment plan which may provide continuous monitoring by trained professionals that at some point in time Ross may assume a parenting role?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-15\">A: Theoretically, it\u2019s possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-16\">Q: In any event, would you agree with me Dr. Page that Ross should be given the opportunity to acquire parenting skills and become a productive parent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-17\">A: If he hasn\u2019t already been given the opportunity to be trained and acquire the knowledge, but I think that with the caveat that his history of acts of deviance as well as marijuana use, etcetera, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>of long standing nature leave him at [sic] a vulnerable person to maintain presence in such a treatment plan and there\u2019s a question as to how much that-It would have to be monitored and measured from the standpoint of progress being made, very closely, in my opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">\u00b614 Ross additionally points to the following cross-examination of Dr. Page by C.R.O.\u2019s guardian ad litem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">Q: Mr. DiRe had asked you questions about can he parent or can he learn what he needs to learn to parent, and you indicated that it\u2019s possible at some time he can be taught that. There\u2019s a presumption in Montana that fifteen (15) months out of home placement that termination is in the child\u2019s best interest. Could he learn anything substantial in fifteen months?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">A: Ah, yes, theoretically. There\u2019s not a deficient intellectual capacity with [sic] which would prohibit him from being able to absorb and retain knowledge, that I know of. There are some vulnerabilities and some high risks against suggesting, difficulty in obtaining such necessary knowledge and lowered impulse; increased impulse control, etcetera, etcetera. Particularly surrounding the risks that I\u2019ve identified in my report in fifteen months. It\u2019s possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">Q: So is it fair to say that he has the intellectual ability to learn how to parent but given his background and his diagnosis, he may not be able to accomplish that in a reasonable time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">A: He has significant vulnerabilities. I should say liabilities that he brings into such a treatment plan that would have to be addressed specifically.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">Q: Could he learn that within a reasonable time given his own history and his own background in spite of his cognitive abilities to assess parenting techniques?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">A: It would be very difficult. I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s impossible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AR\">\u00b615 According to Ross, the treatment plan was improperly waived in this case as the foregoing testimony of Dr. Page falls short of, and negates, any reasonable conclusion that clear and convincing evidence exists that he cannot assume the role of a parent within a reasonable time with the help of a treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">\u00b616 The Department counters that the above testimony, taken out of context, does not fairly characterize the conclusions of Dr. Page. The Department argues that the District Court relied on Dr. Page\u2019s concurrence with Dr. Tranel that Ross was multi-handicapped and unable to provide a minimal standard of parenting for a young child at this time. The Department also argues that to terminate parental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>rights pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(4)(b), MCA, the district court need not find that a parent is unable to learn and never able to parent in the foreseeable future, rather, only that the parent is unable to assume the role of parent at this time and unable to do so within a reasonable time. The Department contends that, while Dr. Page did not rule out the possibility that Ross could ever assume a parenting role, he clearly testified that Ross could not do so within a reasonable amount of time. We disagree with the Department\u2019s assessment of Dr. Page\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\u00b617 Upon review of the full testimony of Dr. Page, this Court is at a loss to discover testimony directly supporting a conclusion by Dr. Page that Ross could not assume the role of parent within a reasonable time. When asked on direct examination how long it would take for Ross, in the ideal program, before he could successfully parent a young child, he responded that, while it would not likely be within the next year, it is \u201cawfully hard to nail down a particular time frame because it\u2019s dependent on so many variables .... I don\u2019t know how long that would take for Ross.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b618 Dr. Page gave no stronger conclusion on cross-examination or upon examination by the guardian ad litem. Rather, when asked whether Ross could learn anything substantial within fifteen months and assume a parenting role, he responded that, although it would be difficult, it was theoretically possible. Dr. Page testified that Ross is of average intellectual functioning and theoretically can process new information, learn and acquire new parenting skills and abilities. Dr. Page opined that Ross could theoretically assume the role of parent if given the opportunity to participate in an ongoing treatment plan with strict supervision and continuous monitoring by trained professionals.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar\">\u00b619 The Department argues that the District Court also relied on Dr. Page\u2019s concurrence with Gwen Farnsworth, Ross\u2019 former social worker and outpatient adolescent sex offender therapist. The Department refers to the November 29,2000, letter from Gwen to the Department wherein she opined that \u201cunder no circumstances do I believe he should be in the position to control the destiny of a child.\u201d When asked whether he agreed with Gwen\u2019s statement that under no circumstances should Ross be in the position to control the destiny of a child, Dr. Page again specifically stated that, <em>\u201c[a]t this point in time, </em>the statement about \u2018should not be in the position to control the destiny of a child\u2019 would be accurate\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\u00b620  To terminate a parent\u2019s rights pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(4)(b), MCA, it is insufficient that both psychologists agree merely that a parent is currently unable to assume the role of parent. Both must also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>agree that the condition making a parent unable to assume the role of parent be unlikely to change within a reasonable time. <em>In re Baby Boy Scott, </em>253 Mont. at 255, 767 P.2d at 299-300; \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(f)(ii), MCA. The record contains substantial evidence that Dr. Page, Dr. Tranel and Gwen Farnsworth agree that Ross is currently unable to assume the role of parent. However, the record is bereft of testimony by Dr. Page that the condition making Ross currently unable to parent is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">\u00b621 Rather, the District Court extrapolated the conclusion that Ross\u2019 condition was unlikely to change within a reasonable time from Dr. Page\u2019s testimony that despite years of counseling and therapy, Ross has not been able to achieve mastery of the tools he needs to manage his own life. The District Court concluded that, as Dr. Page did not provide the Court with a \u201creasonable timeframe\u201d in which Ross may \u201ctheoretically\u201d be able to manage the life of a child, and based upon Ross\u2019 longstanding history, his condition is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">\u00b622 The requirements of \u00a7 41-3-609(4)(b), MCA, are not satisfied simply because a parent has had a long and troubled psychological past, nor because a clinical psychologist does not provide the district court with a reasonable time frame for successful rehabilitation. It is essential that the testimony of two clinical psychologists clearly and convincingly establish that the condition of the parent is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. The testimony of Dr. Page does not clearly and convincingly support this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u00b623 The dissents offer arguments which tug at the heart, but miss the law. Justice Cotter acknowledges that Dr. Page did not offer testimony in accordance with statutory terms, but nonetheless asserts that the Court should deem the statute satisfied from the \u201ctheme\u201d and \u201ctone\u201d of his testimony. Justice Nelson argues that the Court has blindly elevated form over substance, ignoring both the purpose of the statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and C.R.O.\u2019s constitutional rights. While he stops short of advocating that this Court do away with the controlling provision, \u00a7 41-3-609(4)(b), MCA, he clearly implies that the Court should ignore the requirements of that statute in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\u00b624 The Court does not have the option of choosing to ignore the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>wording of a statute, even when those words mandate a result deemed undesirable. Nor can we, by a \u201cbetween-the-lines\u201d assessment of a witness\u2019s tone and theme, create testimony that does not exist in the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">\u00b625 The dissents suggest that if this Court would only view substance over \u201cform\u201d (the requirements of the statute), that Ross\u2019s long and troubled past, in conjunction with his extensive psychological labels, demonstrates that the current condition that renders Ross unable to assume the role of parent is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. However, the statute specifically requires two doctors or psychologists to testify to that conclusion. Undisputably, Dr. Page did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\u00b626 The record, viewed as a whole, may reveal a history of extensive counseling and a \u201cfailure [of Ross] to achieve the tools\u201d to manage his own life, but this Court is constrained first to determine whether substantial evidence exists to support the statutory requirements. <em>In re J.N., </em>\u00b6 11 (citations omitted). Because the record does not support a finding that two psychologists agree that Ross\u2019 condition is unlikely to change within a reasonable time, the basic statutory requirements to terminate Ross\u2019 parental rights, without the benefit of a treatment plan, are not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u00b627  We hold that substantial evidence does not exist to support the District Court\u2019s finding that Dr. Page believed that the condition preventing Ross from assuming the role of parent is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. <em>In re Baby Boy Scott, </em>253 Mont. at 255, 767 P.2d at 299-300. The District Court\u2019s finding is therefore, clearly erroneous. <em>In re A.C., </em>\u00b6 20 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\u00b628 We reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b80-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\"> Jus tice Nelson asserts that, pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-602, MCA, a parent-child relationship maybe terminated if the relationship is not in the best interest of the child. That section is a purpose provision which actually states: \u201cThis part <em>provides procedures and criteria by which the parent-child legal relationship may be terminateaby a court </em>if the relationship is not in the best interest of the child.\u201d The proper criterion to be applied here is not best interest of the child, but that which is set forth in \u00a7 41-3-609(4), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b80-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AZ\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">\u00b629 I concur in the result the Court reaches in this case. I am not persuaded, however, that, in enacting \u00a7 41-3-609(4)(b), MCA, which permits the Department to terminate a parent\u2019s rights without a treatment plan upon the testimony of two medical doctors or clinical psychologists that the parent \u201ccannot assume the role of parent,\u201d the Legislature intended only the same \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d standard applicable to \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(f), MCA, cases where a treatment plan has been adopted, the parent has failed to complete-or to successfully complete-the treatment plan, and the trial court determines the conduct or condition of the parent rendering him or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>unfit is unlikely to change \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\u00b630 The Legislature did not state a time frame for application of the \u00a7 41-3-609(4)(b), MCA, exception to the treatment plan requirement. Clearly, it did not mean that the parent merely could not assume the role of parent \u201cat this very moment.\u201d Just as clearly, it did not mean that the two doctors or psychologists were required to testify that the parent could \u201cnever\u201d assume the role of parent. As a result, the Court necessarily falls back on the \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d standard. This time frame seems inappropriately short to me in this type of case where no treatment plan is offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\u00b631 We have held repeatedly that a parent has a fundamental liberty interest in parenting his or her child. <em>See, e.g., In re </em>J.N., 1999 MT 64, \u00b6 12, 293 Mont. 524, \u00b6 12, 977 P.2d 317, \u00b6 12 (citations omitted). That constitutional right must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures. <em>In re J.N., </em>\u00b6 12. In addition, Montana\u2019s policies with regard to abused and neglected children, while making the health and safety of the children the paramount concern, also require the Department to \u201cpreserve the unity and welfare of the family whenever possible.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-3-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u00b632 The Department ordinarily, and properly, makes serious efforts to meet this latter requirement by means of permitting a parent to complete a treatment plan and, often, a series of treatment plans. Under that approach, the Department proceeds with a petition to terminate parental rights only when it believes-and can prove to a court-that the parent has not completed the treatment plan or the completed treatment plan has not been successful, <em>and </em>the reason therefore is \u201cunlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA. In other words, the parent is afforded an opportunity to establish his or her ability to successfully parent the child, and only when that ability has not been established over a period of time <em>and </em>is unlikely to be established within a reasonable time still to come, can the Department succeed in terminating the parent\u2019s fundamental constitutional right to parent his or her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">\u00b633 It seems to me that applying the same \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d standard to the <em>exception </em>to the treatment plan requirement set forth in \u00a7 41-3-609(4)(b), MCA, as is applied when a parent has not completed or has not successfully completed a treatment plan <em>and </em>the condition rendering the parent unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time does not adequately protect the parent\u2019s constitutional rights. It also allows the Department to avoid making any effort whatsoever to achieve the state\u2019s policy of preserving the unity and welfare of the family whenever possible.</p>\n<p id=\"AmV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>\u00b634 Under the \u201creasonable time\u201d standard applied to the \u00a7 41-3-609(4)(b), MCA, exception to the treatment plan requirement, the following scenario could occur: the Department could remove a child from its parents at birth; petition on the same day for temporary legal custody and protective services based on \u201cprevious involvement\u201d with one or both of the parents; obtain an adjudication that the child is a youth in need of care and temporary legal custody of the child within approximately 120 days <em>(see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 41-3-432, 41-3-437, and 41-3-438, MCA); immediately file a petition to terminate parental rights; seek and obtain an immediate hearing after finding two doctors or psychologists to testify that the parent cannot assume the role of a parent within a reasonable time; and have the parent\u2019s rights terminated. Conceivably this process could be completed within 5 to 6 months of the child\u2019s birth, and without the parent having any opportunity whatsoever to establish the ability to parent and to obtain the Department\u2019s help through the provision of appropriate services to achieve that goal. Indeed, in the present case, C.R.O.\u2019s father\u2019s rights were terminated less than 10 months after the child\u2019s birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b635 I am not unmindful of the importance of protecting Montana\u2019s children. Nor, obviously, is the Montana Legislature. I also am not unmindful of the fact that children, as well as parents, have constitutional rights. I simply am not convinced that the Legislature intended such a \u201crush to judgment\u201d as can occur through the Court\u2019s addition-for lack of any other available time frame-of the \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d standard to the exception contained in \u00a7 41-3-609(4)(b), MCA, which differs significantly from the other exceptions set forth in \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA. Therefore, I encourage the Legislature to revisit the \u00a7 41-3-609(4)(b), MCA, exception in light of the Court\u2019s interpretation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u00b636 All that being said, I agree totally with the result reached by the Court here.</p>\n<judges id=\"b82-6\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER joins in the foregoing specially concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b82-7\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"Ax\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">\u00b637 As the Court points out in \u00b6 8 of its Opinion, where termination of parental rights is accomplished without the benefit of a treatment plan, it can be done only if the doctors who are testifying conclude that the \u201ccondition of the parent is <em>unlikely </em>to change within a reasonable time\u201d (emphasis added). While Dr. Page was unfortunately not asked this question in the statutory terms, and therefore did not testify specifically that Ross\u2019s condition was \u201cunlikely to change within a reasonable time,\u201d this was the clear import of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>\u00b638 The excerpts of testimony set forth by the Court in its Opinion demonstrate that Dr. Page, upon cross examination, would do no more than agree that it was \u201ctheoretically possible\u201d that Ross would someday be able to assume a parenting role. Obviously, just about everything is theoretically possible. However, the balance of Dr. Page\u2019s testimony cannot be fairly interpreted to suggest that such an outcome was <em>likely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b639 To the contrary, Dr. Page recited Ross\u2019s long history of acts of deviance, drug use, aggression, and other handicaps. On top of this, there was ample evidence that C.R.O. suffered from significant developmental disabilities, which would only further hamper the prospects of Ross\u2019s ability to parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u00b640 When Dr. Page\u2019s entire testimony, rather than the carefully chosen excerpts relied upon by the majority, is considered, a theme of caution and conservatism is apparent. While he apparently was unwilling to say in Ross\u2019s presence that Ross would <em>never </em>be able to overcome his difficulties or obtain adequate parenting skills, he made frequent references to the serious and long-term nature of Ross\u2019s multiple disabilities and the extreme difficulty of overcoming those disabilities. He explained that the three years of counseling Ross had already undergone was not abnormal treatment for a \u201ccase like this\u201d but that even after those three years, Ross continued to \u201cneed to learn to perceive the world in a less hostile place\u201d and that \u201c[t]he sexual deviant behaviors have been significant and [Dr. Page] did not perceive in [his] interview process that there was enough evidence that Ross has internalized the tools that he needs to run his own fife, yet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AH8\">\u00b641 Dr. Page testified that Ross retained many of the same deficits after three years of counseling that he had prior to counseling, and that it would be unlikely \u201cif [Ross] were in the ideal program\u201d that he could successfully work through his numerous issues within a year\u2019s time. He further explained that speculation as to \"... the potential for future behavior is typically historical accounts of the same behavior. That is repeated treatment, repeated events, repeated problems suggest the same in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u00b642 The tone of Dr. Page\u2019s entire testimony appears to be that of a doctor unwilling to tell a disabled young man that he will never overcome his difficulties, but the Doctor was also clearly unwilling to say that his condition was likely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"AD\">\u00b643 A mere theoretical possibility, which is all Dr. Page would concede upon cross examination, and upon which the Court relies in reversing the District Court, is simply not sufficient, in my judgment, to override the otherwise clear and convincing tenor of Dr. Page\u2019s testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>which was that Ross had shown no significant improvement despite three years of counseling, that he was not able to parent, and that his condition was unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\u00b644 This Court should not substitute its judgment for that of the District Court in making a finding based to a large extent on credibility and weight of the evidence. <em>In re T.A.G., </em>2002 MT 4, \u00b6 7, [308 Mont. 89, \u00b67] 39 P.3d 686, \u00b67. I would therefore conclude that substantial evidence did exist to support the District Court\u2019s finding, and I would affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b84-5\">JUSTICES NELSON and LEAPHART join in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b84-6\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"Ao\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\u00b645 I concur with and join in Justice Cotter\u2019s dissent and make the following additional observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">\u00b646 In its rush to exalt the form of Dr. Page\u2019s answers over the substance of his testimony, the majority completely loses sight of the primary purpose of parental rights termination proceedings under Title 41, Chapter 3, part 6-to further and protect the best interests of the child. Section 41-3-602, MCA (parent-child relationship may be terminated if the relationship is not in the best interest of the child).</p>\n<p id=\"Ap\">\u00b647 Furthermore, the Court\u2019s decision trammels the inalienable constitutional rights of C.R.O. to pursue life\u2019s basic necessities, to enjoy a safe, healthy and happy life (Art. II, Sec. 3, Mont.Const.) and to basic human dignity (Art. II, Sec. 4, Mont.Const.). <em>See also </em>\u00a7 41-3-101(1)(f), MCA (\u201cIt is the policy of the state of Montana to: (f) recognize that a child is entitled to assert the child\u2019s constitutional rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">\u00b648 In my view, these guarantees under Montana\u2019s Constitution entitle C.R.O. to the opportunity for a permanent, stable and loving family relationship. Indeed, this was the theme of Justice Leaphart\u2019s dissent in <em>Girard v. Williams, </em>1998 MT 231, 291 Mont. 49, 966 P.2d 1155, wherein he observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\">The United States Supreme Court has recognized that the \u201cfamilial relationship\u201d is more than a mere biological tie:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-12\">[T]he importance of the familial relationship, to the individuals involved and to the society, stems from the emotional attachments that derive from the intimacy of daily association, and from the role it plays in \u201cpromoting] a way of life\u201d through the instruction of children ... as well as from the fact of blood relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-13\"><em>Girard, </em>\u00b6 66 (citing <em>Lehr v. Robertson </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 248, 261, 103 S.Ct. 2985, 2993, 77 L.Ed.2d 614, 626 (alteration in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-14\">\u00b649 On the record here, it defies logic and common sense that C.R.O.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>best interests, fundamental constitutional rights, and right to a permanent, stable and loving family relationship will be served by making her the guinea pig of a court-ordered treatment plan for her biological father-a person who has a track record of failure as a parent and who has ADHD, major depressive disorder, learning disability, paraphilia, oppositional defiant disorder, gender identity disorder, sexual addiction, and antisocial personality disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00b650 The majority maintains that the dissents \u201ctug at the heart, but miss the law.\u201d Baloney! The majority opinion ignores the law-and the \u201cplain wording of [the] statute\u201d by the simple expedient of putting its own spin on the evidentiary record to defeat what the law requires-that the parent/child relationship should be terminated when two medical doctors or clinical psychologists testify that the parent cannot assume the role of a parent-\u00a7 41-3-609(4)(b), MCA-and when the child\u2019s best interest would be served thereby-\u00a7 41-3-602, MCA. Those statutory criteria were met in spades in this case. No \u201cbetween-the-lines\u201d assessment is necessary. The fact that the majority have determined otherwise is simply a substitution of this Court\u2019s judgment for that of the trial court who actually heard the testimony and judged the credibility of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u00b651 More to the point, what benefit is to be gained for C.R.O. by trying to teach a person to parent where that person has absolutely no substantive relationship with his child; where that person, in the words of Dr. Tranel, has been given more psychiatric labels than anybody he has ever seen; and where that person has only a \u201ctheoretical possibility\u201d of becoming a parent? The answer is obvious. There is none-unless finally being able to put a young child into the hands of a sexual deviant is considered a benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\u00b652 Worse, all the while the government tries to teach Ross to parent via a treatment plan, C.R.O. will be languishing in foster care. And, when one, two, or three years from now, the State and the courts again conclude what the record already aptly demonstrates-that Ross is unable to parent C.R.O. and that his condition is unlikely to change within a reasonable time-C.R.O. will have been deprived of her constitutional right to an opportunity for a loving, permanent and stable family relationship, apart from her biological father, during the most formative years of her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\u00b653 Once again a child\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights have been ground up in the machinery of a statutory scheme weighted overwhelmingly in favor of the biologically-based right to parent to the exclusion or marginalization of other relationships that will be more in the child\u2019s (as opposed to the natural parent\u2019s) best interest. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>Girard, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 78,79 (Nelson, J. concurring). Once again, by a blind, form-over-substance interpretation of the evidentiary record, a child has been deprived of her rights to pursue life\u2019s basic necessities, to enjoy a safe, healthy and happy life and to basic human dignity. Once again, the biological parent wins a court case and the child loses a shot at a decent life. How sad. Indeed, how tragic.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u00b654 I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b86-5\">JUSTICES COTTER and LEAPHART join in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
